argentina s name may mean made of silver but oftentimes its economy does not seem as strong as the name might suggest with yearly inflation reaching almost 60 percent and the country mired in debt policymakers are grasping for a solution without much success meanwhile many argentines follow the us peso exchange rate religiously yet seem to have little control over its fluctuations foreign investors anxiously watching october s general elections flee from the peso every time the leftist candidate surges in the polls while the currency grows stronger when president mauricio macri s government gains support at this point argentina s economy is intertwined with non state actors beyond just foreign investors and the quandary the country s leadership faces is this how to balance their competing often diametrically opposed interests on one hand international financial institutions such as the world bank the international monetary fund and the organization for economic cooperation and development exert a significant amount of free market pressure over argentina s economic policy yet argentina s powerful trade unions also put pressure on the government from below to enact more socialist policies balancing these two interests will certainly be a tricky challenge yet whatever happens will ultimately depend on the election results above all argentina s economic status reminds the world that despite the proliferation of non state actors state actors still maintain key levels in enacting policies over their countries pressures from above international financial institutions politics complicates argentina s long and complicated financial history the fall of a military government in the 1980s left argentina with massive amounts of debt subsequently the government pegged the argentine peso to the us dollar which ended up reducing argentine exports and plunging the country into a deep recession in 2001 the country defaulted on its debts after the default a commodity boom brought the argentine economy back to its feet but the administrations of néstor and cristina fernandez de kirchner engaged in some dubious economic management printing money to pay for large budget deficits and instituting controls on american dollars leaving the country again argentina defaulted on its debts forcing the international monetary fund to lend argentina us 57 billion in order to save its faltering economy that bailout initiated major international involvement in argentine economic policy as part of the bailout the imf set numerous conditions on argentina s economic policy similar to the spanish and greek austerity packages in the eurozone crisis argentina has raised taxes reduced tax exemptions scaled back capital expenditures and frozen public hiring in order to transform its previous budget deficit into a surplus at the behest of the imf the organization also recently met with the two leading opposition candidates in october s elections discussing their economic plans behind closed doors and likely trying to convince them to continue following the imf s policy recommendations understandably many in argentina have not received these changes well reminded of past times times when spain made all of argentina s economic decisions to many the imf is a bogeyman in argentine circles the international monetary fund is the eye of sauron over argentina an international commentator wrote in forbes such comments underscore the influence such international organizations have on argentina s economy and economic performance with perhaps more influence than the ordinary argentine would want the world bank represents a second international financial institution that has at least some influence on argentina s economy however its mission to grant no interest loans to developing countries to help promote social progress and development is less controversial the bank recently approved a new loan to argentina to improve public sector efficiency and argentina s response to climate change something that both sides of the political divide have welcomed it has also supported sustainable development and social welfare policies in the past though loans that have helped make structural reforms to argentina s economy argentina formally joins the oecd s database system photo by cancillería argentina cc by 2 0 accessed via wikimedia commons finally the macri administration has moved for the country to join with a third international non state actor the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd widely considered a club of rich countries that work together to promote sound free market economic policies the process is long difficult and complex marcelo scaglione the undersecretary for oecd accession said at an event at the ministry of the treasury it s a process of finding out where we are and knowing both our strengths and our weaknesses nonetheless the argentinian government under macri remains committed to joining the organization as part of his crusade to improve the country s economy and clamp down on rampant inflation as such the oecd s review process statistics gathering and policy recommendations provide argentina a solid foundation to improve its economy at least from western perspectives of what constitutes a strong free market economy first the country passed a new competition law to break up existing cartels that dominated the industry exert increased oversight over mergers and acquisitions and strengthen its competition regulator second macri s administration has introduced several new decrees streamlining regulations and reducing bureaucratic red tape third congress passed legislation increasing the central bank s independence all three key measures came in response to oecd recommendations and directives that will help to streamline the accession process especially for a country such as argentina acceding to the oecd proves the cliché that life is more a journey than a destination once argentina finally does achieve membership in the oecd it stands to gain increases in foreign investment and outside investor confidence is key to shore up the struggling peso it will also gain reputational benefits which will allow it to repay its debts at lower interest rates a key plank in argentina s economic recovery however complete membership recognizes the idea that argentina has adopted the oecd s best practices and improved its economic institutions steps that argentina has already started taking as part of the accession process therefore the influence that the oecd has upon argentina s economy during this process is paramount in achieving these benefits the interplay between state actors and supranational non state actors also merits discussion as joining the oecd requires a potential member to secure the consent of all 36 member states already in the organization as such normal interstate politics comes into play and a nominally supranational organization is beholden to the interests of its individual member states in the case of accession the inverse is also true if argentina decides it no longer wants to join the oecd nothing legally requires it to continue making the changes necessary for accession or for that matter reversing previously made changes this becomes relevant in light of presidential elections in october pitting the pro business incumbent macri against peronist alberto fernandez and his running mate cristina fernandez de kirchner the country s divisive former president the fernandez fernandez ticket opposes argentina s membership in the oecd are you going to ask a shoe manufacturer to pay the costs of joining the oecd just because macri thought it was a good idea fernandez told mundo empresarial joining the oecd is absolutely worthless if fernandez and kirchner win office in october they will likely stop the accession process in all the degree to which oecd influences argentina as a state depends on how much the state wants the organization to influence it and the same is true for the other states currently in the accession process scaglione took pains to emphasize accession s cross party support though pointing out that several bills implementing the oecd s requested changes passed in argentina s chamber of deputies with near unanimous levels of support he also noted that the moderate parties that split from the kirchners while still opposing macri generally had not staked out a position on the issue at the time of writing which leaves open the opportunity for negotiations in case of a divided legislature after october s election still the extent to which the oecd as a non state actor still depends on argentinian domestic politics especially how willing the country is to enact reforms pressures from below trade unions another group of non state actors will certainly impact that calculus argentina s powerful unions or sindicatos in spanish the sindicatos often advocate for policies directly and diametrically opposed to international financial institutions and that divide sheds light on the interaction between domestic politics and broader questions of non state actors in an interview for the argentinian daily clarín world bank official jenko hentschel noted that the country has not passed necessary reforms promoted by his organization because of interest groups that defend their own interests of course the unions strongly oppose comprehensive labor reforms that macri has proposed fearing that they would further concentrate power in the hands of big business and away from workers they look at their piece of the pie and fight for their portion hentschel continued unions influence in argentina vastly exceeds their comparable influence in the united states and it appears that striking is a national pastime argentine pilots and air traffic controllers are among the highest paid in the world because they have the power to shut down the country s air transportation system during their frequent strikes and general strikes commonly shut down the country union leaders at a public debate on their role in argentina s economy photo by silvina frydlewsky cc by 2 0 accessed via flickr oftentimes unions act in direct contradiction to international financial institutions as hentschel noted before a general strike on may 29 2019 was framed in direct response to imf policies which union leaders said had directly resulted in increased poverty international union leader shane burrow called on macri s government to take action to support the real economy rather than limiting itself to following the mandates of the imf and the financial markets for instance an earlier strike exactly a month earlier again to protest imf forced austerity measures also paralyzed the country s economy unions do not have as much power as the international institutions to directly influence argentina s economy seeing as general strikes are more reactive instruments than proactive ones but they represent the powerful force of public opinion by shutting down large swaths of the country s economy they can push for more worker centric economic reforms and perhaps persuade legislators that their constituents do not support macri s reform centrist voters tired of strikes may vote for the fernandez fernandez ticket come october knowing that the unions will not strike against favorable policies even if they cannot bail argentina out of its economic rut they can still force major concessions at the negotiating table the state in control above all the influence of each of the non state actors in argentina s economy rests on various state decisions previous state decisions by a socialist governments managed the economy quite poorly which in turn caused macri s election in turn macri turned to international financial institutions for help another state decision that brought obligations imposed by non state actors as a result the state s actions still constrain non state actors even if non state actors constrain the state without previous state decisions argentina would not be at this point of course the state still has the power to withdraw from oecd accession ignore world bank mandates or refuse to deal with the imf many international mandates have few enforcement mechanisms leaving ultimate power in the state s hands indeed néstor kirchner turned his back on international institutions such as the imf and world bank kirchner defaulted on argentina s debts rather than accepting the fund s conditions and the fund subsequently agreed to roll over argentina s debt it showed the world that a country could defy the imf and live to tell about it and contributed to the ensuing loss of imf influence in latin america the guardian stated kirchner s state decision therefore had a key impact on a non state actor both in argentina and across the region argentina s complicated relationship with unions also rests upon earlier state decisions when juan peron took over the country in 1943 he built upon strong relationships with union leaders in what torcuato di tella calls mobilizational caudillismo during argentina s right wing military dictatorships the unions lost much of their power due to government regulations and oftentimes violent suppression even after the dictatorship ended the then newly elected alfonsín administration proposed the mucci bill which would have significantly limited union leaders power unions mobilized and re exerted the power they had lost to defeat the bill but the fall of the dictatorship created a more permissive political climate which enabled them to do so nonetheless the state itself showed it had the power to define its relationship with the unions photo by sander crombach unsplash unions political power fell again in the 1990s during a neoliberal political climate but under the kirchners unions have thrived because both néstor and cristina have formed alliances with unions passing legislation protecting unions right to strike as such unions role in politics has depended on the broader political climate as well as state decisions changes in the country s government have also produced changes in unions status despite this issue s focus on the increasing role of non state actors argentina makes the case that domestic politics and state decisions ultimately constrain or enable non state actors and the actions of non state actors can ultimately be traced back to nation states in the end the state has the final power to determine which set of non state actors will influence its policy the most and domestic politics as indicated by the october elections will determine which government will make those state decisions ultimately whoever wins those elections should not abandon institution led reforms but she or he also should not turn a blind eye to the unions either a middle ground might achieve some success labor reforms should give companies more latitude to hire and fire employees but should also expand the safety net and job training programs for the unemployed for example such a compromise could appeal to both unions and international regulators looking for a more stable argentine economy what the future holds then is uncertain and much depends on the winner of the upcoming presidential election will the status quo continue with the state aligning itself with international institutions or will argentina s next president change strategies and adopt union backed reforms voters and voters alone will decide which non state actor will influence state policy the most
for the ninth consecutive year mti consulting via its corporate finance practice in partnership with daily ft daily mirror and sunday times has concluded the mti ceo business outlook study rajika sangakkara sri lanka jason cordier new zealand saima mazhar bangladesh naush beg dubai darshana buragohain india collectively outlining the sri lankan business community s perception for the state of

companies will face in 2020 the results of the survey including its supplementary analysis will assist organisations in streamlining their strategic decision making for 2020 effectively enabling them to gear their operations in accordance with the economic sentiments of their peers nearly 3 4th of the surveyed chief executives were of the opinion that their businesses performed below expectations in 2019 in contrast only 5 of the surveyed ceos felt that their businesses performed above expectations indicating a similar trend as in 2018 during jan sep of 2019 the sri lankan economy recorded a subdued growth of 2 6 compared to the growth rate of 3 3 in the corresponding period of 2018 the imf expects the real gdp growth of sri lanka to rebound to 3 5 in 2020 driven by the recovery in the tourism sector according to the world bank the sri lankan economy grew at a rate of 2 7 in fy 18 19 ended june 2019 indicating sri lanka as one of the poorest performing countries in the south asian

in comparison to growth rates of 1 8 and 4 4 in the same period of 2018 growth in industrial activities was primarily driven by the recovery in construction and mining and quarrying activities during the period while the service sector was largely supported by the expansion in financial services wholesale and retail trade activities and other personal services activities during january october 2019 a marginal growth of 0 8 was recorded in exports attributing to the growth of industrial exports accounting for 80 of total exports which expanded by 2 3 compared to the same period in 2018 agriculture 4 4 mineral 6 3 and all other export segments 3 6 recorded negative growth rates during the same period leading to an overall trade deficit in the same period import expenditure during the first ten months of 2019 declined by 12 4 largely driven by lower imports of gold 99 5 personal vehicles 53 2 rice 90 1 fuel 5 6 and transport equipment 17 8 tourism earnings recorded a drop of 20 7 owing to the easter sunday attacks which led to a decline in tourist arrivals workers remittances improved yoy in october 2019 although a cumulative decline was recorded according to the central bank of sri lanka gross official reserves increased to 7 5 billion by nov 2019 mainly due to the receipt of the international sovereign bond isb proceeds purchase of foreign exchange by the cbsl from the domestic market and the receipt of the sixth tranche of the imf eff due to the challenges which arose from the slowdown in economic activities due to the easter sunday terror attacks and the delay in implementing certain revenue proposals announced in the 2019 budget the fiscal sector of sri lanka displayed a poor performance during the first seven months of 2019 government revenue as percentage of gdp declined to 6 7 in the first seven months of 2019 from 7 5 in the same period of the preceding year driven by the lower tax and non tax revenue collections the decline in tax revenue was mainly due to the underperformance of revenue collection from excise duties on motor vehicles and petroleum products and vat on domestic goods and services during the first seven months of 2019 total government expenditure as a percentage of gdp rose up to 11 1 in comparison to 10 7 in the corresponding period of 2018 supported by the increase in recurring expenditures government debt rose to rs 12 646 billion as at end july 2019 from rs 10 959 billion at end july 2018 warranted by the expansion in the budget deficit the central bank of sri lanka cbsl adopted a relaxed monetary policy by reducing the standing deposit facility rate sdfr and the standing lending facility rate slfr with a view of fuelling economic activity that was challenged by a high interest rate environment in 2018 as a result of subdued economic activity and high interest rates credit to the private sector decelerated to 4 4 by end november 2019 compared to a growth of 16 2 in the same period in 2018 with a view of stabilising inflation to mid single digit levels over the medium term the cbsl moved to a flexible inflation targeting fit regime in 2019 in order to sustain price stability and strengthen

declined to 9 3 in august 2019 from 14 6 registered at the end of 2018 driven by the lower credit growth due to the adverse business environment observed in the first eight months of 2019 yoy credit

registered businesses in the tourism industry which is valid till 31 march 2020 lonely planet and travel leisure magazine highlighted sri lanka as the number one destination in the world to visit in 2019 which likely contributed to the slow recovery in the tourism industry at the close of 2019 tea during the first half of 2019 tea production grew marginally by 0 2 as a result of the 1 2 decline in tea production witnessed in the first quarter of 2019 due to trade union action coupled with the 1 4 growth in tea production shown in the second quarter of the year supported by favourable weather

of 2 8 during the first half of 2019 in comparison to the growth of 3 9 recorded in the corresponding period in 2018 supported by higher demand from germany netherlands and the uk earnings from

the surveyed ceos have noted a negative sentiment towards global economic growth in 2020 46 of the surveyed ceos have taken an optimistic view that the global economy is expected to recover or take off in 2020 the survey results reveal a growing confidence among business leaders for the sri lankan economy in 2020 as the statistics supporting acceleration of the sri lankan economy is at its highest when analysing survey results with the past years this is further confirmed with the dramatic drop from 45 to 7 in the number of surveyed ceos who have cited that they expect a decline in the local economy more than half of the surveyed ceos expect the local economy to stabilise in 2020 indicating an overall optimistic view in terms of the sri lankan economy in 2020 sri lanka in 2020 the imf expects the real gdp growth of sri lanka to strengthen to 3 5 in 2020 as the country is on the path to recovery from the negative impact of the easter sunday terrorist attacks in april 2019

identified that economic policies will be the biggest challenge to their businesses in 2020 followed by political legal and governance issues which were a concern for 21 of the respondents the concern for political legal and governance issues as well as economic policies in 2020 remain unchanged when compared to the previous year survey as political and economic tensions witnessed in 2019 continued to hinder business and investor sentiment in 2020 other issues cited as business challenges in 2020 were human capital cost of living and international factors which amounted to 7 of the overall challenges debt repayment and budget deficit were cited as key economic challenges in 2020 as the overall budget deficit was financed largely through domestic sources leading to a significant increase in government debt stock in 2019
houston tx accesswire january 20 2020 both forex trading and stock trading provides investors with a diversity of investment opportunities each with its own features perks and risk levels though they both deal with buying and selling their major difference can be drawn from the kind of commodities they trade forex trades foreign currencies over the counter otc while stock trading is focused on trading company shares on a central exchange what is the forex market the forex market is the market in which participants can buy sell exchange and speculate on currencies the currency market is considered to be the largest financial market with over 5 trillion in daily transactions which is more than the futures and equity markets combined investopedia what is the stock market the stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where regular activities of buying selling and issuance of shares of publicly held companies take place investopedia trading forex vs trading stocks there are investors traders who trade both stocks and forex but one of the major reasons why some traders would pick forex over stock trading is forex leverage for a new investor or trader it may be quite tricky knowing which one to trade in no one is better than the other they are both financial instruments that have the potential to fetch the investor or trader more profit if played well though the underlying goals and risk levels of forex and stock may be quite similar they have certain dissimilarities that set them apart outlined below are some of the dissimilarities trading platform in stock trading investors or traders require a central exchange like the new york stock exchange nyse to trade these central exchanges provide stock traders and investors access to order books that have records of all stock purchases and sales with a record of all the buying and selling traders investors are able to analyze similar patterns that occurred on the exchange in the past and recent times stock traders and investors study past buying and selling patterns for different reasons one of which is tracking the exchange activity to know the best time to buy or sell a stock while for forex trading currencies are traded over the counter otc meaning that there is no central exchange that regulates forex as all transactions are privately done between buyer and seller trading time another major difference between forex and stock trading can be seen in market trading hours since forex has no central exchange and it spans across different time frames it is open 24 hours meaning that traders can trade currencies around the clock at all forex trading sessions the major trading sessions are new york london sydney and tokyo sessions note that the forex market is only open for trading during working days and closed for trading on weekends on the flip side the stock market is only open for trading on central exchanges from 8 am to 5 pm daily the time is subject to the exchange geographical location once the market closes by 5 pm all pending trades can only be made when the market opens the next day by 8 am for some traders the stock market timing stands as a major limitation trading pattern in forex trading currencies always quoted in pairs e g usd gbp or eur usd each currency quoted in a pair is dependent on the other so a forex trader is not only concerned about the financial status in the country of the currency that is being traded but also the financial situation of the country that is being traded against whereas in stock trading the trader is only concerned with the happenings surrounding the company he owns shares in that is if a trader owns apple shares he is only concerned with financial occurrences and other occurrences that happen around apple whatever happens in other companies is absolutely none of his business unless for other interests forex trading pairing nature requires that the trader be consciously aware of the economic standing of both countries before trading their currencies a downside for the forex market is that it is prone to political and economic influence unlike the stock market which is hardly affected by any socio political and economic issues that may arise in a country minimum capital required for most investors forex is a more preferable way to enter into the financial market due to the lower capital required to enter the market unlike trading stocks which require more capital to get started through leverage forex allows small speculators or traders to enlarge their controlling units when trading this can be both beneficial and unprofitable for these speculators forex trading amounts can go as low as 500 but such an amount wouldn t yield much profit compared to a forex trader who trades 5 000 daily compared to stocks the minimum trading amount would be on the high side especially if the investor desires high returns leverage the leverage in stock trading and forex trading greatly differ and most traders prefer forex overstock for this reason leverage allows the trader to buy more currencies with less cash and when the currency s value increases the trader gains more return in stock trading traders are allowed a maximum of 2 1 leverage that is being able to make trades only twice above their current account balance while in forex some brokerage firms allow traders leverage of up to 50 1 allowing them to make trades up to fifty times above their account balance 50 1 is the highest leverage in america other countries can go as high as 400 1 leverage high leverages may seem like a great opportunity provided to the trader however it also holds high tendencies of incurring losses leverage has the ability to increase your profits and losses it all depends on how you place your bet insider trading insider trading is an act that is greatly prohibited because it gives certain investors and traders an advantage over the rest of what s supposed to be a fair market however the issue of insider trading is one that is still ongoing as a large number of public listed companies give room for insider trading the category of stock traders who take advantage of insider trading work hand in hand with stock market insiders who have firsthand information about a company s financial position ongoing plans for a new product line or any other important information required to make a successful stock trade or investment the case is not so in forex trading though the forex market is the largest financial market it cannot be manipulated to support insider trading because there is no central exchange and the currencies are particular to each country if peradventure a case of insider trading almost arises in forex trading the liquidity and size of the forex market are able to cover any trading pressure that may come from insider trading commissions and transaction costs forex is considered as one of the easily accessible financial markets because of its low commissions and transaction costs some forex brokers run commission free services but get their fees off the bid ask spread while other brokers charge upfront commissions in the stock market some brokers may decide to generally charge low commissions and transaction fees while others may charge according to the type of investment made and the risk level tradable instruments when it comes to the number of available tradable instruments the stock market beats the forex market the stock market gives traders and investors a wide variety of investment options the new york stock exchange alone has about 2 000 listed stocks whereas the foreign market provides its traders with a variety of only eight major currencies the major currencies include the us dollar usd euro eur british pound gbp canadian dollar cad swiss franc chf new zealand dollar nzd and the japanese yen jpy the major currencies form the major pairs which make up about 72 of the forex volume the overall number of forex pairs are nothing compared to a number of accessible investments that can be made in the stock market on the contrary the stock market may have the advantage of providing investors with multiple investment options however it is quite easier to control fewer currencies or shares compared to controlling a large base it would then be preferable for stock traders to channel their focus on the shares of a particular industry for better monitoring and control rather than having multiple shares from various industries presence of middlemen since forex trades are done over the counter and transactions made directly between the buyer and the seller there d be no room for a middleman unlike stock trading which requires the services of a middleman which is a stockbroker stock traders or investors can only access the stock market through their brokers which serve as an intermediary in processing all transactions by routing or buying and selling orders to match the best possible prices on the market pros cons of forex trading like most financial vehicles forex trading also has its perks and threats it is advisable for individual investors to first weigh the benefits and possible disadvantages of forex before engaging it it is also important to know that forex is not necessarily an investment vehicle but merely a currency trade that holds the potential of bringing in a profit the forex market is the largest and most accessible financial market there is it only takes traders about 1 3 days to set up and account and fund it with at least 500 forex trading is done otc directly between the buyer and the seller but you can also choose to trade through a brokerage which can be done online online forex trading provides traders with real time market pricing price charts

major threat is crashing in 2008 the stock market crashed in only a few hours and a whole lot of investors were badly affected it didn t take until years before most of these investors were able to recover from the shock and rebuild their portfolios also its high volatility makes it that those who bet well win so much money and those who do not bet well lose all their money and watch their investment go down the drain in just a matter of time investing in risk is for those with high risk tolerance and solid financial stability pros capital growth high returns part ownership of a company volatile market high liquidity portfolio diversification cons risk of a company going bankrupt stock market crash fall in shares price high commissions and charges conclusion as earlier stated no financial market is better than the other as both the forex market and the stock market have their benefits and risk levels the result of trading stocks or forex is dependent on how well the trader understands the market and uses it to his advantage the choice is completely up to you as an investor or trader what we have been able to do is highlight major differences in both trades that can help you figure out which one works better for you there are many traders who trade both forex and stocks successfully for beginners forex trading may be a good starting point to get into the financial market as forex trading holds substantial advantages such as leverage lower commissions and transaction costs favorable trading times no middleman interference absence of insider trading and lower starting capital once a certain level of mastery has been gained about how the forex market works the novice trader can move into stock trading and at the end of the day compare which one works better

introduction with usual high hope and promise the davos annual ritual is on the stage but the promise and hope appear false the world economic forum wef switzerland meeting beginning from january 21 has become one of the voices of the world capitalist system as it considers itself the foremost creative force for engaging the world s top leaders to shape global regional and industry agendas but with capitalism as the dominating force in the world what can be shaped other than destruction of lives on this planet shall the davos elites question capitalism the meet and the wef s global risk report are two of the significant weather meters to gauge the weather the system is bumping into many capitans of the capitalist system express their perception about the situation they are facing the most pressing issues on the global agenda these are actually the fear and the uncertainty the system is failing to get rid of the participants include the world s top politicians academics and business and ngo leaders the 2020 meeting theme is stakeholders for a cohesive and sustainable world its cherished commitment is to improve the state of the world a capitalist world system can never be cohesive and sustainable and it can t improve the world as the system breeds incoherence and chaos the system itself is the evidence the hopeless condition the davos report global risks report 2020 grr 2020 fails to hide the hopeless condition the world capitalist system is experiencing the report s the fraying fundamentals chapter cites the facts stagnation downward pressure on the global economy from macroeconomic fragilities and financial inequality continued to intensify in 2019 the global economy is at increasing risk of stagnation tense geo economic and geopolitical landscape and domestic challenges have exacerbated uncertainty there s according to the imf speak synchronized slowdown weakened growth among the world s economies a gradual deceleration was already underway the slowdown of the world economy has further materialized by the third quarter of 2019 six of the world s largest seven economies japan is the exception which together represent more than half of global production had decelerated the outlook is also precarious for other g20 economies most of these economies are growing at a rate below 2 there s risk of a prolonged slowdown of the world economy the imf has lowered its last five estimates of world output for 2019 and expected a growth rate of 3 0 a sharp decline from 3 6 in 2018 and the slowest since the 1 7 contraction in 2009 for 2020 the imf had also downgraded its forecast from 3 7 to 3 4 source imf 2018 and 2019 world economic outlooks and quarterly updates cited in the grr 2020 slowing trade nationalist policies are challenging low trade barriers fiscal prudence and strong global investment rising trade barriers lower investment and high debt are straining economies around the world global trade is slowing down world trade organization wto data for the first three quarters of 2019 show that total world merchandise trade decreased 2 9 from the previous year it decreased in the world s top ten traders reduced trade volumes are largely the result of what the wto has called historically high levels of trade restrictions turning trade to a weapon of rivalry may persist source wef estimates from wto data accessed on

geopolitical tensions foreign direct investment fdi remains lower than it was before the 2008 09 crisis it has decreased for the last three years in 2018 net fdi inflows were down 38 compared to 2017 and less than half of the level they were in 2015 the sharpest decline has been in the euro area where less appealing yields lower production and uncertainty surrounding brexit have led net fdi inflows to the region to fall to a record low since the euro was adopted in 1999 source world bank opendata foreign direct investment net inflows bop current us euro area world united states china japan accessed on december 15 2019 cited in the grr 2020 high debt private and public debt has been accumulating since the crisis according to the imf the global ratio of debt to gdp increased by 11 percentage points between 2009 and 2017 across g20 economies public debt is expected to reach 90 of gdp in 2019 the highest level on record and to grow even more to 95 in 2024 private debt has built up on the basis of lower interest rates particularly in china and the us where more than 40 of total private debt is located in the second quarter of 2019 non financial corporate debt reached 156 of gdp in china in the us non financial corporate debt reached 47 of gdp in the third quarter the highest level ever recorded according to federal reserve bank of st louis data the imf has listed rising corporate debt burdens as a key vulnerability in the global financial system source wef estimates with data from imf datamapper accessed on december 15 2019 cited in the grr 2020 tools unavailable there s a risk that the tools previously used to brake economic slides may no longer be available financial market stress and strained public finances are creating uncertainty as to whether conventional monetary and fiscal policy instruments could be as effective in the future monetary constraints interest rate cuts have fostered higher debt and riskier rent seeking which affect financial market stability in 2019 most central banks persistently cut interest rates to very sometimes historically low levels in the us the fed lowered its target interest rate from 2 50 in december 2018 to 1 75 currently the european central bank ecb cut its deposit rate to a historic low of 0 50 in september 2019 the bank of japan s deposit rate has remained at 0 10 since february 2016 such low rates raise concerns about the soundness of banking systems the ecb has warned that decreasing profits are challenging europe s banking sector in the second quarter of 2019 european banks yielded an average return to equity of 7 0 compared to 12 1 in the us the role and reach of monetary policies are also challenged by wider factors such as technological change climate change and rising inequality fiscal constraints the margin for fiscal stimulus in most of the world s main economies has narrowed public debt in 15 of the 20 largest economies has increased every year since the 2008 09 crisis deteriorated business confidence business confidence has deteriorated during 2019 the business confidence index constructed by the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd using production data and business sentiment to anticipate future performance signals that the state of the global economy is expected to worsen in the short term at the time of writing the grr 2020 the index had declined for 14 consecutive months dropping below the no change threshold for the first time since 2016 and reaching a 10 year low in october of last year source oecd data business confidence index business confidence index bci htm accessed on january 3 2020 cited in the grr 2020 note numbers above 100 suggest an increased confidence in near future business performance and numbers below 100 indicate pessimism towards future performance inequality concern about inequality underlies recent social unrest on almost every continent domestic income inequality has risen in many countries particularly in advanced economies and reached historical highs in some the oecd reports income inequality in oecd countries is at its highest level for the past half century many of those protesting have long been excluded from their country s wealth and share frustration that the elite have captured gains at the expense of others inequality hinders growth and damages macroeconomic fundamentals as the imf has pointed out it slows down economic activities and casts doubt on a country s stability this damages investor confidence and undermines political capital both fundamental conditions for prosperity especially in times of economic volatility in france for example the persistence of the gilets jaunes movement had caused businesses more than us 11 4 billion in losses by december 2019 the protests in chile cost businesses over us 1 4 billion ocial incidents dealt a very severe blow the profound political consequences of inequality can also undermine economic growth by making a country harder to govern in ways ranging from legislative impasses to complete government paralysis this risk is accentuated by the decentralized and spontaneous nature of recent demonstrations with pop up protests it is difficult for governments to negotiate with demonstrators and develop concrete measures to meet their demands weak public finances could aggravate already hard felt social tensions the european sovereign debt crisis has shown that drastic fiscal corrections and public austerity measures can shrink the welfare state with political and social consequences that many governments would be neither willing nor able to incur failed systems systems have failed to promote economic advancement for all profound citizen discontent born of disapproval of the way governments are addressing economic and social challenges has sparked protests throughout the world there s a widespread domestic discontent with current economic systems perceived to be rigged and unfair polarization and confrontation the global risks perception survey finds economic confrontations and domestic political polarization as the top risks in 2020 economic confrontations between major powers is the most concerning risk for 2020 according to the survey participants recession in a major economy most likely to increase in 2020 the survey finds protectionism regarding trade and investment and populist and nativist agendas most likely to increase through 2020 the wef s executive opinion survey finds fiscal crises are the top rated risk for businesses globally over the next 10 years the wef s expert community perceives domestic political polarization most likely to increase in 2020 prolonged slowdown with this background the grr 2020 said unless the global economic system is reformed to be more socially conscious the twin risks of prolonged slowdown and stronger defiance towards the current economic model will continue to exacerbate each other points missed in today s capitalist world system there ll be slowdowns and these will be prolonged the factors behind these slowdowns are within the system the system breeds the factors the grr 2020 talks about stagnation slowing of trade etc the point the elite minds miss is mature monopoly capitalist economy as one that is subject to and indeed dominated by a basic contradiction the very growth of its productive potential puts insuperable obstacles in the way of making full use of available human and material resources for the satisfaction of the needs of the great mass of the population what this means is 1 that in the absence of sufficiently powerful counteracting forces the normal state of the system in its monopoly capitalist phase is determined by the interaction of the tendency to stagnation and the forces acting counter to this tendency paul m sweezy and harry magdoff the irreversible crisis stagnation and the financial explosion monthly review press new york 1988 and the elites aspire for as the report said a prompt and smooth transition to a more cohesive and sustainable model of stakeholder capitalism the issue of public debt demands a brief observation made more than 150 years ago the public debt becomes one of the most powerful levers of primitive accumulation as with the stroke of an enchanter s wand it endows barren money with the power of breeding and thus turns it into capital without the necessity of its exposing itself to the troubles and risks inseparable from its employment in industry or even in usury marx capital vol i progress publishers moscow erstwhile ussr 1977 with contradiction within contradiction with the labor contradiction with the great masses of people the capitalist system can never turn cohesive and sustainable similarly its transition will never be smooth as the system itself continues creating hurdles on the path of its transition which is nothing but the system s dissolution moreover the term stakeholder capitalism needs no elaboration as capitalists and their retinues are its primary stakeholders other than this parasitic group none the people the labor has any stake in the system the latest oxfam report time to care unpaid and underpaid care work and the global inequality crisis narrates a small fragment about the nature of this parasitic group it s horrible it s shameful it s beyond all ethical standards of all ages with this holy aspiration stakeholder capitalism the davos elites are getting engaged with seven key themes that include healthy futures how to save the planet better business beyond geopolitics and tech for good their discussions include averting a climate apocalypse and how to turn protest into progress with capitalism dominating the planet there s no healthy future of this planet this planet s only future that looms over the horizon is apocalypse as long as capitalism is the world system as the system s only survival mode is destroy everything around the system can t survive without ever expansion and it can t expand without destroying all around as long as there s imperialism there s imperialism s never ending hunger for survival there s no scope for going beyond geopolitics but the grr 2020 doesn t look into that fact it s identifying risks partially but declining to look at roots of the risks a real dream in a real world the elites like to dwell within this dream mainstream likes to play with words and dislikes to dig truths that s to hoodwink the commoners so one of the foremost tasks is to tear down covers of mystery the mainstream puts on facts concerning life on issues in economy and politics its play with terms like public debt cohesion sustainable interest is to be exposed the brutal facts with the terms are to be discussed among the commoners these discussions will help expose hollowness of the mainstream despite use of tricky terms the grr 2020 fails to hide the reality as it admits failure to promote economic advancement for all citizens profound discontent with current economic systems perceived to be rigged and unfair the mainstream mouth is uttering the facts that s the beauty of the grr 2020 the reality doesn t allow the elites to hide all facts however it beautifies itself by hiding its ugly class character notorious class partisanship and political power note all statements not cited are quoted from the grr 2020 farooque

financial and capital management measures certain financial and operating results included in this news release including but not limited to production capital expenditures adjusted funds flow free cash flow ebitda net debt and operating netbacks for the year ended december 31 2019 are based on preliminary unaudited results these results are preliminary and unaudited and are inherently uncertain and subject to change as we complete our financial statements for the year ended december 31 2019 given the timing of these estimates we have not completed our customary financial closing and review procedures as at and for the three months and year ended december 31 2019 and there can be no assurance that our final results will not differ from these estimates in this news release we refer to certain financial measures such as adjusted funds flow ebitda exploration and development expenditures free cash flow net debt and operating netback which do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by canadian gaap non gaap measures and are considered non gaap measures while adjusted funds flow ebitda exploration and development expenditures free cash flow net debt and operating netback are commonly used in the oil and gas industry our determination of these measures may not be comparable with calculations of similar measures for other issuers adjusted funds flow is not a measurement based on generally accepted accounting principles gaap in canada but is a financial term commonly used in the oil and gas industry we define adjusted funds flow as cash flow from operating activities adjusted for changes in non cash operating working capital and asset retirement obligations settled our determination of adjusted funds flow may not be comparable to other issuers we consider adjusted funds flow a key measure that provides a more complete understanding of operating performance and our ability to generate funds for exploration and development expenditures debt repayment settlement of our abandonment obligations and potential future dividends in addition we use a ratio of net debt to adjusted funds flow to manage our capital structure we eliminate settlements of abandonment obligations from cash flow from operations as the amounts can be discretionary and may vary from period to period depending on our capital programs and the maturity of our operating areas the settlement of abandonment obligations are managed with our capital budgeting process which considers available adjusted funds flow changes in non cash working capital are eliminated in the determination of adjusted funds flow as the timing of collection payment and incurrence is variable and by excluding them from the calculation we are able to provide a more meaningful measure of our cash flow on a continuing basis ebitda is not a measurement based on gaap in canada ebitda is defined as net income or loss adjusted for financing and interest expenses unrealized gains and losses on financial derivatives income tax non recurring losses payments on lease obligations certain specific unrealized and non cash transactions including depletion exploration and evaluation expenses unrealized gains and losses on financial derivatives and foreign exchange and share based compensation exploration and development capital expenditures is not a measurement based on gaap in canada we define exploration and development expenditures as additions to exploration and evaluation assets combined with additions to oil and gas properties we use exploration and development expenditures to measure and evaluate the performance of our capital programs the total amount of exploration and development expenditures is managed as part of our budgeting process and can vary from period to period depending on the availability of adjusted funds flow and other sources of liquidity free cash flow is not a measurement based on gaap in canada we define free cash flow as adjusted funds flow less exploration and development expenditures both non gaap measures discussed above payments on lease obligations and asset retirement obligations settled we use free cash flow to evaluate funds available for debt repayment common share repurchases potential future dividends and acquisition and disposition opportunities our previous definition of free cash flow referred to sustaining capital as opposed to exploration and development expenditures given the current commodity price environment our exploration and development expenditures are primarily comprised of sustaining capital which we consider the amount of exploration and development capital required to maintain production accordingly we have revised our definition of free cash flow to provide clarity on the reconciliation to measures determined in accordance with gaap net debt is not a measurement based on gaap in canada we define net debt to be the sum of cash trade and other accounts receivable trade and other accounts payable and the principal amount of both the long term notes and the bank loan we believe that this measure assists in providing a more complete understanding of our cash liabilities and provides a key measure to assess our liquidity we use the principal amounts of the bank loan and long term notes outstanding in the calculation of net debt as these amounts represent our ultimate repayment obligation at maturity the carrying amount of debt issue costs associated with the bank loan and long term notes is excluded on the basis that these amounts have already been paid by baytex at inception of the contract and do not represent an additional source of capital or repayment obligation operating netback is not a measurement based on gaap in canada but is a financial term commonly used in the oil and gas industry operating netback is equal to petroleum and natural gas sales less blending expense royalties production and operating expense and transportation expense divided by barrels of oil equivalent sales volume for the applicable period our determination of operating netback may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other entities we believe that this measure assists in characterizing our ability to generate cash margin on a unit of production basis and is a key measure used to evaluate our operating performance advisory regarding oil and gas information the reserves information contained in this press release has been prepared in accordance with ni 51 101 complete ni 51 101 reserves disclosure will be included in our annual information form for the year ended december 31 2019 which will be filed on or before march 30 2020 listed below are cautionary statements that are specifically required by ni 51 101 the term barrels of oil equivalent boe may be misleading particularly if used in isolation a boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one boe 6 mcf bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6 1 utilizing a conversion on a 6 1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value with respect to finding and development costs the aggregate of the exploration and development costs incurred in the most recent financial year and the change during that year in estimated future development costs generally will not reflect total finding and development costs related to reserves additions for that year this press release contains estimates of the net present value of our future net revenue from our reserves such amounts do not represent the fair market value of our reserves this press release contains metrics commonly used in the oil and natural gas industry such as capital efficiencies finding and development costs finding development and acquisition costs net asset value recycle ratio operating netback and reserves life index these terms do not have a standardized meaning and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies and therefore should not be used to make such comparisons such metrics have been included in this press release to provide readers with additional measures to evaluate baytex s performance however such measures are not reliable indicators of baytex s future performance and future performance may not compare to baytex s performance in previous periods and therefore such metrics should not be unduly relied upon capital efficiency means the cost to drill complete equip and tie in a well divided by the initial production rate of the well on a boe basis over its initial 365 days of production finding and development costs are calculated on a per boe basis by dividing the aggregate of the change in future development costs from the prior year for the particular reserve category and the costs incurred on exploration and development activities in the year by the change in reserves from the prior year for the reserve category finding development and acquisition costs are calculated on a per boe basis by dividing the aggregate of the change in future development costs from the prior year for the particular reserve category and the costs incurred on development and exploration activities and property acquisitions net of dispositions in the year by the change in reserves from the year for the reserve category net asset value has been calculated based on the estimated net present value of all future net revenue from our reserves before income taxes as estimated by mcdaniel effective december 31 2019 plus the estimated value of our undeveloped land holdings less net debt recycle ratio means operating netback divided by finding and development costs for the particular reserves

drilling locations drilling inventory and drilling locations refers to baytex s total proved probable and unbooked locations proved locations and probable locations account for drilling locations in our inventory that have associated proved and or probable reserves unbooked locations are internal estimates based on our prospective acreage and an assumption as to the number of wells that can be drilled per section based on industry practice and internal review unbooked locations do not have attributed reserves unbooked locations are farther away from existing wells and therefore there is more uncertainty whether wells will be drilled in such locations and if drilled there is more uncertainty whether such wells will result in additional oil and gas reserves resources or production in

drilling locations include 11 proved and 10 probable locations as at december 31 2019 and 295 unbooked locations notice to united states readers the petroleum and natural gas reserves contained in this press release have generally been prepared in accordance with canadian disclosure standards which are not comparable in all respects to united states or other foreign disclosure standards for example the united states securities and exchange commission the sec requires oil and gas issuers in their filings with the sec to disclose only proved reserves but permits the optional disclosure of probable reserves each as defined in sec rules canadian securities laws require oil and gas issuers disclose their reserves in accordance with ni 51 101 which requires disclosure of not only proved reserves but also probable reserves additionally ni 51 101 defines proved reserves and probable reserves differently from the sec rules accordingly proved and probable reserves disclosed in this press release may not be comparable to united states standards probable reserves are higher risk and are generally believed to be less likely to be accurately estimated or recovered than proved reserves in addition under canadian disclosure requirements and industry practice reserves and production are reported using gross volumes which are volumes prior to deduction of royalty and similar payments the sec rules require reserves and production to be presented using net volumes after deduction of applicable royalties and similar payments moreover baytex has determined and disclosed estimated future net revenue from its reserves using forecast prices and costs whereas the sec rules require that reserves be estimated using a 12 month average price calculated as the arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for each month within the 12 month period prior to the end of the reporting period as a consequence of the foregoing baytex s reserve estimates and production volumes in this press release may not be comparable to those made by companies utilizing united states reporting and disclosure standards baytex energy corp baytex energy corp is an oil and gas corporation based in calgary alberta the company is engaged in the acquisition development and production of crude oil and natural gas in the western canadian sedimentary basin and in the eagle ford in the united states

paul krugman nobel memorial prize in economic sciences and distinguished professor of economics at city university of new york wrote foundation for crisis was laid by a rush of foreign investors into a country followed by a sudden rush out professor krugman further add since 1980 however the roster has been impressive mexico brazil argentina and chile in 1982 sweden and finland in 1991 mexico again in 1995 thailand malaysia indonesia and korea in 1998 argentina again in 2002 and of course the more recent run of disasters iceland ireland greece portugal spain italy cyprus keeping above in view throughout the years consistently low investment rates are a promising sign for pakistan and it has become difficult to deal with the growing and developing economies which are increasing at a much steady pace rendering it a daunting challenge for the country structural flaws legal and constitutional restrictions enhanced tax compliance policy instability and unexpectedness are major challenges to securing substantial conventional capital inflows into the country in order to have access to debt trapping pakistan has also been locked in a perpetual cycle of low investment low saving generally results in private sector dragging out which has constrained the country s growth prospects regarding the regional economies the investment rate in pakistan is weakening both in absolute terms and as a percentage of gdp which has adversely affected economic productive sectors like human capital infrastructure electricity industrial sector transport agriculture etc resurrecting the economy is essential to government but securing foreign investors to invest in the country is equally valuable the government s economic team recently visited the us and europe and went out of their way to persuade and attract and retain investors to invest in government bills and bonds as lending rates are reportedly very high in pakistan therefore interest rates in europe and the us are not so high foreign investors will earn better returns by lending money to pakistan due to high interest rates while pakistan can receive foreign currency that will further help build its foreign reserves this is technically called carry trade and is also known as hot money hot money means is an investment strategy concerning low interest rate borrowing and investing in an asset that delivers a higher rate of return pakistan has already been naturally drawn by international investors to some usd 400 million as hot money sbp authorities believe that in the months ahead pakistan will be able to raise up to usd 2 billion as hot money while the ministry of finance will also finalize the recapitalization of euro bonds with a very attractive return rate pakistan initiated foreign currency accounts fcas in the early 1970s by providing the necessary and saving mechanisms to employees working overseas to draw capital flows to fund rising deficits this scheme proved costly as accounts covered against the exchange risk banks were granted a cushion advance cover on their foreign exchange liabilities towards the forefront by state bank of pakistan sbp hot money means is an investment strategy concerning low interest rate borrowing and investing in an asset that delivers a higher rate of return pakistan has already been naturally drawn by international investors to some usd 400 million as hot money in early 1990s pakistan opened up its economy embraced liberal and market oriented policies and boosted private sector by introducing incentive packages eying capital flows fcas evolved into tax havens for international investors to park capital as a result of some legal measures to entertain tax evaders which raised the country s external debt and additional expense to the economy the trade liberalization regime s adherents believe that financial capital markets and flexible exchange rates chase away free inflows of capital from one country to another to manipulate short term gains that make the economies more susceptible due to the sheer trend of globalization various global hedge funds began approaching pakistani stock market and started pouring hot money for their narrow term gains in order to complement the critical necessity of opening capital accounts during the first half of the 2000 era decade the liberalization process persisted and culminated in more openness and control allowing foreign exchange companies promote structured inward remittance networks rather than hawala and hundi ones with both the liberalizing procedures of foreign banks industry determined exchange rates and financial reforms in 2007 country garnered 8 billion in private foreign investment these foreign capital inflows exacerbated stock market and real estate speculations which made them resilient contribution to degenerating competition in the country if the prominence of pakistan s economy to the global economy is not as large as that of emerging economies but in the past it persisted highly susceptible and consistently felt the heat from economic shocks originating from international oil prices that chucked pakistan into regular payment balance shocks successive governments have not followed any serious legislation on foreign investment policies to entice capital flows in human capital superior technology infrastructure industry or business ecosystem homeland has in the earlier days raised loans from foreign commercial banks or international cooperation agencies to build foreign exchange reserves at floating rates with short term investment boundaries all these previous activities of capitalizing hot money create major debt sustainability challenges and destabilize the country s external account in order to conclude the current designated economic team needs to understand rather than living in fool s paradise and assuring everything will get in align the short term benefits should be weigh against the tsunami of losses and economic disaster as expressed in why nations fail experiences should be taken as precedent pakistan economyhad experienced the severe backlashes of hot money due to its volatile nature such evidences are also found in the case of mexico peso crisis 1994 thailand baht crises 1997 russia 1998 argentina 2001 which led to massive disruptions fluctuations in foreign exchange market and

in june 1965 the french philosopher and political scientist raymond aron gathered an extraordinary group of thinkers including stanley hoffmann lord gladwyn jebb and henry kissinger for a weeklong seminar in the beautiful villa serbelloni in bellagio italy this discussion centered upon the question of whether and how a stable world order could be achieved could different ideological systems co exist in an often chaotic and uncertain world was the nation state the most effective instrument of global governance what effect would transformative technological change have on global politics the core issue the esteemed group wrestled with was if it were possible to organize so that there can be peaceful coexistence between societies which remain fundamentally different fifty five years later analysts are once again consumed with the current and future state of world order which appears in crisis many have offered recommendations for what a future global order might look like and what should be done to build it it is hard to imagine a more consequential question before looking to the future however we need to better understand the past the order that emerged after world war ii is often portrayed in overly simplistic and misleading ways we need a fuller understanding of the much lionized but often misunderstood postwar world if we are to construct an effective future order we ought to also correctly diagnose the contemporary challenges to this order and assess what the aim of future order building efforts should be four caveats before discussing elements of postwar order i would like to offer four caveats or things to consider when analyzing and trying to understand the events policies and institutions that shaped international relations after world war ii first we often think of world order as emerging from a long term master plan and sober debate and consideration based on deep reflection about the future this is how things often look in retrospect especially when described by political scientists and even historians but that may be the product of outcome bias in fact as every decision maker knows ex ante policymakers faced radical uncertainty about the future and often stumbled towards ad hoc reactive ways to create what now seems so impressive and pre planned we often forget the efforts and initiatives to build order that failed or were re adapted for other purposes second no singular world order emerged after world war ii the cold war produced competing orders such as the system imposed by the soviet union on its own country its near periphery and its global allies there were some issues and areas where it would be hard to identify any order more often than not chaos and uncertainty rather than order marked decolonization and the rise of new states in africa and parts of asia my focus will be on what some call the western liberal world order that emerged after world war ii though that name is not without its own problems third because of its overwhelming power after emerging victorious from world war ii many if not most of the elements of this postwar order were shaped by the united states and its close allies it is important to recall however that the united states based on its history had a deep ambivalence about engaging in order shaping to say nothing of participating in alliances we easily forget that there was never a domestic political consensus that world order building should have been an american priority and there were plenty of critics with strong political followings of the order that was constructed there was a deep highly respected tradition dating back to founders including presidents george washington thomas jefferson and john quincy adams that deep engagement in the affairs of the world risked great danger to the american experiment fourth the order that was constructed was shaped largely under the shadow of the searing memory of the recent past three issues or events in particular influenced early order building the abject failure of the versailles conference and other order building efforts in europe in the 1920s the catastrophic collapse of the global economy in the 1930s and world war ii which engulfed europe and asia and pulled in a reluctant united states after the japanese attack on pearl harbor in december 1941 these three concerns were obviously seen as linked and the effectiveness of any world order was judged by its ability to solve the underlying causes and tensions that had led to these crises the intellectual origins of the postwar order matters for two reasons first early order builders had theories about why the interwar period had been a disaster some of these hypotheses were correct other arguments were proven in time to be wrong but for the purposes of constructing an order their understanding of how unwelcome events occurred in the previous decades is critical to understanding their priorities and their choices second some aspects of the order they built were better at solving these problems of the past but less effective at anticipating the problems of the future in other words while this order anticipated and solved many older issues it was less adept at dealing with new challenges in that emerged in the years after world war ii the american led postwar order possessed four components economics security nuclear stability and global governance and international regulation these elements were often related and at times overlap and intersect each had its own chronologies and disjunctures i will not spend much time on the last leg of world order global governance and regulation although arguably it is the most durable pervasive and consequential plank of postwar world order scores of international organizations norms and laws have been created since world war ii and over time have become deeply embedded within the international system affecting all sorts of daily transactions we now take for granted think of the impact that the international civil aviation organization or the world health organization have had in the year 1967 when the world health organization began its smallpox eradication program 2 million people died of the disease in the 20th century 300 million people died of it twice as many as died in all the wars combined over ten years later the disease had been eliminated and the death toll was zero largely resulting from global cooperation and collaboration made possible by the world health organization one could argue that the proliferation and deep penetration of such regimes and the expansion of global governance to include networks of non governmental organizations and even the private sector over the past few decades is the most important if not most obvious legacy of postwar order building international economic order the earliest and initially most important leg of world order was economic it was also the most discontinuous as there have been at least three periods of postwar economic order since 1945 first the bretton woods period that lasted until the early 1970s second the chaotic efforts to rebuild economic order in the 1970s and 1980s and third the globalization order that emerged in the early 1990s which continues today but which has been under some strain since at least 2008 economic order building took priority for two reasons first the united states long had a view about international politics that prioritized economic relations between states over traditional geopolitical concerns such as european balance of power politics or imperialism a guiding principle of american foreign policy since the founding had been that vigorous and fair commerce between states was the best way to generate good relations and peace among nations second american decision makers drew a straight line between the economic disasters of the 1930s the rise of autarky and autocracy and the origins of world war ii the collapse of the u s stock market in 1929 and in particular the global consequences of the failure of the creditanstalt bank in vienna and the suspension of sterling convertibility in 1931 unleashed a variety of unfortunate national policies that made global economic recovery difficult if not impossible countries raised tariffs imposed capital controls and unleashed competitive currency devaluations resulting in what were called beggar thy neighbor policies american order builders believed this kind of economic nationalism weakened democracies strengthened autocracies and made world war more likely the main elements of the postwar economic order were initiated at the bretton woods monetary conference in the summer of 1944 and savannah in the spring of 1946 when the international monetary fund and the world bank were created other initiatives followed including the general agreements on tariffs and trade the 1946 anglo american loan and the european recovery program known as the marshall plan large amounts of u s economic aid were provided to countries in east and southeast asia the middle east and latin america also included was support for the 1951 european coal and steel community which ultimately led to the common market and eventually the european union later programs such as the mutual security administration the 1961 foreign assistance act and the 1961 alliance for progress were implemented these institutions and period of economic world order are often misunderstood they did not promote unfettered free trade foreign investment and the movement of global capital the effort to create an international trade organization failed reconstruction stability and domestic autonomy were prized over interdependence regional integration such as in europe was emphasized over global interactions exchange rates were fixed but national governments were rarely forced to alter their domestic monetary or budgetary policies to rectify misaligned currency values that naturally emerged from differential rates of inflation trade was managed and as a percentage of gross national product far smaller than in previous periods capital controls were common economic order builders were motivated above all else to prevent what they saw as the economic volatility and chaos of the interwar period but the bretton woods system possessed internal contradictions and tensions that meant crisis was inevitable the unraveling of the system was hastened by an american balance of payments deficit driven by its overseas security commitments the unsustainability of the fixed rate gold exchange system and the massive increase in capital flows the convertibility of dollars into gold was suspended in 1971 efforts to re establish economic order and rules to return to stable exchange rates and to limit economic volatility largely failed in the 1970s and 1980s while certain parts of the world especially east asia witnessed impressive growth inflation steep increases in natural resources prices burgeoning debt in the developing world budget deficits amongst developed countries banking crises massive increases in global capital flows erratic exchange rates and rising protectionism marked what might be thought of as a non order the main consolation was that the rival economic order the communist system of the soviet empire was suffering steep crisis and collapse the third period of economic order which persists though is challenged today emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s the g 7 founded in 1975 took on a greater role for both economic and political coordination it was supplemented by and then replaced by the g 20 the uruguay trade round led to the world trade organization the united states began working more closely with re empowered bretton woods institutions to build on principles that were dubbed the washington consensus these principles emphasized steering countries towards the principles of economic reform based on fiscal discipline property rights liberalization privatization and market dynamics much of this economic order was molded by powerful institutions and important arrangements that few recognize or understand for example much of the globalization order is shaped by massive and complex flows of capital and currency between private banks around the world these exchanges which are measured in the trillions of dollars are loosely regulated by a set of agreements the basel accords overseen by the basel committee on bank supervision created in 1974 the committee is an international committee made up of the most important central bank and banking regulatory officials in the worlds it has neither a founding treaty nor is it a multilateral organization yet its three accords basel i in 1988 basel ii in 2004 and the as yet unimplemented basel iii arrangements are far more important than the international monetary fund and world bank in shaping the global economic order international security order there were two strands of order building in the postwar period the first was based on the principle of collective security and international cooperation to prevent interstate war expressed through the charter and mission of the united nations while president franklin roosevelt put much stock into this organization and its mandate which was an expansion upon the wilsonian principles that failed after world war i it is fair to say that the u n system disappointed the early hopes of its greatest advocates that said the u n system did serve the postwar international order in a few ways it provided a forum to negotiate diffuse crises and build support for multilateral action it also enshrined the importance of international law and the need to obtain international legitimacy for state action and perhaps more importantly the costs of not securing it the stronger and more effective if surprising plank of postwar order was the american alliance system there were quite a few treaties and pacts both with individual and groups of countries many of these alliances were transformed deepened and expanded even when the original source of their creation the cold war went away the proliferation of treaties pacts and security arrangements was surprising for two reasons first as mentioned earlier the united states had long looked askance at alliances so its postwar alliance building represented a profound shift in grand strategy second historically alliances were temporary threat specific and additive most of these postwar relationships persisted and deepened over years and decades even as the threat changed and disappeared many of these security arrangements as will be discussed in the next section sought to inhibit alliance partners from adding certain capabilities such as nuclear weapons postwar security building was extraordinarily successful it is currently under threat as the administration of president donald trump questions their value while rising powers challenge their legitimacy postwar order and nuclear weapons it might seem odd to have a separate category for nuclear weapons distinct from security as its own plank of postwar order it is not for two reasons first it was recognized early that the terrifying destructive capabilities of nuclear weapons and the speed and distance at which they could be delivered was historically unique the emergence of nuclear then thermonuclear weapons would have profound revolutionary consequences for world order no one expected geopolitical or ideological competition to go away but nuclear weapons made it imperative to construct an order that reduced if not eliminated the risk of great power war the second reason was that constructing a postwar order for nuclear weapons required two bitter geopolitical and ideological adversaries the soviet union and the united states to cooperate it often saw the two superpowers work together both to limit their own armaments and to suppress the nuclear ambitions of their allies and client states a nuclear world order took some time to emerge in the twenty years after the united states used nuclear weapons against japan in 1945 the american and soviet arsenals expanded to include thousands of weapons new countries the united kingdom france and china developed their own nuclear weapons while many others ranging from australia to sweden demonstrated an interest in acquiring the bomb the trend lines if nothing was done would have seen a continuing arms race between the superpowers and perhaps dozens of new nuclear weapons states by the end of the century while the intellectual origins of arms control went back to ancient greece it had never successfully underpinned previous efforts at world order but the postwar prominence of arms control was to become one of the most important developments in world order beginning first with the 1963 partial test ban treaty and moving towards the 1968 nuclear nonproliferation treaty the superpowers worked with other states to limit the spread of nuclear weapons other initiatives were put forward including from the 1974 nuclear suppliers group the 1997 additional protocol and the 2003 proliferation security initiative to strengthen global nonproliferation chemical and biological weapons were limited the united states and the soviet union and then russia worked to limit strategic weapons with the 1972 strategic arms limitation talks 1991 start and 2011 new start treaties the global nuclear order was not always perfect new nuclear powers have emerged there were cases of cheating and several treaties such as the anti ballistic missile treaty and more recently the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty were abandoned still if one had told interested observers in 1960 that 60 years later nuclear weapons would not have been used in war that nuclear stockpiles had been massively reduced and the number of nuclear weapons states was in the single digits they would have both incredulous and overjoyed the united states as the builder of order america was in many ways a reluctant order builder after world war ii seeking to replace what it saw as inherently predatory destabilizing imperial orders beginning with the western european empires and culminating in the hyper expansionist german and japanese regimes the hope of american planners was that this u s led order while respecting state sovereignty would be more open and integrative theirs was an economic political military conception in that order trade would flourish as might self governance international law and collective security would prevail while not naïve there was hope that the ideals of the atlantic charter concepts including self determination disarmament open trade freedom of the seas and the end of conquest could be implemented over time certainly by the early 1950s important elements of this conception were submerged under a more constrained cold war order openness was balanced by the need to fill political vacuums with reconstruction and stability security took precedence over economics militarized alliances were formed to counter what was seen as an acute threat from the soviet union s communist empire this order was not however simply a traditional geopolitical balance of power arrangement hailed by 19th century statesmen and 20th century realists creative thoughtful statecraft both integrated and liberalized former enemies like germany and japan europe was encouraged both to integrate and to decolonize while often applied inconsistently and unevenly the order encouraged both political and economic liberalization the united states even cooperated with its bitter ideological and military adversary the soviet union on the gravest threat to global order nuclear weapons there was no one postwar order what did emerge was by no means perfect nor are many of its elements relevant to the profound global challenges facing the united states and the world today if we are to construct an effective world order for the future however it would be wise to better understand the lessons of the past the future of world order it is important to recall that this postwar order was very successful for example great power war was avoided and conflict and violence overall fell imperialism was discredited and though often messy a system of sovereign states replaced one of empires a system of arms control and deterrence based on treaties and alliances reigned in the worst fears of a nuclearized world though often uneven both internally and externally the world economy expanded and sharp economic crises were largely avoided this american led order also allowed the west to prevail in the cold war struggle with the soviet union and just as important and often unrecognized helped allow for a relatively peaceful stable prosperous transition to the post cold war world and while there have been ups and downs human rights and tolerance have become powerful global norms and governments are increasingly expected to be responsive to the needs of their citizens so why not simply continue with this post world war ii order amending and improving as needed certainly there are parts that are very successful and should be continued the nuclear order based on the nuclear nonproliferation treaty regime has despite challenges been successful and should be nourished and strengthened also the norm and the practice of international institutions and global governance though rickety at times is important there are two great challenges to the contemporary world order the dramatic rise of china and the consequences of the profound transformation of the global economy and international system a revolutionary change on par with the industrial revolution most of the current debates on world order focus on the capabilities and intentions of a growing china this is understandably important in the past rapidly rising powers have challenged global arrangements with calamitous military conflicts as the result these two stories however the rise of china and the global dynamics of technology demographics and socio economics are intertwined and cannot be understood or dealt with separately furthermore the second challenge which has transformed everything from demographics to governance to how people live and work and self identify to calculations about war and peace is the key challenge and the one that people aren t focusing on enough beginning in the united states in 1960s accelerating in the 1970s and spreading and intensifying in recent decades how the global system operates has been completely upended it is to a great extent the reason for china s rise the consequences of this revolution are impossible to overstate and hard to fully accommodate under current arrangements much of this has to do with the digital revolution and the profound expansion of access to information unmediated by traditional institutions part of it is an upending of how and where and at what cost things were manufactured with world trade and prosperity build upon a complex and deeply integrated global supply chain part of it has to do with a financial revolution even larger and more profound than that which launched early modern europe part of it has to do with a rights revolution that completely upended traditional categories of gender race ethnicity and sexual orientation with a focus on individual autonomy and the tolerance of difference part of this has to do with a complete reshaping of identity and how people live and relate to each other individual family and communal that upends historical relationships between personal autonomy and collective belonging in 1970 a successful american was likely a white male associated with large organizations companies unions churches civic associations political parties and likely lived where his parents did he married in his early or mid twenties from this community and expected to raise his children as he was raised needless to say all of this has changed how we work how and where we live who we live with and how and for what end has changed more dramatically than at any time since the industrial revolution these changes which have reshaped the american socioeconomic and political landscape have quickly spread around the world these shifts in core demographics identity finance and trade technology socioeconomics and the relationship of the individual to institutions have generated both profound opportunities and worrying challenges they have also created a dizzying puzzle in material terms the world is doing wonderfully poverty has fallen dramatically as has infant mortality diseases have been eliminated starvation is rare and life expectancy increased education has spread resources become more abundant and violence of all types between states within states between communities within families has fallen dramatically around the world there has been a profound if largely unrecognized and uneven embrace of tolerance and human rights extraordinary amounts of wealth have been created although obviously not always distributed fairly military expenditures have fallen and new technologies have vastly increased access to information and knowledge despite these accomplishments however there is an overriding sense of anxiety dread worry and concern a sense that world order is trending in the wrong direction constructing a world order for the future the elements that underpinned the postwar order in the second half of the 20th century may not be relevant to these issues while they could return the great scourge of human history through the 20th century great power wars of imperial conquest no longer appear to be the most looming threat a variety of factors make this so nuclear deterrence for one but another is demographics historically aging populations rarely pursue great power war furthermore unlike the past land and territory are not the most important source of power and wealth in some cases they are a burden hong kong is valuable to china not because of its land features or natural resources but because it is a center of financial and technological innovation and one of three places in the world possessing deep capital markets economies and societies are deeply integrated and any move away from such interdependence would come at great cost to the welfare of many how should we think about a world order that alleviates these concerns and anxieties three questions should drive this consideration what do we want to see happen what do we want to avoid and what counts for power to achieve the first two considerations for a start any future global arrangement needs to better account for what counts for power in this current and future world in 1890 1950 even 1980 the answer to what mattered to what was power was clear a state with favorable geography a large population abundant natural resources an industrial economy focused on coal steel and electricity and a centralized governance structure that could mobilize these resources into war making capabilities to conquer rivals was what mattered does anyone think that is the recipe for success in 2020 and beyond in other words how will nuclear weapons and tanks confront climate change disinformation epidemics or financial collapse this gets to the challenge that this profound transformation has wrought for world order first the problems that we faced in the past were based on scarcity wealth was scarce resources scarce information was scarce security was scarce health was scarce and with populations increasing by leaps and bounds in the 19th and first part of the 20th century intense competition for these scarce resources was bound to be violent the problems we face now the explosion of information and disinformation unthinkably large global financial flows the large movement of people climate change generated largely by world wide economic success anxiety and uncertainty due in some measures to the dizzying increase in individual freedoms these might be called the problems of plenty in a world of nuclear deterrence integration flattening demographics where the costs of occupation are high and conquest unappealing military security is far more abundant than we recognize second neither our intellectual tools nor our governing institutions were constructed to deal with these problems of plenty the postwar state based international order was built to handle great power war and old timey economic crises like currency depreciations they are completely overwhelmed when dealing with the issues we are currently facing and in fact often respond to these new problems with old solutions such as a focus on military combat capabilities or outdated tariff policies the same goes for our scholarly models whether in international relations or economics which are based on scarcity models and don t always do well dealing with the problems of plenty the types of insecurity we face look nothing like those that worried order builders in the middle of the 20th century this has generated a legitimacy crisis for governance both nationally and internationally why we know how to prevent world war ii we have a decent sense of how to avoid a great depression or as 2008 revealed how to prevent the worst from happening when the global economy faces steep crisis we don t however have effective policy answers for dealing with climate change or disinformation for regulating trillion dollar all invasive technology companies for handling massive and potentially destabilizing financial flows for managing intensely integrated global supply chains for inequality for identity politics or for the flow of people we face a conundrum when trying to understand and manage this new world we must avoid the temptation to simply rely on past practices and institutions to deal with emerging challenges we must also recognize that these changes though destabilizing and occasionally frightening have brought profoundly positive changes to the world the remarkable global revolution of the past few decades has generated wealth and massively reduced poverty helped eliminate disease increased individual tolerance and freedom provided access to unimaginable levels of communication and information and dampened the dark cloud of war and violence the challenge for any future order building is to capture and build upon these impressive accomplishments as importantly we must generate novel effective institutional and normative responses to deal with the troubling upsetting disorienting and dangerous aspects of these changes how should we go about examining and trying to understand these crucial issues six decades after the bellagio meeting the henry a kissinger center for global affairs which i direct in cooperation with the centre for grand strategy at kings college and the ax son johnson foundation is gathering a diverse set of thinkers in april in middleburg virginia to debate and discuss the question of world order from a variety of perspectives similar to the meeting aron hosted we certainly do not expect consensus or even agreement that world order is achievable wise or even a meaningful goal at best we hope to accomplish what kissinger suggested in his comments at bellagio before the problem of order can be dealt with even philosophically we must be certain that the right questions are being asked francis j gavin is the giovanni agnelli distinguished professor and the inaugural director of the

which ipc operates and globally the availability and cost of financing labour and services and the ability to market crude oil natural gas and natural gas liquids successfully although ipc believes that the expectations and assumptions on which such forward looking statements are based are reasonable undue reliance should not be placed on the forward looking statements because ipc cannot give assurances that they will prove to be correct since forward looking statements address future events and conditions by their very nature they involve inherent risks and uncertainties actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors and risks these include but are not limited to the risks that the parties will not receive required approvals to complete the acquisition or may not be able to satisfy the conditions to closing the risks associated with the oil and gas industry in general such as operational risks in development exploration and production delays or changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects or capital expenditures the uncertainty of estimates and projections relating to reserves resources production

press release to operating cash flow ocf operating costs and net debt which are not generally accepted accounting measures under international financial reporting standards ifrs and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by ifrs and therefore may not be comparable with definitions of ocf operating costs and net debt that may be used by other public companies non ifrs measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with ifrs management believes that ocf operating costs and net debt are useful supplemental measures that may assist shareholders and investors in assessing the cash generated by and the financial performance and position of ipc management also uses non ifrs measures internally in order to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period prepare annual operating budgets and assess ipc s ability to meet its future capital expenditure and working capital requirements management believes these non ifrs measures are important supplemental measures of operating performance because they highlight trends in the core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on ifrs financial measures management believes such measures allow for assessment of ipc s operating performance and financial condition on a basis that is more consistent and comparable between reporting

2019 which may be accessed through the sedar website www sedar com or granite s website graniteoil ca disclosure of oil and gas information this press release contains references to estimates of gross 2p reserves attributed by ipc to granite s oil and gas assets gross reserves are the total working interest reserves before the deduction of any royalties and including any royalty interests receivable reserves estimates and contingent resource estimates in respect of granite s oil and gas assets were evaluated by sproule on behalf of ipc in reports prepared by sproule dated january 15 2020 evaluating the oil and gas reserves and contingent resources attributable to granite s properties as at december 31 2019 the reserves estimates and contingent resource estimates included in these sproule reports are based on ipc s assessment of potential development activities related to the assets which may differ from granite s assessment and reported figures the price forecasts used in the reserve reports are as at december 31 2019 and are available on the website of sproule sproule com 2p reserves means gross proved plus probable reserves proved reserves are those reserves that can be estimated with a high degree of certainty to be recoverable it is likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated proved reserves probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves it is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the sum of the estimated proved plus probable reserves contingent resources are those quantities of petroleum estimated as of a given date to be potentially recoverable from known accumulations using established technology or technology under development but which are not currently considered to be commercially recoverable due to one or more contingencies contingencies are conditions that must be satisfied for a portion of contingent resources to be classified as reserves that are a specific to the project being evaluated and b expected to be resolved within a reasonable timeframe contingencies may include factors such as economic legal environmental political and regulatory matters or a lack of markets it is also appropriate to classify as contingent resources the estimated discovered recoverable quantities associated with a project in the early evaluation stage contingent resources are further classified in accordance with the level of certainty associated with the estimates and may be sub classified based on a project maturity and or characterized by their economic status there are three classifications of contingent resources low estimate best estimate and high estimate best estimate is a classification of estimated resources described in the coge handbook as being considered to be the best estimate of the quantity that will be actually recovered it is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the best estimate if probabilistic methods are used there should be at least a 50 probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the best estimate contingent resources are further classified based on project maturity the project maturity subclasses include development pending development on hold development unclarified and development not viable all of granite s contingent resources are classified by ipc as development unclarified development unclarified is defined as a contingent resource that requires further appraisal to clarify the potential for development and has been assigned a lower chance of development until contingencies can be clearly defined chance of development is the probability of a project being commercially viable references to unrisked contingent resources volumes means that the reported volumes of contingent resources have not been risked or adjusted based on the chance of commerciality of such resources in accordance with the coge handbook for contingent resources the chance of commerciality is solely based on the chance of development based on all contingencies required for the re classification of the contingent resources as reserves being resolved therefore unrisked reported volumes of contingent resources do not reflect the risking or adjustment of such volumes based on the chance of development of such resources chance of development is the probability of a project being commercially viable and the chance of development risk of 70 has been applied by ipc to all of granite s contingent resources the risked contingent resources best estimate as at december 31 2019 is 4 3 mmboe the contingency for all of the unrisked best estimate contingent resources is ipc s corporate commitment whether to proceed with the specific opportunities following completion of the acquisition the contingent resources reported in this press release are estimates only the estimates are based upon a number of factors and assumptions each of which contains estimation error which could result in future revisions of the estimates as more technical and commercial information becomes available the estimation factors include but are not limited to the mapped extent of the oil and gas accumulations geologic characteristics of the reservoirs and dynamic reservoir performance there are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with recovery of such resources including many factors beyond the corporation s control there is uncertainty that it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of the contingent resources referred to in this press release 2p reserves and contingent resources have been aggregated in this press release by ipc estimates of reserves and future net revenue for individual properties may not reflect the same level of confidence as estimates of reserves and future net revenue for all properties due to aggregation there is no assurance that the forecast prices and cost assumptions used in the reserve evaluations will be attained and variances could be material boes may be misleading particularly if used in isolation a boe conversion ratio of 6 thousand cubic feet mcf per 1 barrel bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead as the value ratio between natural gas and crude oil based on the current prices of natural gas and crude oil is significantly different from the energy equivalency

january can be a precarious month for personal finances and personal fitness the financial and dietary costs of holiday revelry must be paid this month and doing so is not always easy as this process unfolds many resolve to tighten their belts physically on their waistbands and metaphorically in their wallets this month of quieter consumption is a good time to take stock of the outlook for u s consumers consumer spending has been the most encouraging trend in recent reports of u s economic growth while trade uncertainty made exports volatile and took business investment into negative territory consumer spending showed reliably strong growth in the first three quarters of 2019 a 21 trillion economy is quite a burden for consumers to carry but they appear to be up to the task closing the books on 2019 we see another year of healthy consumer spending retail sales grew by a strong 5 8 in december helped by a late thanksgiving that pushed the peak holiday shopping weeks later into the year e merchants continued to gain at the expense of traditional department stores but overall results beat expectations for the season it should be no surprise that consumers remained active in 2019 when consumers work they gain income and they spend it the unemployment rate is holding at a historically low level of 3 5 and job openings are plentiful for the past two years over 20 of small business owners surveyed by the national federation of independent business identified a lack of quality labor as the most important problem facing their companies december s employment report reflected the continuing strength of the american labor market while job creation of 145 000 jobs was modestly below expectations it came on the heels of an upside surprise in november the best news was the rise in the labor force participation rate for workers age 25 54 years we watch this metric closely to assess whether the labor market has reached capacity the current cycle high of 82 9 remains below the peaks seen in past cycles suggesting some slack remains very strong job creation has restored incomes and bolstered consumption this growth in the labor force brings many benefits employers are able to grow their headcount without shocks to their labor costs the marginal workers who re enter the workforce are learning new skills earning income and paying taxes they are potentially moving off disability or other welfare programs and by expanding the labor force they are growing the potential output of the total economy clearing the way for continued growth wages continue to grow albeit more slowly than we would expect from past cycles the availability of workers on the margin is among the factors keeping wage growth muted in turn inflation has yet to gain any momentum central bankers are worried that inflation has not reached its target but from a worker s perspective the current level of moderate inflation is generally positive incomes are growing faster than expenses and price shocks are rare though we were unsure of how the economy would adapt to higher tariffs trade protections have been structured to avoid most consumer products the worst case scenario of tariffs weighing on consumer spending has not played out this confluence of favorable conditions is coming through in the data the bloomberg consumer comfort index which assesses financial capacity for purchases has shown solid improvement across income levels favorable circumstances do not mean that every consumer is in perfect shape the record setting stock market does not benefit everyone the federal reserve estimates that only 52 of americans own equities directly or through a retirement portfolio so many of the gains of the recent bull market have not accrued to workers stock holders are often wealthier americans with a lower propensity to spend their higher income or retirement savers who will not spend their short term gains wealth effects from strong equity markets have been modest during the past decade consumers are earning more but also saving more over the past two years the national saving rate has climbed from 6 5 to nearly 8 in the event of a downturn this high savings rate may provide a cushion to consumers who saved but consumers have a long way to go toward building nest eggs the fed estimates that 48 of americans lack retirement savings accounts as these workers grow older their spending will contract and in both cases these averages hide an income disparity 89 of households in the bottom income quintile have no retirement savings while 40 of consumers do not have the liquidity to afford an unplanned 400 expense consumers and lenders have handled debt judiciously in this cycle good employment and low interest rates have allowed consumer debt to grow sensibly transunion reports 197 million consumers are carrying a total debt load of 13 8 trillion throughout the recovery debt balances have grown in every sector except home equity lending however this growth has come in the context of steady economic gains household debt service ratios a measure of debt obligations relative to disposable income have held steady at or below 10 since 2012 falling from a high of over 13 entering the financial crisis in 2007 we have seen a modest uptick in credit card and auto loan delinquencies but these come from a low base and are not yet considered threatening there are risks to continued gains in u s consumption if turmoil in the middle east escalates into an armed conflict energy prices will rise consumers may not feel small fluctuations in headline inflation rates but higher gasoline prices immediately weigh on spending decisions and while labor markets have been resilient job openings and weekly hours worked are starting to fall especially in goods producing sectors which can presage layoffs but the presence of additional savings should provide a buffer against consumer collapse two weeks into the new year it s easy to feel optimistic year end bonuses and tax refunds should help balance our checkbooks and renewed trips to the gym should offset our holiday consumption of food and drink more broadly the behavior of u s consumers seems better balanced than it has been in the past which should bode well for economic growth back against the wall amid a surge in global populism setting sound policy is getting harder no one knows this better than french president emmanuel macron protests across france that began with the yellow vest movement pushing back on increased fuel taxes have evolved into a broader stance against the government s economic policies a proposed overhaul of the country s pension system only added fuel to the fire france has a generous pension system when compared to its european and other advanced counterparts the french government acts as a source of funds and as the overseer and guarantor of the pension system through france has raised the official retirement age from 60 to 62 in the past decade it remains one of the lowest in europe moreover french workers in professions such as train engineers are able to retire much earlier in some cases from the age of 55 an average age for retirement in france is 60 compared to an average of 63 for europe and 64 across all organization for economic co operation development oecd nations in the u k the retirement age for state pensioners is 65 expected to increase to 67 by 2028 under the reform plan the government intended to raise the full benefit retirement age to 64 from 62 the plan would consolidate the current system of 42 different pension regimes each tailored to match different professions in both the public and private sectors with a universal points based system under which all workers would have the same rights workers would accumulate points and cash them in at retirement in the form of pension benefits the outline is intended to bring to an end to the system whereby workers get pension benefits based on the salaries of their best working years the system of multiple schemes with different rules not only undermines labor mobility but also creates inequities in the wake of several weeks of strikes and demonstrations disrupting the economy the government has walked back some of its proposals including the proposed age limit it also offered concessions to individual professions including the police dancers at the paris opera nurses flight attendants and airline pilots by moving back to their tailored retirement structure despite this the protests have continued to rock the french capital as the unions demand withdrawal of the entire reform plan the current benefits come at a steep cost for the state the mandatory pension system consumes 14 of gross domestic product in france the third highest share in europe after greece and italy and well above the 8 oecd average in retirement the french receive from the state an average of 74 of pre retirement earnings compared with an oecd average of 59 thanks to higher life expectancies 80 for men 86 for women citizens are spending about a quarter of a century in their wingchairs 22 7 years for men 26 9 for women up from 13 years in 1970 adding to the burden france like the rest of europe is facing challenges on multiple fronts populations are growing older and pension shortfalls are rising according to a report commissioned by prime minister édouard philippe the country s pension deficit could rise to a high of 17 2 billion by 2025 under the existing system the french government s proposed move to a single pension system was a step in the right direction that could improve transparency foster labor mobility lower management costs and most importantly ensure the financial sustainability of the system retirement ages have not kept pace with life expectancy adding to the pension burden good pension systems should not only bring good benefits but also be sustainable an unsustainable system threatens economic prosperity and stability by creating an excessive burden for governments and taxpayers modest reforms today will allow france s future retirees to live out their lives in comfort and keep them off of the streets conflagration carl offers thoughts on the wildfires raging in australia my first visit to australia was 25 years ago i had been invited to teach at a conference in the blue mountains a verdant area west of sydney i will never forget the charming towns of leura and katoomba and the scent of eucalyptus that filled the air sadly a different scent has been filling the air in katoomba this summer bush fires have been bearing down on the blue mountains producing a haze of smoke that has deterred visitors from coming while katoomba is at low risk for fire other communities across australia have not been so lucky as of this writing almost 18 million acres across the country have burned an area eight times larger than the area covered by california s devastating fires of two years ago weeks of hot summer weather lie ahead climate change has been identified as one of the root causes of the disaster average temperatures in australia have been rising steadily during the past generation and vast tracts of the country have struggled with drought throw in this year s strong winds and you have a recipe for disaster direct damage to property from the blazes could exceed au 1 billion and could grow to make this year s fires the most expensive in australian history the economic impact is likely to result in an interest rate cut from the reserve bank of australia and a reconstruction program from the australian government as we wrote late last year australia could use some fiscal stimulus but we certainly wouldn t have wished for a disaster to bring it about the costs of climate change are on display in australia as insurers tally their losses they will reprice their policies this will certainly have an impact on the locus of population and the level of economic activity in australia in this manner the long term costs of climate change are brought forward which may force the kind of environmental reckoning that some think is long overdue if there is a silver lining behind the smoke clouds currently obscuring australia s visibility it is that the disaster may allow policy makers to see climate risks more clearly

article to print this article all you need is to be registered or login on mondaq com this dentons client alert was originally published as an article by gary goodman and alice yurke in volume 34 no 1 january february 2020 of the american bar association s probate property magazine in july 2017 andrew bailey chief executive officer of the uk financial conduct authority fca announced that the fca would no longer require panel banks to make london inter bank offered rate libor submissions after the end of 2021 since the early 1980s libor and other interbank offered rates have acted as the reference rates for trillions of dollars in real estate secured and other loans bonds and securitizations and deposits and derivatives notional this article provides an overview of libor s historical importance in the financial markets and describes certain challenges in transitioning to a new risk free rate a brief history of libor libor was developed and launched in the mid 1980s by the british bankers association it is used by the real estate industry as the index rate in many floating rate loans libor is derived from submissions by panel banks and represents the rate at which those banks could borrow funds in various currencies and tenors from other banks in london in practice libor submissions have proven to be subject to manipulation and tampering as evidenced by the rate rigging scandal that came to light in 2012 administration of libor was shifted to the ice intercontinental exchange benchmark administration iba in 2014 libor today libor is currently produced on a daily basis in five currencies us dollar euro british pound sterling japanese yen and swiss franc sixteen major money center banks are on the panel that contribute rates to usd libor the banks are based in various jurisdictions and all have operations in london libor is calculated in various tenors and maturity rates including overnight one week one month two months three months six months and 12 months iba has taken significant steps to improve the production of libor by establishing oversight surveillance and validation procedures designed to reduce the possibility of manipulation advantages of libor libor is forward looking and is designed to predict a bank s actual cost of funds over a given time period in the future corresponding to the relevant tenor if libor is accurate then a bank can reasonably price loans on a forward basis by simply adding a margin reflecting the bank s cost of operations and profit margin as well as borrower risk libor as an index also gives the borrower certainty of payment for example in a loan with six month libor as an index the rate will reset every six months and the borrower will know its exact cost for the upcoming period in contrast if the borrower s rate is based on an overnight index its borrowing cost is far less certain disadvantages of libor panel banks have an understandable reluctance to contribute rates to support libor given the risk of future liability based on claims of manipulation notwithstanding improved internal controls and procedures after the credit crisis the actual reliance by banks on the interbank lending market for funding operations has declined substantially as a result current submissions by panel banks are to a large extent based on expert judgment or estimates of the rates the submitting banks would be charged rather than actual or comparable transactions libor therefore suffers both from reputational concerns and from an absence of robust underlying market data and is disfavored by policy makers iosco principles in july 2013 the international organization of securities commissions iosco issued its principles for financial benchmarks principles following on the libor rate rigging scandal the benchmarks discussed in the principles are prices estimates rates indices or values that are 1 made available to users whether free of charge or for payment 2 calculated periodically entirely or partially by the application of a formula or another method of calculation to or an assessment of the value of one or more underlying interests and 3 used for reference reference purposes include one or more of the following a determining the interest payable or other sums due under loan agreements or under other financial con tracts or instruments b determining the price at which a financial instrument may be bought sold traded or redeemed or the value of a financial instrument or c measuring the performance of a financial instrument the principles are designed to address conflicts of interest promote internal controls and improve governance and oversight principle 6 indicates that benchmark design should consider the relative size of the underlying market in relation to the volume of trading in the market that references the benchmark principle 7 recommends that a benchmark be based on prices rates indices or values that have been formed by the competitive forces of supply and demand and anchored by observable transactions entered into at arm s length between buyers and sellers in the market principle 8 provides a hierarchy for data inputs ranking a submitter s own concluded arms length transactions first and expert judgment last policymakers and industry participants in various countries including the united states have been working towards the development of new benchmarks that follow the iosco principles the fca the fca is the regulator that has the power to direct panel banks to continue to submit rates to iba to help generate libor inasmuch as the rate submission activity takes place in london in july 2017 fca chief executive officer andrew bailey asserted that the absence of active underlying markets raises a serious question about the sustainability of libor benchmarks that are based upon these markets 1 this statement prompted the fca to take the position that panel banks would no longer be compelled or encouraged by the fca to submit rates in support of libor effective at the end of 2021 notwithstanding recognized improvements in the production of libor the fca s determination is based on the absence of an active substantial underlying market in inter bank unsecured lending see iosco principle 6 this announcement does not mean that libor will definitely cease to be produced at the end of 2021 continued libor after 2021 however would be dependent on the willingness of a sufficient number of panel banks to voluntarily continue to submit bids a visualization of financial stability and libor arrc implementation plan in november 2014 the alternative reference rates committee arrc was convened by the federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york ny fed to consider new us dollar risk free reference rates arrc members include a number of major banks and industry groups and arrc obtains input and participation from a broad range of market participants and us regulators in june 2017 arrc announced it had selected the secured overnight financing rate sofr as the preferred alternative us dollar risk free reference rate and as its preferred alternative to usd libor in march 2018 arrc published the second report its most authoritative and comprehensive publication to date regarding the transition away from libor arrc s second report outlines its paced transition plan which would result in a forward sofr curve from which term sofr rates could be derived the timeline contemplates the following completion dates end of 2018 trading begins in futures and uncleared swaps referencing sofr 2019 ql trading begins in cleared swaps that reference sofr end of 2021 creation of term sofr reference rate based on sofr derivatives market provided the market has developed enough to provide a robust rate about sofr in the united states sofr is the leading new alternative reference rate under development produced by the board of governors of the ny fed sofr is an overnight rate calculated and published daily based on an average of reported overnight repurchase transactions in us treasury securities captured from several sources that report actual transaction data to the ny fed the sources capture the vast majority of actual transactions of this type the ny fed commenced publication of sofr in april 2018 sofr meets the iosco criteria in that the underlying market us treasury repos is extremely broad and robust and there is very substantial actual reported transaction data available based on market transactions sofr attributes sofr underlying data are not limited to bank to bank lending but rather are based on transactions among participants in the broad us treasury repo market which may be banks broker dealers insurance companies pension funds private equity funds corporations and others the data submitted to the ny fed are almost all based on overnight transactions and do not contain data from which term rates could be derived for sofr to be used as a lending rate to replace libor term rates must be derived from sofr sofr is essentially a risk free rate because the underlying transactions are fully secured by high quality liquid collateral in contrast libor is an unsecured borrowing rate and includes a component that reflects the borrowing bank s creditworthiness especially as to longer tenors unlike libor sofr is a backward looking rate because of these differences sofr can be expected to perform differently from libor sofr futures trading in may 2018 cme group inc cme launched quarterly and monthly sofr futures contracts listed by cme and available for trading by cme clients the quarterly contract references daily compound sofr over a future three month reference period the reference periods end in march june september and december and are available up to five years out the monthly contract references average sofr over a calendar month and these contracts are available up to seven months out it has recently been reported that there are now over 130 participants in the cme sofr futures contract market with average daily trading volume running in the range of 68 billion notional and open interest at 479 billion notional trading volume could be expected to increase significantly to the extent that market participants begin to incur financial obligations linked to sofr and therefore require sofr futures contracts for hedging purposes at this time it is not clear whether trading in sofr futures will be robust enough to produce forward sofr term reference rates that would meet iosco standards money talks transition risks sofr appears to be a very high quality well designed reference rate for new transactions but as an index to replace libor in existing contracts without causing material economic gain or loss to either party sofr has issues sofr is a risk free rate it is unknown whether a market convention will develop to add a spread to sofr to reflect the bank credit risk embedded in libor sofr is an overnight rate only it is not known for certain that a term sofr curve based on derivative trades will develop and will be accepted as a market convention even if a term sofr curve develops under the arrc timeline this will not be completed until the end of 2021 just when libor would be phasing out leaving no margin for error if there is a delay will there be a term sofr the structured finance association and other industry groups have advocated that for the cash markets including floating rate loans there should be a true forward looking term sofr derived from overnight sofr forward looking term sofr would predict sofr over a future accrual period based on market transaction inputs and would be available at the beginning of the accrual period it would be comparable to forward term libor minus a credit component however the vast majority of libor based transactions that might convert to sofr are derivatives which reference an overnight index and do not require a forward looking term index for this reason policymakers have discouraged use of a forward term replacement index for derivatives and the international swaps and derivatives association inc isda consultations more fully discussed below do not include a forward term sofr in line with this trend and in light of concerns about the volume of sofr futures trading arrc leadership has indicated that there can be no assurance that a forward looking term sofr will actually develop in advance or in arrears sofr although sofr itself is an overnight rate sofr could be derived over a given accrual period e g 30 or 90 days through a number of approaches in advance means that the sofr for a given accrual period is calculated at the start of the period but is based on overnight sofr over the period ending on or about the start of the period in other words the observation period is the period before the accrual period for example if the accrual period is fourth quarter 2019 the rate is determined at the start of the accrual period but is based on actual overnight sofr over third quarter 2019 thus the in advance approach is based on backward looking or stale information but has the benefit of being known at the start of the accrual period in arrears means sofr for a given accrual period is calculated at the end of the period based on overnight sofr over the accrual period in other words the observation period is the same as the accrual period for example if the accrual period is fourth quarter 2019 the rate is determined at the end of the accrual period based on actual overnight sofr during fourth quarter 2019 the in arrears approach is based on actual rate information during the accrual period but has the disadvantage of not being known at the start of the accrual period when using the in arrears approach the observation period may be pushed back by a few days so that the rate can be calculated a few days before the end of the accrual period the in arrears approach is favored by isda and may be suitable for corporate debt but is viewed as inappropriate for consumer debt compounded or average sofr compounded means that the daily overnight sofr rate is compounded on a daily basis over the observation period this results in a slightly higher rate for the observation period because of the effects of compounding and is thought to at least to some extent convert sofr from an overnight rate to a term rate the overwhelming majority of derivatives market participants favor the compounded in arrears approach which fits in well for overnight indexed swaps over a fixed contractual time period however market participants in the cash markets have indicated that the calculations for compounding could prove burdensome for those markets an alternative to compounding would be to average overnight sofr over the relevant observation period and add a margin to adjust the average overnight rate to a term rate in the capital markets a number of corporate debt issuances that reference sofr have been made generally these transactions use averaging not compounding in arrears spread adjustment because overnight sofr is a risk free rate in contrast to all tenors of libor which include a bank credit component when using sofr as a replacement for libor it may be desirable to add a spread adjustment in order to minimize any value transfer minimization of value transfer at the time of conversion is deemed desirable in order to avoid gains and losses which may create tax and accounting issues for all parties the spread adjustment would add on a factor to account for bank credit risk over the relevant accrual period the spread adjustment also would take into account the difference in tenor between the tenor of libor being replaced and the form of sofr being applied this difference is greatest with overnight sofr and least with forward looking term sofr spread adjustment is not dynamic it is a fixed amount that minimizes value transfer at the point of benchmark replacement isda consultations isda is planning to amend its 2006 definitions so that its floating rate options provide new fallbacks that would replace libor and other inter bank offered rates ibors produced in other jurisdictions in the event of a permanent discontinuation of libor isda published a multi jurisdictional consultation in july 2018 for comment on proposed fallbacks for various ibors the 2018 isda consultation under the 2018 isda consultation the fallbacks for each relevant ibor would be triggered on the occurrence of a public statement by the ibor administrator that it will cease publication of the benchmark a public statement by the regulatory supervisor of the administrator or other authorities with jurisdiction over the administrator that the benchmark will cease to be provided in each case the effective date of the conversion to the fallback will be the actual date of discontinuance of the relevant libor the 2018 isda consultation requested comment on proposed fallbacks including spot overnight reference rate and convexity adjusted overnight rate compounded setting in arrears compounded setting in advance the 2018 isda consultation also introduced three concepts for a spread adjustment forward approach at the time of ibor cessation on a one time basis a forward spread curve would be generated based on observed market prices for the forward spread between the relevant ibor and the replacement reference rate this fixed curve would be used to determine the spread adjustment on each future date at the time of ibor cessation on a one time basis a forward spread curve would be generated based on observed market prices for the forward spread between the relevant ibor and the replacement reference rate this fixed curve would be used to determine the spread adjustment on each future date historic mean median approach the spread adjustment would be a single number that would be the historic mean or median spot spread between the relevant ibor and the replacement reference rate over a five or 10 year lookback period from the time of ibor cessation there would be a one year phase in from the current spot spread to the historical spread the spread adjustment would be a single number that would be the historic mean or median spot spread between the relevant ibor and the replacement reference rate over a five or 10 year lookback period from the time of ibor cessation there would be a one year phase in from the current spot spread to the historical spread spot spread approach the spread adjustment would be simply the spot spread between the relevant ibor and the replacement reference rate at the time of conversion or over a brief period isda announced its summary of responses in december 2018 which revealed among other things that the majority of derivatives market participants preferred a compounded setting in arrears with historic mean median approach separately in may 2019 isda published 1 the supplemental consultation on spread and term adjustments for fallbacks in derivatives referencing usd libor cdor and hibor and certain aspects of fallbacks for derivatives referencing sor and 2 the consultation on pre cessation issues for libor and certain other inter bank offered rates ibors collectively the 2019 isda consultations which sought market input on addressing certain issues that will apply to alternative risk free rates and pre cessation issues respectively arrc consultations in late 2018 arrc working groups published separate consultations for fallback contract language for new cash products including bilateral business loans syndicated business loans floating rate notes notes offered and sold to investors and securitizations the arrc consultations are informed by the 2018 isda consultation which preceded them but they seek to develop alternative approaches where warranted that reflect the needs of market participants in cash products these consultations do not address transitioning away from libor for legacy assets which will be addressed separately under the consultations relevant governmental body means the board of governors of the federal reserve board the federal reserve board the ny fed or a committee established by the federal reserve board or the ny fed such as the arrc arrc consultation syndicated business loans this consultation was published september 2018 with final recommendations published april 2019 this consultation provides two alternatives amendment approach establishes protocols for amending loan documents to transition from libor but does not specify the replacement rate this acknowledges that much remains unknown today about the replacement benchmarks and may be preferred for large balance loans establishes protocols for amending loan documents to transition from libor but does not specify the replacement rate this acknowledges that much remains unknown today about the replacement benchmarks and may be preferred for large balance loans hardwired approach sets a prescribed waterfall for the replacement rate this approach may be preferred for administrative ease with portfolios with large numbers of loans also the isda consultations and the arrc floating rate note and securitization consultation use only the hardwired approach transition to a replacement rate would be triggered by cessation triggers the same trigger events as under the isda consultations authoritative public statements that libor publication will cease which triggers are effective upon actual cessation pre cessation triggers a public statement by the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of libor announcing that libor is no longer representative which statement can be effective prior to the actual cessation of libor additional early opt in trigger events are provided separately for each of the amendment approaches loans in the market are replacing libor and the hardwired approach other syndicated loans are priced over term sofr amendment approach the replacement reference rate would be an alternative benchmark agreed on between a borrower and an administrative agent giving due consideration to the recommendation by a relevant governmental body rgb or market convention spread adjustment would be as agreed between a borrower and an administrative agent giving due consideration to the recommendation by an rgb or market convention the approval mechanism would generally be negative consent by a simple majority of lenders or affirmative consent by a simple majority of lenders for the early opt in triggers hardwired approach the replacement benchmark would be determined under a waterfall whichever is first available term sofr corresponding tenor of libor tenor being replaced next available term sofr next shorter tenor compounded sofr or alternatively simple average sofr which in either case may be in arrears with a lookback period based on conventions as recommended by an rgb or as observed in the market as agreed between a borrower and an administrative agent giving due consideration to the recommendation by an rgb or market convention spread adjustment would be determined under a waterfall whichever is first available as recommended by relevant governmental body as selected by isda if no form of sofr as listed above is available then as agreed between a borrower and an administrative agent giving due consideration to the recommendation by an rgb or market convention approval mechanism no amendment is needed unless the following occur if none of the sofr waterfall steps is available then negative consent by a simple majority of lenders if additional triggers are applied then affirmative consent by a simple majority of lenders arrc consultation bilateral business loans this consultation published december 2018 also provides amendment and hardwired alternatives the main differences from the syndicated business loan consultation as published september 2018 are that references to an administrative agent and the required lenders instead are to the lender under the amendment approach alternatives are provided whereby the lender can select the replacement reference rate and spread adjustment subject to negative consent of the borrower under the hardwired approach waterfall step 3 overnight sofr is omitted in light of isda s announced preference for compounded sofr if no form of sofr is available then the lender selects the replacement reference rate and determines the spread adjustment no amendment is needed unless no form of sofr is available in which case the negative consent by the borrower is required usd ice bank yield index before 2019 there were some indications that iba might endeavor to continue publication of libor following 2021 with further enhancements and improvements in january 2019 iba published for comment a report introducing a new benchmark the usd ice bank yield index byi the proposal expressly acknowledges that libor faces an uncertain future indicates that overnight risk free rates such as sofr are in most instances well suited to the derivatives market observes that lenders borrowers and other cash market participants generally prefer a forward looking term reference rate that represents average unsecured funding costs of a group of large banks the byi is based entirely on actual arms length transactions representing senior unsecured and uninsured usd borrowing costs of a group of large banks the transactions include primary wholesale market funding transactions including interbank deposits institutional cds and commercial paper with data sourced directly from a group of large international banks including most of the usd libor panel banks on a daily basis minimum transaction size us 10 million secondary market bond transactions as reported on the trade reporting and compliance engine of the financial industry regulatory authority in bonds of a larger group of internationally active banks minimum transaction size us 2 million the byi methodology gathers data on transactions of varying maturities up to approximately one year and buckets them into maturity ranges the methodology targets at least ten transactions per maturity range the transaction data are then used to generate a yield curve from which one month three month and six month rates would be plotted and published the curve plotting aspect of the byi methodology means that transactional inputs with a wide range of maturities are incorporated into the analysis not just transactions with maturities corresponding to the publication tenors iba tested the byi over a 12 month period beginning january 2018 and found that the index was based on an average of 153 transaction inputs per day with the majority being bond transactions the transaction target was met on each day of the testing period for the maturity ranges corresponding to one month three months and six months the resulting byi generally correlated closely with reported libor over the testing period with some exceptions in october 2019 iba published an updated methodology based on a rolling five day average of unsecured bank funding and bond transaction yields iba has indicated that it is planning to further refine the byi methodology and to publish further modeling and testing results iba currently plans to launch the byi in first quarter 2020 iba cautions there is no guarantee it will launch the byi however and advises that market participants currently using libor should not rely on the availability of the byi byi observations based on the minimum transaction size and average number of daily inputs during the testing period assuming the average transaction size is not more than twice the minimum transaction size it appears that a very rough estimate of the average daily volume of transactional inputs for the byi is in the range of us 1 to 2 billion this is a rough guess not provided by iba this would be a much less robust data set than underlies sofr us 754 billion or even the overnight bank funding rate us 197 billion it is unclear whether the byi will ultimately be viewed as iosco compliant or what the consequences of not being iosco compliant would be in terms of using this index on the positive side the byi is based only on market transactions not expert judgment and captures a market based indication of large bank funding costs including a bank credit component on a forward term basis with reported tenors that would match the most widely used usd libor tenors to the extent a requirement for a libor replacement is that it be a successor index based on comparable information the byi is arguably more comparable to libor than is sofr to the extent it can be confirmed that the byi with any further refinements correlates closely to libor then replacing libor with the byi in any cash asset or contract would be close to value neutral over its remaining term in contrast spread adjustments applied to sofr are designed to be value neutral on the date of substitution only and being static are not designed to assure correlation to libor at any future date additional risks basis risk given that the derivatives and cash markets may be subject to different approaches swaps used to hedge cash exposures may convert differently than the cash exposures themselves resulting in an imperfect hedge tax risks replacing libor in any asset with a new benchmark may be a modification resulting in a tax recognition event and other tax risks including cancellation of debt income and loss of grandfathered status under the foreign account tax compliance act such modifications could also affect a securitization entity by impairing grantor trust or remic status in october 2019 the us treasury and the irs published proposed regulations that are designed to minimize the tax consequences from a benchmark transition accounting risks under hedge accounting a hedge must be designated and documented at inception changes in a hedge may result in de designation isda and the financial accounting standards board are working on this issue commercial real estate floating rate loans historically such loans have included provisions to the effect that if libor is unavailable the index will convert to prime if such a provision were triggered borrower and lender would likely want to renegotiate a replacement index new production loans typically have additional provisions for replacing libor with an alternative rate a replacement would be triggered if the lender determines there will be a replacement for libor because of the actual or potential phase out of libor the replacement alternative rate would be based on the index generally used by us lenders as a replacement for libor on floating rate commercial mortgage loans as determined by the lender in good faith in many cases the above determinations are made solely by the lender although this may vary from deal to deal there would not necessarily be a spread adjustment new production loans are not yet including language similar to the hardwired approach under the arrc bilateral business loan consultation legacy real estate assets for certain asset types there is less risk of conversion from libor to another index because of for example replacement protocols being developed for that asset type assets being shorter term and burning off before 2022 or assets of a bilateral nature that can be readily amended for other asset types there is more concern about conversion away from libor in particular us libor indexed residential mortgage loans such loans typically reference libor as published at a specific location and may state that if libor as so published is no longer available the substitute index will be based on comparable information such loans typically reference libor as published at a specific location and may state that if libor as so published is no longer available the substitute index will be based on comparable information us libor indexed student loans such loans typically provide that if libor is no longer available the lender or holder will choose a comparable index at this time it is by no means clear that sofr would be appropriately viewed as comparable to libor or whether a margin could be added to the sofr rate to reflect equivalency with the bank credit risk embedded in libor for any legacy asset that is amended to replace libor with an alternative index there will be a concern whether the amendment constitutes a significant modification that could trigger gain or loss recognition for accounting and tax purposes conclusion key questions for the future efforts to create new risk free rates based on extremely robust market data are laudable market participants should plan to transition away from libor because its continuance cannot be assumed key questions that market participants face include the following will there be a forward looking term sofr as a fallback what other form of sofr would be acceptable in the cash markets compounded vs average in advance vs in arrears will there be authoritative guidance on spread adjustments how best to contingency plan for the absence of authoritative guidance on spread adjustments for new contracts should the amendment approach or hardwired approach be used will the usd ice byi be launched and become accepted as a replacement for libor will another alternative replacement for libor emerge what can be done to mitigate risk on legacy

in an april 26 plebiscite on whether to rewrite the constitution to better address economic and social disparities the plebiscite was proposed after massive protests broke out in mid october against a hike in subway fares in the capital santiago and quickly spread throughout the country fueled by anger at chile s inability to distribute the country s wealth which is leading to growing inequality it remains to be seen whether the april poll will satisfy chilean protesters but one good sign is that the plebiscite addresses what many experts believe is latin america s biggest concern inequality it

political scientist marcelo arequipa without a doubt bolivia s political electoral horizon seems uncertain especially since the right insists on a fragmented roster of potential presidential candidates said arequipa the problem that plagues the right center right and hard right he said is the lack of consensus around a unifying candidate which means those parties will be disputing 60 percent of the votes while the remaining 40 percent will go to the ruling movement towards socialism mas party to win a candidate must garner more than 50 percent of the vote or more than 40 percent

introduction and summary every year millions of americans benefit from employee ownership and broad based profit sharing plans that ensure workers receive a share of the wealth that they help create these programs which reward workers based on a company s collective performance rather than workers individual performance help raise wages and boost wealth among american workers moreover research shows that broad based sharing programs support the long term stability and profitability of local businesses and even do a better job boosting firm level productivity than does performance pay for individual workers this site is protected by recaptcha and the google privacy policy and terms of service apply as a result of these benefits city and state policymakers across ideological divides including the conservative strongholds of iowa and nebraska and the progressive bastions of berkeley california and newark new jersey are increasingly adopting policies to support and expand the use of employee ownership and broad based profit sharing 1 yet too few jurisdictions are taking advantage of such programs cities and states could do much more to advance the use of all types of profit sharing plans which help ensure that workers are able to prosper in the 21st century despite working in an expanding economy with low levels of unemployment americans wages are only slowly inching up 2 according to a 2018 report from the economic policy institute labor income for the bottom 90 percent of americans as a share of all market based income shrunk by 11 percentage points between 1979 and 2015 3 moreover the wealth of everyday americans is shrinking while racial wealth disparities are increasing the average wealth level for the bottom half of american households was approximately 20 500 in early 2019 about half of what working class families were able to save 20 years earlier 4 in addition the wealth gap between white households and african american and latino households has only increased since the great recession 5 at the same time large corporations are too often focused on short term profits rather than long term investments and increasingly share profits only with corporate executives and top talent moreover an ongoing wave of retirements among baby boomer business owners could lead to the sale or shuttering of local businesses that employ millions of american workers 6 employee ownership and broad based profit sharing granting workers ownership stakes in the company or a share of its profits based on workers collective performance promise to help alleviate a number of these problems these plans include everything from profit sharing and stock options that are sufficiently broad based to employee stock ownership plans employee ownership trusts and worker cooperatives studies that compare workers enrolled in broad based sharing programs with workers in similar companies without sharing programs find that participating employees including those who are african american latino or working class experience higher wages and wealth 7 businesses that offer such programs are more likely to have other types of retirement plans as well 8 research also shows that firms and investors receive tangible benefits from sharing with their workers and by selling to their workers retiring business owners can preserve local jobs and the legacies of their companies 9 yet today far too few workers receive significant benefits from employee ownership and broad based profit sharing while the federal government has adopted a number of policies to support sharing programs such as tax advantages for companies and owners interested in selling to their employees policymakers at all levels of government can take further action to ensure that more workers are able participate in these sorts of programs this report seeks to increase knowledge among state and local lawmakers on the benefits of broad based profit sharing review existing policies that state and local leaders are using to expand the use of these programs and recommend innovative reforms that can help cities and states go even further specifically state and local policymakers should establish an office of employee ownership and broad based profit sharing to provide outreach and technical assistance to private sector businesses and workers and serve to improve government knowledge and support for all types of broad based sharing ensure employee owned firms can access existing government loan programs and use public funding to help facilitate ownership conversions evaluate government contractors on whether they provide good jobs and encourage them to share ownership and profits with their workers require government supported tech startups to share equity profits or ownership with their workers by adopting these sorts of reforms policymakers can help expand the use of employee ownership and broad based profit sharing increase the well being of working families and support strong local economies ways to share private sector companies have adopted a variety of programs to share profits with their workers ranging from employee stock ownership plans and worker cooperatives which allow workers an ownership stake in the company to cash based profit and gain sharing programs which pay workers a portion of the capital related income they helped generate but do not grant ownership all of these plans compensate a broad base of workers not just top executives on the basis of group performance rather than individual performance while some programs fundamentally change workers relationships with their employers and provide significant capital payments others have fairly modest effects on workers what follows is an overview of the various types of ownership and broad based profit sharing plans that companies currently practice in the united states 10 worker cooperatives co ops are typically started by ideologically affiliated workers and are owned and democratically controlled by their member owners co op members elect their board of directors co ops pay taxes on income kept within the co op for investment and reserves but not on any surplus revenues that are returned to individual members who pay taxes on that income employee stock ownership plans esops esops are tax qualified employee benefit plans that typically offer workers an ownership stake in a company without having to spend their own money to purchase stock esop companies set up a trust fund into which they contribute new shares of their stock or cash to purchase existing shares workers receive their stock when they retire or leave the company and the company must buy the stock back at its fair market value unless the worker is able to sell it in the public market the esop trust may also borrow money to buy shares with the company making payments to the trust in order to repay the loan private companies often use leveraged esops to buy out company founders and other shareholders 401 k plans with ownership of company stock with these retirement plans workers and companies make pretax contributions from their pay to buy company stock or the company gives employees company stock as a match to employee contributions as 401 k s have become the primary retirement vehicle for many workers the federal government has increasingly scrutinized 401 k s with investments in employer stock and made a number of changes to regulations in order to encourage investment diversity employee ownership trusts eots employers transfer stock to a perpetual trust that is administered on behalf of all current and future employees participants typically receive a percentage of profits annually as a cash payment eots are rare in the united states and do not enjoy tax advantaged status however employee ownership advocates are increasingly promoting their expansion due to the relatively low cost of establishing the plans flexible plan designs and the trust s ability to maintain shared ownership of the company in perpetuity 11 employee stock purchase plans employers subsidize the purchase of company stocks outside of a retirement plan typically offering workers stock at a 10 percent to 15 percent discount usually over an offering period that ranges from three months to as many as 27 months enrolled employees buy company shares with after tax contributions deducted from their paychecks stock options restricted stock phantom stock and stock appreciation rights in these hybrid programs benefits are tied to either the value of shares as in restricted stock and phantom stock or to increases in stock prices as with stock options and stock appreciation rights workers may or may not ever actually own shares except for a very short period once the awards are exercised profit sharing when the firm makes money employees are paid a share of the profits payments can be offered either in cash such as annual cash bonuses or employer contributions of company stock profit sharing becomes employee ownership when profits are received in the form of stock contributions can be made to deferred plans that are placed in individual tax qualified retirement accounts where earnings accrue tax free until withdrawal gain sharing workers receive payments based on the performance of their unit rather than the entire company performance is typically measured as productivity or cost savings payments are typically made in cash employee ownership and profit sharing can raise standards for everyone a growing body of research indicates that providing workers with a stake in firm performance when coupled with good pay and benefits and a voice on the job leads to good results for the firm its shareholders its workers and the economy at large research finds that these programs often empower workers by increasing their participation in decision making and trust in the company and management they are also associated with higher pay and benefits as well as greater long term wealth accumulation 12 benefits for workers studies measuring the benefits of various types of broad based sharing programs find that workers wages are significantly higher when compared with those of workers in similar companies without sharing programs employees are also up to five times more likely to have another retirement plan and a recent study also finds that workers participating in an esop hold more than twice the average total retirement balance of americans nationally 13 moreover workers participating in these programs are far more likely to have other types of benefits that are increasingly essential including paid maternity and paternity leave tuition reimbursement flexible work scheduling and even company provided or subsidized child care 14 employee ownership does not replace other types of wealth research finds that it results in a substantial net gain in wealth 15 one study of companies in finland also found that even when firms with profit sharing plans struggle either by experiencing losses or decreases in profitability companies do not respond by lowering workers wages 16 these results demonstrate the potential of these programs to help stem the tide of income stagnation and rising wealth inequality and ensure that middle and working class american families see the benefits of economic growth employee ownership and broad based profit sharing programs also promise to help boost the incomes and wealth of women and people of color who continue to be paid significantly less than comparable men and white workers and as a result have difficulty accumulating wealth for example in 2018 women in the united states earned 85 percent of what men earned 17 and a 2017 study from the center for american progress found that african americans hold approximately one tenth of the wealth of white americans 18 while the effects of employee ownership on women and people of color merit far more study emerging research is beginning to demonstrate that participating in such a program leads to both earnings and wealth increases for example a 2017 study from the national center for employee ownership using data from a sample of more than 5 500 respondents found that workers of color who participate in an esop compared with those who do not earn 30 percent more in wages hold nearly 80 percent more in net household wealth and have a median tenure at their current job that is 36 percent longer 19 the study also found that single women participating in an esop earned wages that were 24 percent higher than the wages of those with no ownership benefits and held 51 percent more in net household wealth 20 similarly a 2019 institute for the study of employee ownership and profit sharing qualitative study which included detailed interviews with 92 low to moderate income esop participants found that african american study participants held three times more wealth in their esop and 401 k than the overall median wealth for african american households in the united states moreover latino study participants held 12 times more in retirements savings than the median wealth level for latino households in the united states 21 benefits for employers and the greater economy business owners also benefit when workers share in a firm s profits research shows that sharing programs are associated with greater worker loyalty and effort lower turnover rates and absenteeism and a greater willingness on the part of workers to put in longer hours and suggest innovations 22 for example a 2015 study found that workers in companies with higher levels of reliance on broad based incentive pay reported higher levels of information sharing trust in supervisors and improved workplace culture the same study found that combining group incentive pay with policies that increase information sharing with workers and allow them greater participation in decision making in turn reduced turnover and increased firms return on equity sharing 23 moreover employee ownership and profit sharing are often associated with increased productivity profitability and likelihood of the company s survival companies and investors that adopt partnership approaches make profits that are greater than the cost of sharing ownership with employees according to a review of more than 70 empirical studies 24 a recent study also found that group incentive pay and particularly incentive pay based on firm profitability is more effective at boosting enterprise level productivity than incentive pay based on individual performance pay 25 research shows that both public and private companies with broad based sharing plans are less likely than their counterparts without employee ownership to go bankrupt or disappear for another reason 26 indeed a study reviewing companies during a time period that included the 2001 and 2008 recessions concluded that publicly traded employee owned firms exhibit greater employment stability in the face of economy wide and firm specific negative shocks 27 the government also benefits from greater employment stability in employee ownership firms recent analyses of the general social survey have found that employees of firms that did not offer an employee ownership program were six to seven times more likely than employees with some form of stock ownership to have been laid off in the previous year 28 a lower layoff rate likely results in billions of dollars in savings for the government since it does not have to bear the costs associated with supporting unemployed workers 29 by reducing layoffs employee ownership may play a role in decreasing the economic social and personal costs of unemployment and help stabilize the economy when it is under recessionary pressures disparities in access to profit sharing and employee ownership plans unfortunately while many american workers receive some form of profit sharing compensation the benefits do not provide a meaningful source of income or wealth to average workers at most companies with these programs and most workers still lack access to broad based sharing programs at all 30 less than half of all u s workers participated in some sort of sharing plan in 2018 according to analysis from rutgers university s school of labor and management relations about 38 percent of workers participated in a profit sharing plan and 30 percent in a gain sharing plan while 20 percent owned company stock and 9 percent held stock options 31 in addition the value of workers plans varied widely while the median value of stock owned by participating workers was 15 000 in 2018 and the average was about 75 000 the median value of profit sharing and gain sharing programs in 2018 was approximately 2 000 with the average value just more than 13 000 32 moreover the benefits of profit sharing are not evenly distributed across the population white workers hold significantly more wealth than people of color through profit sharing and are somewhat more likely to participate in these programs more than 20 percent of white workers participate in sharing programs of any kind holding a median of 12 000 in wealth through sharing programs comparatively just less than 11 percent of latino workers participate in sharing programs holding a median wealth level of less than 10 000 and approximately 17 percent of african american workers participate in sharing programs holding a median wealth level of less than 7 000 33 authors of the study believe that nationwide occupational segregation firms relatively recent move toward greater gender and racial diversity and ongoing barriers to advancement may contribute to these disparities 34 the same pattern is true for workers across the income distribution while nearly one third of high income workers participate in profit sharing plans just 20 percent of middle income workers who earn between nearly 35 000 and 99 000 annually and only 7 percent of low wage workers who earn less than 35 000 annually participate in these programs 35 in order to ensure that these programs benefits are broadly shared state and local policymakers must do more to expand the use of profit sharing as well as think through how to target populations of workers that would benefit the most from sharing programs several cities and states are working to support profit sharing policymakers in several cities and states are expanding government support for profit sharing programs in order to counteract wage stagnation inequality and racial disparities as well as to support local economies while some jurisdictions have supported programs for nearly 40 years to provide outreach and education to area businesses on transitioning to employee ownership interest in and action on these sorts of policies is growing in other areas policymakers focus has expanded to include leveraging tax incentives other sorts of public financing and even the government s role as a purchaser of goods and services to support the growth of profit sharing in the mid 1980s several states funded employee ownership programs with the goal of broadening ownership stabilizing local economies and preventing plant closures 36 although the first esop was founded in 1956 esop conversions did not become more commonplace until after congress enacted the employee retirement income security act the first federal statute to officially recognize esops as well as several tax incentives to encourage companies to convert to an esop in the 1970s and 1980s 37 even so shared ownership structures at the time were still rarely used and poorly understood by the business community the state programs implemented during the 1980s functioned to facilitate word of mouth about the benefits of employee ownership plans as well as new federal tax incentives to encourage their growth the programs also aimed to assist owners converting to an employee ownership structure through preliminary feasibility studies technical training and advice and locating financial assistance help workers and employers adopt an ownership culture and bring together existing employee owned businesses the success of these programs has varied the ohio employee ownership center and the vermont employee ownership center have been particularly successful in increasing awareness of employee stock ownership plans throughout the country and in facilitating company conversions particularly in small privately held firms where owners are facing retirement 38 yet many other state programs were victims of budget cuts or were allowed to sunset for example massachusetts office for employee involvement and ownership closed due to budget cuts during the last recession 39 and while some policymakers and advocates in the 1980s and 1990s hoped to use employee ownership as a tool to rescue failing firms this approach fell out of favor after a handful of failed high profile employee buyouts in struggling industries 40 in the past decade however there has been a resurgence of interest at the state and local government level in these types of programs particularly insofar as they can serve as a tool to ensure that local businesses do not shutter when owners retire and to support good jobs that boost wages and provide a mechanism for wealth acquisition especially among low income residents and residents of color these efforts have typically taken the form of three types of initiatives education outreach and technical assistance on the benefits of employee ownership financial incentives for businesses that transition to employee ownership and offers of special corporate status to businesses that implement an employee ownership or profit sharing plan education outreach and technical assistance a number of reforms expand on vermont and ohio s education and outreach model policymakers and employee ownership advocates in colorado california massachusetts new jersey new york north carolina and pennsylvania as well as the cities of new york newark new jersey madison wisconsin and oakland and berkeley california have all launched efforts in recent years to conduct outreach on the benefits of employee ownership programs 41 for example colorado gov jared polis d signed an executive order in spring 2019 establishing a commission on employee ownership and an employee ownership network the effort promises to provide technical support to businesses that want to convert to an employee owned structure educate businesses and communities on the benefits of becoming employee owned and identify barriers to the expansion of employee ownership 42 in his signing comments and order preamble gov polis emphasized the ability of employee ownership conversions to meet the twin goals of ensuring that workers wages keep up with economic growth and retaining local businesses after owners retirement 43 similarly new york city provides targeted assistance to support the conversion of companies to worker cooperatives with the goal of overcoming economic and social inequality 44 financial incentives in addition to general outreach and education these sorts of programs often subsidize the cost of companies conducting feasibility and transition planning studies other jurisdictions provide even more financial incentives to companies converting to employee ownership for example iowa and missouri have enacted legislation to exempt half of a seller s capital gain from taxation if a company is sold to an esop new jersey debated legislation that would have exempted 100 percent of a seller s gains and many states duplicate federal tax exemptions in ways that are beneficial to esops 45 these state level tax incentives supplement federal tax benefits to both selling owners and the firms themselves indeed there is ongoing debate at the federal level around legislation to further expand the tax benefits of profit sharing for example during her 2016 presidential campaign former u s secretary of state hillary clinton proposed a new tax credit to spur business owners to enact broad based profit sharing plans 46 jurisdictions are also using their power as a purchaser of goods and services to incentivize companies to adopt these sorts of structures for example in cleveland the municipal government the cleveland foundation and the city s universities and hospitals have combined their purchasing power equivalent to nearly 3 billion dollars annually to support community based cooperatives that create high quality green jobs and support economic stability for residents of the surrounding low income communities 47 newark is encouraging businesses to implement some sort of employee ownership program as well the city is initiating a new plan that is combining this function of outreach and education on the benefits of employee ownership with financial assistance in order to support the conversion of companies in partnership with the newark community economic development corporation cedc the city is pairing outreach to retirement age business owners with a public private investment fund to help ensure that companies have the access to the capital they need to sell to their employees and provide incentives to owners interested in exiting a business quickly 48 esop conversions typically require loan payments over several years with esop trusts often providing selling owners with promissory notes to cover at least a portion of the proceeds from a sale in contrast the newark cedc would take on the debt in the transaction allowing business owners to cash out immediately at the sale without this support some of these retiring business owners could choose to either sell to a competitor that moves the jobs elsewhere or shutter the firm special corporate status finally some cities and states have enacted legislation to provide a privileged corporate status to companies that abide by higher standards including sharing profits with their workers at least 36 state legislatures have passed benefit corporation laws that provide certified companies with broad legal protections from shareholder reprisal thereby allowing corporate boards to look beyond short term financial gains and make decisions that consider broader impacts on workers and other community stakeholders as well 49 to become certified companies must report on their overall social and environmental performance including their adoption of profit sharing plans to an independent and transparent third party standard these laws for example protect companies decisions to sell to their workers prioritize service to low income communities or adhere to higher environmental standards over profit maximization indeed cities and states are adopting numerous initiatives to boost income and wealth for area residents supporting the long term economic prosperity of area businesses and creating a new generation of leaders committed to fostering these ideas however cities and states could do more to support the growth of employee ownership and profit sharing programs are frequently too modest in scope reaching a relatively small number of workers and companies or supporting only one type of sharing for example cities and states do little to support the expansion of profit sharing plans in large companies that may reach far more workers moreover cities and states do not do nearly enough to leverage their power as a purchaser of goods and services or incorporate employee ownership and broad based profit sharing into larger strategies of supporting high quality jobs in their communities state and local governments can raise wages and wealth for workers support high road businesses and create a wider coalition of supporters by more broadly incorporating policies to promote profit sharing in their economic policy agendas policy recommendations policymakers in cities and states across the country are taking action to expand support for employee ownership while the renewed interest in these sorts of policies is encouraging and will likely be expanded to more jurisdictions there is far more that policymakers can do to support the growth of employee ownership and broad based profit sharing both in terms of expanding the public s understanding of the benefits of profit sharing and ensuring that government spending programs are deployed in ways that facilitate the expansion of these sorts of programs specifically cap recommends that cities and states establish an office of employee ownership and broad based profit sharing use public financing to facilitate ownership conversions encourage government contractors to share ownership and profits with their workers require government supported tech startups to share equity profits or ownership with their workers establish an office of employee ownership and broad based profit sharing cities and states can encourage more companies to adopt well designed sharing programs by creating an office of employee ownership and broad based profit sharing housed in a jurisdiction s commerce department or economic development authority this office would provide outreach and technical assistance to private sector businesses and workers and serve to improve government knowledge and support for all types of broad based sharing successful sharing programs are not always well understood by the business community or workers 50 the benefits and mechanisms for sharing capital broadly with workers are largely absent from higher education curricula and companies often report that they are unaware of the benefits of sharing capital income and ownership broadly they thus lack the technical knowledge to evaluate whether to adopt these programs or how to do so 51 however employee ownership and broad based profit sharing could provide important benefits to privately held businesses recent analysis by project equity a nonprofit advocacy organization and consultant for companies interested in selling to their employees estimates that baby boomers nearing retirement own more than 2 3 million businesses employing nearly 25 million workers nationwide 52 selling to employees rather than to a competitor larger company or private equity fund is one way for these owners to ensure that local jobs and the legacy of their company are preserved but few owners know that employee ownership is a viable option additionally companies are often unaware of how employee involvement in programs paired with profit sharing or gain sharing can improve business performance an office of employee ownership and broad based profit sharing should award grants at a maximum value of 500 000 per year to a university nonprofit or a partnership between these entities the goal should be to create a center of employee ownership and broad based profit sharing as well as to promote these sorts of programs among existing business owners and develop this knowledge among future leaders to the extent that a similar center already exists in the state it would also be eligible for support these centers would promote employee ownership and profit sharing as well as democratic workplace culture that allows workers a stronger voice on the job by providing education and outreach technical assistance training and even modest grants to small businesses to conduct feasibility studies grants would also fund the development of various levels and types of curricula and courses on the topic as well as academic research looking at the effects of profit sharing broadly and its effects on women workers of color and low income workers these efforts should prioritize recipients that target assistance to support the retention and creation of businesses in low income communities in order to build knowledge of sharing programs and the impact of outreach the office would also track various measures including growth in the number of businesses and workers participating in these sorts of programs participant demographics and the effect of sharing programs on the state s economy this concept builds on a successful model for increasing one type of sharing as discussed above employee ownership centers in vermont and ohio have successfully increased awareness and facilitated the conversion of small and medium sized businesses to an employee ownership structure for example a 2013 report found that the ohio employee ownership center has assisted about 15 000 employees in the purchase of all or part of their respective companies adding an average of 40 000 to their individual wealth 53 while several cities and states have recently funded new centers focused on esops and worker cooperatives state and local officials should also promote the benefits of stock ownership and profit sharing in order to ensure that workers at larger companies enjoy the benefits of broad based sharing programs they should also support low cost options such as employee ownership trusts that make sense for smaller companies 54 finally the office of employee ownership and broad based profit sharing should help improve governmentwide support for employee ownership and profit sharing programs the office should serve as an advocate for improving government knowledge and support for well designed broad based sharing it should also increase awareness of how agency programs affect companies with sharing programs and promote the legislative or regulatory changes necessary to ensure that government policies encourage the adoption of existing and emerging sharing programs for example these offices should evaluate the effects and total cost of providing additional tax incentives to business owners selling to an esop as well as how the government should promote and potentially regulate new forms of sharing such as employee ownership trusts eots and make recommendations on whether to pursue new policy in these areas use public financing to facilitate ownership conversions employee ownership structures including worker cooperatives esops and now eots are most frequently adopted by small businesses according to the national center for employee ownership nearly 60 percent of esops nationwide include 100 or fewer employees 55 moreover the ongoing wave of baby boomer retirements provides a significant opportunity to convert thousands of businesses several cities and states help fund feasibility studies and transition plans for existing businesses but policymakers should also ensure that businesses have access to sufficient capital to sell to their employees for example at the federal level congress recently enacted sen kirsten gillibrand s d ny main street employee ownership act to ensure that small businesses selling to an esop or worker cooperative are able to access a u s small business administration loan guarantee program 56 additionally as discussed above the city of newark and the newark cedc are going further to target local business owners who are nearing retirement the cedc will finance not only the cost of hiring an independent trustee and appraiser but also in partnership with commercial lenders and private investors the acquisition of the business by the esop trust 57 the program should allow the cedc as well as partnering investors to secure a moderate return on the investment while delivering cash at sale to selling owners and allowing them to avoid business broker fees after a sale the company will be required to train workers on their new roles as owners as well as the benefits of ownership while the program is in its earliest stages it is working with a handful of midsize companies on executing a sale to an esop cities and states should ensure that all existing loan guarantee and loan programs aimed at supporting small businesses and economic development in the jurisdiction are available to firms transitioning to an employee owned structure in addition cities and states in partnership with the state or local economic development authority should consider adopting newark s more active investment model encourage government contractors to share ownership and profits with their workers state and local governments finance millions of jobs across the u s economy with the hundreds of billions of dollars that they spend each year to purchase goods and services yet jobs created through government contracting are often substandard paying very low wages and involving poor working conditions some governments have developed ways in the contractor selection process to give extra consideration to employers that create good jobs basing bidders scores in part on the quality of workplace practices as well as other comprehensive criteria can increase the likelihood that companies with better practices will win contracts and help motivate companies to improve their working conditions 58 government agencies frequently evaluate bidders proposals based on the strength of their technical ability and past performance record as they seek contractors that will provide the best value for the taxpayers not simply the lowest price they should use the same type of system to evaluate contractors on the quality of their workplace practices government agencies should give significant weight to those employers that provide decent jobs including those that pay market wages provide benefits and share profits with their employees incentives can potentially play a useful role in improving job standards beyond the contracted workforce and can reward employers that successfully create quality jobs cities and states can encourage employers to improve job standards broadly by evaluating job quality across a bidder s entire workforce that is located within the jurisdiction rather than evaluating only standards for contracted workers while this sort of evaluation is not without precedent state and local policymakers should nonetheless carefully consider the criteria for measuring work quality as discussed above 36 states have adopted benefits corporation laws that require third party evaluations of qualifying companies workplace practices cities including el paso texas and san jose california already consider the quality of jobs provided by a contractor when determining a winning bidder 59 similarly california and texas are debating legislation that would provide a contracting preference for companies that workers own through an esop 60 finally policymakers should ensure that a firm s status as an esop does not preclude it from qualifying for contracting set aside programs rules governing contracting set asides for minority women and veteran owned businesses should ensure that employee owned companies are able to access these programs by counting each stock trustee and plan member as an owner require government supported tech startups to provide their employees equity state and local governments frequently promote entrepreneurship and the growth of innovative startups through various types of economic development subsidies and assistance 61 these incentives can include grants direct loans support for private venture capital companies and tax benefits for companies and investors for example new york s start up ny program allows growing businesses to partner with eligible university or college campuses and to operate tax free for 10 years 62 and massachusetts massventures was formed in 1978 as a quasi public venture capital firm to provide early stage funding as well as grants to startups working to commercialize a product 63 this early stage seed funding often represents a relatively high risk venture and is granted in cases when obtaining government support is essential to a firm s survival many of today s leading technology and biotechnology firms such as google apple tesla symantec and medimmune were recipients of government support in their early years 64 tech startups pioneered the use of stock ownership programs in the mid 20th century as a way to reward all employees upon a company s sale but companies such as intel hewlett packard science applications international corporation apple microsoft and google broadened the application of these programs over the next three decades to ensure that all employees were oriented toward the success of the company yet many tech companies have abandoned this practice in recent years offering stock ownership to a much smaller sliver of top talent for example one study found that from 2002 to 2010 the portion of workers in the computer services industry benefiting from employee stock options fell by nearly 70 percent 65 in order to help reverse this trend whenever a government provides at least 1 million in assistance to a company the recipient should be required to share profits or ownership with its workers when the company goes public or is sold to another firm 66 companies should be required to demonstrate that the value expended on the top 5 percent of employees is equal to the amount spent on the bottom 80 percent of workers at the time of sale or public offering 67 recipients could comply with this requirement by setting up broad based incentive programs with an ongoing awards system through grants of restricted stock unions stock options or an employee stock ownership plan 68 alternatively they could fulfill these requirements at the point of going public or a private sale with the award of unrestricted stock with full voting rights or cash profit sharing government assistance can include grants loans loan guarantees access to government developed technology and even tax incentives support would be measured cumulatively a company receiving 1 million in assistance from multiple programs or at different phases of development would be required to meet these profit sharing requirements while attaching a profit sharing requirement to economic development subsidies would break new ground many tech companies embrace broad based equity programs and would likely already comply under this policy conclusion employee ownership and broad based profit sharing programs can help to ensure that workers are rewarded for the wealth they help create close racial wealth disparities and strengthen local economies while less than half of working americans benefit from these sorts of sharing plans state and local policymakers are increasingly interested in supporting their growth in order to do so cities and states should adopt policies to ensure that companies know about the benefits of sharing and that government spending programs are deployed in ways that facilitate the expansion of these sorts of programs about the author karla walter is the director of

its name to the world economic forum high stock prices and profits are celebrated as evidence america is thriving common good but on some issues republicans don t sound as reflexively business friendly as they used to sharpening competition with china which for trump has been mostly about trade has spurred some republicans into a broader rethink one idea taking hold is that if its chief rival has a government directed industrial policy america may need one too republican senator marco rubio has made that case in a series of reports and speeches while the market will always reach the

the headlines on any given day suggest a world under siege war terrorism refugees disease recession famine climate change but beneath these often very real problems something remarkable has been happening something on a more epochal level that has gone almost completely unnoticed global poverty has fallen faster during the past 20 years than at any time in history around the world hunger child death and disease rates have all plummeted more girls are getting into school in fact never before have so many people in so many poor countries made so much progress in reducing poverty increasing incomes improving health reducing conflict and war and spreading democracy some of these gains especially the declines in poverty and child mortality rank among the greatest achievements in history yet few people are aware that they are even happening most people believe that apart from a few special cases such as china and india developing countries by and large remain hopelessly mired in poverty stagnation and dictatorship yet the reality is quite different a major transformation is quietly under way affecting the lives of hundreds of millions of people in nearly every corner of the world in 1993 almost 2 billion people around the world lived on the paltry sum of less than 1 90 a day the world bank s definition of extreme poverty or less than 10 a day for a family of five imagine if you can what that means never enough food a house made of mud and thatch that couldn t possibly keep out the rain and the pests no schooling for your children and going through your entire life without ever having a single lightbulb in your home or seeing anyone resembling a doctor for most of world history the number of people living in this kind of poverty rose inextricably alongside world population but in the early 1990s for the first time extreme poverty began to fall fast by 2012 just 1 billion people were living on less than 1 90 a day half as many as two decades before the 1 90 figure is calculated in constant prices adjusting for inflation by best estimates the number was down to around 700 million in 2015 and falling the change is widespread going far beyond china and india to include countries as far flung as indonesia mozambique ghana brazil el salvador and mongolia in all more than 60 developing countries around the world have seen a decline in the number of extreme poor despite continued population growth meanwhile millions more poor people have access to clean water and basic sanitation facilities the share of people living in chronic hunger has been cut nearly in half with better nutrition and lower rates of stunted growth in children prior to 1980 just half of girls in developing countries completed primary school now 85 percent do less than 50 percent of adult females could read and write but today global female literacy has passed 93 percent perhaps most remarkable of all are the widespread improvements in basic health diarrhea killed 5 million children a year in 1990 but less than 1 million in 2014 malaria deaths have been cut by half since 2000 and deaths from tuberculosis and hiv have both fallen by one third because of better nutrition greater access to immunizations and success in fighting diseases life expectancy at birth has increased from 50 years in 1960 to 65 years today the biggest health gains have been for children in 1960 some 22 percent of children born in developing countries died before their fifth birthday a horrifyingly high percentage but today less than 5 percent do remarkably the improvements have been truly global the rate of child death has declined in every country in the world since 1980 at least where data are available and as fewer children die parents are having fewer of them fertility rates have fallen from 5 children per adult woman in the 1960s to 2 5 today and global population growth has slowed from 2 percent to 1 2 percent per year still high but headed in the right direction at the same time economic growth has accelerated and average incomes have risen in the 1970s and 80s most developing countries stagnated in the midst of oil price shocks the debt crises the meddling of the cold war superpowers and mismanagement by incompetent despots economic growth per person averaged zero for nearly 20 years but starting in the mid 1990s growth rates began to rise by 2015 average incomes in developing countries had almost doubled after controlling for inflation and that figure excludes china quite literally hundreds of millions of people poor middle class or wealthy in dozens of developing countries have much higher incomes than they did 20 years ago importantly the benefits of growth have been relatively widespread and not just concentrated among the rich roughly speaking inequality has worsened in about one third of developing countries remained about the same in another one third and improved somewhat in the other third meanwhile there has been a big shift from dictatorship to democracy in 1983 only 17 developing countries were democracies by 2013 that number had tripled to 56 and this figure excludes many other countries with populations of less than a million the generals that once ruled across latin america are gone replaced by democratically elected governments the same is true for dictators such as ferdinand marcos in the philippines suharto in indonesia gen park chung hee in south korea and many others the end of apartheid in south africa ushered in a slow but steady sweep of democracy across about half the countries of africa recent elections in both myanmar burma and nigeria hold out the hope for continued gains taiwan elected its first female president in january yes these new democracies are imperfect and have many problems as is true of any democracy especially young ones but today power is far more likely to be transferred through the ballot box than through violence coups and countercoups are much less common and individual freedoms and rights are honored and enforced to a much greater degree never before have so many poor countries been so democratic as incomes have risen and democracy has spread conflict war and violence have fallen sharply this fact surprises anyone reading the daily news about syria yemen or afghanistan while i do not want to trivialize these conflicts we tend to forget just how violent the world was in the 1980s and early 90s when all of central america was engaged in bloody civil wars most of southern africa was in flames during the height of apartheid west africa was in chaos and southeast asia was reeling in the aftermath of the vietnam war and the killing fields of cambodia while far too much conflict still exists there is much less of it the number of civil wars over the past decades is only half as many as there were in the 1980s and deaths from war have fallen by nearly three quarters the fight against extreme poverty is far from over not all developing countries are making progress and even in those that are not everyone is moving forward there are still 700 million people living in extreme poverty every year 6 million children die of preventable diseases many countries especially the poorest remain vulnerable to calamities such as the ebola outbreak that swept through west africa in 2014 too few women and girls get the opportunities they deserve nevertheless the changes over the past two decades are a big start the strongest and most promising start ever in improving the well being of millions of people in many of the world s poorest countries what sparked these changes why did so many developing countries begin to move forward on so many fronts in the early 1990s three major forces were at work first the end of the cold war the demise of communism and the collapse of the soviet union dramatically improved the global environment for sustained and peaceful development the united states and the soviet union stopped propping up some of the world s nastiest dictators proxy wars and political violence associated with the cold war came to an end in central america southeast asia southern africa and elsewhere countries in eastern europe and central asia gained their freedom perhaps most powerfully economic and political ideologies shifted substantially communism and strong state control lost credibility a new consensus began to form around more market based economic systems and at least in many countries more accountable and democratic governance along with greater respect for basic freedoms and rights developing countries around the world introduced major economic and political reforms and began to build institutions more conducive to growth and social progress second globalization and international access to new technologies brought more trade and finance and a far greater exchange of ideas and information exports from developing countries are five times as large today as they were just 20 years ago and financial flows are 12 times as large creating many more economic opportunities with deeper global integration came technologies that spurred progress vaccines medicines new seed varieties mobile phones the internet and faster and cheaper air travel to be sure globalization has brought challenges risks and volatility not least the 2007 food and 2008 financial crises but it has also brought investment jobs ideas and markets all of which stimulated progress third while global changes mattered the countries that began to move forward did so primarily because of strong leadership and courageous actions by the people in those countries themselves where new leaders at all levels of society stepped forward to forge change progress ensued where old dictators stayed in place or new tyrants stepped in to replace the old political and economic systems remained rigged new national leaders such as nelson mandela of south africa corazon aquino of the philippines óscar arias of costa rica lech walesa of poland ellen johnson sirleaf of liberia and many others worked to build new and more inclusive political systems while introducing stronger economic management working alongside civil society and religious leaders such as rigoberta menchú tum of guatemala desmond tutu of south africa muhammad yunus of bangladesh jaime sin of the philippines and wangari maathai of kenya less famous local leaders opened schools clinics microfinance organizations and businesses to support the turnaround in addition foreign aid played a supporting role in bolstering progress although aid is far from a silver bullet and not all of it works well much of it has been effective in saving lives building schools and achieving other goals the bulk of the research evidence on aid shows a moderate positive effect on development progress aid has been particularly helpful in improving health fighting disease mitigating the impacts of natural disasters and humanitarian crises and helping to jump start turnarounds from war in countries such as mozambique and liberia aid programs have helped save millions of lives by fighting malaria tuberculosis hiv aids and diarrhea and by immunizing children around the world aid is not the most important driver of development but it has played an important secondary role in the development surge over the past two decades the huge gains in global development over the past two decades are unprecedented never before have so many millions of poor people made so much progress in so many dimensions of human life these advances are obviously good for the global poor but they are good for richer countries like the us as well broad based gains in development and reductions in poverty enhance global security build states capacities to fight drug trafficking terrorism and pandemic disease and help the us economy by providing new markets and consumers for american products development helps build like minded allies that can work with the us to solve major global challenges helping citizens in each country perhaps most important development helps spread and deepen values that americans hold dear openness economic opportunity democracy and freedom yet few people are aware of this great transformation a 2013 survey asked americans what they thought had happened to the share of the world s population living in extreme poverty over the past two decades sixty six percent of respondents said they thought it had doubled and another 29 percent said that it hadn t changed that is 95 percent of americans got it completely wrong only 5 percent knew or guessed the truth that the share of people living in extreme poverty had fallen by more than half why are these changes not more widely recognized in part it reflects our penchant for bad news we can t get enough of scandal corruption disaster and conflict but we ignore tales of steady progress or a job well done stories of flawed elections with violence in africa are on the front page peaceful and successful ones go unnoticed at the same time news travels much faster and there is much more of it in the past when outbreaks of disease or violent protests occurred we may never have heard about it whereas today it hits the internet almost instantly partly it reflects the tendency of researchers to specialize narrowly in one area of expertise while learning much less about others health experts recognize the huge decline in infant mortality but know little of the spread of democracy poverty experts know all about the gains of the extreme poor but are unaware of the decline in conflict academic research rewards specialization not big connections across disciplines it is also partly about poor memory we romanticize the past the good old days and focus on today s problems rather than on what is going well when we read about today s wars and conclude the world is in bad shape we are forgetting how much worse it was in so many ways just a few decades ago but for whatever reason some of the greatest gains in history are happening right in front of our eyes yet we fail to recognize them the real question is whether the progress of the global poor can continue in the future so far the transformation is incomplete while the fates of hundreds of millions of people are improving many other people have been left behind there are big opportunities to continue progress stemming from technological breakthroughs in energy agriculture and medicine increased trade among emerging markets and a much greater exchange of ideas but there are also huge challenges including population pressures climate change demand for resources changing demographics threats of disease and tensions from the rise of china and india there are at least three broad future scenarios any one of which is possible one is that the development transformation continues sustained economic growth smart investments and policy choices continued advances in technology and ideas stronger health and education systems and deepening democracy will lead to growing prosperity and improved welfare in the coming decades china india brazil and other middle income countries continue their ascendancy with gradually slowing growth followed by turkey indonesia thailand south africa ghana and many others trade among developing countries grows mobile phones expand their reach and the internet extends to more people in poor countries new technologies lead to increased agricultural productivity cleaner and more efficient energy sources reduced environmental damage and further advances in health although progress does not reach everywhere and some countries stagnate or face tragic setbacks others such as myanmar and cuba eventually join the widening circle of development democracy spreads farther and deeper perhaps in different forms and new variations with more countries embracing accountability transparency and good governance the number of people living in extreme poverty falls quickly a second future is that the rate of progress diminishes significantly china s rapid economic expansion decelerates quickly the us and european economies remain sluggish and economic growth and job creation slow across many developing countries rich and poor countries alike fail to make critical investments in infrastructure education health and technology resource mismanagement and environmental degradation begin to undermine progress advancements in health continue but at a much slower pace as antimicrobial resistance expands and new epidemics strike as with the ebola virus in west africa a backlash against democracy takes shape opening doors to authoritarianism and more nations follow thailand and venezuela in reversing democracy poverty continues to decline but much more slowly a third scenario is that development progress is derailed population pressures demand for resources climate change environmental degradation and growing conflict and war combine to halt and in some countries reverse development progress rising populations and increasing incomes cause growing shortages of water food energy and minerals while climate change significantly destabilizes food production and worsens health conditions both rich and poor countries fail to take the actions necessary to slow climate change increase food supplies and develop new energy sources growing tensions from an ascendant asia and a declining west coupled with greater competition over scarce resources or growing global religious and ideological hostilities spark greater conflict western countries increasingly turn inward creating a global leadership void that allows security threats to grow as trade and investment suffer international organizations lose legitimacy and effectiveness democracy is seen as an unsuccessful experiment and dictators rise again economic growth decelerates sharply much as it did in the 1970s and 80s and the declines in global poverty slow considerably development progress largely ends and some countries go backward none of these futures are inevitable or etched in stone any of them or shades between them are possible it is easy to be pessimistic and to conclude that the obstacles to continued progress are just too great and that progress will falter for hundreds of years people have predicted at one point or another that global progress would halt but they have always underestimated the world s growing abilities even with many setbacks along the way to work cooperatively meet new challenges and expand global prosperity and basic freedoms while we can picture many of the future difficulties facing developing countries it is much harder for us to envision the new ideas innovations technologies governance structures and leadership that will emerge to tackle them continued progress in fighting poverty will not happen automatically it will depend on human choices sacrifice cooperation leadership and action both in the world s leading countries like the us and in developing countries around the world the right question is not which of these scenarios is more likely but rather how can we continue to achieve rapid progress for the global poor getting there will require action in several crucial areas one for instance is global leadership the us and other leading countries must take steps to strengthen their own economic and political systems not just for their own benefit but to establish a global environment in which other countries can prosper the rich countries must also lead efforts to improve the effectiveness and legitimacy of international organizations such as the united nations the international monetary fund the world trade organization and the world bank perhaps most important the us and others must lead by example with respect to democracy we are not at the moment a very good model democracy will not continue to spread in developing countries if the leading countries are poor examples at the same time as has been the case for 200 years continued progress will require sizable investments in new technologies and innovations by 2050 global food production must increase by around 70 percent freshwater requirements will grow by 50 percent and the demand for energy in developing countries will double technology alone will not solve these problems but these challenges cannot be met without robust investments in new technologies within developing countries themselves effective leadership will be the major driving force for continued advancement lasting progress will require good governance and state institutions that can deliver sustained and inclusive economic growth with good jobs alongside continued advancements in education and health get stories that empower and uplift daily by signing up you agree to our privacy policy already a subscriber log in to hide ads delivering on this ambitious agenda will not be easy but all of it is possible with effective leadership cooperation both within and across countries the right kinds of policy choices and investments and concerted action the stakes are high for developing countries and rich ones alike but the

it s time to fundamentally transform our tax code so that we tax the wealth of the rich not just their income by asking top households to pay their fair share my proposal will help address runaway wealth concentration elizabeth warren perhaps no policy proposal has generated more excitement among democratic voters looking toward the 2020 election than elizabeth warren s wealth tax a tax on the actual balance sheet worth of wealthy americans above and beyond the taxes imposed on their incomes the idea that some americans do not pay enough taxes and therefore need to be taxed annually on their wealth itself and not just on the income the wealth produces has gained popularity in recent years driven by concerns about income inequality and influenced by the work of the french economist thomas piketty warren and her fellow senator and presidential candidate bernie sanders have made the idea a centerpiece of their presidential campaigns their embrace of a wealth tax marks a sizable move leftward in the way american progressives see wealth accumulation free market economics and the role of the state bemoaning income inequality is nothing new and many proposals have been advanced in the past decade to address the issue for example most in the democratic primary field have embraced higher taxes on investment income as a means of penalizing capital relative to labor but this policy prescription is by no means universally supported after president obama won reelection in 2012 the bush tax cuts were set to expire which would have led to an increase in dividend tax rates and capital gains taxes so what did the hero of american progressive leftism popular reelected and armed with a team of leftist economic advisers and policymakers do he made permanent the lower tax rates on investment income allowing only a slight increase on the very highest income brackets that was an increase from the bush tax cut levels but not an increase anywhere near the level they were set to revert to cooler heads prevailed for the underlying principle at stake now was very much at stake then taxing capital does not merely redistribute capital it destroys capital and taxing capital does not merely tax capital it taxes growth investment and productivity if increased tax rates on dividends and capital gains were a danger to capital investment in 2012 think how much more is at stake now with the idea of a flat out wealth tax an impost not merely on the increase of one s wealth but on its mere existence as proposed the tax would not directly affect a huge number of american taxpayers warren calls for a 2 percent tax on the total balance sheet wealth of anyone with a net worth over 50 million i e a tax of 2 percent of all value above 50 million and a 3 percent tax on anyone with a net worth over 1 billion these would be in addition to the taxes paid by these wealthy taxpayers on income investment property and consumption i suppose this looks reasonable compared with sanders s proposal which calls for a wealth tax beginning at 32 million of net worth with the rate rising from 1 percent up to 8 percent at higher tiers of wealth but there is nothing reasonable about either plan they are destructive twelve developed nations have tried some version of the wealth tax nine of them later repealed it we need to make sure it is not attempted here the rationale for a wealth tax is misguided one of the fascinating things about the debate on a wealth tax is the intense disagreement within the highly insular world of leftist economists over the rationale for it the notion that wealthy people are not paying their fair share of taxes knowing that the data don t support the idea that wealthy even über wealthy people in our society are under taxed warren came to this fight loaded for bear she has pointed to a study from two economists at the university of california at berkeley claiming that the top 400 earners in our society pay a blended tax rate of 23 percent of their income while the bottom 50 percent of earners pay a blended rate of 24 2 percent 1 the berkeley economists arrive at such a startling conclusion by doing a few incredible things with their data their study a ignores the child tax credit and the earned income tax credit in other words it pretends that certain taxpayers who literally pay 0 in federal income tax pay anywhere from 1 400 to 5 600 that they do not pay b ignores transfer payments which essentially means it counts the tax one pays for a transfer of wealth but not the transfer of wealth itself when social security payments are included the numbers reflect a highly progressive tax code none other than jason furman chairman of obama s council of economic advisers had to point this out 2 c uses projections for 2018 tax receipts made before the numbers for 2018 tax revenues had been released and with no explanation of how their estimates for the unknowable 2018 data were calculated what is known is that the authors of the study use a different methodology for calculating tax receipts from the one they used in their own prior work 3 one can be forgiven for wondering why this might be the tax policy center of the urban institute and brookings institution is hardly a right wing enterprise and it has concluded that the lowest quintile of american taxpayers pay just 2 9 percent of total federal tax with the next quintile paying 7 6 percent 4 a difference this large between two left leaning sources would be nearly impossible if both were operating in good faith the idea that the american income tax code as it currently exists is regressive is utterly preposterous and lacks any serious mathematical foundation as acknowledged by highly progressive economic pundits and institutions warren may choose to justify the wealth tax as a means of reducing wealth inequality or a means of paying for a spending program but the argument that it is addressing the problem of a regressive tax code is dishonest and easily contradicted by evidence but there is another component of the wealth tax s rationale that warrants even harsher criticism it fails to understand the very basic realities of wealth itself there are obscenely wealthy people in the united states though i use that adverb only in the plainest and most pedestrian sense possible i have no number in mind as a ceiling to what the resale value of one s holdings ought to be however no dramatic images of opulence intended to stoke the fires of envy in all of us will change one basic fact far and away the most common use and function of wealth is to facilitate wealth producing activities a tax on wealth is misguided for no bigger reason than that it is actually a tax on productive activity the tax will be levied on the capital necessary to fund businesses new technologies new pharmaceuticals new medical devices new construction projects and innovation it is easy to isolate a particular wealthy person and think of that person giving up a piece of his or her assets to fund a government program but the impact across society is a raid on the supply side of the economy on the productive activities that are the most important in generating economic opportunity you may decide to believe erroneously that high net worth people just hide their money in bank accounts and that the wealth tax would not take from the innovative and productive parts of our economy but even this notion begs for an understanding of how capital markets work that mattress money joe billionaire has buried in his bank account is itself the deposit base that banks use to make mortgages lend to small businesses and finance economic activity the rationale for a wealth tax is wrong because the tax code is already highly progressive and because the impact of a tax on wealth would be felt by the beneficiaries of wealth creating activities in a free society those whom warren claims to want to help confiscating wealth from wealthy people satisfies a class warfare agenda but it takes productive capital and makes it nonproductive capital the most misguided notion in all of economics a wealth tax is unconstitutional the constitution prohibits federal direct taxes that are not apportioned by population article i section 9 clause 4 federal taxes can be levied only in proportion to the state s population as determined by a census this rule was put in the constitution precisely for the purpose of making direct taxation very difficult the 16th amendment which entered the constitution in 1913 makes an exception for the income tax the income tax is a very direct levy assessed on individuals with no regard to the apportionment of the population in their state as the supreme court affirmed it is because the income tax was a direct modification of article i section 9 that a constitutional amendment not merely a bill was required for it to become law a wealth tax is in any possible interpretation of the english language also a direct tax and such taxes have to meet the apportionment requirement of the constitution a wealth tax cannot be apportioned by population and state wealthy households are obviously not conveniently distributed around the country in proportion to the states populations the language of the 16th amendment makes it clear that a wealth tax would not be included since it gives congress the power to lay and collect taxes on incomes from whatever source derived there is no practical way to institute or enforce a wealth tax untold trillions of dollars of wealth exist in the united states in the form of closely held businesses real estate illiquid assets and any number of other assets and legal structures that cannot be valued accurately by any available method this is typically not a problem for a high net worth person what he could get for his family car wash business is irrelevant if he is not planning to sell owning a chain of hotels some of which may be under construction creates no need to know what their value is on any given day the cash flow the net operating income and of course the business outlook all matter but establishing a sticker price is inconsequential that would not be so with a wealth tax under its terms a market value would have to be determined for assets that defy such measurement and real life measurable cash i e the tax has to be paid based on that fantasyland figure cash and publicly traded stocks offer nearly perfect price transparency when it comes to valuing them cash has a par value by definition and stocks function on exchanges in which not only are prices created in real time but the spread between the bid price and the ask price is nil if a wealth tax came into being the incentives to move capital into highly opaque mysterious difficult to ascertain price assets becomes overwhelming perhaps the medium of choice would be art and collectibles certainly we know that complicated consortiums of private businesses wrapped in various llcs trusts and offshore entities would become irresistible and this is not simply a comment on the human nature of high net worth people seeking tax minimization nor is it merely a comment on the reality of tax evasion though it is that too rather it is a fundamental critique of the impossibility of the task itself valuing what cannot be valued asking a family that owns significant timberland or farmland or vineyards or a chain of frozen yogurt stores to come up with a cash value of these things every year and then to write a check based on that value is to demand the impossible though compelling the task would be a gift of indescribable value to accountants lawyers appraisers and other such service professionals who would be the only real beneficiaries of such a policy more than 65 percent of the wealth of 1 billion plus households is already in their various business interests these businesses have loans that are measurable but they also have loan guarantees how would those guarantees get valued in calculating a wealth tax they generally have goodwill intellectual property and other such intangibles on their balance sheets how are patents and copyrights to be valued in this annual calculation are irs agents suddenly going to become experts in say appraising a music catalogue and producer royalties the perverse incentives such a tax would create are countless do we really want to incentivize ultra high net worth married people to not be married that has happened in countries where the wealth tax was imposed since a wealthy family can split its net worth into two half as wealthy families after a divorce do we really want to incentivize ceos to push down their stock value at the end of each year to reduce their own personal tax burden do we really want more opaque ownership structures for stock options and the like that delay receipt of income for tax purposes do we really like the idea of a massive national incentive to talk down one s net worth and a national incentive to take actions that reduce it either superficially or substantively the reality is that the large mega cap multinational publicly traded companies whose stock is publicly valued do not make up the backbone of the economy their significance to the national economy pales in comparison to the impact of family owned businesses small businesses multigenerational companies and any number of such enterprises that would be victims of such a misguided policy so a wealth tax that is supposed to help middle class americans by a massive redistribution of wealth would essentially take capital from the backbone of america s economy the vast network of closely held businesses american entrepreneurial success stories and yes the most common employers of america s middle class here is another reality that elizabeth warren is not going to address in her campaign if the wealth tax includes exemptions the wealthy will find ways to use those exemptions to skirt the tax and if it doesn t the things that otherwise would be exempted will be hurt far worse than the high net worth taxpayers subject to the tax let me illustrate the point let s say municipal bond investments are exempted in one s calculation of net worth as they would likely be since they are so crucial to the good working order of school districts hospitals toll roads state funds and any number of other public works projects under this scenario the wealth tax can be skirted by massive deployment of capital to municipal bonds which would boost their price level and distort markets by pushing bond yields lower and if they are not exempted and warren has made no suggestion that they would be a wealth tax will effectively raise the cost of running schools medical facilities highways and the like the wealth tax would invite evasion misallocation distortion and the subsidizing of a cottage industry of advisors who will aid and abet the minimization of the liability it would attempt to do the impossible value what cannot be rationally valued and it would risk depleting needed capital projects in our society charitable municipal etc it is impractical and unenforceable at its core as france learned and had to concede after fumfering with one for more than 30 years france got rid of its wealth tax in 2017 the projected revenue generation from a wealth tax is massively overstated the left leaning keynesian economist larry summers who was treasury secretary under bill clinton and the chairman of obama s national economic council has been particularly critical of the assumptions made by elizabeth warren and her advisers about the revenue a wealth tax would generate he looked at the actual revenue raised by the estate tax as a way to estimate what a wealth tax would bring in the estate tax is a kind of wealth tax it s a levy on the generational transfer of wealth that takes place when someone over a certain net worth passes away that threshold is currently 11 million for a single person but it has been set at a number of different levels far lower than that over the past 20 years summers determined that the revenue generated from a wealth tax would be just 12 percent of what warren s campaign estimates even with preposterously optimistic adjustment to inputs he could get the number only as high as 40 percent of warren s estimate 5 summers also argued with a finger pointed at himself that policymakers have every incentive to believe overly optimistic revenue estimates no matter how strong the testimony of history is against such projections it was the ease of avoiding wealth taxes that caused denmark and sweden to ditch theirs the difficulty of implementation is a large part of the reason they did so but the shortfall in revenues collected was the deciding factor right now the internal revenue service is unable to audit even 10 percent of millionaires the resources for enhanced collection valuation and instigation simply are not there not to mention the problem of superior intellectual resources and motivations available to the taxpayers of course when a wealth tax inevitably falls short of political promises and projections the obvious next step is what is always always done in the world of compulsory taxation you expand the base of taxpayers subject to the tax does anyone who has studied the history of the income tax consumption tax alternative minimum tax property tax or investment tax want to argue that warren s 50 million threshold for a wealth tax would not drop over time the wealth tax would fail to deliver the revenues it promises but you can be sure warren s spending bills would never fail to exceed their promised expense the truth of these two statements should be clear to anyone regardless of his viewpoint on the tax itself a wealth tax is immoral and unfair the wealth tax is indeed misguided as a practical matter unconstitutional unenforceable and overhyped but it also is wrong it is rooted in a principle that cannot be proven or defended that those who have accumulated extreme wealth did something wrong to get it of course if they did something illegal they should be prosecuted fraud extortion embezzlement and theft are already against the law we don t need to noodle around with a 3 percent annual tax on lawbreakers but if they didn t break any laws then our own emotional response to the magnitude of their wealth is irrelevant and to make public policy punitive policy at that out of our emotional impulses is immoral there are people who have inherited tens of millions of dollars of wealth and perhaps we don t feel a passion to defend their good luck at birth that certainly doesn t give us the right to confiscate their property not in a civilized society founded on law and order and it is utterly illogical to create a policy designed to penalize a successful entrepreneur whom the free marketplace has rewarded with great wealth after years of risk hard work and sacrifice just because we don t like that he and others have come to live wonderfully comfortable lives as a consequence again we don t arbitrarily do such a thing because it is wrong it violates the most ancient of ethical principles found in the ten commandments prohibitions against theft and covetousness we also must recognize that capital in our country is taxed as it is accumulated through an impost on the income that generates it and then taxed again as the fruits of that already taxed labor are invested through dividend and capital gains taxes i have argued for years that investment taxes are double taxation but a wealth tax is quite literally a triple tax this is not moral using the tax code to punish american citizens is wrong the rhetoric of fair share has been abused long enough in debates about our income tax code a pile on wealth tax is flawed for all the reasons outlined above but no reason is more important than the immorality of this confiscatory envy soaked idea from its perverse incentive to break up families to its dubious claims about the nature of the present u s tax base the wealth tax is a dangerous and destructive policy idea already rejected by european socialist nations its revenue promises are disingenuous at best and dishonest at worst it attacks the productive purpose of wealth the creation of economic activity more than it attacks the personal wealth of high net worth taxpayers and worst of all it is a thoroughly immoral tax designed to play into people s natural resentment of those wealthier than themselves it is but one of the many reasons to reject elizabeth

program this lecture was supposed to be the first of a series of distinguished speaker series lecture with dr bawumia as a visiting professor to the central university college as a student of economics then on the university of ghana epm program i was forced to listened and read the paper although dr bawumia was a thorn in the flesh of the ndc then dr bawumia opened this lecture by admonishing the ghanaian people that the lecture and for that matter the subject restoring the value of the cedi should be seen and considered as one much of economics than politics this actually caught many to listen even on their radio sets let it be on record that this was captured as a reference paper to the many in his closet which made his phd today in history the many fine policy alternatives as were proposed and thrown about have been dusted in the shelves of libraries in ghana and beyond it is said that the basic principles in economics are allergic to political propaganda as dr bawumia himself alluded to in his famous if the fundamentals are weak the exchange rate will expose you so the substance of this lecture given the exigencies of the time in 2014 could pass some practical test although it was loaded with political propaganda and conveniences the series contained issues of debt net international reserves central bank financing of government and many others dr bawumia just like mr martin amidu manasseh azure awuni etc were strategically created monsters by the npp and their media cabal to haunt the then regime under he john dramani mahama after losing out in 2008 when he first faced the people of ghana in the political space with his raw and unrealistic economic theories dr bawumia staged a come back in 2012 this time his impact was felt in the 9 long months stay in the supreme court where he served as the star witness in the box during his stay in the box dr bawumia s economic and political image got bruised with some allegations and concessions he made in the course or delivery and cross examination the almighty economic messiah couldn t make such a simple mistake of conceding that a blank space in a pink sheet means zero when he knows in basic mathematics that zero isn t same as null nb zero is a number while null is nothing dr bawumia s stay in the witness box gave him the best of ratings in the npp and that earned him the star to play a permanent front role in the npp s 2016 campaign so he came into 2016 as a wounded economic lion with lots of bruises on his face he came with two eyes closed and no direction he was now bathed with organized and embellished propaganda and so economic fundamentals and principles made no sense to him delivering the lecture on this special 25th day of march 2014 dr bawumia alluded to the fact that ghana as a fragile economy was operating on a floating exchange rate regime which unequivocally makes us susceptible to external shocks and economic decisions from giant economies like the usa the case is even worse with our taste for imported basic commodities but because he was given some political dose dr bawumia refused to accept this explanation from the then government in his lecture dr bawumia ridiculed every explanation the then government gave for instance on page 40 of the said paper he made useless of the explanation that the depreciation of the cedi then was a global phenomenon for emerging markets like malaysia india south africa etc with that explanation the government at the time made the case that the us federal reserve was engaged in what economist will refer to as tapering and this is the reduction in bond purchase and increase in us interest rates which will ultimately make us investments more attractive than the emerging markets all these were rubbished on page 40 of his lecture when he said once the fundamentals of the economy were weak that explanation was weak hollow illogical and can t stand the test of time today in history dr bawumia attempted several times to justify the deprecation of the cedi with same weak explanation but the law of karma is at work on that 25th day of march dr completely run down he john mahama and his administration for ever engaging in borrowing although borrowing to put up the gas infrastructure in atuabo was one of the best decisions any government could engage in his assessment of public debt and his conclusions suggested that ghana had no reason to borrow and that borrowed cash were not used to engineer economic growth and development dr bawumia lamented over the ghc 40bn borrowed by the ndc in a five year period 2009 2014 and postulated that about 6 000 complete shs projects could be built from this amount even if one was costed at a high amount of ghc 6m he again said about 15 000km roads could be asphalted with this amount and thousands of boreholes drilled across the hamlets of ghana today if we were to play back the logic and reasoning of dr bawumia as against borrowing how justified with it be to have his government borrowing as much as over ghc 80bn and still counting what have they used the money for the last time i checked most of the projects running had their funding secured by the john mahama administration and was left with disbursements and the physical project execution by 2016 the 84m for the pokuase interchange project was secured and added to the stock of public debt owed to the ndc and john mahama s administration it is unarguably ironical for dr bawumia to assume that the following were signs to show that an economy such as ghana s in 2014 had weak fundamentals but same can t be used as a standard measure under him as the chairman of the economic management team 1 massive increase in public debt ghc 120bn in 2016 and ghc 205bn as of end of 2019 2 net international reserve at precarious levels 3 government unable to meet its statutory obligations like payment of the district assembly s common fund 4 declining consumer and investor confidence in the economy among others the above were part of a long list of economic cases used as a measure of an economy in crisis restricting us to the above four only can dr bawumia s economy today pass the test what is the state of our net international reserves what about borrowing and debt levels at the time of this lecture 1 was exchanging for ghc 2 6 and the reasons given then were untenable and unforgivable according to dr bawumia today same 1 is exchanging for between ghc 5 64 and ghc 5 72 depending on the market one is operating what is the explanation from dr bawumia now that international shocks and economic decisions can t fit for purpose in the scenario of ghana s depreciating cedi what else is the cause in his lecture dr bawumia proffered 9 alternative solutions to restoring the value of the cedi on page 44 solution 1 dr bawumia suggested in part the government has to admit that the economy is in crisis so to carry the country along and get public support for the tough remedial measures it may have to take the problem will not go away by refusing to acknowledge it he said there must be policy credibility to assure markets and investors that ghana is a safe bet today is dr bawumia able to swallow his pride and stop blaming he john mahama and accept the problem the economy is facing solution 2 on page 45 dr bawumia suggested to the mahama government on paragraph d to deal effectively with corruption in the management of public finances what has happened to this idea has he heard about the 400 nda tricycles worth ghc 2m that his darling samba allegedly carried away on the blindside of the authority what about the endless opened looting of the public purse right by him today he nana addo the npp government and the people of ghana have all lost trust in dr bawumia s knowledge of the economy a parallel committee from the economic management team of 40 men has been constituted to investigate the behavior of the cedi as against the us dollar this singular act by government is a vote of no confidence on dr bawumia and his economic management team so where are the men note that the behavior of the cedi is not independent of the way the economy is behaving it s a function of tailored economic decisions made by dr bawumia and his economic management team those times when the lectures of dr bawumia were replayed and serialized on popular morning shows have since diminished the voices of popular show hosts which repeated jabs of dr bawumia and made them to look more of better alternatives to the construction of terminal 3 and the eastern corridor road by he john mahama have become voices of hymns dr bawumia described he john mahama as incompetent on the back of the depreciating cedi how should we describe him and his boss he nana addo after we were told the dollar was arrested and the keys handed to the igp may the soul of he amissah arthur rest in peace he told dr bawumia that the economy can t be managed with book knowledge and unrealistic theories today the 170 questions are haunting dr bawumia himself he s been asked to answer just 1 of the 170 on how to restore the value of the cedi and he is no where close to the ali baba and the 40 thieves it is now clear that to manage an economy is not about phd but the application of common sense logic and realism he aliu mahama wasn t a phd holder mr mahama wasn t one neither was he amissah arthur but none of them beat their chest like dr bawumia did so i still don t understand why the agric minister is in the list while dr bawumia is resting in the it rooms of the nia

announced a series of new taxes including one on whatsapp calls that sent hundreds of thousands of people from all sects into the streets within two weeks saad hariri the sunni prime minister who was struggling to come up with an economic salvation plan and his cabinet resigned just as the lebanese economy and the banking system were falling apart the protests were largely peaceful that changed last week when commercial bank outlets and the banque du liban the central bank were attacked over the weekend the protests expanded and turned into pitched battles between protesters and police another day without a government another night of violence and clashes said jan kubis the un s special co ordinator for lebanon in a tweet sunday the protesters want the appointment of a new cabinet composed of independent technocrats who can launch a crisis plan to stabilize the economy as the demonstrations turn violent the pressure is mounting on the political blocs controlled by the sunni shia christian and druze parties to put their differences aside and appoint a cabinet under prime minister designate hassan diab an engineer and academic who has won the parliamentary support of the big christian and shia coalition including hezbollah iran s powerful political and paramilitary proxy in lebanon the political stalemate has pushed the economy and the banking system into turmoil a senior lebanese government technocrat who is not being identified by the globe and mail said we have clearly reached the point where the system is financially economically and politically dead the protests will be violent when the weekend protests erupted geopolitical tensions in lebanon were already high the u s assassination on jan 3 of qassem soleimani iran s top military commander brought

the exchange sat down with vermont senator bernie sanders on sunday jan 19 before a live audience to discuss the senator s views on medicare for all gun policy foreign policy and other issues on voters minds this election cycle sanders who won the 2016 new hampshire democratic presidential primary by a large margin finds himself in a close race for the 2020 contest he was recently endorsed again by the sea seiu local 1984 one of the largest labor unions in the granite state the exchange candidate forum is a collaboration between new hampshire public radio and new hampshire pbs air date jan 19 2020 listen to the conversation watch the forum the video broadcast will begin at 10 59 est on sunday jan 19 this is a computer generated transcript and may contain errors peter biello from new hampshire public radio i m peter biello and this is the exchange peter biello today we continue our series of presidential primary 2020 candidate forums and for this show on sunday january 19th we re speaking with democratic presidential candidate vermont senator bernie sanders he s with us before a live audience in nhpr s studio d peter biello we ve been hearing from listeners throughout this campaign season and we ll bring some of their questions into the conversation today so thank you to everyone who has written to us in advance also i ll be joined by nhpr s casey mcdermott who covers politics and policy for nhpr peter biello senator sanders welcome thank you very much for being here senator sanders great to be with you peter biello so let s begin on thursday you and your fellow senators took an oath administered by supreme court chief justice john roberts to uphold impartial justice in the upcoming impeachment trial in the senate you ve been extremely critical of the president on the campaign trail and you are running against him how can you assure voters that you re going into this process with an open mind senator sanders well you re absolutely right i have been critical of trump i happen to believe that trump is perhaps the most dangerous president in the history of the united states i think he is and i say this with no joy in my heart i think he is a pathological liar i think his administration is corrupt i think he s a racist a sexist a xenophobe a homophobe and a religious bigot but those charges do not necessarily are not necessarily impeachable offenses you could be a terrible president and not have committed impeachable offenses what i will say if i were a member of the house and i was for 16 years i would have voted to impeach him but my job now is as a juror to hear the evidence and i will do my best i am disturbed i must say peter that mitch mcconnell at least up to this point has not allowed witnesses there are several witnesses john bolton among others who want to come forward and it seems to me that when you have a trial what american jurisprudence is about is listening to those people who are prosecuting listening to those people who are defending and you reach a conclusion it concerns me that mcconnell has not allowed for witnesses i should also say with a caucus coming up in iowa in two weeks and a primary here in new hampshire and three weeks between you and me i d rather be here but i did swear an oath to do my job as a united states senator that s what i ll do and i ll listen to all of the evidence and come to the best conclusion that i can peter biello senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has said he would be working in total coordination with the white house when it comes to the impeachment trial some democrats have said that this amounts to prejudging the outcome of the trial to what extent do you think democrats have made up their minds on the outcome of the trial senator sanders i mean if mcconnell what a trial is supposed to be about is hearing the evidence and reaching a conclusion if mcconnell is saying he s working hand in glove with the person who has been indicted who has been charged with impeachable offenses that kind of tells you something look we are living in a very political moment i mean and it would be very naive to suggest that republicans there have not reached their views or democrats have not reached their views what i would hope again mcconnell allows witnesses that we have a serious trial and that people come up with the conclusions that they come up with but within this political climate i think you know republicans have their views democrats have their views peter biello you ve said that you would prefer to be in new hampshire instead of having to deal with the impeachment trial i think your new hampshire supporters and other voters here would appreciate that sentiment senator sanders absolutely i just want to say a word on that and i think i speak for the other senators i m not the only senator who s going to be stuck in the impeachment trial you know we plan on schedules you know we had a couple of great rallies here i m heading out to conway right after the show you know that s what we had planned for and then suddenly that has been disrupted and again it s for other senators as well and not only has it been disrupted i can t tell you how long i m going to be in washington is it a week is it two weeks is it three weeks and then on top of that i can t tell you that mcconnell may not be playing politics as well with this whole thing so it creates a difficult political situation but i swore an oath to do my job and i will do my job we have great supporters and volunteers here in new hampshire and iowa who are going to go out knocking on doors and doing their work and we ll just do the best that we can casey mcdermott so let s talk about medicare for all you have been calling for this for a long time senator sanders yes casey mcdermott your campaign web site talks about how this would improve access to coverage it doesn t go quite into as much detail about how to transition to the system but you did sponsor a medicare for all bill earlier this year that outlines several different options to finance that move among them a 7 5 percent premium paid by employers a 4 percent income based premium paid by households among others of the options you outlined in that legislation which to you seemed the most viable senator sanders casey let me start that off if i could you could interrupt me if you think i m going on too long but this is an issue that is very close to my heart this is an issue that i talk about at every town meeting we do in new hampshire and in iowa it s an issue that moves me because i hear stories from people all over this country about the dysfunctionality and cruelty of the current system so here is just a few points that i want to make in america today we are spending twice as much per person on health care as do the people of any other country we re spending a fortune 11 000 per person you would think that when you spend so much money we would have a system where every single american would have quality health care not quite the case today eighty seven million americans are either uninsured or underinsured thirty thousand people die each year because they don t get to a doctor on time we pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs in some cases 10 times more than our canadian neighbors pay for the same exact product and five hundred thousand people go bankrupt because of medically related debt in other words they re going bankrupt because they have been diagnosed with cancer that is a disgusting and dysfunctional system so what medicare for all is about is changing the way we pay for health care right now the way you pay for it is you pay a premium your employer pays a premium you pay a deductible you pay out of pocket expenses we do away with all of that and as you ve indicated we ve come up with a number of options i think most relevant for the middle class is that we would pay for it with a 4 percent tax on income exempting the first twenty nine thousand dollars the median family income in america is about sixty thousand a year that means if you exempt the first twenty nine thousand you d be paying four percent of thirty one thousand which is about twelve hundred dollars a year for comprehensive health care because we also include dental care eyeglasses hearing aids and we expand medicare to cover home health care capital for all we have other options as well progressive options taxes on employer a payroll tax is one option at the end of the day we are able to provide comprehensive health care to all at a far lower cost for the american people because we re ending the profiteering hundred billion a year from the health care industry and furthermore the incredible complexity of administering thousands of separate plans which are wasting some five hundred billion dollars a year casey mcdermott so just to follow up on that your home state vermont as you well know spent years trying to launch its own single payer health care system but abandoned that effort in recent years after failing to come up with a way to make the system work what lessons do you draw from that experience and how would you avoid running into the same challenges if you rolled it out nationally senator sanders if vermont had a better governor at the time it might have been different look i think medicare for all is supported by the national nurses union which has endorsed me by many many doctors primarily primary care physicians who are themselves sick and tired of arguing with insurance companies about whether they can prescribe this drug or do this type of therapy this is not a radical idea the point that i want to make is this is not a radical idea in one form or another it exists all over the world it exists in canada we d do better than the canadians do with my plan but in canada if you end up with a serious illness you re in the hospital for a month anybody here know what the bill is when you get out it s zero and yet they are spending half as much per capita on health care as we do let s be clear the function of the current health care system in america is not to provide quality care to all it is to make huge profits for the insurance companies and the drug companies and that is exactly what it is doing and i intend to take on forcefully the insurance companies and the drug companies and make it clear that health care is a human right not a privilege casey mcdermott senator if i might just follow up on your response so do you view that mainly as a failure in leadership in vermont senator sanders look vermont is a small state and it s going to take tough leadership to move forward but i think at the national level and you know this primarily i think significantly can be done at the national level at the end of the day here s an interesting point we have been talking about universal health care in america for well over 100 years teddy roosevelt talked about it franklin delano roosevelt talked about it truman talked about it kennedy talked about it carter talked about it obama talked about it lyndon johnson did something about it but at the end of the day we have a very very powerful industry who spends huge amounts of money on lobbying and campaign contributions that s why we are where we are right now at the end of the day we re going to have to take these people on and make it clear that all americans regardless of income are entitled to quality comprehensive health care as a human right casey mcdermott i just want to talk a little bit more about how you get there when we had your colleague senator warren here we asked her this question and we also got this question from audience members new hampshire voters who were curious about this regardless of how it s paid for medicare for all would result in a pretty serious shift i think you would agree on how we do health care in this country even supporters of medicare for all have said that it could cost a lot of jobs somewhere in the range of 2 million jobs lost many of those in administrative positions in insurers and doctors offices an expert that talked to kaiser health news about this earlier this year said that proponents of medicare for all have to think about what a quote just transition or in other words a fair transition might look like what does a fair transition look like for you senator sanders i do agree with that because if at the heart of what we are trying to do is create a simple non complicated system which is what you ve got right now you know millions of people are being driven crazy by trying to deal with the insurance companies are you covered or are you not covered and arguing with everybody you ve got a lot of people out there in administration and when you have a simple system and not thousands of separate systems you save a lot of money on administration but your point is fair some of those people will lose their jobs and there must be a just transition and that is why in our medicare for all program we put in billions of dollars to protect those people in kind of an unprecedented way and by the way it s exactly the same issue when we deal about climate change all right maybe we ll talk about that in a minute but i intend to stand up to the fossil fuel industry and move this country and do my best to move the world away from fossil fuel into energy efficiency and sustainable energy and i can t sit here and honestly tell you that that s not going to cost jobs it will but the goal is to protect the planet the goal in health care is to provide health care to all people but i would also say with regard to medicare for all when you ve got 87 million people who are uninsured or underinsured when our primary health care system is very very weak when so many people are not going to the dentist when they should the truth is i believe we will end up creating more jobs by allowing more people to access health care than we will lose will we lose some jobs we will and we have to build a just transition in to protect those people peter biello here s a question that came in from our survey of voters in the state misa marks of henniker asks our government is designed for incremental change except in extraordinary circumstances yet our country today faces huge challenges that demand big vision and fundamental changes what in your leadership style or experience prepares you to reconcile big vision and outside the system change with incremental change senator sanders lisa raises a very interesting question i would phrase it a bit differently but i think her question is right on point this country today faces enormous challenges as does the world i wish i could tell you look i think we just need a little bit of an adjustment over here a little tinkering over there and things will be ok that is not where we are at this moment for a start we have a president who is in my view the most dangerous president in the modern history of this country and that begins the discussion of the necessity to defeat him how we can defeat him second of all when you look at issues like a corrupt political system you know we pride ourselves in terms of being one of the longstanding democracies in the world and yet democracy in america is very much on the defensive not just because of trump who considers the media to be enemies of the people or fake news not just because of the voter suppression when you have republican governors trying to make it harder for people of color or for young people or lower income people to vote but we have a political system today which allows billionaires to buy elections if you guys were billionaires and i m sure that on your salaries you are probably not billionaires you could contribute hundreds of millions of dollars to elect candidates that you wanted is that really what democracy is about that s why i believe we must overturn citizens united move to public funding of elections so that is a huge crisis the very existence of american democracy is a huge crisis and then you have income and wealth inequality you got three people in america owning more wealth than the bottom half of america over the last 30 years the top 1 percent have seen a 21 trillion dollar increase in their wealth while the bottom half have seen a decline in their wealth is that a crisis i think that is a crisis from an economic point of view as well as if you like a morality point we are the richest country in the history of the world and half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck and then on top of all of that you got the existential crisis of climate change what the scientists are now telling us is if we do not act boldly let me underline boldly boldly boldly and aggressively the planet that we re leaving our children and grandchildren will be increasingly uninhabitable unhealthy and unhealthy this is a crisis that has got to be dealt with i wish i could tell you look you know we have 50 100 years to deal with climate change and we re going to get some more solar panels up here in new hampshire get a little bit of wind up in vermont we re going to be in great shape i wish i could tell you that it would be a lot easier and then i got to tell you that it s not just an american issue this is a global issue america can do everything right and if you got china and russia and india doing it wrong this planet is in very serious shape so how do we not appreciate that this is a pivotal moment for america and the world we need bold solutions and at the end of the day and i know people don t like talking about it i know people get nervous when i talk about it but at the end of the day we have to recognize that we have a corporate elite in this country as part of the 1 percent who are not only extremely greedy but in many senses they are corrupt and that if you want real change in america we have got to summon up the courage to take them on if you think you could do that by not having a political movement prepared to take on the wealthy and the powerful and their greed and heir corruption i would disagree peter biello and senator sanders so you re describing a lot of big changes to a very big system do these proposed changes require in your view taking control of the senate perhaps in a super majority keeping the house and also winning the presidency or can you do it as president without having full control senator sanders that s a great question and i ll just give you my best answer obviously if i am the democratic nominee i will do everything i possibly can to see that the democrats gain control of the senate and expand their position in the house but this is what i believe and it s kind of what s motivated me throughout my whole political life i have always believed that real change real change always takes place from the bottom on up not from the top on down what does that mean it means that if you look at the history of america you look at the struggles of working people and their ability to form unions over a hundred years ago you look at the women s movement the civil rights movement the gay rights movement the environmental movement today it is millions of people standing up and fighting for justice that is the way real change takes place and as president i will not only be commander in chief of the military i will be organizer in chief rallying the american people around a justice agenda this is nhpr you re listening to the exchange we re speaking with democratic presidential candidate and vermont senator bernie sanders when we come back we ll talk about more policy positions including senator sanders s position on guns this is the exchange on nhpr i m peter biello we ll be right back peter biello this is the exchange on nhpr i m peter biello and today it s the latest in our presidential primary 2020 candidate forums i m here with an nhpr s casey mcdermott and we re speaking with vermont senator bernie sanders and we wanted to ask you senator sanders a few questions about your position on guns when it comes to guns you ve been at odds at times with many in the democratic party which has long promoted gun control you opposed the 1993 brady bill which established federal background checks on firearm purchasers and a five day waiting period for checks in 2003 and 2005 you supported legislation that protects gun manufacturers and sellers from lawsuits over misuse of a firearm with some exceptions you ve recently taken more aggressive positions in favor of gun control so what is your view on those earlier votes now senator sanders thank you well my view is as you know i m from vermont which is a neighbor of new hampshire but in vermont there was virtually no gun control legislation literally until a couple of years ago and that is the state that i represented when i ran for congress in 1988 and lost by three points in a three way race my position was that we should ban the sale and distribution of assault weapons gun groups opposed me and that may have been one of the factors there were other factors why i lost that election but to answer your question i think the people of vermont i suspect the people of new hampshire the people of america have moved in a different direction with regard to guns as a result of the horrific unbelievably i don t know what the word is terrible frightening gun violence that we have seen over the last many many years and my view now is that we cannot have gun policy in america as is currently the case dictated by the nra the nra has intimidated trump has intimidated the republican leadership that s why we re doing nothing on guns so my view is that gun policy and here s some really good news i mean vermont s views have changed on guns i suspect new hampshire s have as well right now as we speak in virginia there is quite a dispute going on with regard to guns their views have changed as well but the people of this country want us to do everything that we can to end horrendous violence gun violence that exists and to me i ll tell you what that means it means universal background checks it means eliminating the gun show loophole it means doing away with so called straw man provision which allows people to legally buy guns and then perhaps sell them to criminal elements it means something that i ve supported for decades ending the sale and distribution of assault weapons it means dealing with this manufacturing liability issue and my view has changed on that issue peter biello how did it change senator sanders well it changed because i mean it became clear to me that if i m a gun manufacturer and i m selling guns in a small town and suddenly i m selling 10 times more guns than normally you would expect people to be buying you got to add two and two together that maybe those guns are not for that community but they re going to people who should not have them and there were some gun manufacturers who refused to acknowledge it that s why my view changed on that i ll tell your story right here from new hampshire i was at a town meeting and a woman stands up asked me a question she said senator what am i supposed to tell my 11 year old daughter who tells me that she wants a bulletproof backpack for christmas how tragic is that i ve got grandchildren here in the hampshire kids who were on these drills which means that kids all over this state all over this country are frightened to death about what should be a joyful experience you go to school you learn you socialize and now they re scared so this is a serious serious problem and we have to be aggressive in dealing with it there will be differences of opinion but the good news is i think the american people urban rural gun owners non gun owners have really more or less come together around a pretty good agenda on how to deal with gun violence and that means that the nra cannot be the determining factor it s the american people s views that must carry peter biello and what is your view on licensing and permitting requirements for firearms senator sanders be a little bit more explicit peter biello some have argued that in order to get a handgun you would have to get a license in the same way that people have to get a license to drive peter biello at this moment at least i m comfortable with the it s something that you know that we can explore but i m comfortable with the idea of very strong background checks for a start peter biello what about the buyback plan for assault style weapons is that something you would support and how would you convince gun owners to give up their weapons given strong feelings about the second amendment senator sanders it s something that i would support but not making it compulsory i think making it compulsory would be unconstitutional peter biello so if it s not mandatory then then how would you convince gun owners that it s a good idea senator sanders well you know you would make the general argument that we have seen so much violence that all of us have got to do everything that we can to get those types of guns off the streets and i got to tell you where this becomes a very difficult problem is there are hundreds of millions of guns and millions of assault weapons or semi assault weapons out on the street this is not easy but we have to do everything that we can peter biello and final question on that on the gun issue national studies have shown that the cause of most gun deaths is suicide how would the reforms you support help address the problem of suicide senator sanders suicide is a fearful issue in this country as i m sure most people know ahistorically we are actually seeing a decline in life expectancy in the united states we ve seen that for the last three years which is rather unbelievable given the advances that we see in medicine and it s not true for the rest of the world they re seeing you know modest increases in life expectancy why is that doctors call that diseases of despair so this ties in this gets beyond guns this gets to a very serious problem facing lower income and working people all across this country often in rural areas and agricultural areas people who are feeling so depressed about their own futures people were working longer hours for low wages people who worry about their children even being worse off than they do seeing no future at all and then what happens is what the doctors are telling us who study this issue is you re seeing a growth in alcoholism you re seeing a growth in drug addiction and you re seeing a growth in suicide so to answer your question obviously the answer is to give hope to people in rural america that means to rebuild our rural communities which all over this country in vermont our most rural communities are seeing a decline in population young people are leaving there aren t any decent jobs there in many cases education is not adequate schools are being shut down downtowns are being boarded up all over this country in rural america many urban communities are doing just fine and one of the things that i would do as president is focus on the needs of rural america something that has been ignored for too many years give hope to people and i think that is one way that we address the crisis but the other way obviously is a failure of our health care system you go into rural areas you go into areas all over america you don t have the money we get calls in my office and i m sure other senators get the same call somebody calls up i remember a call came to my office i am worried to death about what my brother is going to do to himself or to somebody else and we can t find the kind of counseling that we need we can t afford it that s going on all over this country so you people today all over america who are suicidal some of them have guns they may become homicidal do we have the kind of mental health capacity to address those issues the answer is absolutely we don t and that is something by the way that a medicare for all system would be a significant improvement over where we are today casey mcdermott senator i just want to move on to a different issue here your campaign s earned the backing of a number of people who are leaders within the state s refugee communities here in new hampshire what kind of conversations have you had with those individuals and what would you do as president to specifically help refugees senator sanders you know one of the uglier aspects of the trump administration is his effort to try to divide us up divide us up based on the color of our skin our sexuality where we were born our religion our gender so the first thing that a i think a president who is not a xenophobe or a bigot does is say that we are all in this together and we re going to stop the division that we try to run an administration not based on hatred and divisiveness but on compassion and love my father was an immigrant he came to this country from poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket couldn t speak english never made any money but he was the proudest american you ever saw and that s kind of the history of america so we need to stop the demonization we need to develop policies that address the needs of the immigrant community as president of the united states i believe absolutely that there is support in the congress right now bipartisan support for comprehensive immigration reform and a path towards citizenship on my first day as president through executive order i would end all of trump s racist immigration executive orders and reestablish the legal status of the 1 8 million young people and their parents for the daca program and very much change our border policy so that federal agents are not snatching babies from the arms of their mother so you know basically what trump tries to do for political purposes like demagogues all over the world do divide people up and one of the groups he attacks virtually every day are the undocumented and immigrants i will absolutely on day one put an end to that peter biello we have this question from a listener elizabeth in concord writes explain your evolution on a national issue a long held belief you changed your mind on after being presented evidence to the contrary senator sanders well guns is one peter biello do you have another senator sanders i mean i think you change your views you know if you go back to what i believe read the things that i talked about in the early 80s when i was mayor of burlington vermont i talked about income and wealth inequality i talked about a government s needs and i tried to do that as mayor of burlington and as a congressman as a senator to try to represent the working people and not just the wealthy and powerful i have always believed that health care is a human right there are issues where i have learned more i mean anybody who wants to go on a really good educational experience run for president i mean you learn a lot you learn about the diversity of america you really do i mean i didn t know this i m a united states senator from a small mostly white state and suddenly you go to nevada and you go to california and you go to native american reservations you know what a lot of things happening in this country you go to latino communities you go to the african american community a lot of stuff criminal justice well talk about an issue you know i learned a lot about criminal justice if i were on this program 20 years ago i would not have said that today we have a broken racist criminal justice system that is what i have learned and this is something i talk about every day on the campaign trail the need to end the disgrace of having more people in jail than any other country on earth disproportionately african american and latino and native american so 20 years ago that s not an issue i would have talked about immigration is not an issue that i was as fluent on as i am right now because you know as the mayor of a city in burlington vermont a senator from a mostly white state those are not the issues that came across my desk but as a presidential candidate those are the issues that i can and must and will deal with casey mcdermott senator you ve already talked about campaign finance a little bit in this conversation you have been very critical of the role of undisclosed money big money in politics the associated press recently reported though that you are benefiting from the support of a large political action organization that you helped to launch you were at the kickoff called our revolution the ap reported that that group has taken in nearly one million dollars from donors that gave more than the limits and whose identities are not fully disclosed according to recent tax filings how do you square your statements on that with the existence of this large corporation senator sanders i mean we have a broken campaign finance system and as i mentioned a moment ago if you guys are billionaires and you wanted to put hundreds of millions of dollars in somebody s campaign you can do that if you want to run for president and spend a couple of hundred million dollars on tv ads you can do that it s a broken system this is what i will say number one i do not have a super pac bernie sanders s campaign does not have a super pac we don t want a super pac we don t need a super pac and what i m extremely proud of is that our campaign today has raised more money from more individuals i think 1 4 million over five million contributions averaging 18 apiece than any camp campaign in the history of american politics and i m enormously proud of that now you ve got groups all over the country that legally can do what they want and i would be very happy to say and to urge an end to all that if other candidates do the same so i am not in favor of these things that is the way it is and if other candidates wanted to say you know if mike bloomberg wanted to run for president without spending a few hundred million dollars and you want to register as a plain citizen that s fine too but that s the world that we live in but i will tell you that as president i will move aggressively to campaign finance reform which entails not only overturning citizens united that disastrous supreme court decision but also moves to public funding of elections i believe that very strongly casey mcdermott senator so just to clarify what is your relationship to that group right now legally and in fact you re quite right in saying that after the campaign we launched that i did no apologies for that the function of our revolution was to generate grassroots political activity to get people involved in the political process and i think they ve done a very good job at it legally and in fact i have nothing to do with them they operate absolutely independently of our campaign casey mcdermott should the group disclose more information about its fundraising given you know your own positions on that issue senator sanders i would have no problem with that but again legally if i got on the phone and i told them what to do that would be a violation of campaign finance law but again this system is broken you have people who are literally spending hundreds of millions of their own dollars you have other candidates who have super pacs i don t have a super pac you have other candidates who spend a lot of their time there are at least two of my opponents who have raised money from more than 40 billionaires each i mean it is a broken system so i would hope that we can change it casey mcdermott i guess just using the bully pulpit that is available to you as a presidential candidate would you call on the group to senator sanders i think that every group should do it i think we should end superpacs right now so i would tell my opponents who have a superpac why don t you end it and certainly that s applicable to the groups that are supporting me peter biello senator sanders we re up against a break but i did want to get a listener question into you before we break for a moment and the question comes from sheila who works in new hampshire she says how the how would you select your support staff and advisers i ask this question because i judge all leaders in business or politics by the quality of the people who support and work for them senator sanders sheila is absolutely right i mean sometimes there is an illusion that a president does it all by himself or herself but any serious leader whether you re a president whether you re a united states senator whether you re a congressperson whatever you may be you are made or broken by the kind of staff you have no president can do it all alone there are so many issues and they are so complex you need a great staff and i think again one of the weaknesses of trump and you know it s who his personality is the world revolves around him he thinks he knows everything about everything we don t even have adequate representation in the state department right now we have very poor level of advice out there he changes leadership every other day if he gets angry at somebody but to answer sheila s question she is absolutely right we are going to need in this world you re going to need the scientific community engineers to help us with climate change you re going to need the best and most knowledgeable people on health care to help us move forward on medicare for all we re gonna need the best economists in the country to help us to develop an economy that works for working people not just the 1 percent immigration reform criminal justice reform educational reform you need the best out there and we will bring them into our administration peter biello we re speaking with vermont senator and presidential candidate bernie sanders as part of the exchange forum with presidential candidates when we come back we ll be talking more with senator sanders about a variety of issues including foreign policy the dnc and we will bring in more listener questions as well this is the exchange on nhpr i m peter biello we ll be right back peter biello this is the exchange on an nhpr i m peter biello and today it s the latest in our presidential primary 2020 candidate forums i m here with nhpr s casey mcdermott and we re speaking with vermont senator and democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders and senator sanders i wanted to start this part of the program by talking a little bit about the dnc the dnc has made changes to the nominating process since your last run for president it has put more emphasis on small dollar donors among other reforms and that s partly in response to calls from your supporters but now some say that the new set of rules has unfairly winnowed the field of candidates it s become less diverse have the dnc s reforms in your view created a new set of problems senator sanders look in fairness to tom perez and the dnc it s tough no matter what you do somebody is going to criticize you last time around in terms of need for reform we went into our campaign with our opponent already having 500 superdelegates lined up before the first ballot was cast is that fair i don t think it s fair i don t think anyone thinks that s fair so maybe the most significant reform i would have gone further is to say that on the first ballot our view is superdelegates should not be voting at all at the convention but on the first ballot superdelegates will not have a vote that is a very significant step forward there were reforms that were needed in new york state where it was very hard for people who were not democrats or republicans a lot of people are independents or what they call nonpolitical party or whatever it may be they literally could not vote if they didn t register in the party i think six months before really pretty crazy rules california had its own set of rules so i think what you have seen over the last couple of years is an attempt a good faith attempt not as far as i would like but an attempt to democratize the democratic party and we have worked with the dnc on some of those rule changes we re making some progress peter biello what further progress would you like to see specifically to make it in your view more democratic senator sanders look i think that the democratic nominee should be determined by the people of this country not by superdelegates it is no secret maybe i say this from a self interested point of view i don t have a whole lot of superdelegates who support me that s the political establishment and last time around and this time around we re taking on the whole democratic or mostly the whole democratic establishment we have some great members of congress mark mccann who s the co chair of the progressive caucus just came on board we have a number of members alexandria ocasio cortez rashida talib ilhan omar and others are on board our campaign but you know we re not the establishment candidate so if you have a ballot where the establishment has the right to select the nominee we probably you know we ll be at a disadvantage so i would hope that in the future it should be the american people and democrats and independents voting in the democratic primaries who select the candidate not superdelegates casey mcdermott senator i don t need to tell you that there s been a lot of back and forth over the last week about a conversation that took place between you and senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts in 2018 she says that you indicated that you did not think a woman could win the presidency you have strongly denied that but i want to get at a few questions here that i don t think have been addressed thus far because this issue of gender and electability has been on the minds of lots of voters understanding that it s possible for two people to walk away from the same conversation with vastly different interpretations of what happened did you talk at all with senator warren in that conversation about whether gender would be an obstacle for someone senator sanders i really don t want to get into what was a private conversation but to answer your question let me just say this it is hard for me to imagine or anybody in the year 2020 could not believe that a woman could become president of the united states and if you check my record i ve been saying that for 30 years in fact as i mentioned the other day during the debate there was a movement that are were well aware of because it took place here in new hampshire significantly to draft senator warren to be president in 2016 you know what i deferred i did not announce my candidacy until after senator warren indicated she did not want to run and anybody who looks at 2016 hillary clinton won the presidential popular vote by 3 million votes a few hundred thousand votes in three states she would have been president today so you know all that i will say you know the media has blown this thing up and i really don t want to get into it anymore other than to say of course i believe always believed and believe today that a woman can be elected president of the united states and trust me if i am not the nominee and a woman is i will do everything i can to make sure that she is electedcasey mcdermott well again just to kind of take it from a bigger picture view for example there was a poll last year that found that 74 percent of democrats and independents would themselves be comfortable with a woman president but only 33 percent of them believe that their neighbors would be so this is an anxiety that exists senator sanders right it does and i think look as a country we have come a long way i think if you and i were here 25 years ago and somebody said well you know i don t know that an african american could be elected president of the united states i think 25 years ago that would ve been the general and then you ve got barack obama coming along he wins the election he wins a sweeping re election you have a candidate today mayor buttigieg who is openly gay right twenty five years ago do you think anybody in america would have said we could have a serious candidate for president of the united states who is openly gay married you know the world has changed and to those people who think that a woman cannot be elected you re dead wrong if you think a gay american cannot be elected you are dead wrong you think an african american can t be elected you re dead wrong i think the american people have moved very significantly in trying to look at candidates based on what they stand for not on their agenda not on their sexuality not on their race casey mcdermott i guess just just one more question on this do you think that female candidates have a different experience running for president than you and do you think that gender is still an obstacle for a female politician senator sanders look the answer is yes but i think everybody has their own sets of problems i m 78 years of age that s a problem there are a lot of people say well you know i like bernie he s a nice guy but he s 78 years of age and so we have to argue please look at the totality of who i am if you re looking at buttigieg he s a young guy and people will say well he s too young to be president so everybody you know brings some negatives if you like i would just hope very much that the american people look at the totality of a candidate not at their gender not at their sexuality not at their age but at everything you know nobody is perfect there ain t no perfect candidate out there and all of us have got to do the best what does that candidate stand for what is the life record of that campaign one of the advantages of kind of being old if i may say so is i have a long record i ve been doing this stuff for decades i ve been you know making my fight some of you agree with me some of you don t but you know my record has taken on virtually every special interest out there i ve been doing that for like 30 years standing up for working people i ve probably been on more picket lines than you know all of my opponents combined that s what i do you talked about medicare for all i ve been doing this for 25 30 years or more so everybody has their advantages everybody has their disadvantages all i would ask of voters is take a look at the totality of the candidacy of the person peter biello let s talk a little bit about foreign policy you ve been reluctant to send american troops into combat over the years presidents have escalated conflicts overseas both with u s troops on the ground and with drone warfare sometimes without express permission from congress would a president sanders always consult congress first or are there circumstances where you would act as some past presidents have unilaterally senator sanders the rule is that you always consult congress because that s what the constitution is about and i have to tell you peter i m very proud that one of my signature accomplishments in recent years was to work with conservative republicans a fellow named mike lee of utah who led the effort of republicans in the senate to for the first time use the authority of the war powers act that was passed i think back in 1974 and what the war powers act was about is saying that let s make it clear that it is congress not the president who has the authority to get us into a war and the president must have that authority and we used that authority for the first time in terms of the disastrous destructive war in yemen which is led by saudi arabia intervened in that civil war there and america supported them we passed in the senate with mike lee and myself leading the effort and in the house for the first time a war powers resolution which said you know what mr president you don t have the authority to be involved in the war in yemen unfortunately trump vetoed that so to answer your question i do believe in that very very strongly if you ask me are there any incidents well if missiles were flying into the united states i think you have to act instantaneously common sense suggests that but everything being equal you need the authority of congress andi want to tell you why i don t know that there s any other candidate for president who will say this and maybe age has some advantage you know when i was a kid that was when the war in vietnam took place and as people know i marched in demonstrations against that war but what is important whether you re for that war or against that war is to understand that that horrifically destructive war which took fifty nine thousand american lives god knows how many hundreds of thousands or millions of lives of asians that war was caused by a lie the so called gulf of tonkin resolution it was a lie and we got into a war based on a lie now in 2002 i wasn t a kid i was a member of the united states congress and i heard what dick cheney and george bush and donald rumsfeld had to say and i never doubted for a second that they were lying and i never doubted for a second that they were manipulating intelligence they were telling the american people and the media was echoing their claims we could talk about the role of the media in these things as well that the united states was being endangered some of you who were old enough might remember that saddam hussein who was no doubt a thug and a murderer he was developing nuclear weapons he was developing chemical weapons he was going to use that against the united states he was involved in 9 11 also which was a lie so they lied and they lied and they lied and if you check the record you will find that bernie sanders not only voted against that war but was one of the leaders in opposition it doesn t give me any pleasure to tell you that much of what i predicted about the destabilization that would happen as a result of an american invasion that s what i said back in 2002 turned out to be true so i hate war because and i m also the chairman former chairman of the senate committee on veterans affairs and that gave me the opportunity to meet with so many great veterans and wives who lost their husbands at war mothers who lost their kids in war and people do not appreciate it s not just in iraq the forty five hundred men and women that we lost it is the thousands and thousands who came home with ptsd without arms without legs without their eyes war must be the last resort and what we do as the leader of the world the most powerful nation on earth must be to do everything that we can to resolve international conflict through diplomacy and i know it s not sexy you know you get more votes when you stand up and you pound the table we re not going to take it anymore these are bad guys we re going to bomb them to hell it s good politics you get votes when you re doing that but it is not the politicians who give the speeches by and large whose kids come home maimed or killed all right it s the working class of this country casey mcdermott it s an important issue but i want to i want to just move to one more kind of security related issue obviously we have seen a lot of emphasis on election interference in the last few years we know though that actual hacking into voting systems is only one piece of the puzzle that we have to worry about outside actors are eager to sow discord or cast doubt on the legitimacy of the process itself what responsibility do presidential candidates like you have to confront that part of it senator sanders let me confront it right now you re absolutely right hacking attempts first of all let us be aware whether it s russia or whoever else it is trying to distort or destroy american democracy is a real attack against america this is clearly unacceptable you know we would respond if somebody lobbed a missile at us we have got to respond very forcefully and it s a bit embarrassing that we have a president of the united states who continues to deny the role that russia played in interfering in our election process and you re right so let me be very clear i mean we have got to be very strong in telling russia get the hell out of our elections you know they are moving in their own country toward more and more authoritarian rule we don t need them fomenting discord you re exactly right what they did is try to get blacks against whites all kinds of discord so we have got to be very forceful in telling russia stay out of our elections or else casey mcdermott so i guess for example you know if there are leaks along the lines of what we saw in 2016 or if you are a candidate who happens to benefit from an online army of bots or supporters who are who are fake are there any steps that you think that candidates could could take to address that part of it senator sanders i m not the world s greatest expert in technology this is very sophisticated attacks against this country but my campaign will do everything possible to get russia or any other country out of this campaign that is totally totally unacceptable peter biello we have a question from a listener that we wanted to put to you senator sanders and the question comes from julia a junior at manchester west high school and she asks who is your hero someone who inspired you senator sanders well ironically one of my great heroes is a man whose birthday we re gonna be celebrating tomorrow dr martin luther king junior now again i guess telling my age i was there on the march on washington for jobs and freedom i was a student at the university of chicago i took a long bus trip and went there king was an extraordinary human being one of the great leaders in american history not just as an african american one of the great leaders in american history and while the media appropriately talks about the extraordinary role he played in fighting segregation and racism they often don t talk about what he was doing the day he was assassinated he was in memphis tennessee with striking sanitation workers standing up for justice for decent wages and working conditions he was organizing a poor people s march of blacks and whites and native americans and latinos to change the priorities in washington so that instead of spending huge amounts of money on the military and war you start investing in housing and jobs and health care he was an extraordinary human being in terms of his courage he stood up at great personal sacrifice against the war in vietnam so martin luther king jr is certainly one of my heroes senator sanders well senator sanders thank you very much for speaking with us today we really appreciate it my pleasure thank you for having me and thanks also to nhpr s casey mcdermott for joining us on stage today thank you casey thanks peter this is the exchange on an hp it s our 2020 presidential

amid the alpine peaks of the swiss resort of davos in the week ahead politicians investors and executives will be busy debating whether we are witnessing peaks in key drivers of the world economy from oil demand car production and the proportion of young people as a share of the population to less measurable themes like globalization inequality and central banking power there s an argument each will ebb in the 2020s strategists at bank of america corp are already telling clients to brace for a ground breaking peak decade that will disrupt business and investing ian bremmer a delegate at the world economy forum s annual meeting and founder of eurasia group describes this year as a tipping point the theme is captured throughout the davos program which contains multiple panels on stakeholder capitalism and tackling inequality participants will also discuss the future of globalization and whether central banks are out of ammunition here are the hot talking points peak globalization the era of people goods and money flowing increasingly unchecked around the world may have past its high point as governments pursue protectionism and erect more obstacles to migration already there are around 77 physical barriers delineating international borders compared with 15 in 1989 after the fall of the berlin wall according to bank of america the world trade organization calculates the pace of growth in international commerce fell below the rate of economic expansion in 2019 for the fifth time since the financial crisis foreign direct investment inflows have been on the decline since 2015 says the united nations the u s china trade war is at the center of the shift but even with the signing of an interim deal the peterson institute for international economics reckons the average u s tariff on imports from china is still 19 3 per cent versus 3 1 per cent at the start of 2018 away from beijing trump is also seeking to remodel the world trade organization and potentially clamp down on european auto exports the u k still needs to strike a post brexit trade deal with the european union still the continued development of the digital economy rising tourism and mounting reliance of companies on revenues generated outside their home market provide room for confidence globalization is evolving rather than ending peak capitalism jpmorgan chase co ceo jamie dimon and blackrock inc founder laurence fink both of whom will be in davos are among those who have entered the debate over whether companies should better weigh stakeholders such as customers and employees a departure from the decades old shareholder first mindset behind the shift the rise of populism concern wages aren t keeping up with assets such as equities and fears over climate change the maturing millennial generation are a driving force too when making investment decisions 87 per cent of those born between 1981 and 1996 believe environmental social and governance factors are important according to bank of america peak inequality the pressure to reduce inequality will become more urgent this decade as the un s sustainable development goals approach their 2030 deadline 193 governments have signed up to 17 goals 169 targets and 304 indicators on how to end poverty clean up the environment and share prosperity for all there has already been some progress abhijit banerjee and esther duflo last year s winners of the nobel prize for economics estimate the average income of the world s bottom 50 per cent of earners also almost doubled since 1980 but william gale of the brookings institution notes the 400 richest americans owned 3 26 per cent of wealth in 2018 up from 0 93 per cent in 1982 the top one per cent also paid about a third of their income in tax in both 1979 and 2019 he says expect such numbers to be bandied about ahead of the u s election in november with some democrat candidates promoting higher corporate and wealth taxes peak youth for the first time there are now more seniors than children in the world and that trend is set to escalate according to the un the global fertility rate already halved from five children per woman in 1955 and the average life expectancy has increased from 31 in 1900 to 72 today and is tipped to reach 83 by the end of this century while another one billion people are expected on the planet by 2030 the demographic mix will be starkly different for starters the number of those aged 65 or older will outnumber children under the age of 5 the growth of the working age population is also set to slow straining pensions and healthcare resources in a recent paper stanford university professor charles jones said there is a distinct possibility that global population will decline rather than stabilize in the long run threatening economic growth peak climate change the world faces a sweeping series of climate related tipping points from melting ice caps to droughts and dying coral reefs nature magazine in november collated the risks which they described as a climate emergency that will compel political and economic actions on emissions twenty one of the hottest years on record came in the last quarter century we argue that the intervention time left to prevent tipping could already have shrunk towards zero whereas the reaction time to achieve net zero emissions is 30 years at best the article s authors wrote the international effort to rein in fossil fuel pollution took a knock in december after marathon un talks watered down language on issues they had agreed on in previous years peak oil demand hotter temperatures have put new scrutiny on the world s energy mix this means renewable energy like solar and wind plus electric vehicles are going to soar up the policy agenda at the cost of fossil fuel gurgling vehicles big oil executives believe that peak oil demand is increasingly likely in the late 2030s for example saudi aramco the world s largest oil producer and the most profitable company in the planet said on its initial public offering prospectus that oil demand may peak around 2035 with demand leveling off peak cars the 1 3 billion vehicles on the roads today are probably the most there will ever be megacities will house around two thirds of the global population by mid century cutting back on the need for expensive cars evolving urban architecture will also increasingly constrain car usage the shift is already underway in mature markets only 26 per cent of u s 16 year olds earned a driver s license in 2017 compared with almost half just 36 years ago according to sivak applied research even if overall car sales remain robust cheaper technology such as robotaxis and developments such as ride sharing stand to take the shine off their attractiveness

president trump claimed victory on two fronts of his global trade war this week after securing a preliminary deal with china and a replacement for the north american free trade agreement nafta the senate approved trump s nafta rewrite dubbed the united states mexico canada agreement usmca by a resounding margin thursday one day after the president signed a phase one trade deal with china s vice premier liu he trump celebrated the two deals as promises kept to his supporters less than a year before election day the farmers are really happy with the new china trade deal and the soon to be signed deal with mexico and canada trump declared in a thursday tweet but i hope the thing they will most remember is the fact that i was able to take massive incoming tariff money and use it to help them get through the tough times each deal gives trump an arsenal of big numbers and lucrative concessions to tout on the campaign trail with a strong economy at his back even some of trump s fiercest critics and potential replacements backed his nafta reboot after securing unprecedented protections for laborers but trade experts say the deals may do more to boost the president s reelection campaign than the u s s trade relationships particularly with china edward alden a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations said the china deal represents an encouraging truce but doesn t touch the big issues about the structure of the chinese economy and the distortions that causes in world trade if you think back to what really started to increase u s concerns over china alden added this deal does nothing about that trump stormed into the white house in 2017 on a promise to rip up nafta and crack down on china after decades where members of both parties argued beijing s policies bilked u s businesses and farmers trump s scorn for bipartisan free trade agreements helped him endear him to voters in blue leaning industrial states such as michigan pennsylvania and wisconsin that lost millions of factory jobs after nafta s 1994 enactment all three of those states broke for trump in 2016 after supporting democratic presidential candidates for more than two decades and are key to his 2020 prospects trump has touted his new deals as a crucial step toward stopping the bleeding of u s jobs saying wednesday that the u s and china are righting the wrongs of the past and delivering a future of economic justice and security for american workers farmers and families but the agreement with china does not address the forces driving the decline in u s manufacturing jobs and beijing s open ambition to dominate the production of essential technology by 2025 the deal also doesn t address china s long running practice of pouring subsidies into domestic companies to produce an oversupply of industrial materials such as steel to price out american competitors there are a long running series of challenges for the us and china this deal doesn t even scratch alden said there s a whole technology war going on alongside this trade war and that is going to continue in force this next year and beyond even as we have this trade truce trump and his top advisers acknowledge that the current deal leaves a lot to address with china in a proposed phase two agreement the president is keeping 25 percent tariffs on 250 billion and 7 5 percent tariffs on 120 billion in chinese goods to ensure beijing remains at the negotiating table the other half it s not that we didn t get it it s just incomplete said larry kudlow director of the white house national economic council in wednesday remarks to reporters the centerpiece of trump s deal with china is a commitment from beijing to boost purchases of u s goods and services by 200 billion over the next two years including 77 7 billion for manufactured goods and 32 billion for agricultural products while the president may be eager to boast of a new contract with beijing trade experts say it s unlikely that china can meet such high demands u s farmers may also be wary of devoting their entire crop to chinese buyers and leaving their bottom lines at the mercy of beijing do you want to put all your soybeans in one basket said bill reinsch a senior adviser at the center for strategic and international studies do you want to have one single giant customer who buys everything knowing that they have a long record of turning the spigot on and off depending upon how they feel about you at the moment forcing china to buy such vast quantities of u s crops could also require beijing to cut off business with other agricultural exporters which may spur lawsuits and challenges before the world trade organization wto there are almost certainly wto challenges in it because you can t specify import requirements said rachel pierson a senior research analyst for beacon policy advisors you can t have quotas of amounts to buy from someone in this way as i understand it neither trump s trade deal with china nor usmca drastically change the terms of trade between the u s and those nations but both pacts do include some significant changes that could yield benefits across the u s economy the usmca increases the threshold of north american parts an automobile must have to avoid tariffs opens canadian markets up to u s dairy farmers and sets new rules for digital trade practices unheard of when nafta was written the phase one deal with china codified beijing s commitments to respect and protect the intellectual property of u s businesses cease forced technology transfers and allow foreign banks credit card companies and insurers into domestic markets the agreement also requires china to scrap excessive regulatory reviews and health testing for u s products used to halt american exports from entering the country under the pretense of food safety china has a track record of shirking on trade commitments though the pain of u s tariffs could induce beijing to cut its losses alden said that china is known for finding subtle ways around trade rules that are tough to prosecute the commitments on paper are not that different from what the chinese have said in the past alden said but he added that the will to enforce may be greater now than it was in the past

states dollars us 32 500 000 in addition to above funding other information on millennium challenge corporation and millennium challenge compacts jenner edelman is the resident country director for mcc in sri lanka her last assignment has been in georgia where mcc had signed agreements for usd 395 3 million in 2005 and usd 140 million in 2013 respectively during the said periods georgia s gdp growth rate declined from 9 6 to 4 7 and today it is a poor country with a total gdp of usd 16 2 billion i was not able to find information on what usa gained in georgia through these two agreements there are three types of mcc grants compacts five year grants for countries that meet mcc s eligibility criteria type of agreement proposed to sri lanka concurrent compacts for regional investments grants that promote cross border economic integration threshold programs smaller grants for countries that come close to passing mcc s eligibility criteria and show commitment to improving their policy performance the basic purpose of this mc compact is said to be to grant usd 480 million to sri lanka to reduce poverty through economic development we will now look at how the 27 countries who have signed millennium challenge compacts with usa have benefitted or lost from those compacts based on the gross domestic product gdp growth rate criteria data source world bank data 2018 observations and conclusions that can be made from the data given in the above table 15 out of the 27 countries are in africa and they are extremely poor small countries jordan is the only country from middle east and that is one of the poorest among the oil rich middle eastern countries after signing the mcc compact in 2010 economic growth has declined drastically gdp growth rate which was 7 in 2008 has declined to 2 3 in 2010 and further declined to 1 9 by 2018 total gdp of jordan is usd 42 billion which is about 50 of the gdp of sri lanka there are three countries in central america and they are el salvador nicaragua and honduras which are poor countries with small populations all three countries have experienced serious economic problems after signing the mcc agreements and have ended up with negative economic growth within few years after signing the agreements only two countries in western asia georgia and armenia have signed mcc agreements and both countries have experienced negative economic growth after signing mcc agreements they still remain to be countries with extreme poverty levels compared to their neighboring countries such as turkey bulgaria and russia philippines and indonesia are the only countries with a considerable gdp size that have signed mcc agreements although the gdp growth rate has not significantly declined in philippines there is no improvement in growth after signing the agreements philippines has now become a country faced with a major drug problem indonesia has experienced a gradual decline in economic growth rate after signing the mcc agreement in 2010 from 6 2 to 4 9 in 2015 nepal is the only country in south asia that has signed a mcc agreement as it was signed in 2017 not much can be said yet about the impact of the mcc agreement on nepal mcc a grant from the biggest debtor in the world with very high poverty levels in sri lanka 4 1 of the population lives below the national poverty line as per world bank data for 2016 of the population lives below the national poverty line as per world bank data for 2016 the official poverty rate for usa is 12 3 based on the u s census bureau s 2017 estimates deep poverty is 5 7 usa has the biggest external debt in the world which is usd 20 2 trillion in 2019 this is usd 4 trillion higher than the external debt of entire eu given the above poverty and debt levels it is obvious that usa is not going to simply give a grant to develop our country without significant benefit for usa sri lanka has to be extremely careful in signing complicated and binding agreements that are subjected to international law especially since usa has a history of having signed over 100 agreements with the native american indians during the period 1778 to 1871 which subsequently led to the native american indians losing almost all their land that they had lived on for thousands of years prior to signing the said agreements concerns on land issues for sri lanka under the proposed agreement usd 350 million is for a transport project and usd 67 3 million for a land project land project allows mcc to survey lands in anuradhapura kandy kegalle kurunegala mathale polonnaruwa and trincomalee districts further the agreement allows mcc to survey lands in other areas covering 67 of the total land extent of sri lanka all such data collected in the above surveys will become the intellectual property of mcc usa it means that mcc will have intellectual property rights to survey plans of 67 of land in sri lanka including places of natural resources and water resources sri lankan proponents of mcc agreement do not seem to have any idea of limitations or bindings of such intellectual property rights given to a country like usa that is trying hard to maintain their military powers in the asian region through various strategic agreements the proposed mcc agreement does not fall under the laws of sri lanka and will be subjected only to international law a country that loses its land will always be a country of people in extreme poverty we should not forget the important statement once made by desmond tutu the world famous south african archbishop when the missionaries came to africa they had the bible and we had the land they said let us pray we closed our eyes when we opened them we had the bible and they had the land through an act in 1913 the white rulers of south africa acquired about 93 of land from the indigenous black people chasing them out from their traditional homelands mandela fought against this and for the freedom of black south africans mandela was jailed in 1964 for about 30 years he was later released and became the president of south africa and apartheid was said to be over twenty five years have passed since 1994 but still the black people in south africa have not got their land back and majority of them live in extreme poverty even today the average income of a white man in south africa is 5 times that of a black man that is why losing land is proven to be the beginning of the loss of future prosperity of any nation agreements such as the millennium challenge compact if signed at the expense of entire future generations of a country will only help a handful of unpatriotic power hungry and greedy politicians who want to be in power for few more years till they die of old age sri lanka is now an upper middle income country with a per capita income of over usd 4 000 and thus technically cannot fulfill the mcc criteria for a grant to overcome this issue the former government and mcc have taken the year of grant approval as 2016 which is just before the year that sri lanka passed the usd 4 000 per capita income level therefore my personal opinion is that if the present government wants it can avoid signing the millennium challenge compact on that criterion being an upper middle income country we do not have to run to other countries with a begging bowl anymore strong patriotic leadership with good negotiation skills and confidence in local capabilities is the need of the hour to develop the country whilst improving living standards of the entire population there is no point in increasing the gdp of a country unless it really helps to increase the income and living standards of the poor people in the bottom layers of the income pyramid i sincerely believe in the reality that not signing agreements is always better than signing unfavourable agreements that put the future of many generations to come in a miserable situation that they can never escape data sources mcc gdp population gdp per capita
critics warn the deal with china leaves unresolved most of the toughest and most complicated issues dividing the world s two biggest economies washington president donald trump s trade deal with china last week opened up export opportunities for american farmers manufacturers and energy producers and his trade pact with canada and mexico approved jan 16 by the senate could help restore some auto production in the united states yet perhaps more than anything last week s twin breakthroughs on trade provided a breather from two chaotic years of trumpian policymaking involving threats truces and heavy us tariffs imposed on friend and foe alike on a scale unseen since the 1930s the uncertainty had been clouding the economy causing businesses to delay investments until they knew how the trade turmoil would shake out we got trade peace said mary lovely an economist who studies trade at syracuse university at least for now advertisement but lovely and other critics warn that the deal with china leaves unresolved most of the toughest and most complicated issues dividing the world s two biggest economies and that progress could unravel over time they also caution that the new north american trade pact though it might spur some job growth will likely make american built cars more expensive and less competitive globally whatever the outcome the president s approach to trade marks a clear break with seven decades of us policy that had favoured ever freer world commerce rather than seek to tear down trade barriers and pursue rules designed to benefit all countries the administration unabashedly embraced an america first agenda armed with tariffs threats and combative rhetoric it sought to force concessions out of china mexico and canada previous presidents would

had eliminated most trade barriers among the united states canada and mexico nafta which took effect in 1994 triggered a surge in trade among the three countries and it created a regional manufacturing bloc to compete with east asia and europe but trump and other critics argued that nafta cost the united states jobs by encouraging factories to move south to capitalize on low wage mexican labourers who were largely prevented from forming independent unions trump s top trade negotiator robert lighthizer crafted a replacement trade agreement that is intended most of all to return some factory production to the united states to qualify for usmca s duty free benefits automakers must derive 75 of their production content from within north america up from 62 5 under nafta that means more auto content would have to be homegrown in higher wage north america not imported more cheaply from china and elsewhere at least 40 of vehicles would also have to originate in places where workers earn at least 16 an hour that would benefit the united states or canada not mexico where auto assembly workers are paid a fraction of that amount after sealing a deal with canada and mexico lighthizer had to negotiate with democrats who had taken control of the house in the 2018 midterm elections he ended up drawing overwhelming bipartisan support by agreeing to democratic demands these

unusual move the two countries did not arrange to let any disputes go to a neutral arbitrator instead they will try to work out their differences in a series of consultations if they can t the united

the bank of canada will be weighing deteriorating economic numbers against an improving global trade climate as it prepares this week to issue its first interest rate decision and economic projections of 2020 the central bank is widely expected to keep its key policy interest rate unchanged at 1 75 per cent in wednesday s announcement the same rate it has maintained for the past 16 months even as many of its global peers cut rates last year but the bigger questions will lie in the bank s forecasts contained in its quarterly monetary policy report which will have to incorporate some significant changes in the economic landscape since the bank s last mpr in october on the one hand the outlook will have to address disappointing fourth quarter economic indicators that suggest growth in the quarter was much weaker than the bank had anticipated on the other hand breakthroughs in u s china and north american trade deals have at least partly removed the biggest source of uncertainty dogging the growth outlook delivering some potential upside to the bank s analysis certainly the central bank will have to toss aside its previous forecast of a 1 3 per cent annualized growth pace in the fourth quarter based on the data to date economists believe there was little to no growth in the quarter but signals from the central bank over the past couple of weeks suggest that it will play down the fourth quarter weakness as an aberration and that it still isn t convinced that a rate cut is in canada s economic cards i don t think they re going to see as too much of a concern conference board of canada economist alicia macdonald said she pointed to a news conference earlier this month in which bank of canada governor stephen poloz largely dismissed the slow quarter as tainted by temporary factors such as the canadian national rail strike and a major oil pipeline shutdown instead she said probably will focus now on what it has seen from its latest business and consumer surveys last week the bank of canada s quarterly business outlook survey and canadian survey of consumer expectations both showed relatively upbeat sentiment in the fourth quarter despite the growth slowdown the business survey showed that companies plan to hire more staff and that they are increasingly bumping against the limits of their production capacity the consumer survey indicated that canadians are poised to accelerate their spending critically the central bank interpreted the increasing pressures on business capacity as evidence the small amount of output slack that it believed remained in the economy has been absorbed that means the economy is essentially operating at full capacity a condition that would imply that interest rate cuts are not required to stimulate demand the bank of canada may also be concerned about consumers signals of their spending intentions given the country s already near record household debt loads something the central bank has long flagged as a potential threat to economic and financial stability that worry is another key reason the bank is averse to rate cuts as it fears that lower borrowing costs could stoke further consumer debt accumulation meanwhile the biggest source of uncertainty hanging over the economy has dissipated since the bank s most recent rate decision in early december canada the united states and mexico have cleared away the last roadblocks to their new trade agreement and last week the u s and china signed a pact that de escalates the trade war between the economic powers which had become an onerous threat to the global economy an improving external backdrop also reduces the urgency to lower rates royal bank of canada senior economist nathan janzen said in a research note looking deeper into 2020 the direction for interest rates is a topic of considerable disagreement the monetary policy council at the c d howe institute the economic think tank s panel of respected academics and private sector economics last week came up with a median prediction that the bank of canada s rate should dip to 1 5 per cent by the end of the year but the panel was deeply split with one third of its members actually predicting that rates would rise ms macdonald of the conference board said she wouldn t be surprised if the bank of canada holds rates steady for the entire year but she says she believes the acceleration of wage growth in recent months may eventually tip the scales toward a rate hike we haven t yet seen the run up in wages over the past few months translate into higher inflation but that risk is starting to build a little bit she said i think is still tilting more toward the upside in terms of an interest rate increase rather than a decrease

message you have entered an invalid email address from email required message required washington ap president donald trump s trade deal with china last week opened up export opportunities for american farmers manufacturers and energy producers and his trade pact with canada and mexico approved thursday by the senate could help restore some auto production in the united states yet perhaps more than anything last week s twin breakthroughs on trade provided a breather from two chaotic years of trumpian policymaking involving threats truces and heavy u s tariffs imposed on friend and foe alike on a scale unseen since the 1930s the uncertainty had been clouding the economy causing businesses to delay investments until they knew how the trade turmoil would shake out we got trade peace said mary lovely an economist who studies trade at syracuse university at least for now but lovely and other critics warn that the deal with china leaves unresolved most of the toughest and most complicated issues dividing the world s two biggest economies and that progress could unravel over time they also caution that the new north american trade pact though it might spur some job growth will likely make american built cars more expensive and less competitive globally whatever the outcome the president s approach to trade marks a clear break with seven decades of u s policy that had favored ever freer world commerce rather than seek to tear down trade barriers and pursue rules designed to benefit all countries the administration unabashedly embraced an america first agenda armed with tariffs threats and combative rhetoric it sought to force concessions out of china mexico and canada previous presidents would have said it s about win win it s about trade liberalization it s about global growth said william reinsch a former u s trade official now at the center for strategic and international studies trump would say no it s not it s about what s good for america this is essentially might makes right we re big and important so we can push other countries around free trade has long been a mutually accepted priority for the world s major industrialized economies many trade experts say they worry that in the long run trump s relentlessly confrontational stance and eager embrace of tariffs could pose risks to both the u s and global economies and even as tensions ease at least temporarily with china the trump administration is readying tariffs on the european union over subsidies to the aviation giant airbus and on france over a digital services tax that targets u s tech giants like google and amazon here is a closer look at trump s recent record on trade revamping north american trade senators voted 89 10 thursday to approve trump s u s mexico canada agreement a month after the house had passed it 385 41 the so called usmca replaces the north american free trade agreement which had eliminated most trade barriers among the united states canada and mexico nafta which took effect in 1994 triggered a surge in trade among the three countries and it created a regional manufacturing bloc to compete with east asia and europe but trump and other critics argued that nafta cost the united states jobs by encouraging factories to move south to capitalize on low wage mexican laborers who were largely prevented from forming independent unions trump s top trade negotiator robert lighthizer crafted a replacement trade agreement that is intended most of all to return some factory production to the united states to qualify for usmca s duty free benefits automakers must derive 75 of their production content from within north america up from 62 5 under nafta that means more auto content would have to be homegrown in higher wage north america not imported more cheaply from china and elsewhere at least 40 of vehicles would also have to originate in places where workers earn at least 16 an hour that would benefit the united states or canada not mexico where auto assembly workers are paid a fraction of that amount after sealing a deal with canada and mexico lighthizer had to negotiate with democrats who had taken control of the house in the 2018 midterm elections he ended up drawing overwhelming bipartisan support by agreeing to democratic demands these included calls to strengthen language meant to ensure that mexico adopts labor reforms that will encourage unions but usmca could produce negative side effects the new content requirements will raise production costs resulting in higher auto prices reduced u s demand lower auto exports and more rapid substitution of machines for workers syracuse s lovely and jeffrey schott of the peterson institute for international economics concluded in a report last month a cease fire with china after 18 months of trade combat the united states and china agreed to an interim truce wednesday under the so called phase 1 deal trump scrapped his plan to impose tariffs on 160 billion in chinese imports and he halved his import taxes on an additional 110 billion worth the administration still maintains tariffs on 360 billion in chinese products and beijing has imposed retaliatory tariffs on u s exports in return china agreed to do more to protect intellectual property and to curb its practice of forcing foreign companies to hand over trade secrets as the price of admission to the chinese market but the centerpiece of the deal was china s vow to buy an extra 200 billion worth of u s manufacturing energy and farm exports this year and next the mandated purchases are unusual for modern trade agreements trade pacts now usually set the rules for commerce but let customer demand sort out who buys how much of what trump s deal is not about competing on price and quality anymore lovely said we re using our market power to force purchases critics wonder whether china is really capable of meeting the targets under the deal for instance china is supposed to buy 40 billion in u s agricultural products a year a wildly ambitious goal considering that it s never bought more than 26 billion a year and that during the trade war it has redirected some of its farm purchases to other exporting countries and things could get nasty if the united states decides china isn t living up to its commitments in an unusual move the two countries did not arrange to let any disputes go to a neutral arbitrator instead they will try to work out their differences in a series of consultations if they can t the united states could impose tariffs and the deal could unravel perhaps most significantly the phase 1 deal did nothing about the u s key complaint that china uses illicit trade practices in its drive to surpass the united states in such advanced technologies as robotics and quantum computing specifically it didn t address beijing s massive subsidies for its own tech companies those issues are expected to be taken up in future talks talks that aren t likely to go anywhere until after november s u s election
in many countries interest rates are so low even negative that central banks can t lower them further tepid economic growth and low inflation mean they can t raise rates either the wall street journal s greg ip wrote last week the u s might not be far behind central bank officials remain faithful to their congressional mandate to support maximum employment and stable prices adjusting the money supply and interest rates to boost the economy when growth is sluggish or to tap on the brakes when prices rise too quickly but shifting dynamics are making it much harder for central bankers to steer the economy the fed remains the most powerful financial institution in the world it was pivotal in preventing the great recession from metastasizing into the great depression ii and with the jobless rate at a 50 year low and inflation quiescent officials are clearly upholding their mandate but there have always been limits to the fed s might and they are painfully obvious today as the economy hits hurdles that monetary policy the control of the money supply and the cost of borrowing can t overcome advertisement a partial list widening disparities in income wealth and education not only by class but also by regions of the country see boston cities where housing is so expensive that most low wage workers and many in the middle class must live elsewhere see boston inadequate highways and

edelman covering the trends shaping business and the economy in boston and beyond enter email sign up mitigating these real life real people problems falls far beyond the fed s duties even though they affect the economy in significant ways instead the responsibility rests with our elected officials who set fiscal policy how local state and federal tax dollars are raised and spent they have failed and the failure is bipartisan to target anywhere near enough money for public schools and worker training affordable housing transportation clean energy and a more fair and efficient health insurance system following the 2008 2009 recession president obama backed off a fight for more substantial stimulus spending president trump chose to cut 1 5 trillion in taxes a windfall that has gone disproportionately to corporations and the wealthy as have the gains from the long bull market for stocks advertisement when are we going to make the investments to tackle our most daunting challenges if not during the longest economic expansion on record especially when the cost of borrowing is very low did we blow our chance globe reporters and editors put these questions and others to eric rosengren president of the federal reserve bank of boston during an interview last week he had just wrapped up a one year rotation as a voting member of the fed s policy making federal open market committee and had offered to come in and share his views rosengren s replies as always were judiciously understated the way we ve spent our money might have not the highest return to society in general as we might have otherwise had he said it is in some respects a missed opportunity rosengren isn t prone to partisan hyperbole or shade throwing but his position was clear our political leaders can choose whether to raise taxes or lower them they can invest heavily at the pentagon or on main street they can prioritize education or corporate profits in a low interest rate environment fiscal policy could have had a very different mix rosengren said it s a choice that a voting public has on what they want to spend tax dollars on advertisement rosengren said he remained cautious but optimistic on the economy he dissented from each of the three rate cuts approved by fomc members in the second half of last year because he believed the economy was on sound footing and didn t need extra help he was quick to note that the us unemployment rate of 3 5 percent is definitely good news that has brought many minority workers into the job market and boosted pay for low wage workers while the fruits of prosperity are never shared equally the worst outcome is not being able to get a job at all rosengren said and that s much less of a problem than it was he worries less about a recession and more about low rates leading to rising inflation and destabilizing bubbles in assets prices think the stock market housing and office buildings but to come full circle he is concerned that after cutting short term rates to about 1 5 percent to inoculate the economy from disruptions such as the us china trade fight and brexit the fed has left itself with less ammunition to fight the next downturn we don t have very much room before we hit zero he said i would argue that we didn t need to take out as much insurance as we did the fed s mojo isn t limitless you can reach me at larry

millennium challenge compact can it reach its goal of reducing poverty through economic growth in sri lanka by samantha kumarasinghe millennium challenge compact isan agreement between the united states of america acting through the millennium challenge corporation mcc and the democratic socialist republic of sri lanka acting through the ministry of finance government it is important to note that what mcc means in the said millennium challenge compact document is the millennium challenge corporation of usa and not millennium challenge compact the latter is referred to as compact in the said document following excerpts are from the millennium challenge compact document released recently by the government of sri lanka background december 2015 mcc s board of directors selected sri lanka to develop a threshold program during the development of the threshold program the government and mcc conducted a constraints analysis in collaboration with the centre for international development at harvard university completed in november 2016 december 2016 mcc board selected sri lanka to develop a compact government recruited the compact development team housed in the prime minister s office of policy development november 2017 government submitted project proposals that focused on addressing sri lanka s binding constraints june 18 2018 amended and restated grant and implementation agreement cdf agreement pg 9 consultative process as given in the millennium challenge compact agreement document the government consulted a wide range of public officials the private sector civil society and development partners separate meetings with various government ministries and agencies the ceylon chamber of commerce and the american chamber of commerce in sri lanka stakeholder workshops outreach sessions targeted at specific interest groups in 2017 series of workshops with government ministries and agencies working on transport and land various think tanks and civil society while finalizing in may 2018 extensive consultations and workshops with stakeholders goal and funding goal is to reduce poverty through economic growth in sri lanka mcc shall provide assistance in a manner that strengthens good governance economic freedom and investments in sri lanka mcc shall provide assistance in a manner that strengthens good governance economic freedom and investments in sri lanka upon entry into force of this compact mcc shall grant to the government four hundred forty seven million five hundred thousand united states dollars us 447 500 000 to implement the programme multi year allocation of funding is described in annex ii upon the signing of this compact mcc shall grant to the government thirty two million five hundred thousand united states dollars us 32 500 000 in addition to above funding other information on millennium challenge corporation and millennium challenge compacts jenner edelman is the resident country director for mcc in sri lanka her last assignment has been in georgia where mcc had signed agreements for usd 395 3 million in 2005 and usd 140 million in 2013 respectively during the said periods georgia s gdp growth rate declined from 9 6 to 4 7 and today it is a poor country with a total gdp of usd 16 2 billion i was not able to find information on what usa gained in georgia through these two agreements there are three types of mcc grants compacts five year grants for countries that meet mcc s eligibility criteria type of agreement proposed to sri lanka concurrent compacts for regional investments grants that promote cross border economic integration threshold programs smaller grants for countries that come close to passing mcc s eligibility criteria and show commitment to improving their policy performance the basic purpose of this mc compact is said to be to grant usd 480 million to sri lanka to reduce poverty through economic development we will now look at how the 27 countries who have signed millennium challenge compacts with usa have benefitted or lost from those compacts based on the gross domestic product gdp growth rate criteria data source world bank data 2018 observations and conclusions that can be made from the data given in the above table 15 out of the 27 countries are in africa and they are extremely poor small countries jordan is the only country from middle east and that is one of the poorest among the oil rich middle eastern countries after signing the mcc compact in 2010 economic growth has declined drastically gdp growth rate which was 7 in 2008 has declined to 2 3 in 2010 and further declined to 1 9 by 2018 total gdp of jordan is usd 42 billion which is about 50 of the gdp of sri lanka there are three countries in central america and they are el salvador nicaragua and honduras which are poor countries with small populations all three countries have experienced serious economic problems after signing the mcc agreements and have ended up with negative economic growth within few years after signing the agreements only two countries in western asia georgia and armenia have signed mcc agreements and both countries have experienced negative economic growth after signing mcc agreements they still remain to be countries with extreme poverty levels compared to their neighboring countries such as turkey bulgaria and russia philippines and indonesia are the only countries with a considerable gdp size that have signed mcc agreements although the gdp growth rate has not significantly declined in philippines there is no improvement in growth after signing the agreements philippines has now become a country faced with a major drug problem indonesia has experienced a gradual decline in economic growth rate after signing the mcc agreement in 2010 from 6 2 to 4 9 in 2015 nepal is the only country in south asia that has signed a mcc agreement as it was signed in 2017 not much can be said yet about the impact of the mcc agreement on nepal mcc a grant from the biggest debtor in the world with very high poverty levels in sri lanka 4 1 of the population lives below the national poverty line as per world bank data for 2016 of the population lives below the national poverty line as per world bank data for 2016 the official poverty rate for usa is 12 3 based on the u s census bureau s 2017 estimates deep poverty is 5 7 usa has the biggest external debt in the world which is usd 20 2 trillion in 2019 this is usd 4 trillion higher than the external debt of entire eu given the above poverty and debt levels it is obvious that usa is not going to simply give a grant to develop our country without significant benefit for usa sri lanka has to be extremely careful in signing complicated and binding agreements that are subjected to international law especially since usa has a history of having signed over 100 agreements with the native american indians during the period 1778 to 1871 which subsequently led to the native american indians losing almost all their land that they had lived on for thousands of years prior to signing the said agreements concerns on land issues for sri lanka under the proposed agreement usd 350 million is for a transport project and usd 67 3 million for a land project land project allows mcc to survey lands in anuradhapura kandy kegalle kurunegala mathale polonnaruwa and trincomalee districts further the agreement allows mcc to survey lands in other areas covering 67 of the total land extent of sri lanka all such data collected in the above surveys will become the intellectual property of mcc usa it means that mcc will have intellectual property rights to survey plans of 67 of land in sri lanka including places of natural resources and water resources sri lankan proponents of mcc agreement do not seem to have any idea of limitations or bindings of such intellectual property rights given to a country like usa that is trying hard to maintain their military powers in the asian region through various strategic agreements the proposed mcc agreement does not fall under the laws of sri lanka and will be subjected only to international law a country that loses its land will always be a country of people in extreme poverty we should not forget the important statement once made by desmond tutu the world famous south african archbishop when the missionaries came to africa they had the bible and we had the land they said let us pray we closed our eyes when we opened them we had the bible and they had the land through an act in 1913 the white rulers of south africa acquired about 93 of land from the indigenous black people chasing them out from their traditional homelands mandela fought against this and for the freedom of black south africans mandela was jailed in 1964 for about 30 years he was later released and became the president of south africa and apartheid was said to be over twenty five years have passed since 1994 but still the black people in south africa have not got their land back and majority of them live in extreme poverty even today the average income of a white man in south africa is 5 times that of a black man that is why losing land is proven to be the beginning of the loss of future prosperity of any nation agreements such as the millennium challenge compact if signed at the expense of entire future generations of a country will only help a handful of unpatriotic power hungry and greedy politicians who want to be in power for few more years till they die of old age sri lanka is now an upper middle income country with a per capita income of over usd 4 000 and thus technically cannot fulfill the mcc criteria for a grant to overcome this issue the former government and mcc have taken the year of grant approval as 2016 which is just before the year that sri lanka passed the usd 4 000 per capita income level therefore my personal opinion is that if the present government wants it can avoid signing the millennium challenge compact on that criterion being an upper middle income country we do not have to run to other countries with a begging bowl anymore strong patriotic leadership with good negotiation skills and confidence in local capabilities is the need of the hour to develop the country whilst improving living standards of the entire population there is no point in increasing the gdp of a country unless it really helps to increase the income and living standards of the poor people in the bottom layers of the income pyramid i sincerely believe in the reality that not signing agreements is always better than signing unfavourable agreements that put the future of many generations to come in a miserable situation that they can never escape data sources mcc

rttnews the international monetary fund on monday cut the global growth forecasts for this year and next mainly due to the weaker than expected expansion in india global growth for this year is projected at 3 3 percent which is 0 1 percentage point less than the forecast made in october the international lender said in its latest world economic outlook the growth rate is projected to rise to 3 4 percent next year which is 0 2 percentage points less than the october forecast the growth estimate for 2019 was lowered to 2 9 percent from 3 0 percent the downward revision primarily reflects negative surprises to economic activity in a few emerging market economies notably india which led to a reassessment of growth prospects over the next two years the imf report said in a few cases this reassessment also reflects the impact of increased social unrest the report added there are now tentative signs that global growth may be stabilizing though at subdued levels imf chief economist gita gopinath said in a blog the pickup in global growth for 2020 remains highly uncertain as it relies on improved growth outcomes for stressed economies like argentina iran and turkey and for underperforming emerging and developing economies such as brazil india and mexico she said there are no clear signs of a turning point and there is simply no room for complacency gopinath added india s growth forecast for 2020 was cut by 1 2 percentage point to 5 8 percent and the outlook for next year was lowered by 0 9 percentage point to 6 5 percent growth was estimated at 4 8 percent in 2019 domestic demand slowed more sharply than expected in india amid stress in the non bank financial sector and a decline in credit growth the imf said the improvement in growth is expected to be supported by monetary and fiscal stimulus as well as subdued oil prices a more subdued growth forecast for india accounts for the lion s share of the downward revisions the imf report said risks to global activity are less tilted to the downside compared to the october weo the imf said the lender expects these early signs of stabilization to persist and eventually reinforce the link between still resilient consumer spending and improved business spending fading distinct drags in key emerging markets and the effects of monetary easing are also expected to contribute to the rebound in the global activity the 2019 global growth estimate and 2020 projection would have been 0 5 percentage point lower in each year without monetary stimulus the report said that said downside risks remain prominent and includes rising geopolitical tensions mainly those between the us and iran intensifying social unrest further worsening of relations between the us and its trading partners and a deepening economic frictions between other countries a materialization of these risks could lead to rapidly deteriorating sentiment causing global growth to fall below the projected baseline the imf warned the lender also pointed out weather related disasters such as hurricanes in the caribbean drought and bushfires in australia floods in eastern africa and drought in southern africa as new challenges to global growth advanced economies growth forecast for 2020 was lowered by 0 1 percentage point to 1 6 percent mainly due to downward revisions to the outlook for the us euro area the uk and some key asian economies notably hong kong growth is expected to continue at the same pace in 2021 the u s growth forecast for 2020 was cut by 0 1 percentage point to 2 percent slowing from an estimated 2 3 percent in 2019 the economy is expected to expanded 1 7 percent in 2021 eurozone growth outlook for this year was lowered by 0 1 percentage points to 1 3 percent which is a tad stronger than the estimated 1 2 percent expansion in 2019 the improvement was attributed to better external demand support to growth the economy is forecast to grow 1 4 percent in 2021 among the big four of the euro area the projections for france and italy were left unchanged while those for germany were marked down due to the sluggishness in manufacturing the outlook for spain was also lowered due to to carryover from a stronger than expected deceleration in domestic demand and exports in 2019 growth in the uk is expected to stabilize at 1 4 percent in 2020 and to improve to 1 5 percent in 2021 these were unchanged from the october projections the projections assume an orderly exit from the european union at the end of january followed by a gradual transition to a new economic relationship the report said japan s growth was projected to eased to 0 7 percent in 2020 from 1 percent in 2019 however the forecasts were upwardly revised from those in october mainly due to healthy private consumption that said growth is expected to slow to 0 5 percent in 2021 on the fading impact of fiscal stimulus china s growth is expected slow to 6 percent in 2020 from 6 1 percent in 2019 the growth rate is seen easing further to 5 8 percent in 2021 the 2020 projection was upwardly revised by 0 2 percentage points due to the easing trade tensions with the us after the phase one trade deal and the consequent partial rollback in tariffs however unresolved disputes on broader us china economic relations as well as needed domestic financial regulatory strengthening are expected to continue weighing on activity the imf said in latin america chile saw a sizable markdown to growth forecasts due to the social unrest the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the

global growth is expected to hit 3 3 percent this year the imf predicted that is up from 2 9 percent last year which was the worst year for the world economy since the great recession the more upbeat forecast for 2020 is largely due to president donald trump s trade war easing with china and the stimulus from 49 central banks including the federal reserve that lowered interest rates in recent months imf managing director kristalina georgieva called the initial u s china trade deal a welcoming sign but here in davos as top business and political leaders gather in this ski chalet town in the swiss alps uncertainty remains high about trump launching a trade war with europe about military flare ups in the middle east about central banks running out of medicine to revive the economy about inequality and about record levels of corporate debt the reality is global growth remains sluggish georgieva said monday we are adjusting to live with the new normal of higher uncertainty georgieva warned that the record or near record levels of wealth inequality in the united states united kingdom and many other parts of the world combined with the rapid advancement of technology feels a lot like the 1920s which ultimately led to financial disaster the beginning of this decade has been eerily reminiscent of the 1920s high inequality rapid spread of technology and huge risks and rewards in finance georgieva said for the analogy to stop right there and go no further acting together in a coordinated manner is absolutely critical the imf is urging countries to use this time now while unemployment is low and growth is decent to address bigger problems in the economy while the short term economic outlook is positive there are deep structural trends in the economy that are worrying for the longer term the u s economy will grow at 2 percent down modestly from 2 3 percent last year the imf predicted china is expected to grow at 6 percent down from 6 1 percent last year growth is expected to pick up in europe brazil mexico and some other emerging markets we re probably at a low right now we should start to see growth accelerate as the year goes on said chris williamson chief business economist at ihs markit american consumers continue to be the backbone of the u s economy business investment dried up last year as executives sat on their cash to see what would happen with the trade war there is hope that there might be a modest uptick in business investment i do believe we will see an uptick in investment now said kelly grier u s chair of ey the consulting firm formerly known and ernst young in discussions with business leaders in recent days grier said reaction has been quite positive on the trade deals and the perception is this is a period of relative calm now for trade more business spending and a rebound in global growth should help boost manufacturing which was in a mild recession last year in the united states and other countries treasury secretary steven mnuchin recently predicted a surge in growth following the signing of the partial china trade deal and the u s mexico canada trade agreement most independent economists say while finalizing the deals is a small positive for the economy they don t expect a big bump from that alone after 2020 there are concerns about where the u s and global economies are headed the extremely low interest rates that have been in place for over a decade have side effects they push investors into riskier investments that could backfire the fed is pumping liquidity into the system we had a period like this back in 1998 and 1999 that inflated the internet bubble said scott minerd global chief investment officer of guggenheim investments and a davos attendee the fact the fed doesn t seem to be aware they are creating bubbles in risky assets is really disconcerting the world is awash in debt again leading into the 2008 financial crisis housing and consumer debt was at record levels causing a bubble that ultimately burst today there is around 10 trillion in corporate debt a level never seen before no one knows how long this can be sustained or what would happen if interest rates went up again minerd also pointed to the surge in commercial real estate as a red flag the united states is enjoying the longest expansion in its history lasting 11 years while recession risks have largely faded for 2020 there s heightened attention on every sign of a potential slowdown there is a sense that even though risks have receded at the moment that this is a very long old bull market for equities and a very long old economic expansion said rich nuzum president of mercer s wealth business which works with large investors around the world

for the past 18 months the u s and china have been embroiled in a tariff war the two countries on january 15 signed an agreement that commits to addressing the problem this phase i agreement is widely viewed as a step forward according to mauro guillen wharton professor of management while many challenges remain to be ironed out the most important aspect of the agreement is that the two countries are finally talking with the u s and chinese economies being so tightly integrated any outright confrontation he believes would be a disaster for both countries and for the global economy in a conversation with knowledge at wharton guillen shares his views on the implications of the deal for the u s and china below is an edited version of the interview knowledge at wharton the u s has described the recent u s china trade deal as a significant agreement and china also has spoken positively about it what will the deal really mean for both countries mauro guillén it is clearly a first step that s exactly the way in which both governments are describing it it s a phase 1 agreement the agreement essentially is about not doing anything that would derail the relationship it contains some concessions by china in terms of imports from the u s of manufactured goods farm products and services and some kind of a vague commitment to enforce intellectual property laws more strongly this seems to be a truce rather than a comprehensive trade deal which is something that takes much longer to conclude knowledge at wharton what do you consider the agreement s positive achievements to be more importantly what does it fail to accomplish guillén the most important aspect of this phase 1 agreement is that the two countries are finally talking and negotiating and that the escalation of tariffs on both sides has come to an end the united states as part of the deal is not implementing the last round of tariff increases that was supposed to come into effect on december 15 2019 what s missing here is a general framework about the relationship between china and the united states a high level framework as to what this relationship is going to look like it is also important to note that none of the tariff increases has been rescinded the most important aspect of this phase 1 agreement is that the two countries are finally talking and negotiating and that the escalation of tariffs on both sides has come to an end these are the two biggest economies in the world the two largest trading nations in the world they are tightly integrated in terms of trade many companies do business in china and do business in the united states for many american firms having an operational base in china is essential even if they re not selling in china because they are making goods that then they sell somewhere else what s also missing is a lot of the details as to how we re going to de escalate they have agreed not to continue escalating but there s no agreement so far as to how we could go back to where the tariffs were before the trade war was initiated knowledge at wharton what are some of the most contentious issues that still separate the u s and china guillén the agreement does include a commitment on the part of china to not manipulate its currency in order to regain competitiveness and in exchange the united states has taken china off the list of currency manipulators that s a step in the right direction because of all the protectionist measures that countries may adopt the most dangerous is currency manipulation it is indiscriminate it affects every kind of goods and services and it triggers a chain of reactions around the world the biggest issue that remains unresolved is the one that lies at the core of the dispute which is intellectual property it s one thing that as part of the phase 1 agreement china has committed to enforcing intellectual property laws and quite another that they will do so and more importantly that they will be able to enforce the regulations over the last two or three decades chinese companies have learned how to get around regulations how to obtain technology without being detected it s going to be difficult for the chinese especially initially to figure out all the ways in which chinese companies are getting u s technology without paying for it it is a legitimate request on the part of the united states to have china enforce these laws because obviously intellectual property is valuable but i think it s going to take a while nonetheless it is a step in the right direction there is recognition on the chinese side that something needs to be done knowledge at wharton how has china been dealing with intellectual property issues and enforcement in recent years has it affected china s ability to attract foreign direct investment guillén unlike 20 or 30 years ago the chinese economy is no longer in a situation in which it either attracts foreign direct investment or it doesn t grow china has moved beyond that phase in terms of its economic development in fact the biggest development in china over the last 10 years has been the investment by chinese companies outside china as opposed to foreign companies in china having said that in certain sectors china continues to welcome foreign direct investment and this is helping them further develop their economy the issue with technology was that initially it was a requirement that every foreign company in china had to be a joint venture in which the chinese party would have a majority that was an arrangement that lent itself to technology transfer either officially or unofficially after 1989 after tiananmen china relaxed the rules for joint ownership of foreign ventures since then it has been more difficult for chinese companies to obtain technology without paying but as i was mentioning earlier they have found different ways around that as well so this agreement as difficult as it is going to be for the chinese to implement or to enforce these regulations at least signifies that china understands that the most important grievance for the u s involves intellectual property as part of this deal they have committed to enforcing specifically in pharmaceuticals intellectual property protections more strongly what s missing here is a general framework about the relationship between china and the united states a high level framework as to what this relationship is going to look like knowledge at wharton one of america s objectives for the trade war has been to bring back manufacturing jobs to the u s to what extent has that goal been met guillén that is going to be very difficult knowledge at wharton why guillén there is a study by the united nations that was published in november 2019 that i think is the best analysis of the consequences of the tariff war between china and the united states this study found two things one was that consumers have been hurt especially poorer consumers or lower middle class consumers since a greater percentage of their income is consumption whenever there is an increase in tariffs they get hurt more the biggest issue that remains unresolved is the one that lies at the core of the dispute which is intellectual property the other big finding was that the tariffs have not brought manufacturing back to the united states instead companies in response to the tariffs have moved their operations or have sourced whatever it was that they were making in other countries so other countries have benefited indirectly from these tariffs the biggest beneficiaries and this is a very interesting list are taiwan vietnam south korea japan and the european union it s worth mentioning that taiwan has been the biggest beneficiary precisely at a time when there are growing tensions between china and taiwan in other words companies that were making something in china or sourcing something from china destined towards the u s market have essentially said okay we can find a supplier or we can quickly switch production to taiwan and they have done so knowledge at wharton have there been any winners in the u s china trade war if not which country has lost more guillén everybody loses from these protectionist episodes while we all agree that the goal of the protectionist policies to compel china to play by the rules is a legitimate one the method or the means used to accomplish that goal have not been so introducing protectionist measures is always dangerous because while it s relatively easy to implement them it s difficult to take them away companies that are now enjoying the protection may become lazy and not work as hard and they re going to lobby for those protections to remain in place the other problem in this bilateral relationship is that china is not a small powerless country this is the second biggest economy in the world it s the biggest trading nation bigger than the united states so china has retaliated and it has retaliated where it hurts most iowa farmers farmers in the great plains have suffered immensely the trump administration has subsidized those farmers to the tune of nearly 20 million over the last 18 months since the trade war began several industries in the united states have suffered consumers have suffered and china s entire economy has suffered given that it s so much driven by exports the fact that their biggest market the u s has become protectionist has had a large aggregate effect in terms of reducing the growth potential of the chinese economy it s safe to say that in addition to those industries that have been targeted the entire chinese economy has suffered because of this trade war knowledge at wharton how do you see the long term effect of the trade war on american companies for example how will u s tech companies such as semiconductor firms be affected on the flip side how will chinese firms be affected guillén in general companies have options at their disposal they can in principle decide where to produce where to sell they can decide how much to invest in different parts of the world most of the time they can switch those investments and move those operations relatively quickly companies have sensed american companies in particular that protectionism is here to stay in one way or another but there is a strong public sentiment against free trade these days and so they ve been making decisions the level of integration is so high that flat out confrontation would be a disaster for both countries and for the global economy as i mentioned earlier many of them have switched their sources of production or supplies from china towards taiwan vietnam south korea even the european union depending on the product this will continue that s also the case in semiconductors the three industries where we ve seen the biggest shifts of production locations as a result of this protectionism or this trade war have been chemicals electric machinery and electronics that would include semiconductors and then there are mechanical devices those are important sectors in the economy as part of the phase 1 agreement a lot of emphasis has been placed on automobiles and auto parts china has promised to increase their imports from the u s ironically those imports are not going to come from detroit they re going to come mostly from the bmw and mercedes factories in alabama and south carolina where they make bmw and mercedes suvs because those are in high demand in china the chinese are not going to buy american cars they re going to buy suvs and they prefer the european ones the expectation is that bmw and mercedes are going to benefit from this but not necessarily gm ford or chrysler by the way this comes in the wake of very bad news from ford in terms of its chinese operations ford has been reporting over the last few weeks that their sales in china are falling behind knowledge at wharton what would be the best way forward for phase 2 of the us china negotiations guillén what s important is to keep talking it is also important to recognize that comprehensive trade talks take a long time it s not something that you can hope to conclude let s say between now and the u s presidential election for instance the presidential election is only nine months away that s very little time it would be a mistake to rush this conversation you need to first establish a good framework that would inform the relationship over the long run and then you can take care of all the details more importantly during this process they should continue talking they should continue negotiating they should also continue to make acts of good faith both sides should continue to lower the tariffs that they have increased over the last 18 months i think that s very important so good gestures a lot of talking and a lot of patience i strongly believe that the deal will not be concluded until after the next presidential election in which case it could be a different president who is in office in the united states if the deal is concluded before the presidential election then it will be another patch it won t be a comprehensive deal because there s literally not enough time to do that trade negotiations are very time consuming knowledge at wharton what might be the political implications of the trade war especially the impact on the presidential election guillén an agreement already existed before trump was elected between people from or candidates from both parties in that china s behavior is not acceptable over the long run that china needs to change especially over intellectual property there s more of a disagreement in terms of how important it is to reduce the bilateral trade deficit between the u s and china relatively few people would say that is a priority because what really matters is the overall deficit by increasing tariffs with china all that we accomplish is that we reduce the trade deficit with china but then it increases with taiwan or with vietnam or with somebody else very few of those manufacturing operations let alone the jobs are coming back to the united states the other issue is it all hinges on who is the democratic president some of them are far more radical in terms of trade at one extreme you have somebody like bernie sanders who insists that every trade deal should also be a deal about the environment and about global warming that introduces yet another degree of complexity into the negotiations if sanders were president and if that s the way in which trade deals are going to be made after he becomes president then it s going to take even longer to do any one deal if it s somebody else like biden let s say and i m just picking random names but biden i think would probably represent more of a continuation of the style of looking at trade and at potential agreements with other countries that has been the norm in the united states over the last 20 years or so knowledge at wharton what is your long term view of us china economic and trade relations guillén some people are saying that this is the new cold war i couldn t disagree more when we had the competition geopolitically between the u s and the soviet union the two economies were separate they were not interconnected but in the case of the confrontation that potentially could be geopolitical between china and united states it s very different the two economies are completely integrated especially in the manufacturing area what is important here is to acknowledge that china and the u s are the biggest economies they need to agree on fundamentals because otherwise the global economy wouldn t be able to work that means updating certain institutions including the world trade organization the imf and the world bank so that we can have a set of tools and arrangements that help us with the situation today not the situation that was created after world war ii we re still using institutions that were put in place long ago the important thing is that the u s and china need to talk to one another they need to agree about basic issues they can compete but they also must cooperate the level of integration is so high that flat out confrontation would be a disaster for both countries and for the global economy
the value of the syrian pound keeps hitting record lows against the us dollar amid the rising cost of living geopolitical tensions and continuing devastation in the country the most recent fallout came after the us assassinated top iranian general qasem soleimani in iraq earlier this month soleimani oversaw tehran s proxy wars across the middle east including syria and iraq ever since syria s national currency has showed a more than a 10 percent slide with 1 costing as much as 1 020 syrian pounds while it was traded at 47 to the dollar before the war began in 2011 panic buying the killing of soleimani and its regional fallout isn t the only reason behind the fall of the syrian pound which has kept crumbling as the syrian war progressed over the past nine years now local events in neighbouring countries such as lebanon can have an impact on the syrian currency when people in lebanon began protesting against long standing corruption and insufficient basic services in mid october last year syria s inflation showed a sharp increase many syrians have deposited their money in lebanon since the beginning of the war and the syrian pound took a battering as lebanon s tight transaction controls of hard currency amid the protests made it difficult for syrians to move their cash deposits elsewhere during the lebanon protests in an attempt to save their savings panicked syrians began using dollars for transactions and hoarded their currencies syria s deeply rooted internal problems also play a great part in its failing economy but any major regional development can put syrians on a high alert and lead to the fluctuation of the syrian pound iran s hand in the economy the united states the european union and some arab countries began imposing sanctions on syria in 2011 following the regime leader bashar al assad s brutal crackdown on the peaceful protesters since they weren t imposed by the united nations the sanctions technically don t prevent the syrian regime from having economic ties with many countries however by having its varying sectors including the oil industry banking some companies and individuals including assad and his relatives targeted the syrian regime became increasingly dependent on iran its ally in its war along with russia iran is believed to have deposited hundreds of millions of dollars in the country s reserves according to reuters citing bankers familiar with the syrian sector then in 2018 the office of foreign assets control ofac of the us department of treasury announced tougher sanctions as it warned countries involved in shipping oil and gas to syria and added some russian and iranian companies to its sanctions list additional sanctions on syria on january 2019 followed with the eu placing more travel bans on businessmen and freezing assets of some additional individuals and companies amid increasing tensions between tehran and the us following soleimani s death washington placed more measures on iran a move likely to challenge tehran s ability to support the syrian regime financially the war keeps devastating the syrian regime and russia keep bombing the country in an attempt to take over the last rebel held region idlib as the syrian regime s war debt keeps piling up mainly to its ally russia the wrecked country needs an overhaul according to the un the cost of the war stands at 388 billion on the civilian side syrians have experienced a fuel crisis and struggle to afford basic necessities this has resulted in protests in both regime held and rebel held areas where some 350 000 syrians have fled a relentless offensive since december at least 313 civilians have been killed in idlib since november 2019 meanwhile many countries refuse to contribute to the re construction process as long as assad clings to power what they see the obstacle for a political settlement

president donald trump misrepresented the testimony of a key witness who described an exchange of favors in the ukraine matter washington ap in his first formal response to impeachment charges president donald trump misrepresented the testimony of a key witness who described an exchange of favors in the ukraine matter the claim marked a week of frequent exaggeration and distortion by the president heading into the opening statements of his impeachment trial just as his tax cuts are far from the biggest in history the economy isn t the best ever and his election victory in 2016 was no landslide of historic proportions trump s two trade deals don t stand atop the field of presidential endeavors one is a partial settlement of trade grievances with china the other is a refresh of what past presidents created for north america meanwhile the democratic presidential contenders weren t immune from misrepresentation in their final debate before the first votes of the 2020 campaign in iowa a look at the claims impeachment trump via attorneys individuals who have stated for the record that they spoke to the president about the subject actually exonerate him ambassador to the european union gordon sondland stated that when he asked the president what he wanted from ukraine the president said i want nothing i want no quid pro quo r esponse to impeachment charges filed saturday the facts that assertion omits key context on what sondland told house investigators as one of the officials most deeply involved in trying to get ukraine to do trump s bidding sondland testified that there was indeed a quid pro quo in the matter and everyone was in the loop specifically sondland said it was understood that ukraine s new president would only get a meeting with trump in the oval office if he publicly pledged to investigate the bidens and the democrats was there a quid pro quo sondland asked in his statement to the house intelligence committee as i testified previously with regard to the requested white house call and white house meeting the answer is yes moreover on the more serious matter of withholding military aid to ukraine unless the country investigated democrats sondland testified that a this for that explanation was the only one that made sense to him testimony from other officials shored up the picture of a president and his associates systematically trying to get ukraine to do what trump wanted during a period when the military assistance approved by congress was put on hold without explanation ___ trump the president acted at all times with full constitutional and legal authority and in our national interest response to impeachment charges the facts that of course is in dispute the nonpartisan government accountability office the investigative arm of congress found the white house violated federal law in withholding security assistance to ukraine an action at the center of trump s impeachment its report said the office of management and budget broke the law over the military aid which congress passed less than a year ago saying the president is not vested with the power to ignore or amend any such duly enacted law the money was held up last summer on orders from trump but freed up in september after congress pushed for its release and a whistleblower s complaint about trump s july call with the ukrainian leader became public the government accountability office said the white house budget office violated the impoundment control act by delaying the security assistance for policy reasons rather than technical budgetary needs the budget office has said it disagrees with that finding and the hold was appropriate and necessary trump argues he delayed the 391 million in u s assistance because of concerns about corruption although the defense department had already previously certified to congressional committees that ukraine had made enough progress on reducing corruption to receive the aid ___ trump house democrats ran a fundamentally flawed and illegitimate process that denied the president every basic right including the right to have counsel present the right to cross examine witnesses response to impeachment charges trump we demand fairness shouts pelosi and the do nothing democrats yet the dems in the house wouldn t let us have 1 witness no lawyers or even ask questions tweet on jan 13 referring to house speaker nancy pelosi d calif the facts not true the house judiciary committee which produced the articles of impeachment invited trump or his legal team to come he declined absent white house representation the hearings proceeded as things in congress routinely do time is split between democratic and republican lawmakers to ask questions and engage in the debate lawyers for democrats and republicans on the committee presented the case for and against the impeachment articles and members questioned witnesses among them an academic called forward by republicans the first round of hearings was by the house intelligence committee and resembled the investigative phase of criminal cases conducted without the participation of the subject of the investigation trump cried foul then at the lack of representation then rejected representation when the next committee offered it his lawyers will participate in the senate s impeachment trial which resumes tuesday ___ trump on house intelligence chairman adam schiff mr schiff created a fraudulent version of the july 25 call and read it to the american people at a congressional hearing without disclosing that he was simply making it all up response to impeachment charges the facts it s incorrect that schiff didn t disclose what he was doing trump is overstating schiff s exaggerations which the president has repeatedly described as lies and massive frauds the california democrat in what he said was a parody during a committee hearing in september was mocking the president s pleas in his july call to ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskiy as trump does with his critics routinely schiff made clear he was providing an account that was in essence what he believed trump was conveying to zelenskiy when shorn of its rambling character ___ trump you had a fake whistleblower that wrote a report that bore no relationship to what was said everything was false remarks thursday the facts trump s statement is false the whistleblower s account of a phone call between trump and ukraine s leader in july closely resembled what was said judging by the rough transcript released later by the white house itself and by the testimony of officials who listened in on the call witnesses in the impeachment hearings and other sources also verified the whistleblower s description of events before and after the call as trump and his aides pressed ukraine to investigate one of trump s political rivals democrat joe biden the senate impeachment trial will explore whether trump abused his power ___ trade trump on his trade agreement with china this is the biggest deal there is anywhere in the world by far remarks wednesday at the signing trump on the china deal and his updated north american trade agreement so we ve done two of the biggest trade deals they are the two biggest trade deals in the world ever done remarks at the white house on thursday the facts neither claim is true the china agreement is not nearly as big as the u s mexico canada agreement so it s not the largest ever much less by far the deal with canada and mexico was an update of the long standing north american free trade agreement worked out by presidents george h w bush and bill clinton the north american agreement also is not the largest ever for instance 123 countries signed the uruguay round agreement that liberalized trade and produced the world trade organization in 1994 the organization s initial membership accounted for more than 90 of global economic output the federal reserve bank of boston found and that was before china joined the organization also bigger the trans pacific partnership which would have joined north america with pacific rim countries in freer trade trump took the u s out after the deal was negotiated and before the u s ratified it the european union was formed from a giant deal the china deal leaves tariffs in place on about 360 billion in imports from china and pushes substantial remaining disputes ahead to a second phase of negotiations ___ trump on china deal i did the biggest deal ever done in the history of our country yesterday in terms of trade and probably other things too if you think about it remarks thursday the facts trump is even more wildly off the mark in speculating that his china trade deal eclipses all other international agreements even outside trade the montreal protocol aimed at protecting earth s ozone layer was ratified by every member state of the united nations a variety of other agreements on the rights of children world health standards droughts achieved nearly universal ratification more than 190 countries signed the paris accord on climate change of which more than 180 have ratified it the u s is pulling out of it ___ economy trump in wisconsin the unemployment rate has reached its lowest level in history milwaukee rally tuesday the facts he s citing outdated figures wisconsin did post a record low unemployment rate of 2 8 in april and may but it has since edged up and is now at 3 3 that s slightly lower than the u s average of 3 5 but suggests that the state hit a rough patch in the middle of last year ___ trump more than 300 000 people under obama 300 000 people left the workforce under just three years of my administration 3 5 million people have joined the workforce milwaukee rally the facts trump is wrong about barack obama s record more than 5 million people joined the u s labor force during obama s presidency according to labor department

people with preexisting conditions from health insurance discrimination with obamacare still in place insurers in the individual marketplace must take all applicants regardless of medical history and charge the same standard premiums to healthy people and those who have poor health or past medical problems before obama s law any insurer could deny coverage or charge more to anyone with a preexisting condition who was seeking to buy an individual policy ___ bernie sanders medicare for all will cost substantially less than the status quo democratic debate the facts there s no guarantee of that the nonpartisan congressional budget office said in a report last year that total spending under a single payer system like the vermont senator and democratic presidential candidate favors might be higher or lower than under the current system depending on the key features of the new system those features have to do with the design of the system questions such as payment rates for hospitals and doctors and whether patients are required to pay part of the cost of their care sanders says his plan would require no cost sharing from patients no copays and no deductibles but completely free care could trigger a surge in demand for medical services raising costs other countries that provide coverage for all do use cost sharing to help keep spending in check a research report last year by the nonprofit rand think tank estimated that a medicare for all plan similar to what sanders wants would modestly raise total u s health spending ___ military trump on killing iran

the truth about the trump economy new york as the world s business elites trek to davos for their annual gathering people should be asking a simple question have they overcome their infatuation with us president donald trump photo unsplash com darren halstead two years ago a few rare corporate leaders were concerned about climate change or upset at trump s misogyny and bigotry most however were celebrating the president s tax cuts for billionaires and corporations and looking forward to his efforts to deregulate the economy that would allow businesses to pollute the air more get more americans hooked on opioids entice more children to eat their diabetes inducing foods and engage in the sort of financial shenanigans that brought on the 2008 crisis today many corporate bosses are still talking about the continued gdp growth and record stock prices but neither gdp nor the dow is a good measure of economic performance neither tells us what s happening to ordinary citizens living standards or anything about sustainability in fact us economic performance over the past four years is exhibit a in the indictment against relying on these indicators to get a good reading on a country s economic health start by looking at the health of its citizens if they are happy and prosperous they will be healthy and live longer among developed countries america sits at the bottom in this regard us life expectancy already relatively low fell in each of the first two years of trump s presidency and in 2017 midlife mortality reached its highest rate since world war ii this is not a surprise because no president has worked harder to make sure that more americans lack health insurance millions have lost their coverage and the uninsured rate has risen in just two years from 10 9 to 13 7 one reason for declining life expectancy in america is what anne case and nobel laureate economist angus deaton call deaths of despair caused by alcohol drug overdoses and suicide in 2017 the most recent year for which good data are available such deaths stood at almost four times their 1999 level the only time i have seen anything like these declines in health outside of war or epidemics was when i was chief economist of the world bank and found out that mortality and morbidity data confirmed what our economic indicators suggested about the dismal state of the post soviet russian economy trump may be a good president for the top 1 and especially for the top 0 1 but he has not been good for everyone else if fully implemented the 2017 tax cut will result in tax increases for most households in the second third and fourth income quintiles given tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the ultrarich and corporations it should come as no surprise that there was no significant change in the median us household s disposable income between 2017 and 2018 again the most recent year with good data the lion s share of the increase in gdp is also going to those at the top real median weekly earnings are just 2 6 above their level when trump took office and these increases have not offset long periods of wage stagnation for example the median wage of a full time male worker and those with full time jobs are the lucky ones is still more than 3 below what it was 40 years ago nor has there been much progress on reducing racial disparities in the third quarter of 2019 median weekly earnings for black men working full time were less than three quarters the level for white men making matters worse the growth that has occurred is not environmentally sustainable and even less so thanks to the trump administration s gutting of regulations that have passed stringent cost benefit analyses the air will be less breathable the water less drinkable and the planet more subject to climate change in fact losses related to climate change have already reached new highs in the us which has suffered more property damage than any other country reaching some 1 5 of gdp in 2017 the tax cuts were supposed to spur a new wave of investment instead they triggered an all time record binge of share buybacks some 800 billion in 2018 by some of america s most profitable companies and led to record peacetime deficits almost 1 trillion in fiscal 2019 in a country supposedly near full employment and even with weak investment the us had to borrow massively abroad the most recent data show foreign borrowing at nearly 500 billion a year with an increase of more than 10 in america s net indebtedness position in one year alone likewise trump s trade wars for all their sound and fury have not reduced the us trade deficit which was one quarter higher in 2018 than it was in 2016 the 2018 goods deficit was the largest on record even the deficit in trade with china was up almost a quarter from 2016 the us did get a new north american trade agreement without the investment agreement provisions that the business roundtable wanted without the provisions raising drug prices that the pharmaceutical companies wanted and with better labor and environmental provisions trump a self proclaimed master deal maker lost on almost every front in his negotiations with congressional democrats resulting in a slightly improved trade arrangement and despite trump s vaunted promises to bring manufacturing jobs back to the us the increase in manufacturing employment is still lower than it was under his predecessor barack obama once the post 2008 recovery set in and is still markedly below its pre crisis level even the unemployment rate at a 50 year low masks economic fragility the employment rate for working age males and females while rising has increased less than during the obama recovery and is still significantly below that of other developed countries the pace of job creation is also markedly slower than it was under obama again the low employment rate is not a surprise not least because unhealthy people can t work moreover those on disability benefits in prison the us incarceration rate has increased more than sixfold since 1970 with some two million people currently behind bars or so discouraged that they are not actively seeking jobs are not counted as unemployed but of course they are not employed nor is it a surprise that a country that doesn t provide affordable childcare or guarantee family leave would have lower female employment adjusted for population more than ten percentage points lower than other developed countries even judging by gdp the trump economy falls short last quarter s growth was just 2 1 far less than the 4 5 or even 6 trump promised to deliver and even less than the 2 4 average of obama s second term that is a remarkably poor performance considering the stimulus provided by the 1 trillion deficit and ultra low interest rates this is not an accident or just a matter of bad luck trump s brand is uncertainty volatility and prevarication whereas trust stability and confidence are essential for growth so is equality according to the international monetary fund so trump deserves failing grades not just on essential tasks like upholding democracy and preserving our planet he should not get a pass on the economy either project syndicate 1995 2020
in his first formal response to impeachment charges president donald trump misrepresented the testimony of a key witness who described an exchange of favors in the ukraine matter the claim marked a week of frequent exaggeration and distortion by the president heading into the opening statements of his impeachment trial just as his tax cuts are far from the biggest in history the economy isn t the best ever and his election victory in 2016 was no landslide of historic proportions trump s two trade deals don t stand atop the field of presidential endeavors one is a partial settlement of trade grievances with china the other is a refresh of what past presidents created for north america meanwhile the democratic presidential contenders weren t immune from misrepresentation in their final debate before the first votes of the 2020 campaign in iowa a look at the claims impeachment trump via attorneys individuals who have stated for the record that they spoke to the president about the subject actually exonerate him ambassador to the european union gordon sondland stated that when he asked the president what he wanted from ukraine the president said i want nothing i want no quid pro quo response to impeachment charges filed saturday the facts that assertion omits key context on what sondland told house investigators as one of the officials most deeply involved in trying to get ukraine to do trump s bidding sondland testified that there was indeed a quid pro quo in the matter and everyone was in the loop specifically sondland said it was understood that ukraine s new president would only get a meeting with trump in the oval office if he publicly pledged to investigate the bidens and the democrats was there a quid pro quo sondland asked in his statement to the house intelligence committee as i testified previously with regard to the requested white house call and white house meeting the answer is yes moreover on the more serious matter of withholding military aid to ukraine unless the country investigated democrats sondland testified that a this for that explanation was the only one that made sense to him testimony from other officials shored up the picture of a president and his associates systematically trying to get ukraine to do what trump wanted during a period when the military assistance approved by congress was put on hold without explanation trump the president acted at all times with full constitutional and legal authority and in our national interest response to impeachment charges the facts that of course is in dispute the nonpartisan government accountability office the investigative arm of congress found the white house violated federal law in withholding security assistance to ukraine an action at the center of trump s impeachment its report said the office of management and budget broke the law over the military aid which congress passed less than a year ago saying the president is not vested with the power to ignore or amend any such duly enacted law the money was held up last summer on orders from trump but freed up in september after congress pushed for its release and a whistleblower s complaint about trump s july call with the ukrainian leader became public the government accountability office said the white house budget office violated the impoundment control act by delaying the security assistance for policy reasons rather than technical budgetary needs the budget office has said it disagrees with that finding and the hold was appropriate and necessary trump argues he delayed the 391 million in u s assistance because of concerns about corruption although the defense department had already previously certified to congressional committees that ukraine had made enough progress on reducing corruption to receive the aid trump house democrats ran a fundamentally flawed and illegitimate process that denied the president every basic right including the right to have counsel present the right to cross examine witnesses response to impeachment charges trump we demand fairness shouts pelosi and the do nothing democrats yet the dems in the house wouldn t let us have 1 witness no lawyers or even ask questions tweet on jan 13 referring to house speaker nancy pelosi the facts not true the house judiciary committee which produced the articles of impeachment invited trump or his legal team to come he declined absent white house representation the hearings proceeded as things in congress routinely do time is split between democratic and republican lawmakers to ask questions and engage in the debate lawyers for democrats and republicans on the committee presented the case for and against the impeachment articles and members questioned witnesses among them an academic called forward by republicans the first round of hearings was by the house intelligence committee and resembled the investigative phase of criminal cases conducted without the participation of the subject of the investigation trump cried foul then at the lack of representation then rejected representation when the next committee offered it his lawyers will participate in the senate s impeachment trial which resumes tuesday trump on house intelligence chairman adam schiff mr schiff created a fraudulent version of the july 25 call and read it to the american people at a congressional hearing without disclosing that he was simply making it all up response to impeachment charges the facts it s incorrect that schiff didn t disclose what he was doing trump is overstating schiff s exaggerations which the president has repeatedly described as lies and massive frauds the california democrat in what he said was a parody during a committee hearing in september was mocking the president s pleas in his july call to ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskiy as trump does with his critics routinely schiff made clear he was providing an account that was in essence what he believed trump was conveying to zelenskiy when shorn of its rambling character trump you had a fake whistleblower that wrote a report that bore no relationship to what was said everything was false remarks thursday the facts trump s statement is false the whistleblower s account of a phone call between trump and ukraine s leader in july closely resembled what was said judging by the rough transcript released later by the white house itself and by the testimony of officials who listened in on the call witnesses in the impeachment hearings and other sources also verified the whistleblower s description of events before and after the call as trump and his aides pressed ukraine to investigate one of trump s political rivals democrat joe biden the senate impeachment trial will explore whether trump abused his power trade trump on his trade agreement with china this is the biggest deal there is anywhere in the world by far remarks wednesday at the signing trump on the china deal and his updated north american trade agreement so we ve done two of the biggest trade deals they are the two biggest trade deals in the world ever done remarks at the white house on thursday the facts neither claim is true the china agreement is not nearly as big as the u s mexico canada agreement so it s not the largest ever much less by far the deal with canada and mexico was an update of the long standing north american free trade agreement worked out by presidents george h w bush and bill clinton the north american agreement also is not the largest ever for instance 123 countries signed the uruguay round agreement that liberalized trade and produced the world trade organization in 1994 the organization s initial membership accounted for more than 90 of global economic output the federal reserve bank of boston found and that was before china joined the organization also bigger the trans pacific partnership which would have joined north america with pacific rim countries in freer trade trump took the u s out after the deal was negotiated and before the u s ratified it the european union was formed from a giant deal the china deal leaves tariffs in place on about 360 billion in imports from china and pushes substantial remaining disputes ahead to a second phase of negotiations trump on china deal i did the biggest deal ever done in the history of our country yesterday in terms of trade and probably other things too if you think about it remarks thursday the facts trump is even more wildly off the mark in speculating that his china trade deal eclipses all other international agreements even outside trade the montreal protocol aimed at protecting earth s ozone layer was ratified by every member state of the united nations a variety of other agreements on the rights of children world health standards droughts achieved nearly universal ratification more than 190 countries signed the paris accord on climate change of which more than 180 have ratified it the u s is pulling out of it economy trump in wisconsin the unemployment rate has reached its lowest level in history milwaukee rally tuesday the facts he s citing outdated figures wisconsin did post a record low unemployment rate of 2 8 in april and may but it has since edged up and is now at 3 3 that s slightly lower than the u s average of 3 5 but suggests that the state hit a rough patch in the middle of last year trump more than 300 000 people under obama 300 000 people left the workforce under just three years of my administration 3 5 million people have joined the workforce milwaukee rally the facts trump is wrong about barack obama s record more than 5 million people joined the u s labor force during obama s presidency according to labor department figures

associated press washington ap in his first formal response to impeachment charges president donald trump misrepresented the testimony of a key witness who described an exchange of favors in the ukraine matter the claim marked a week of frequent exaggeration and distortion by the president heading into the opening statements of his impeachment trial just as his tax cuts are far from the biggest in history the economy isn t the best ever and his election victory in 2016 was no landslide of historic proportions trump s two trade deals don t stand atop the field of presidential endeavors one is a partial settlement of trade grievances with china the other is a refresh of what past presidents created for north america meanwhile the democratic presidential contenders weren t immune from misrepresentation in their final debate before the first votes of the 2020 campaign in iowa a look at the claims impeachment trump via attorneys individuals who have stated for the record that they spoke to the president about the subject actually exonerate him ambassador to the european union gordon sondland stated that when he asked the president what he wanted from ukraine the president said i want nothing i want no quid pro quo r esponse to impeachment charges filed saturday the facts that assertion omits key context on what sondland told house investigators as one of the officials most deeply involved in trying to get ukraine to do trump s bidding sondland testified that there was indeed a quid pro quo in the matter and everyone was in the loop specifically sondland said it was understood that ukraine s new president would only get a meeting with trump in the oval office if he publicly pledged to investigate the bidens and the democrats was there a quid pro quo sondland asked in his statement to the house intelligence committee as i testified previously with regard to the requested white house call and white house meeting the answer is yes moreover on the more serious matter of withholding military aid to ukraine unless the country investigated democrats sondland testified that a this for that explanation was the only one that made sense to him testimony from other officials shored up the picture of a president and his associates systematically trying to get ukraine to do what trump wanted during a period when the military assistance approved by congress was put on hold without explanation trump the president acted at all times with full constitutional and legal authority and in our national interest response to impeachment charges the facts that of course is in dispute the nonpartisan government accountability office the investigative arm of congress found the white house violated federal law in withholding security assistance to ukraine an action at the center of trump s impeachment its report said the office of management and budget broke the law over the military aid which congress passed less than a year ago saying the president is not vested with the power to ignore or amend any such duly enacted law the money was held up last summer on orders from trump but freed up in september after congress pushed for its release and a whistleblower s complaint about trump s july call with the ukrainian leader became public the government accountability office said the white house budget office violated the impoundment control act by delaying the security assistance for policy reasons rather than technical budgetary needs the budget office has said it disagrees with that finding and the hold was appropriate and necessary trump argues he delayed the 391 million in u s assistance because of concerns about corruption although the defense department had already previously certified to congressional committees that ukraine had made enough progress on reducing corruption to receive the aid trump house democrats ran a fundamentally flawed and illegitimate process that denied the president every basic right including the right to have counsel present the right to cross examine witnesses response to impeachment charges trump we demand fairness shouts pelosi and the do nothing democrats yet the dems in the house wouldn t let us have 1 witness no lawyers or even ask questions tweet on jan 13 referring to house speaker nancy pelosi d calif the facts not true the house judiciary committee which produced the articles of impeachment invited trump or his legal team to come he declined absent white house representation the hearings proceeded as things in congress routinely do time is split between democratic and republican lawmakers to ask questions and engage in the debate lawyers for democrats and republicans on the committee presented the case for and against the impeachment articles and members questioned witnesses among them an academic called forward by republicans the first round of hearings was by the house intelligence committee and resembled the investigative phase of criminal cases conducted without the participation of the subject of the investigation trump cried foul then at the lack of representation then rejected representation when the next committee offered it his lawyers will participate in the senate s impeachment trial which resumes tuesday trump on house intelligence chairman adam schiff mr schiff created a fraudulent version of the july 25 call and read it to the american people at a congressional hearing without disclosing that he was simply making it all up response to impeachment charges the facts it s incorrect that schiff didn t disclose what he was doing trump is overstating schiff s exaggerations which the president has repeatedly described as lies and massive frauds the california democrat in what he said was a parody during a committee hearing in september was mocking the president s pleas in his july call to ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskiy as trump does with his critics routinely schiff made clear he was providing an account that was in essence what he believed trump was conveying to zelenskiy when shorn of its rambling character trump you had a fake whistleblower that wrote a report that bore no relationship to what was said everything was false remarks thursday the facts trump s statement is false the whistleblower s account of a phone call between trump and ukraine s leader in july closely resembled what was said judging by the rough transcript released later by the white house itself and by the testimony of officials who listened in on the call witnesses in the impeachment hearings and other sources also verified the whistleblower s description of events before and after the call as trump and his aides pressed ukraine to investigate one of trump s political rivals democrat joe biden the senate impeachment trial will explore whether trump abused his power trade trump on his trade agreement with china this is the biggest deal there is anywhere in the world by far remarks wednesday at the signing trump on the china deal and his updated north american trade agreement so we ve done two of the biggest trade deals they are the two biggest trade deals in the world ever done remarks at the white house on thursday the facts neither claim is true the china agreement is not nearly as big as the u s mexico canada agreement so it s not the largest ever much less by far the deal with canada and mexico was an update of the long standing north american free trade agreement worked out by presidents george h w bush and bill clinton the north american agreement also is not the largest ever for instance 123 countries signed the uruguay round agreement that liberalized trade and produced the world trade organization in 1994 the organization s initial membership accounted for more than 90 of global economic output the federal reserve bank of boston found and that was before china joined the organization also bigger the trans pacific partnership which would have joined north america with pacific rim countries in freer trade trump took the u s out after the deal was negotiated and before the u s ratified it the european union was formed from a giant deal the china deal leaves tariffs in place on about 360 billion in imports from china and pushes substantial remaining disputes ahead to a second phase of negotiations trump on china deal i did the biggest deal ever done in the history of our country yesterday in terms of trade and probably other things too if you think about it remarks thursday the facts trump is even more wildly off the mark in speculating that his china trade deal eclipses all other international agreements even outside trade the montreal protocol aimed at protecting earth s ozone layer was ratified by every member state of the united nations a variety of other agreements on the rights of children world health standards droughts achieved nearly universal ratification more than 190 countries signed the paris accord on climate change of which more than 180 have ratified it the u s is pulling out of it economy trump in wisconsin the unemployment rate has reached its lowest level in history milwaukee rally tuesday the facts he s citing outdated figures wisconsin did post a record low unemployment rate of 2 8 in april and may but it has since edged up and is now at 3 3 that s slightly lower than the u s average of 3 5 but suggests that the state hit a rough patch in the middle of last year trump more than 300 000 people under obama 300 000 people left the workforce under just three years of my administration 3 5 million people have joined the workforce milwaukee rally the facts trump is wrong about barack obama s record more than 5 million people joined the u s labor force during obama s presidency according to labor department figures these gains reflect the recovery from the great recession as well as population growth more than 4 8 million people have joined the labor force in three years of trump s presidency trump under the trump economy the lowest paid earners are reaping the biggest fastest and largest gains earnings for the bottom 10 are rising faster than earnings for the top 10 proportionally milwaukee rally the facts actually the top 10 of earners saw the biggest raises of any income bracket over the past year their usual weekly earnings jumped 8 or 168 according to the labor department the bottom 10 saw weekly incomes grow 7 or 30 over a broader range the top and bottom 25 weekly earnings also grew at faster rate for the wealthier group trump we ve created 7 million jobs since the election including more than 1 million manufacturing and construction jobs nobody thought that was possible milwaukee rally the facts his numbers are roughly right though they are less impressive than trump claims job gains under trump over the past three years were lower than during the final three years of obama s presidency more than 8 million jobs were added during that period under obama including 1 2 million combined in manufacturing and construction what these figures suggest is that much of the job growth under trump reflects the momentum from a recovery that officially began in the middle of 2009 immigration trump we have loopholes like a visa lottery we put things in the lottery and they come in they become american citizens do you think these countries are giving us their finest oh let s give them our best citizens milwaukee rally the facts this is a perpetual falsehood from the president countries don t nominate their citizens for the program they don t get to select people they d like to get rid of foreigners apply for the visas on their own under the program citizens of countries named by the u s can bid for visas if they have enough education or work experience in desired fields out of that pool of qualified applicants the state department randomly selects a much smaller pool of tentative winners not all winners will have visas approved because they still must compete for a smaller number of slots by getting their applications in quickly those who are ultimately offered visas still need to go through background checks like other immigrants trump mexico s paying for the wall you know that it s all worked out milwaukee rally the facts mexico isn t paying for trump s long promised border wall trump has argued that the updated trade agreement with canada and mexico will pay for the wall because of economic benefits he predicts will come from the deal nothing in the trade agreement would cover or refund the construction cost or require a payment from mexico child care biden on his early days in washington i was making 42 000 a year i commuted every single solitary day to wilmington delaware over 500 miles a day excuse me 250 miles a day because i could not afford child care it was beyond my reach democratic presidential debate tuesday the facts that s a stretch biden s wife and daughter died in a car accident after he won a senate seat in 1972 as a single parent working far out of town biden might have faced steeper child care costs than people who work locally do but his senate salary actually 42 500 was worth more than 256 000 in today s dollars that s more than four times the median household income health care trump i was the person who saved pre existing conditions in your healthcare you have it now tweet on jan 13 the facts that s false people with preexisting medical problems have health insurance protections because of obama s health care law which trump is trying to dismantle one of trump s major alternatives to obama s law short term health insurance already in place doesn t have to cover preexisting conditions another alternative is association health plans which are oriented to small businesses and sole proprietors and do cover preexisting conditions meanwhile trump s administration has been pressing in court for full repeal of the obama era law including provisions that protect people with preexisting conditions from health insurance discrimination with obamacare still in place insurers in the individual marketplace must take all applicants regardless of medical history and charge the same standard premiums to healthy people and those who have poor health or past medical problems before obama s law any insurer could deny coverage or charge more to anyone with a preexisting condition who was seeking to buy an individual policy bernie sanders medicare for all will cost substantially less than the status quo democratic debate the facts there s no guarantee of that the nonpartisan congressional budget office said in a report last year that total spending under a single payer system like the vermont senator and democratic presidential candidate favors might be higher or lower than under the current system depending on the key features of the new system those features have to do with the design of the system questions such as payment rates for hospitals and doctors and whether patients are required to pay part of the cost of their care sanders says his plan would require no cost sharing from patients no copays and no deductibles but completely free care could trigger a surge in demand for medical services raising costs other countries that provide coverage for all do use cost sharing to help keep spending in check a research report last year by the nonprofit rand think tank estimated that a medicare for all plan similar to what sanders wants would modestly raise total u s health spending military trump on killing iran gen qassem soleimani the democrats and the fake news are trying to make terrorist soleimani into a wonderful guy tweet on jan 13 trump you know what bothers me when i see a nancy pelosi trying to defend this monster from iran when nancy pelosi and the democrats want to defend him i think that s a very bad thing for this country remarks on jan 9 at event on environmental regulations the facts that s a fabrication democrats did not praise or defend the iranian general they criticized the action trump took pelosi called the u s missile strike provocative and disproportionate while branding soleimani a terrible person similarly democratic presidential candidates criticized trump s strategy and the fact he didn t notify or consult congress in advance while making clear they considered soleimani anything but wonderful the iranian was a murderer responsible for the deaths of thousands including hundreds of americans said massachusetts sen elizabeth warren even so republican rep doug collins of georgia asserted democrats were in love with terrorists then retracted the statement and apologized i left parts of my body in iraq fighting terrorists democratic sen tammy duckworth of ilinois a former army pilot who lost both her legs while serving in iraq told cnn after hearing collins initial remarks i don t need to justify myself to anyone trump our military has been totally rebuilt milwaukee rally the facts it hasn t the administration has accelerated a sharp buildup in defense spending but it will take years for freshly ordered tanks planes and other weapons to be built delivered and put to use the air force s minuteman 3 missiles for instance a key part of the u s nuclear force have been operating since the early 1970s and modernization started under the obama administration they are due to be replaced with a new version but not until later this decade biden i was asked to bring 156 000 troops home from that war which i did i led that effort democratic debate the facts biden is roughly right about bringing troops home but he didn t mention that the u s had to send some back obama did designate biden his vice president to take the lead in pulling u s forces out of iraq and coordinating efforts to maintain stability in baghdad his results were mixed biden and obama failed to win agreement from the iraqi government to keep a limited number of u s troops there after december 2011 that was the deadline for a complete u s pullout under a deal negotiated by the bush administration biden was still vice president when obama was compelled to return american troops to iraq in 2014 after the rise of the islamic state group electability trump on the 2016 election there have been some great movements where somebody came along and out of the nowhere won the state of new hampshire won iowa won south carolina down the way won a state someplace but we won 32 states the facts trump won 30 states not 32 it was no landslide he won with about 57 of electoral votes a comfortable margin but no better than average or below average obama and clinton each won bigger victories twice and many other presidents outperformed trump moreover republican trump lost the popular vote to democrat hillary clinton a rare occurrence for a winning candidate trump routinely inflates the number of electoral votes he won too associated press

strong result upcoming data should probably be viewed in the context of the increasing likelihood of a cut to the bank rate by the bank of england next week tomorrow morning s claimant count change

a super rich one percent of the world s population has accumulated twice as much wealth as the remaining 90 percent said a new report by oxfam a global charity the report has been released on january 20 2020 on the eve of the world economic forum in davos switzerland the gap between the filthy rich and the rest of humanity has reached grotesque proportions according to the report the report time to care focuses on the largely unpaid care work many women and girls take upon themselves the report said the world s top 22 richest men have now more wealth than all the women in africa it added at the bottom of the economy women and girls especially women and girls living in poverty and from marginalized groups are putting in 12 5 billion hours every day of care work for free and countless more for poverty wages their work is essential to our communities it underpins thriving families and a healthy and productive workforce the report said this great divide is based on a flawed and sexist economic system that values the wealth of the privileged few mostly men more than the billions of hours of the most essential work the unpaid and underpaid care work done primarily by women and girls around the world tending to others cooking cleaning and fetching water and firewood are essential daily tasks for the wellbeing of societies communities and the functioning of the economy the heavy and unequal responsibility of care work perpetuates gender and economic inequalities it said this broken economic model has accumulated vast wealth and power into the hands of a rich few in part by exploiting the labor of women and girls and systematically violating their rights only 2 153 there are only 2 153 billionaires in the world according to the report but their wealth matches that of more than 4 6 billion people or about 62 percent of the world s population estimated to stand at 7 7 billion the gap between the wealthy and all those who fare less well looks even more prominent if to compare the combined income of the richest of the rich the top one percent to that of some 6 9 billion people according to the report the one percenters boast more twice as much wealth as nearly 90 percent of the global population it said at the top of the global economy a small elite are unimaginably rich their wealth grows exponentially over time with little effort and regardless of whether they add value to society tax the rich oxfam said the only way to tackle inequality is to raise taxes taxing additional 0 5 percent of wealth of the top 1 percent over the next decade will provide governments with enough funds to create 117 million of jobs in health education elderly care and other sectors it said governments must act now to build a human economy that is feminist and values what truly matters to society rather than fuelling an endless pursuit of profit and wealth investing in national care systems to address the disproportionate responsibility for care work done by women and girls and introducing progressive taxation including taxing wealth and legislating in favor of carers are possible and crucial first steps it added one reason for these outsized returns is a collapse in taxation of the super rich and the biggest corporations because of falling tax rates and deliberate tax dodging at the same time only 4 of global tax comes from taxation of wealth and studies show that the super rich avoid as much as 30 of their tax liability extremely low corporate taxation helps them cream the profits from companies where they are the main shareholders between 2011 and 2017 average wages in g7 countries increased by 3 while dividends to wealthy shareholders grew by 31 while oxfam did not call any names in its report it appeared to have taken a thinly veiled jab at amazon ceo and founder of blue origin space company jeff bezos the on and off planet s richest man who however slipped to the second place this week behind the chairman and ceo of french luxury giant lvmh bernard arnault less than 5 50 a day the report cited world bank estimates almost half of the world s population lives on less than 5 50 a day and the rate of poverty reduction has halved since 2013 the oxfam report said many people are just one hospital bill or failed harvest away from destitution inequality is one of the major reasons for this a huge share of global income growth consistently accrues to those at the top leaving those at the bottom further and further behind the report cites thomas piketty and his team between 1980 and 2016 the richest 1 received 27 cents of each dollar of global income growth this was more than twice the share of the bottom 50 who secured only 12 cents of every dollar the report said if you saved 10 000 a day since the building of the pyramids in egypt you would have one fifth the average fortune of the 5 richest billionaires if everyone were to sit on their wealth piled up in 100 bills most of humanity would be sitting on the floor a middle class person in a rich country would be sitting at the height of a chair the world s two richest men would be sitting in outer space the monetary value of women s unpaid care work globally for women aged 15 and over is at least 10 8 trillion annually three times the size of the world s tech industry the very top of the economic pyramid sees trillions of dollars of wealth in the hands of a very small group of people predominantly men their wealth is already extreme and our broken economy concentrates more and more wealth into these few hands recently some commentators have asked whether it would be better for the world to abolish billionaires suggesting that they are a sign of economic sickness rather than economic health it has been estimated that one third of billionaire wealth exists because of inheritance such levels of inheritance have created a new aristocracy that undermines democracy once secured the fortunes of the super rich take on a momentum of their own the wealthiest people can simply sit back and watch their wealth grow with the help of highly paid accountants who have delivered them an average annual return of 7 4 on their wealth over the last ten years despite admirably committing to give his money away bill gates is still worth nearly 100bn which is twice what he had when he stood down as head of microsoft as well as doing care work for free at home many poor women also work providing care for others for example as domestic workers who are among the most exploited workers in the world just 10 of domestic workers are covered by general labor laws to the same extent as other workers and only around half enjoy equal minimum wage protection more than half of all domestic workers have no limits on work hours under national law in the most extreme cases of forced labor and trafficking domestic workers find themselves trapped in people s homes with every aspect of their lives controlled rendering them invisible and unprotected it is estimated that globally the 3 4 million domestic workers in forced labor are being robbed of 8bn every year equating to 60 of their due wages recognize unpaid and poorly paid care work which is done primarily by women and girls as a type of work or production that has real value reduce the total number of hours spent on unpaid care tasks through better access to affordable and quality timesaving devices and care supporting infrastructure redistribute unpaid care work more fairly within the household and simultaneously shift the responsibility of unpaid care work to the state and the private sector represent the most marginalized caregivers and ensure that they have a voice in the design and delivery of policies services and systems that affect their lives change is possible from engna legna besdet bringing together ethiopian domestic workers in lebanon to the domestic workers rising campaign in south africa women are demanding change and claiming their rights and governments are starting to listen uruguay s groundbreaking national integrated care enshrines the right to care and be cared for as well as care workers rights and new zealand introduced a celebrated wellbeing budget in 2019 but more action is needed over the past decade leading academics and even mainstream economic institutions such as the imf have produced robust evidence of the corrosive effects of inequality affected communities activists women s rights organizations and faith leaders have spoken out and have campaigned for change around the world recent protests for example against inequality and climate chaos from chile to germany are huge mainstream economic meetings such as those of the imf and the world economic forum have placed economic inequality on their agendas time and again however the inequality crisis remains fundamentally unaddressed the reality is that most world leaders are still pursuing policy agendas that drive greater gaps between the haves and the havenots leaders like president trump in the usa and president bolsonaro in brazil are exemplars of this trend offering regressive policy menus like tax cuts for billionaires obstructing measures to tackle the climate emergency or turbo charging racism sexism and hatred of minorities crucially today s economic system is built on sexism recommendations oxfam has proposed the following six actions to help realize the rights of carers and to start closing the gap between unpaid and underpaid care workers and the wealthy elite who have profited most from their labor the report s recommendations are 1 invest in national care systems to address the disproportionate responsibility for care work done by women and girls governments must invest in cross governmental national care systems in addition to investing in and transforming existing public services and infrastructure national care systems must include the provision of universal access to safe water sanitation and domestic energy systems and investments to deliver universal childcare eldercare and care for people with disabilities these should also include access to quality healthcare and education as well as the provision of universal social protection such as pensions and child benefits as part of national care systems governments must ensure a minimum of 14 weeks of paid maternity leave and the progressive realization of one year of paid parental leave including a phase of use it or lose it paternity leave 2 end extreme wealth to end extreme poverty extreme wealth is a sign of a failing economic system governments must take steps to radically reduce the gap between the rich and the rest of society and prioritize the wellbeing of all citizens over unsustainable growth and profit to avoid a world that caters only to a privileged few and consigns millions of people to poverty governments must take bold and decisive steps by taxing wealth and high incomes and cracking down on loopholes and the inadequate global tax rules that allow rich corporations and individuals to escape their tax responsibilities 3 legislate to protect the rights of all carers and secure living wages for paid care workers as part of their national care systems governments must ensure legal economic and labor market policies are in place to protect the rights of all carers and paid care workers in both formal and informal sectors and monitor their implementation this must include ratifying ilo convention 189 on the protection of domestic workers and policy to ensure that all care workers are paid a living wage and working towards the elimination of gender wage gaps 4 ensure that carers have influence on decision making processes governments must facilitate the participation of unpaid carers and care workers in policy making fora and processes at all levels and invest resources into collecting comprehensive data that can better inform policymaking and evaluate the impact of policies on carers this should be alongside consulting women s rights actors feminist economists and civil society experts on care issues and increased funding for women s organizations and movements working to enable their participation in decision making processes these measures are important building blocks of national care systems 5 challenge harmful norms and sexist beliefs harmful norms and sexist beliefs that see care work as the responsibility of women and girls lead to an unequal gendered distribution of care work and perpetuate economic and gender inequality as part of their national care systems governments need to invest resources to challenge these harmful norms and sexist beliefs including through advertising public communication and legislation further men need to step up to equally fulfill their responsibilities on care work to address the disproportionate amount of care done by women within households and communities 6 value care in business policies and practices businesses must recognize the value of care work and sustain the wellbeing of workers further they should support the redistribution of care through the provision of benefits and services such as crèches and childcare vouchers and ensure living wages for care providers companies and business should assume their responsibility for contributing to achieving the sustainable development goals by paying their fair share of taxes implementing family friendly employment practices such as flexible working hours and paid leave and using progressive advertising and public communication to challenge the gendered distribution of care work a broken economy the report said if the economic system is left to distribute the fruits of growth so unevenly we will never eliminate poverty unequal and unbridled growth is also unsustainable and makes it impossible to live within the environmental boundaries of our planet economic inequality is also built on gender inequality and the majority of those at the bottom of the economic pyramid are women women and girls are more likely to be found in poorly paid and precarious employment and they do the bulk of unpaid and underpaid care work the dominant model of capitalism actively exploits and drives traditional sexist beliefs that disempower women and girls counting on them to do this work but refusing to value them for it commenting on the findings oxfam india ceo amitabh behar said that while unpaid or poorly paid care work mostly done by women serves as the hidden engine that fuels the global economy broken economies are lining

the opening statements of his impeachment trial just as his tax cuts are far from the biggest in history the economy isn t the best ever and his election victory in 2016 was no landslide of historic proportions trump s two trade deals don t stand atop the field of presidential endeavors one is a partial settlement of trade grievances with china the other is a refresh of what past presidents created for north america meanwhile the democratic presidential contenders weren t immune from misrepresentation in their final debate before the first votes of the 2020 campaign in iowa a look at the claims impeachment trump via attorneys individuals who have stated for the record that they spoke to the president about the subject actually exonerate him ambassador to the european union gordon sondland stated that when he asked the president what he wanted from ukraine the president said i want nothing i want no quid pro quo r esponse to impeachment charges filed saturday the facts that assertion omits key context on what sondland told house investigators as one of the officials most deeply involved in trying to get ukraine to do trump s bidding sondland testified that there was indeed a quid pro quo in the matter and everyone was in the loop specifically sondland said it was understood that ukraine s new president would only get a meeting with trump in the oval office if he publicly pledged to investigate the bidens and the democrats was there a quid pro quo sondland asked in his statement to the house intelligence committee as i testified previously with regard to the requested white house call and white house meeting the answer is yes moreover on the more serious matter of withholding military aid to ukraine unless the country investigated democrats sondland testified that a this for that explanation was the only one that made sense to him testimony from other officials shored up the picture of a president and his associates systematically trying to get ukraine to do what trump wanted during a period when the military assistance approved by congress was put on hold without explanation ___ trump the president acted at all times with full constitutional and legal authority and in our national interest response to impeachment charges the facts that of course is in dispute the nonpartisan government accountability office the investigative arm of congress found the white house violated federal law in withholding security assistance to ukraine an action at the center of trump s impeachment its report said the office of management and budget broke the law over the military aid which congress passed less than a year ago saying the president is not vested with the power to ignore or amend any such duly enacted law the money was held up last summer on orders from trump but freed up in september after congress pushed for its release and a whistleblower s complaint about trump s july call with the ukrainian leader became public the government accountability office said the white house budget office violated the impoundment control act by delaying the security assistance for policy reasons rather than technical budgetary needs the budget office has said it disagrees with that finding and the hold was appropriate and necessary trump argues he delayed the 391 million in u s assistance because of concerns about corruption although the defense department had already previously certified to congressional committees that ukraine had made enough progress on reducing corruption to receive the aid ___ trump house democrats ran a fundamentally flawed and illegitimate process that denied the president every basic right including the right to have counsel present the right to cross examine witnesses response to impeachment charges trump we demand fairness shouts pelosi and the do nothing democrats yet the dems in the house wouldn t let us have 1 witness no lawyers or even ask questions tweet on jan 13 referring to house speaker nancy pelosi d calif the facts not true the house judiciary committee which produced the articles of impeachment invited trump or his legal team to come he declined absent white house representation the hearings proceeded as things in congress routinely do time is split between democratic and republican lawmakers to ask questions and engage in the debate lawyers for democrats and republicans on the committee presented the case for and against the impeachment articles and members questioned witnesses among them an academic called forward by republicans the first round of hearings was by the house intelligence committee and resembled the investigative phase of criminal cases conducted without the participation of the subject of the investigation trump cried foul then at the lack of representation then rejected representation when the next committee offered it his lawyers will participate in the senate s impeachment trial which resumes tuesday ___ trump on house intelligence chairman adam schiff mr schiff created a fraudulent version of the july 25 call and read it to the american people at a congressional hearing without disclosing that he was simply making it all up response to impeachment charges the facts it s incorrect that schiff didn t disclose what he was doing trump is overstating schiff s exaggerations which the president has repeatedly described as lies and massive frauds the california democrat in what he said was a parody during a committee hearing in september was mocking the president s pleas in his july call to ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskiy as trump does with his critics routinely schiff made clear he was providing an account that was in essence what he believed trump was conveying to zelenskiy when shorn of its rambling character ___ trump you had a fake whistleblower that wrote a report that bore no relationship to what was said everything was false remarks thursday the facts trump s statement is false the whistleblower s account of a phone call between trump and ukraine s leader in july closely resembled what was said judging by the rough transcript released later by the white house itself and by the testimony of officials who listened in on the call witnesses in the impeachment hearings and other sources also verified the whistleblower s description of events before and after the call as trump and his aides pressed ukraine to investigate one of trump s political rivals democrat joe biden the senate impeachment trial will explore whether trump abused his power ___ trade trump on his trade agreement with china this is the biggest deal there is anywhere in the world by far remarks wednesday at the signing trump on the china deal and his updated north american trade agreement so we ve done two of the biggest trade deals they are the two biggest trade deals in the world ever done remarks at the white house on thursday the facts neither claim is true the china agreement is not nearly as big as the u s mexico canada agreement so it s not the largest ever much less by far the deal with canada and mexico was an update of the long standing north american free trade agreement worked out by presidents george h w bush and bill clinton the north american agreement also is not the largest ever for instance 123 countries signed the uruguay round agreement that liberalized trade and produced the world trade organization in 1994 the organization s initial membership accounted for more than 90 of global economic output the federal reserve bank of boston found and that was before china joined the organization also bigger the trans pacific partnership which would have joined north america with pacific rim countries in freer trade trump took the u s out after the deal was negotiated and before the u s ratified it the european union was formed from a giant deal the china deal leaves tariffs in place on about 360 billion in imports from china and pushes substantial remaining disputes ahead to a second phase of negotiations ___ trump on china deal i did the biggest deal ever done in the history of our country yesterday in terms of trade and probably other things too if you think about it remarks thursday the facts trump is even more wildly off the mark in speculating that his china trade deal eclipses all other international agreements even outside trade the montreal protocol aimed at protecting earth s ozone layer was ratified by every member state of the united nations a variety of other agreements on the rights of children world health standards droughts achieved nearly universal ratification more than 190 countries signed the paris accord on climate change of which more than 180 have ratified it the u s is pulling out of it ___ economy trump in wisconsin the unemployment rate has reached its lowest level in history milwaukee rally tuesday the facts he s citing outdated figures wisconsin did post a record low unemployment rate of 2 8 in april and may but it has since edged up and is now at 3 3 that s slightly lower than the u s average of 3 5 but suggests that the state hit a rough patch in the middle of last year ___ trump more than 300 000 people under obama 300 000 people left the workforce under just three years of my administration 3 5 million people have joined the workforce milwaukee rally the facts trump is wrong about barack obama s record more than 5 million people joined the u s labor force during obama s presidency according to labor department figures these gains reflect the recovery from the great recession as well as population growth more than 4 8 million people have joined the labor force in three years of trump s presidency ___ trump under the trump economy the lowest paid earners are reaping the biggest fastest and largest gains earnings for the bottom 10 are rising faster than earnings for the top 10 proportionally milwaukee rally the facts actually the top 10 of earners saw the biggest raises of any income bracket over the past year their usual weekly earnings jumped 8 or 168 according to the labor department the bottom 10 saw weekly incomes grow 7 or 30 over a broader range the top and bottom 25 weekly earnings also grew at faster rate for the wealthier group ___ trump we ve created 7 million jobs since the election including more than 1 million manufacturing and construction jobs nobody thought that was possible milwaukee rally the facts his numbers are roughly right though they are less impressive than trump claims job gains under trump over the past three years were lower than during the final three years of obama s presidency more than 8 million jobs were added during that period under obama including 1 2 million combined in manufacturing and construction what these figures suggest is that much of the job growth under trump reflects the momentum from a recovery that officially began in the middle of 2009 ___ immigration trump we have loopholes like a visa lottery we put things in the lottery and they come in they become american citizens do you think these countries are giving us their finest oh let s give them our best citizens milwaukee rally the facts this is a perpetual falsehood from the president countries don t nominate their citizens for the program they don t get to select people they d like to get rid of foreigners apply for the visas on their own under the program citizens of countries named by the u s can bid for visas if they have enough education or work experience in desired fields out of that pool of qualified applicants the state department randomly selects a much smaller pool of tentative winners not all winners will have visas approved because they still must compete for a smaller number of slots by getting their applications in quickly those who are ultimately offered visas still need to go through background checks like other immigrants ___ trump mexico s paying for the wall you know that it s all worked out milwaukee rally the facts mexico isn t paying for trump s long promised border wall trump has argued that the updated trade agreement with canada and mexico will pay for the wall because of economic benefits he predicts will come from the deal nothing in the trade agreement would cover or refund the construction cost or require a payment from mexico ___ child care biden on his early days in washington i was making 42 000 a year i commuted every single solitary day to wilmington delaware over 500 miles a day excuse me 250 miles a day because i could not afford child care it was beyond my reach democratic presidential debate tuesday the facts that s a stretch biden s wife and daughter died in a car accident after he won a senate seat in 1972 as a single parent working far out of town biden might have faced steeper child care costs than people who work locally do but his senate salary actually 42 500 was worth more than 256 000 in today s dollars that s more than four times the median household income ___ health care trump i was the person who saved pre existing conditions in your healthcare you have it now tweet on jan 13 the facts that s false people with preexisting medical problems have health insurance protections because of obama s health care law which trump is trying to dismantle one of trump s major alternatives to obama s law short term health insurance already in place doesn t have to cover preexisting conditions another alternative is association health plans which are oriented to small businesses and sole proprietors and do cover preexisting conditions meanwhile trump s administration has been pressing in court for full repeal of the obama era law including provisions that protect people with preexisting conditions from health insurance discrimination with obamacare still in place insurers in the individual marketplace must take all applicants regardless of medical history and charge the same standard premiums to healthy people and those who have poor health or past medical problems before obama s law any insurer could deny coverage or charge more to anyone with a preexisting condition who was seeking to buy an individual policy ___ bernie sanders medicare for all will cost substantially less than the status quo democratic debate the facts there s no guarantee of that the nonpartisan congressional budget office said in a report last year that total spending under a single payer system like the vermont senator and democratic presidential candidate favors might be higher or lower than under the current system depending on the key features of the new system those features have to do with the design of the system questions such as payment rates for hospitals and doctors and whether patients are required to pay part of the cost of their care sanders says his plan would require no cost sharing from patients no copays and no deductibles but completely free care could trigger a surge in demand for medical services raising costs other countries that provide coverage for all do use cost sharing to help keep spending in check a research report last year by the nonprofit rand think tank estimated that a medicare for all plan similar to what sanders wants would modestly raise total u s health spending ___ military trump on killing iran gen qassem soleimani the democrats and the fake news are trying to make terrorist soleimani into a wonderful guy tweet on jan 13 trump you know what bothers me when i see a nancy pelosi trying to defend this monster from iran when nancy pelosi and the democrats want to defend him i think that s a very bad thing for this country remarks on jan 9 at event on environmental regulations the facts that s a fabrication democrats did not praise or defend the iranian general they criticized the action trump took pelosi called the u s missile strike provocative and disproportionate while branding soleimani a terrible person similarly democratic presidential candidates criticized trump s strategy and the fact he didn t notify or consult congress in advance while making clear they considered soleimani anything but wonderful the iranian was a murderer responsible for the deaths of thousands including hundreds of americans said massachusetts sen elizabeth warren even so republican rep doug collins of georgia asserted democrats were in love with terrorists then retracted the statement and apologized i left parts of my body in iraq fighting terrorists democratic sen tammy duckworth of ilinois a former army pilot who lost both her legs while serving in iraq told cnn after hearing collins initial remarks i don t need to justify myself to anyone ___ trump our military has been totally rebuilt milwaukee rally the facts it hasn t the administration has accelerated a sharp buildup in defense spending but it will take years for freshly ordered tanks planes and other weapons to be built delivered and put to use the air force s minuteman 3 missiles for instance a key part of the u s nuclear force have been operating since the early 1970s and modernization started under the obama administration they are due to be replaced with a new version but not until later this decade ___ biden i was asked to bring 156 000 troops home from that war which i did i led that effort democratic debate the facts biden is roughly right about bringing troops home but he didn t mention that the u s had to send some back obama did designate biden his vice president to take the lead in pulling u s forces out of iraq and coordinating efforts to maintain stability in baghdad his results were mixed biden and obama failed to win agreement from the iraqi government to keep a limited number of u s troops there after december 2011 that was the deadline for a complete u s pullout under a deal negotiated by the bush administration biden was still vice president when obama was compelled to return american troops to iraq in 2014 after the rise of the islamic state group ___ electability trump on the 2016 election there have been some great movements where somebody came along and out of the nowhere won the state of new hampshire won iowa won south carolina down the way won a state someplace but we won 32 states the facts trump won 30 states not 32 it was no landslide he won with about 57 of electoral votes a comfortable margin but no better than average or below average obama and clinton each won bigger victories twice and many other presidents outperformed trump moreover republican trump lost the popular vote to democrat hillary clinton a rare occurrence for a winning candidate trump routinely inflates the number of electoral votes he won too ___ associated press writers josh boak paul wiseman robert burns ricardo

photo wang zhao pool getty images if the relationship between china and the united states the world s two largest economies is the most important relationship in the world then arguably the second most important relationship is that between china and its neighbor japan the third largest economy wrote distinguished east asia expert ezra vogel indeed japan and china have been closely intertwined for more than 1 500 years through economic cultural and political connections perhaps longer than any other two countries hot economics cold politics in recent times political relations between japan and china have suffered from conflict different interpretations of history territorial disputes and japan s close political relationship with the u s but since the opening of china to the world economy in 1978 business and economic connections between these two countries have blossomed thanks to their geographical proximity and natural complementaries china s rising middle class provides a welcome market for a japan mired in demographic stagnation while japan s advanced technology offers many benefits to china including essential components for companies like huawei and products that china assembles on behalf of companies like apple the japan china relationship is often described as hot economics cold politics a major rebooting of the japan china economic partnership occurred in 1978 when chinese vice premier deng xiaoping visited japan the first ever visit of a chinese state leader massive technology transfer vice premier deng xiaoping visited a panasonic tv factory in osaka and said to company founder kōnosuke matsushita mr matsushita you are called the god of management in japan would you be willing to help us advance the modernization of china the founder immediately responded we will do whatever we can to contribute to the modernization of china throughout the 1980s mr matsushita transferred technology trained chinese workers and otherwise helped china modernize its industry through 150 separate projects china learned how mr matsushita made everything from electric irons to transformers and semiconductors panasonic s investment in china was just the beginning of the wave of japanese investment in china the total stock of japanese foreign direct investment in china stood at some 124 billion at the end of 2018 with about 23 000 japanese companies now having operations in china japan s biggest trading partner in the early days japanese manufacturing companies in the motor vehicle electronics and heavy industries were taking advantage of china s low cost structure but today the buying power of china s emerging middle class is a growing attraction for japanese companies with such a strong investment relationship it is not surprising that china has also become japan s most important trading partner trade has increased from 1 billion to some 317 billion over the past 45 years and now represents more than 20 of japan s total trade even though it has suffered recently from the u s administration s trade war and china s slowdown japan is also china s third largest trading partner the recent agreement by 15 regional economies including both japan and china for the regional comprehensive economic partnership will only improve the foundations for trade relations chinese tourists today japan s services trade is being driven by a veritable boom in inbound tourists with the number of visitors leaping from around 8 million in 2008 to more than 31 million in 2018 and not surprisingly chinese tourists now the biggest group visiting japan have been behind this boom we seem to be witnessing a slow drift of japan to a more independent role in the indo pacific and in its global relations in 2018 some 8 4 million chinese tourists visited japan and spent a whopping 13 billion accounting for nearly 34 of all spending by foreign visitors japan has also experienced a boom in international students with 300 000 students in japan in 2018 up from 124 000 a decade earlier once again china is leading the way accounting for 115 000 of these students way ahead of vietnam in second place with 72 000 chinese immigrants a similar story applies to immigration in 2018 there were some 2 7 million foreign residents in japan an increase of 270 since 1990 representing 2 2 of the national population china has now jumped ahead of korea as japan s biggest source of foreign residents with close to 800 thousand many of these chinese residents are skilled workers the reorientation of japan s economy toward china represents a paradigm shift from 1945 until the 1970s when the people s republic of china was finally recognized by the u s and japan the u s held japan back from doing business with china much to the chagrin of japanese business the u s japan security alliance gave the u s great sway over japanese foreign policy and japanese exports were thus more focussed on the u s market america accelerating the realignment but with the progressive rise of a more open and dynamic china over the past few decades it was only natural that the historical pattern of close sino japanese economic relations would re emerge and the recent disdain of the u s in regional free trade agreements like the trans pacific partnership will only further marginalize the u s as a trading partner for japan and other asian countries more generally as economic relations are drawing japan and china closer together so too is the erratic behavior of the u s especially in the trade wars with the u s perceived as an unreliable political and economic partner it is only natural that japan and china seek cooperation together while japan followed america s lead in not signing up to china s belt and road initiative it is now seeking to cooperate with the project and both japanese and chinese leaders now speak positively of the new era of sino japan relations moving past historic rifts we cannot say that japan is moving away from the u s and toward china the u s has long been japan s security guarantor and japan still feels more comfortable being aligned with another democracy the japan china relationship still has many deep historical scars too and japan is concerned at china s military buildup and assertive behavior in the east and south china seas but we do seem to be witnessing a slow drift of japan to a more independent role in the indo pacific and in its global relations and as part of this its relationship with china has become more important and will likely continue to increase in importance in the decades to come it s even possible that closer people to people contacts between japan and china will eventually soothe some of the wounds of history in tandem with generational change and thereby improve each country s low public opinion of the other indeed evidence is now appearing of chinese public attitudes to japan starting to warm

by clint siegner narayana kocherlakota the former president of the federal reserve bank of minneapolis wants you to know the federal government can never borrow too much money our government already borrowed 23 trillion and deficits are expected to exceed 1 trillion per year he knows many americans feel anxious about the federal government going bankrupt and he has a simple solution he just wrote the following in an editorial published by bloomberg policy makers and voters often express concern about the level of the federal deficit which topped 1 trillion last year and the national debt now more than 23 trillion but unlike a household that owes money to a bank the u s government has the ability to tax its creditors this power means that the federal government can afford any level of debt that is owed to american taxpayers there you have it government can tax americans for whatever is needed the solution is so simple any dim wit could have come up with it as a matter of fact one did federal reserve bankers have always received unnatural reverence for their wisdom and piety it s refreshing when one of them puts their patently stupid indeed evil ideas on public display the people running our central bank come from the same stock as the liars schemers and sociopaths who run the federal government and wall street the sooner americans figure that out the better toward that end we have some follow up questions for kocherlakota we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us have you considered the track record of nations that borrowed and spent without restraint we can find lots of examples of nations that collapsed when leaders like you arrogantly assumed they could get away with borrowing spending and taxing in confidence destroying amounts what do you expect will happen to the treasury market when your tax is imposed on creditors do you expect them to continue lining up after they discover they must both lend money and then bear the cost of its repayment too what if creditors the people who buy treasuries tend to be better politically connected than people who don t buy treasuries will politicians really impose a massive tax on these people or is it possible they will stick it to the poor and middle class instead when they get cornered and have to raise taxes of course kocherlakota is well aware his cabal of central bankers and politicians is already taxing americans heavily and lying about it the tax is called inflation and it is severely underreported the federal reserve is printing money to buy federal debt officials there pushed interest rates to epic lows and kept them near there for most of a decade as a consequence the federal reserve notes americans saved are worth a lot less the purchasing power was transferred to washington and wall street the recipients of all the monetary stimulus the effect is exactly like income tax and the myriad other federal taxes people pay all that borrowed currency is fueling the massive expansion in government financial services gobble up an ever larger chunk of the nation s gdp and wealth inequality just keeps getting bigger kocherlakota published his solution for unlimited government borrowing in a misguided attempt to put people at ease but have a look at the comment section below the editorial those who gave it a serious read were aghast thank goodness
washington in his first formal response to impeachment charges president donald trump misrepresented the testimony of a key witness who described an exchange of favors in the ukraine matter the claim marked a week of frequent exaggeration and distortion by the president heading into the opening statements of his impeachment trial just as his tax cuts are far from the biggest in history the economy isn t the best ever and his election victory in 2016 was no landslide of historic proportions trump s two trade deals don t stand atop the field of presidential endeavors one is a partial settlement of trade grievances with china the other is a refresh of what past presidents created for north america meanwhile the democratic presidential contenders weren t immune from misrepresentation in their final debate before the first votes of the 2020 campaign in iowa a look at the claims impeachment trump via attorneys individuals who have stated for the record that they spoke to the president about the subject actually exonerate him ambassador to the european union gordon sondland stated that when he asked the president what he wanted from ukraine the president said i want nothing i want no quid pro quo response to impeachment charges filed saturday the facts that assertion omits key context on what sondland told house investigators as one of the officials most deeply involved in trying to get ukraine to do trump s bidding sondland testified that there was indeed a quid pro quo in the matter and everyone was in the loop specifically sondland said it was understood that ukraine s new president would only get a meeting with trump in the oval office if he publicly pledged to investigate the bidens and the democrats was there a quid pro quo sondland asked in his statement to the house intelligence committee as i testified previously with regard to the requested white house call and white house meeting the answer is yes moreover on the more serious matter of withholding military aid to ukraine unless the country investigated democrats sondland testified that a this for that explanation was the only one that made sense to him testimony from other officials shored up the picture of a president and his associates systematically trying to get ukraine to do what trump wanted during a period when the military assistance approved by congress was put on hold without explanation trump the president acted at all times with full constitutional and legal authority and in our national interest response to impeachment charges the facts that of course is in dispute the nonpartisan government accountability office the investigative arm of congress found the white house violated federal law in withholding security assistance to ukraine an action at the center of trump s impeachment its report said the office of management and budget broke the law over the military aid which congress passed less than a year ago saying the president is not vested with the power to ignore or amend any such duly enacted law the money was held up last summer on orders from trump but freed up in september after congress pushed for its release and a whistleblower s complaint about trump s july call with the ukrainian leader became public the government accountability office said the white house budget office violated the impoundment control act by delaying the security assistance for policy reasons rather than technical budgetary needs the budget office has said it disagrees with that finding and the hold was appropriate and necessary trump argues he delayed the 391 million in u s assistance because of concerns about corruption although the defense department had already previously certified to congressional committees that ukraine had made enough progress on reducing corruption to receive the aid trump house democrats ran a fundamentally flawed and illegitimate process that denied the president every basic right including the right to have counsel present the right to cross examine witnesses response to impeachment charges trump we demand fairness shouts pelosi and the do nothing democrats yet the dems in the house wouldn t let us have 1 witness no lawyers or even ask questions tweet on jan 13 referring to house speaker nancy pelosi the facts not true the house judiciary committee which produced the articles of impeachment invited trump or his legal team to come he declined absent white house representation the hearings proceeded as things in congress routinely do time is split between democratic and republican lawmakers to ask questions and engage in the debate lawyers for democrats and republicans on the committee presented the case for and against the impeachment articles and members questioned witnesses among them an academic called forward by republicans the first round of hearings was by the house intelligence committee and resembled the investigative phase of criminal cases conducted without the participation of the subject of the investigation trump cried foul then at the lack of representation then rejected representation when the next committee offered it his lawyers will participate in the senate s impeachment trial which resumes tuesday trump on house intelligence chairman adam schiff mr schiff created a fraudulent version of the july 25 call and read it to the american people at a congressional hearing without disclosing that he was simply making it all up response to impeachment charges the facts it s incorrect that schiff didn t disclose what he was doing trump is overstating schiff s exaggerations which the president has repeatedly described as lies and massive frauds the california democrat in what he said was a parody during a committee hearing in september was mocking the president s pleas in his july call to ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskiy as trump does with his critics routinely schiff made clear he was providing an account that was in essence what he believed trump was conveying to zelenskiy when shorn of its rambling character trump you had a fake whistleblower that wrote a report that bore no relationship to what was said everything was false remarks thursday the facts trump s statement is false the whistleblower s account of a phone call between trump and ukraine s leader in july closely resembled what was said judging by the rough transcript released later by the white house itself and by the testimony of officials who listened in on the call witnesses in the impeachment hearings and other sources also verified the whistleblower s description of events before and after the call as trump and his aides pressed ukraine to investigate one of trump s political rivals democrat joe biden the senate impeachment trial will explore whether trump abused his power trade trump on his trade agreement with china this is the biggest deal there is anywhere in the world by far remarks wednesday at the signing trump on the china deal and his updated north american trade agreement so we ve done two of the biggest trade deals they are the two biggest trade deals in the world ever done remarks at the white house on thursday the facts neither claim is true the china agreement is not nearly as big as the u s mexico canada agreement so it s not the largest ever much less by far the deal with canada and mexico was an update of the long standing north american free trade agreement worked out by presidents george h w bush and bill clinton the north american agreement also is not the largest ever for instance 123 countries signed the uruguay round agreement that liberalized trade and produced the world trade organization in 1994 the organization s initial membership accounted for more than 90 of global economic output the federal reserve bank of boston found and that was before china joined the organization also bigger the trans pacific partnership which would have joined north america with pacific rim countries in freer trade trump took the u s out after the deal was negotiated and before the u s ratified it the european union was formed from a giant deal the china deal leaves tariffs in place on about 360 billion in imports from china and pushes substantial remaining disputes ahead to a second phase of negotiations trump on china deal i did the biggest deal ever done in the history of our country yesterday in terms of trade and probably other things too if you think about it remarks thursday the facts trump is even more wildly off the mark in speculating that his china trade deal eclipses all other international agreements even outside trade the montreal protocol aimed at protecting earth s ozone layer was ratified by every member state of the united nations a variety of other agreements on the rights of children world health standards droughts achieved nearly universal ratification more than 190 countries signed the paris accord on climate change of which more than 180 have ratified it the u s is pulling out of it economy trump in wisconsin the unemployment rate has reached its lowest level in history milwaukee rally tuesday the facts he s citing outdated figures wisconsin did post a record low unemployment rate of 2 8 in april and may but it has since edged up and is now at 3 3 that s slightly lower than the u s average of 3 5 but suggests that the state hit a rough patch in the middle of last year trump more than 300 000 people under obama 300 000 people left the workforce under just three years of my administration 3 5 million people have joined the workforce milwaukee rally the facts trump is wrong about barack obama s record more than 5 million people joined the u s labor force during obama s presidency according to labor department figures these gains reflect the recovery from the great recession as well as population growth more than 4 8 million people have joined the labor force in three years of trump s presidency trump under the trump economy the lowest paid earners are reaping the biggest fastest and largest gains earnings for the bottom 10 are rising faster than earnings for the top 10 proportionally milwaukee rally the facts actually the top 10 of earners saw the biggest raises of any income bracket over the past year their usual weekly earnings jumped 8 or 168 according to the labor department the bottom 10 saw weekly incomes grow 7 or 30 over a broader range the top and bottom 25 weekly earnings also grew at faster rate for the wealthier group trump we ve created 7 million jobs since the election including more than 1 million manufacturing and construction jobs nobody thought that was possible milwaukee rally the facts his numbers are roughly right though they are less impressive than trump claims job gains under trump over the past three years were lower than during the final three years of obama s presidency more than 8 million jobs were added during that period under obama including 1 2 million combined in manufacturing and construction what these figures suggest is that much of the job growth under trump reflects the momentum from a recovery that officially began in the middle of 2009 immigration trump we have loopholes like a visa lottery we put things in the lottery and they come in they become american citizens do you think these countries are giving us their finest oh let s give them our best citizens milwaukee rally the facts this is a perpetual falsehood from the president countries don t nominate their citizens for the program they don t get to select people they d like to get rid of foreigners apply for the visas on their own under the program citizens of countries named by the u s can bid for visas if they have enough education or work experience in desired fields out of that pool of qualified applicants the state department randomly selects a much smaller pool of tentative winners not all winners will have visas approved because they still must compete for a smaller number of slots by getting their applications in quickly those who are ultimately offered visas still need to go through background checks like other immigrants trump mexico s paying for the wall you know that it s all worked out milwaukee rally the facts mexico isn t paying for trump s long promised border wall trump has argued that the updated trade agreement with canada and mexico will pay for the wall because of economic benefits he predicts will come from the deal nothing in the trade agreement would cover or refund the construction cost or require a payment from mexico child care biden on his early days in washington i was making 42 000 a year i commuted every single solitary day to wilmington delaware over 500 miles a day excuse me 250 miles a day because i could not afford child care it was beyond my reach democratic presidential debate tuesday the facts that s a stretch biden s wife and daughter died in a car accident after he won a senate seat in 1972 as a single parent working far out of town biden might have faced steeper child care costs than people who work locally do but his senate salary actually 42 500 was worth more than 256 000 in today s dollars that s more than four times the median household income health care trump i was the person who saved pre existing conditions in your healthcare you have it now tweet on jan 13 the facts that s false people with preexisting medical problems have health insurance protections because of obama s health care law which trump is trying to dismantle one of trump s major alternatives to obama s law short term health insurance already in place doesn t have to cover preexisting conditions another alternative is association health plans which are oriented to small businesses and sole proprietors and do cover preexisting conditions meanwhile trump s administration has been pressing in court for full repeal of the obama era law including provisions that protect people with preexisting conditions from health insurance discrimination with obamacare still in place insurers in the individual marketplace must take all applicants regardless of medical history and charge the same standard premiums to healthy people and those who have poor health or past medical problems before obama s law any insurer could deny coverage or charge more to anyone with a preexisting condition who was seeking to buy an individual policy bernie sanders medicare for all will cost substantially less than the status quo democratic debate the facts there s no guarantee of that the nonpartisan congressional budget office said in a report last year that total spending under a single payer system like the vermont senator and democratic presidential candidate favors might be higher or lower than under the current system depending on the key features of the new system those features have to do with the design of the system questions such as payment rates for hospitals and doctors and whether patients are required to pay part of the cost of their care sanders says his plan would require no cost sharing from patients no copays and no deductibles but completely free care could trigger a surge in demand for medical services raising costs other countries that provide coverage for all do use cost sharing to help keep spending in check a research report last year by the nonprofit rand think tank estimated that a medicare for all plan similar to what sanders wants would modestly raise total u s health spending military trump on killing iran gen qassem soleimani the democrats and the fake news are trying to make terrorist soleimani into a wonderful guy tweet on jan 13 trump you know what bothers me when i see a nancy pelosi trying to defend this monster from iran when nancy pelosi and the democrats want to defend him i think that s a very bad thing for this country remarks on jan 9 at event on environmental regulations the facts that s a fabrication democrats did not praise or defend the iranian general they criticized the action trump took pelosi called the u s missile strike provocative and disproportionate while branding soleimani a terrible person similarly democratic presidential candidates criticized trump s strategy and the fact he didn t notify or consult congress in advance while making clear they considered soleimani anything but wonderful the iranian was a murderer responsible for the deaths of thousands including hundreds of americans said massachusetts sen elizabeth warren even so republican rep doug collins of georgia asserted democrats were in love with terrorists then retracted the statement and apologized i left parts of my body in iraq fighting terrorists democratic sen tammy duckworth of illinois a former army pilot who lost both her legs while serving in iraq told cnn after hearing collins initial remarks i don t need to justify myself to anyone trump our military has been totally rebuilt milwaukee rally the facts it hasn t the administration has accelerated a sharp buildup in defense spending but it will take years for freshly ordered tanks planes and other weapons to be built delivered and put to use the air force s minuteman 3 missiles for instance a key part of the u s nuclear force have been operating since the early 1970s and modernization started under the obama administration they are due to be replaced with a new version but not until later this decade biden i was asked to bring 156 000 troops home from that war which i did i led that effort democratic debate the facts biden is roughly right about bringing troops home but he didn t mention that the u s had to send some back obama did designate biden his vice president to take the lead in pulling u s forces out of iraq and coordinating efforts to maintain stability in baghdad his results were mixed biden and obama failed to win agreement from the iraqi government to keep a limited number of u s troops there after december 2011 that was the deadline for a complete u s pullout under a deal negotiated by the bush administration biden was still vice president when obama was compelled to return american troops to iraq in 2014 after the rise of the islamic state group electability trump on the 2016 election there have been some great movements where somebody came along and out of the nowhere won the state of new hampshire won iowa won south carolina down the way won a state someplace but we won 32 states the facts trump won 30 states not 32 it was no landslide he won with about 57 of electoral votes a comfortable margin but no better than average or below average obama and clinton each won bigger victories twice and many other presidents outperformed trump moreover republican trump lost the popular vote to democrat hillary clinton a rare occurrence for a winning candidate trump routinely inflates the number of electoral votes he won too
