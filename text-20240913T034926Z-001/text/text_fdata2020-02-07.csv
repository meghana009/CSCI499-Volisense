state bureaucracy and rentier capital state bureaucracy and rentier capital venezuela is undergoing a rentier capitalist implosion made worse by imperial intervention violent domestic right wing opposition and the fusion of the interests of the state and capitalists within the maduro regime nicolás maduro at national constituent assembly on january 14 2020 carolina cabral getty images this article is part of a forum on the ongoing crisis in venezuela at the end of may 2019 the central bank of venezuela released the first official figures on inflation and gross domestic product in the country since 2015 which roughly correspond with recent estimates from the international monetary fund as well as independent economists according to the bank inflation reached 130 000 percent in venezuela in 2018 well surpassing the 50 percent technical threshold of hyperinflation after averaging 863 percent over 2017 while gdp contracted by 22 5 percent year on year in the third quarter of the same year the last quarter for which figures are available venezuelan gdp has been in free fall since the outset of 2014 shrinking by at least 10 percent in every quarter since the end of 2015 economic growth in venezuela closely tracks the international price of oil its national cycles of capital accumulation are rooted overwhelmingly in the appropriation of oil rents oil dependency while hardly introduced by hugo chávez or nicolás maduro has accelerated alongside deindustrialization since the outset of the bolivarian process in the late 1990s an overvalued currency among other factors made imports cheap and exports expensive when prices were high as in 2012 oil constituted close to 95 percent of the total value of the country s exports even when the price was relatively low as in 1998 oil still accounted for approximately 65 percent of export value accordingly venezuela grew at an explosive rate of 18 percent in 2004 and maintained an average of 8 percent growth from 2005 to 2008 in a context of favorable world market conditions this optimal scenario enabled the high period of nationalizations in sectors such as cement steel telecommunications banking and mining it also undergirded popular features of the bolivarian process such as the health and education missions dramatically declining levels of poverty and ambitious anti imperial regional initiatives like the bolivarian alternative for the peoples of our america alba venezuela and the global crisis in the immediate fallout from the most recent global crisis of capitalism however the price of oil fell reaching a low of 35 per barrel it recovered to 120 over the 2011 2013 period but in 2014 and 2015 plummeted again at least relative to the peaks of the mid 2000s by this point public expenditure had become much greater than in the early years under chávez as had the structural reliance on imports this formed the basic material backdrop to venezuela s intensifying economic crisis a forty five page internal report from the united nations published in march 2019 indicates that 60 percent of the venezuelan population now lives in extreme poverty with consumption of meat and vegetables dropping precipitously from 2014 to 2017 approximately 3 7 million people suffer from undernourishment with 22 percent of children experiencing chronic malnutrition preventable diseases like tuberculosis diptheria measles and malaria have made a comeback roughly 300 000 people are at acute risk due to lack of access to medicines dialysis and treatment for hiv and parkinson s the financial times reports that migrant outflows from venezuela will reach 6 5 million by the end of this year mainly to neighboring colombia but also in significant numbers to peru chile ecuador brazil and argentina twenty two thousand doctors a third of the country s total have left the country as part of a vast migrant exodus of technical professionals in no sense is this a crisis of socialism what we are witnessing is the particular form capitalist crisis has assumed in venezuela s oil economy in the long aftermath of the global great recession this is a rentier capitalist implosion made worse by a perfect storm of imperial intervention violent domestic right wing opposition to the government of nicolás maduro and the conservative fusion of the interests of the state and a particular fraction of capital within the regime itself the imperial dimension international socialists living outside of venezuela and particularly those of us in the global north have been correct to focus first analytically and politically on the role of imperialism in exacerbating the country s crisis and attempting to undermine the basic principle that the shape of venezuela s future should be determined by venezuelans themselves the south american nation has receded from donald trump s foreign policy attentions in recent months early in 2019 however venezuela seemed to be of pivotal importance to the american imperium s calculus as evidenced by the u s led recognition of juan guaidó s self declaration as venezuela s interim president and direct u s support for his spectacularly ill conceived coup attempt at the end of april that year while grand geopolitical concerns have seemingly shifted elsewhere the u s sanctions imposed on venezuela by presidential decree in august 2017 and january 2019 remain in place as do de facto economic constraints confronting the maduro administration in the wake of u s recognition of a parallel government led by guaidó according to a detailed report for the center for economic and policy research in washington by economists mark weisbrot and jeffrey sachs the sanctions have gravely impacted the venezuelan population s caloric intake the country s disease and mortality rates the migrant exodus oil production power outages and the government s ability to deal with the economic crisis more generally according to the report u s sanctions made a substantial contribution to a 31 percent increase in general mortality in the country from 2017 to 2018 or more than 40 000 deaths whether or not maduro s administration would have taken the measures necessary for an economic recovery in the absence of sanctions weisbrot and sachs convincingly demonstrate that they have worsened the already massive dimensions of the crisis in venezuela they have cut off the country from international financial markets and prevented a restructuring of its debt while also restricting venezuela s access to foreign exchange used to import food medicine medical equipment and other basic necessities by further undercutting its oil production and capacity to sell it abroad the united states has also seized billions of dollars worth of venezuela s foreign assets such as the majority state owned oil refinery and transport company citgo which is based in the united states with the help of allied institutions like the bank of england the united states has also frozen much of venezuela s 6 6 billion in foreign reserves a significant portion of which are held in gold real gdp fell roughly 37 4 percent in 2019 even if the threats of u s military intervention or a right wing coup d état have diminished for the foreseeable future opposition to imperial sanctions must remain a priority characterizing the regime alongside axiomatic anti imperialism however there must also be a full analysis of the class character and nature of the maduro regime and an assessment of its role in the crisis even a cursory examination demonstrates that the maduro administration in no way represents the interests of venezuela s lower orders meaningful international solidarity requires continuing to reach out to those social forces as beleaguered and minoritarian as they are at present committed to building an anti capitalist left that is simultaneously independent of maduro free of any association with the domestic right and anti imperialist to its core those left wing analyses that suggest that an economic war being carried out by the venezuelan bourgeoisie accounts for the bulk of the crisis are deeply unconvincing other analyses confuse the systematic orientation of economic management under maduro for a series of irrational technical errors that simply require policy correction from new advisers with better advice to offer still others draw up balance sheets of the good and the bad aspects of the maduro s rule without offering sufficient analytical explanation for the logic of these divergent phenomena or the overarching class character of the government none of these analyses can offer much insight into the continuing class logic behind maduro s ostensibly irrational economic policy nor any solid basis for the venezuelan socialist left to determine its relationship to the government as patrick guillaudat has pointed out in viento sur one key facet in understanding the character of the maduro regime is to grasp the hegemony within it of the so called bolibourgeoisie and the evolution of this fraction of the venezuelan capitalist class the bolibourgeoisie began its formation in the early to mid periods of chávez s rule as a group of domestic capitalists who enriched themselves spectacularly through speculation on currency and opportunities opened up through close political relations with the chávez government the bolibourgeoisie has since expanded in social weight and political power a second pillar of the bolibourgeoisie formed as a bureaucratic layer within the state apparatus creating vast opportunities for corruption on the part of high ranking bureaucrats in the mid to late chávez era these bureaucrats enriched themselves and then gradually invested their private fortunes in legal capitalist enterprises and joint activities with international capital in other words former bureaucrats have become proper capitalists without abandoning their positions within the state the scale of such private accumulation through mechanisms of corruption facilitated by state policy is difficult to exaggerate and it began well before maduro came to office one such mechanism was sitme the notorious preferential exchange rate for import firms aiming to obtain u s dollars to purchase merchandise on the world market and then sell it at the normal exchange rate in bolívares in the domestic market in 2012 then minister of finance and planning jorge giordani publicly denounced this arrangement arguing that it had facilitated corruption at all levels of state power amounting to the disappearance of 25 billion of state revenue giordani was expelled from the maduro government in june 2014 as the venezuelan economist manuel sutherland has suggested it wasn t simply that the government s monetary policy amounted to a transfer of oil rent from the state to private importers with ties to the administration which would have been bad enough but also that many of these supposed imports did not actually materialize with disturbing frequency no merchandise ever arrived in the country between 2003 and 2012 the value of these often fraudulent imports rose from 14 billion to 80 billion departing significantly from giordani s conservative estimate the consultancy firm ecoanalítica estimates that these years witnessed the loss of 69 5 billion through fraudulent imports finally and most critically the third pillar of the bolibourgeoisie involves powerful military figures drawing on their enhanced infrastructural power within the state military officials have entered the ranks of the bolibourgeoisie with a vengeance since maduro took office maduro s cabinet has had an average of more than 30 percent of positions occupied by active or retired military officials since 2014 including general vladimir padrino lópez as minister of defense and general néstor reverol as interior minister and overseer of the civilian security forces in 2017 general of the national guard manuel quevedo was named both minister of energy and president of the state oil company pdvsa general iván hernández dala is head of the presidential guard and the military counter intelligence agency dgcim and general manuel cristopher figuera is head of the secret police sebin of venezuela s twenty three states the united socialist party of venezuela psuv controls twenty governorships seven of which are occupied by military officers military officials are also prominent in positions of power within the national constituent assembly the presidency of which is occupied by active captain diosdado cabello the fusion of state power exercised by high ranking military personnel and the increasing economic power of the military elite in both public and private capitalist enterprises is evident on a number of fronts military figures now control key national corporations in addition to pdvsa such as caracas metro steel and aluminum enterprises and the national electric corporation they also enjoy tremendous power over the importation and distribution of subsidized foodstuffs and medicine and control the country s main ports francine jácome writing in nueva sociedad points out that since 2013 several explicitly military enterprises have been established the bank of the bolivarian national armed forces banfanb a television channel tvfanb a transport company emiltra an agricultural enterprise agrofanb and a mining oil and natural gas company camimpeg guillaudat counts ten further military corporations in transport agriculture construction water and telecommunications at least 785 active and retired military officials also manage private companies that have won lucrative contracts with the government in construction imports medicine food and health the rise of these military capitalists requires us to understand the imbrication of state and fractions of capital in contemporary venezuela rather than assuming as in the common colloquial and academic language of business state relations an unambiguous separation of state actors from private entrepreneurship and state enterprises from processes of capital accumulation taken together the constituent parts of the bolibourgeois class fraction are the most influential actors within the maduro administration and their interests are behind the class logic of seemingly irrational exchange rate policies and other apparent instances of economic mismanagement their ability to reproduce themselves as a capitalist class fraction is contingent on the reproduction of the maduro administration as a whole which helps to explain the paltry support of the military elite for the most recent u s backed coup attempt headed by guaidó the power of the bolibourgeoisie at present is perhaps nowhere more viscerally on display than in the recent establishment of special economic zones most emblematically the orinoco mining arc located in the state of bolívar with a surface area bigger than portugal the legislation surrounding these zones together with supplemental laws guaranteeing greater protections for foreign investors is designed to attract international capital to enter into joint contracts with military state enterprises such as camimpeg and to override the considerable social indigenous and environmental concerns with the intensification of extractive capitalism that these endeavors imply camimpeg has already entered into agreements with the anglo swiss corporation glencore a firm with a notable record of corruption and environmental abuse and the british oil company southern procurement services according to guillaudat in the state elections of october 2017 the national electoral council cne initially proclaimed the victor in the state of bolívar to be the candidate of the oppositional party a new time andrés velásquez two days later however the cne annulled its initial announcement and declared justo noguera pietri the psuv s candidate governor pietri an ex general commander of the national guard will manage the rollout of the orinoco mining arc initiative exits the present conflict between the right wing opposition and the maduro government is fundamentally a political confrontation between different fractions of venezuelan capital one backed by the imperial power of the united states and international financial markets the other by the venezuelan state and to some extent chinese and russian imperialism which has retained its rentier capitalist character throughout the chávez and maduro eras an emancipatory project of socialism from below cannot hope to wed itself to either fraction and survive the difficult but necessary task facing independent socialists is to navigate an independent struggle against imperial intervention total

while addressing the world economic forum at davos in january prime minister imran khan claimed that the year 2020 will be one of economic growth for pakistan khan s words echoed his vows to the domestic audience as he has promised fiscal development in the country within the ongoing calendar year after a tumultuous first 12 months since the pakistan tehreek e insaf pti government took over in august 2018 the fiscal positives for the country have indeed been tangible in recent months in september pakistan s current account deficit dropped by 80 percent to a 41 month low of 259 million with a 111 5 percent rise in foreign direct investment fdi and 194 percent increase in private investment with fdi of 1 34 billion during the first half of the current fiscal year a 68 3 percent increase was registered in january compared to 796 8 million of the same period of the previous fiscal year this month the reserves of the state bank of pakistan sbp also hit a 21 month high at 11 586 billion the economic positivity was also reflected by the karachi stock exchange kse which registered a 16 month high this month crossing the 42 000 point mark after a cumulative increase of 13 000 points in four months the financial developments in pakistan have been duly recognized globally as well with moody s investor service upgrading pakistan s economy outlook from negative to stable in december the world bank has also acknowledged pakistan as one of the top 10 most improved countries in the ease of doing business index while there are positives aplenty almost all of them have come in the aftermath of pakistan reaching a 13th bailout agreement with the international monetary fund imf in july last year the agreement was designed to address a multitude of macroeconomic imbalances spearheaded by a balance of payment crisis the pti government was much criticized for taking over nine months to go to the imf finance ministry officials revealed at the time that the initial plan under former finance minister asad umer had been to seek aid from other countries instead of approaching the fund for which a finance bill was also passed 12 months ago the delay meant that by the time the government implemented an imf instructed market driven currency exchange rate the pakistani rupee had already lost over 50 percent of its value against the u s dollar however in the six months since the imf bailout agreement the pakistani rupee u s dollar exchange rate has eased from around 165 to the current 155 while the government s delayed response aggravated the currency exchange crisis financial analysts argue that its foundation were laid by the previous pakistan muslim league nawaz pml n government whose finance minister ishaq dar had kept the pakistani rupee u s dollar exchange rate artificially afloat around the 100 mark there has been an annual 5 percent depreciation for the rupee against the dollar since at least the 1970s whenever you artificially fix the value like shaukat aziz fixed it around 60 65 or dar at 100 that depreciation isn t allowed and when you do that the currency rates snaps back into its actual place financial analyst at fx empire shahab jafry told the diplomat currency markets work on trends and sentiments this snap forms a self fulfilling prophecy which generates a multiplier effect and as a result we have seen the rupee fall over 40 percent and not the 20 25 percent it would have fallen over the previous four to five years he added while the imf dictated policies have steered the economy toward macro corrections the impact on the masses has been especially jarring furthermore the abovementioned delay in agreeing to the imf terms meant that by the end of august 2019 inflation had hit an 87 month high of 11 6 percent january saw a 12 year high inflation rate of 14 6 which the state bank of pakistan declared transitory the imf conditions coupled with the government s negligence leading up to the bailout continue to take their toll on the masses with persistent increase in prices of gas power and fuel furthermore while inflation has caused an hike in the prices of commodities and food items mismanagement has seen shortages of basic dietary ingredients like tomatoes wheat and sugar the state has attempted to address the inflation through the sbp maintaining a high policy rate at 13 25 percent providing the increased interest rate as a savings incentive for the masses however critics argue that with the inflation being cost push and not demand pull the enhanced rate won t suffice in addressing it furthermore the high interest rate is attracting overseas investment in treasury bills the high investment is owing to carry trade where overseas investors are putting their money here owing to the high interest rate this is hot money when you re getting hot money owing to high interest rate you re reluctant to reduce the interest rate especially when there are no triggers for growth maintains shahab jafry farrukh saleem a former spokesperson on economy for the pti says the government has been trapped by this hot money they ve attracted the 2 2 billion owing to high interest rates through treasury bills and rupee convertible accounts the interest rate in the u s is 1 75 percent while pakistan is offering 13 25 percent so they are borrowing and investing them if the government lowers the interest rate the investors will run away he told the diplomat saleem whose criticism of the government s policies prompted the pti government to disown him as their spokesperson last year further argues that pakistan s economic outlook depends on which statistics you choose to read into in november federal board of revenue fbr reported a shortfall of 220 4 billion rupees in revenue collection a 1 trillion rupee shortfall is expected on the revenue target of 5 230 trillion which had been revised in december from the original 5 503 trillion rupees at the start of the fiscal year while it is normal for pakistani governments to be overambitious in revenue generation targets analysts believe that the deficit this time around might be unprecedented historically the highest was the 8 8 percent deficit in 2013 this time it is going to be the highest last year s revenue collection was 3 8 trillion rupees now they have taken it to 5 5 trillion rupees historically we aim for an 18 20 percent increase in budget but this time it s a 45 percent rise which is unprecedented said saleem there will be additional sales tax because they haven t been able to collect direct taxes and the shortfall is evident if you have collected 2 083 trillion rupees in the first six months then you clearly can t add over 3 trillion more and the easiest way for them to collect sales tax is through increasing power and gas tariffs and fuel prices he added officials argue that the high budget goals were set based on the growing number of taxpayers and filers in the country the 2 7 million tax filers for tax year 2019 was almost twice the number of filers in the previous year but still a fraction of the number of individuals that come under the tax net the pti government had come to power over vows of accountability and transparency which meant greater scrutiny on tax returns and a crackdown on largescale corruption which khan deems as the predominant reason behind pakistan s economic woes the government aims to bolster the economy by filling the fiscal holes caused by misappropriation which resulted in the promulgation of the national accountability second amendment ordinance 2019 in december even so given the fiscal impact felt by the masses in the first year and a half of the pti rule a significant percentage of the populace has become more skeptical critics blast such measures for being selective accountability designed more to target political opponents than for any benefit to the economy this rings truer given the continued influence of former pti general secretary jehangir tareen over the government despite having been disqualified by the supreme court furthermore the pti s critics point to tareen and other business and mill owners in the pti s federal and provincial cabinets who benefit from financial crises like inflated sugar prices critics say there is a lack of economic growth in the country which even khan s aide on commerce concedes and question how the high interest rate could result in any progress for local businesses salman shah the government s financial advisor in punjab however points to the extent of the economic crisis that the pti inherited and maintains that the worst is over we ve had to carry out painful reforms made the exchange rate market based which led to massive devaluation and inflation particularly in energy products and food inflation even more so but we ve been firefighting to ensure that the more vulnerable segments are brought into the social safety net to mitigate the impact of macro adjustment the likes of ehsaas programme and kamyab jawan are prominent examples he told the diplomat we need to see why we repeatedly go to the imf structural transformations are needed in pakistan s production system agriculture industry or services to improve our productivity and export competitiveness says shah import substitution with domestic production and export promotion is important car manufacturing for instance has been declining in the country because a lot of its constituents are imported that needs to change in agriculture owing to devaluation our wheat has become cheaper in dollars hence it is being increasingly smuggled causing the current domestic shortage exchange rate realignment have made our exports more competitive but we need to make them even more robust energy and gas export sectors are being given regionally competitive prices yes there are glitches but they are being addressed the uproar among the faisalabad textile businesses is not as much as it was a few months ago similarly this so called hot money owing to high interest rate is not a demon that we were better off without in fact the 2 2 billion that has come means the domestic banks now have extra 2 2 billion which they can lend to the private sector when that happens the yield curve would come down bringing the interest rates down he adds khan s dealings in davos where he met u s president donald trump and imf president kristalina georgieva are also being seen as evidence of traction that pakistan s regional role is getting internationally the potential for increased u s influence in the region amid the continued search for stability in afghanistan and the standoff with iran following the killing of its quds force commander qassem soleimani could be interpreted in the power corridors of islamabad and rawalpindi as an opportunity for the country to make itself useful for washington again however islamabad would have to counterbalance any financial gains from washington with its trade war adversary beijing which continues to dictate the china pakistan economic corridor cpec relaxation at the counterterror watchdog financial action task force fatf is one of many financial and geopolitical benefits that islamabad will seek in exchange for letting the imf run its economic affairs it is based on imf instructions that pakistan has been asked to keep the interest rate higher than the inflation rate with the government having been barred from borrowing money from its own central bank the borrower feels the impact if it s for consumption then there is less consumption if for investment then there is less investment we re basically running the imf program as things stand we are meeting all the indicators and targets given to us shah says however the cpec is a huge factor in increasing investment many foreign parties are coming and buying areas in the special economic zones the first drops of rain have come he adds
ten years ago the massive failure of subprime mortgage holders and lenders in the united states dealt a devastating blow to the world economy the worst international financial economic and social crisis since the great depression had its origin in one of the most potent features of the financial turn of capitalism the ever intensifying finance property link in most countries worldwide the use of property financing as an arterial route in the circulation of finance as economic geographer philipp o neill puts it has increasingly intertwined the fates of the financial and real estate sectors for better and for worse in lebanon the intensification of the finance property interplay is too often ignored despite its central position in the workings of local capitalism for instance the current debates on the soundness of subsidized home loan programs and on the decision earlier this year to temporarily shut them down rarely question the root reasons for which banque du liban bdl lebanon s central bank i e the gatekeeper of lebanese capitalism has invested so much time and money in encouraging and subsidizing bank sponsored homeownership a detailed investigation of central bank involvement by the author reveals housing solutions to be a secondary concern if that rather property financing has first and foremost been leveraged over the past 20 years to bolster gdp growth and to secure a precarious financial and monetary stability this reality comes to the fore when the countercyclical timing of central bank monetary and regulatory interventions in the property sector is examined a majority have taken place during periods of financial economic and property stagnation this was the case for example in the late 1990s when bdl orchestrated the establishment of the state owned public corporation for housing which assumed a pivotal intermediary role in the development and standardization of private led housing finance and again in the 2010s when it deployed successive housing focused stimulus plans and debt restructuring schemes for property firms the object here and elsewhere has been the invigoration of property demand and asset prices to which were added in recent years the avoidance of mortgage holder and development firm failure but why and through which mechanisms is property so critical to the country s macroeconomic performance and financial and monetary stability the property peg a key trait of crisis prone lebanese capitalism two major features among others characterize lebanon s rentier and finance driven growth regime a currency peg between the lebanese lira and the us dollar to secure monetary stability and the high remuneration of sovereign debt and bank deposits to ensure the country s financial attractiveness a third added in the past two decades or so is a property peg the property market through real estate and housing finance has acquired an important strategic position and mediating role in the country s political economy it functions as a stabilizer that pins together the imperative at the country level of capitalist expansion and regulation and at the city level the eminently capitalist process of urban development by regulation i mean the action of public authorities and elite business actors whose aim is to correct the vulnerabilities tensions and contradictions of the local economy financial system and monetary order and to reduce or postpone the risk of a systemic crisis this regulation urbanization nexus which is the central mechanism of the model i have termed pegged urbanization is common to a number of financializing economies of the global south dependent on incoming money transfers it is also a prevailing feature of the very liquid political economies of japan hong kong and the united arab emirates in this cross level feedback loop urbanization is both a consequence and an instrument of regulation enhancing gdp growth and protecting financial and monetary stability in lebanon regulation initiatives importantly shape the nature location and materiality of real estate and construction activity and the trajectory of property asset prices the 2002 paris ii international donor conference decision to lower the remuneration of sovereign securities and consequently of bank deposits is in many ways a telling illustration of the property peg this public policy initiative intended to loosen debt pressure and restore confidence in the domestic financial system unexpectedly reinforced the attractiveness of local property assets for wealthy capital holders in doing so and alongside other policy decisions that diminished risk increased asset liquidity and maximized the absolute and relative financial performance of property paris ii helped to trigger the 2000s upmarket property boom in municipal beirut the resulting asset price growth subsequently pervaded other market segments extending the construction frenzy to most areas of greater beirut in a similar way reducing the remuneration of traditional financial products played an important role in the proliferation of condominium towers in prime city locations on the supply side such capital intensive projects provided high yield relatively liquid placement vehicles in the short to medium term on the demand side they offered appealing investment opportunities for stocking and fructification of value and diversification of capital portfolios in the longer term the plethora of residential high rises invading the city have thus been constructed primarily to accommodate capital not people as anyone can see at night when most units soaring above are unlit at the same time city making through property financing and property asset prices has also purposely been used as a pivotal instrument of regulation to avoid crises and to reproduce in the short term the local outward oriented growth pattern the rapid expansion of housing finance in particular was intended primarily to provide new vehicles of capitalization to allow banks to absorb yield seeking surplus liquidity in times of financial and economic boom such as the second half of the 2000s according to the international monetary fund as of 2015 real estate and construction lending in lebanon totalled at least 40 percent of private debt housing finance also helped to reinforce the size and influence of a growing equity owning middle class whose interest in the stability of the financial system is expected to generate more economically socially and politically conservative behaviors to put it bluntly research has shown worldwide that the need to avoid failure and foreclosure motivates indebted homeowners to support the status quo a tendency that clearly upholds and benefits the ruling political economic elite as importantly in the context of the post 2010 financial and economic stress the fast paced deployment of mortgage based homeownership has also sought to sustain consumption based growth and to shield the local banking industry from a range of financial risks by increasing the volume of private debt on the banks loan books property related credit and costly property assets acting as high quality collaterals that secure private debt growth do indeed help to alleviate or at least contain sovereign risk moreover by supporting property asset prices housing finance also helps at least temporarily to mitigate property risk a critical threat to the financial system the regulation dimension of property activity and more generally the ever growing finance property link is subject to controversy however since it carries a number of risks economic decisions of agents in the property sector e g households development firms etc can contribute to regulation but they can also constitute a negative feedback capable of propelling the domestic economy and financial system into crisis unlike the period of late 1990s property sluggishness during which the banking industry s exposure was limited the fast paced deployment of bank debt in real estate and construction activity in the past 20 years has placed lebanese banks in a fragile position the credit system is now a critical channel for the transmission and amplification of booms and busts between the real estate and banking sectors simply put the extensive use of credit has accentuated the vulnerability of the property market by exposing it to credit risk as much as it exposes the financial sector to a sudden drop in property asset values any sharp increase in the delinquency rate of housing and construction loans is in effect able to trigger a rapid downward adjustment of property prices just as importantly any plunge in property asset values is likely to jeopardize credit system stability as such the various scenarios of crisis contagion which could involve both the demand and supply sides of the property sector should be considered a serious possibility in a context where asset prices despite a progressive decline remain artificially overvalued real estate demand is persistently stagnant and the prospects for the growth of construction and real estate activity are bleak in the face of the country s accentuated financial and political vulnerability any exogenous and endogenous shock of an economic or extra economic nature e g an economic recession a protracted drop in remittances diplomatic tensions among with gulf countries an episode of civil violence could very well deal a fatal blow to this house of cards the property based regulation of lebanese capitalism ultimately raises a number of policy questions over the past 20 years the maximization of real estate activity and exchange value a key feature of pegged urbanization has from the perspective of the lebanese people negatively and irremediably affected property use value the lebanese have been the first to bear the cost of this financialization of urban development both individually with the housing market s ever increasing unaffordability and collectively with the increased wealth and income disparity between equity owning groups and others this can only worsen in the event of a property generated financial crisis during which private debt default and eviction could throw tens of thousand of people into turmoil throughout the country the experience of the millions of bankrupted americans who became homeless or who suffered very poor living conditions in the aftermath of the subprime crisis reminds us that such a scenario goes beyond theory
the trump administration has just granted its commerce department sweeping powers to slap tariffs on countries it decides are manipulating their currencies to the detriment of the united states and its exporting companies for some this will come as news at aoth it is confirmation that our earlier warning reported here has come true in our article us prepares for currency war we warned readers about these new powers when they were first proposed by the us government several months ago amid its trade war with china the commerce department now says it will proceed with the plan which gives commerce a wide scope of power to decide whether or not a country is under cutting us exporters by keeping its currency artificially low whereas commerce normally follows the advice of the treasury department which issues a twice yearly report to congress on suspected currency manipulators on whether to impose trade sanctions the new rules allow commerce to slap duties on goods from accused countries and individual businesses even in cases where the treasury did not find them to be guilty of currency manipulation bloomberg neatly explains what broadening the commerce department s mandate to impose anti subsidy duties could mean the new rule which was opposed by the treasury department when it was first proposed in may 2019 would allow u s companies to file complaints with the commerce department over specific imported products by treating undervalued currencies as a form of unfair subsidy it would also give the administration the power to self initiate cases should it so choose however potentially making the u s government plaintiff judge jury and executioner in currency fights some industries and us at aoth believe this aggressively protectionist stance will lead to currency wars and turn the 6 trillion per day global currency market into a new battleground for trump s trade wars goods benefiting from weak currencies representing each and every one of america s trading partners could be recipients of duties or countervailing duties equal to the difference between the weaker currency and the us dollar in other words eliminating that country s currency advantage here s how it could work a us company that manufactures and sells widgets is losing market share to chinese companies that makes their widgets cheaper and sells them in the us at a significant discount to us widgets the us companies through an industry association lobby the us government to help them stop china from dumping widgets on the us market the industry association says that china s undervalued currency is an unfair subsidy the commerce department investigates president trump imposes a tariff on chinese widgets to level the playing field for american widget makers trump s claim that his tariffs on chinese goods are being absorbed by the chinese government is incorrect in this situation the us consumer pays the inflated price the tariff on a chinese widget and the tariff percentage goes to the us government the real loser is the us consumer or end user who is forced to buy more expensive american widgets while china is the obvious target of us tariffs and rule changes strengthening the commerce department s hand in dealing with currency complaints there are many other countries and individual businesses commerce has in its sights last year the treasury department came out with a report that recommended 21 trading partners should face scrutiny over their currencies they include china germany japan south korea ireland italy malaysia vietnam and singapore these trading nations and even their indivivual businesses that import goods into the us are now vulnerable to being tariffed on targeted imports an amount that will make imports sell for more than their us counterpart the big question is why the official reason given by secretary of commerce wilbur ross is as follows this currency rule is an important step in ensuring that unfair trade practices are properly remedied ross said in a statement while successive administrations have balked at countervailing foreign currency subsidies the trump administration is taking action to level the playing field for american businesses and workers weaponizing the dollar but the most important reason for such drastic protectionism not seen in the united states since the great depression is to lower the us dollar previous attempts by trump to talk down the dollar through pressing fed chair jerome powell to lower interest rates and demonizing him for not doing so have largely failed the us dollar index dxy has not dropped below 95 in the past year many trade and forex observers believe the currency rule is another step in trump s efforts to weaponize the dollar for trump a low dollar is the way to bring jobs back to the us after so many were exported abroad to take advantage of lower labor costs and therefore rebuild the us manufacturing sector primarily through cheaper exports the problem for the united states is that throughout the past several years the dollar has remained high in relation to other currencies the dollar as the world s reserve currency can only go so low because it will always be in high demand for countries to purchase commodities priced in us dollars and us treasuries nor should it be allowed to go too low because that would risk the dollar losing its exorbitant privilege related suv sales continue to soar us exporters face resistance from foreign buyers because products priced in dollars are more expensive bloomberg quotes mark sobel a former treasury official this is a unilateral policy which will alienate countries around the world he added the highly unusual trading stance may even put the us at odds with its world trade organization commitments opening the country up to wto challenges conclusion but there s more to it than that taken to its logical solution if the us starts slapping tariffs on all the products its domestic industries can t compete against we are looking at the complete collapse of global trade as we know it imagine you want to hell you need to sell your products to the us because of the enormity of the us market consumer spending makes up 70 of us gdp to be a successful international company you need to be selling into the us but your american competitors don t like how cheaply you re able to sell your goods in their own backyard they complain to the commerce department and bang you re your us imports are immediately hit with a 25 tariff guess what just happened to your us market any country in the world that manufactures goods that are priced higher than ones made in the us or any country company that manufactures goods the commerce department thinks can be made cheaper domestically can be subjected to punishing duties those duties aren t picked up by the so called currency manipulators they are added to the prices paid by us consumers and go directly into us government coffers and because a lot of goods previously made in america no longer are because of globalization american consumers end up paying billions of dollars worth of duties which are effectively an import tax on consumers having treated its former trading partners with such disdain they of course begin looking elsewhere to replace the increasingly closed off us market in country supply chains spring up regional trading blocks with countries friendly enough to not engage in a race to the bottom devaluation battle start to emerge including the countries that are part of china s belt and road initiative the problem though is everything is priced in us dollars companies don t have to sell into the us but they do have to buy raw materials which invariably are priced in usd soon discussions at higher levels like the imf and the wto point to alternatives beyond the usd the us has been in danger of losing its exorbitant privilege but now its adversarial trade stance pushes the major powers into adopting a new global currency possibly backed by gold once this happens the us dollar plunges in value hardly anyone can afford to trade with the us because of its radical protectionism in this environment of fear and isolationism the metals that prosper are gold and silver traditional safe havens that hold their value and can be relied upon as tangible currencies in the event of a fiat money breakdown the united states withdraws further and further from its former trading partners eventually the only countries it trades with are its old nafta stalwarts canada and mexico coffee beans from kenya chinese silks forget about it most imported products are either too expensive or not available the irony in all this is how badly the us would hurt itself bereft of trading partners the once mighty us economy becomes a shadow of its former self as for commodities the new america is in real trouble having relied on offshore suppliers for decades the us mining industry cannot produce enough critical metals to feed the industries factories needed to replace imports raw materials are in short supply to fix america s crumbling infrastructure the us mining industry embraces the opportunity to explore for and mine these metals but it takes 10 to 15 years to build new mines and that s after large deposit discoveries are made it doesn t help that for many years the united states government couldn t agree on a viable mining strategy with anti mining democrats pitted against nimby republican lawmakers who preferred to share mining knowledge with countries locked into chinese off take agreements rather than nurture a domestic mining industry that could come to the rescue of the us which has cut itself adrift are we being alarmist maybe at aoth we believe the global economy has reached an inflection point that is very close to breaking down global growth has slowed compounded by trade wars the slowdown in china and the latest threat the novel coronavirus according to the world gold council global gold backed etfs and similar products added 61 tonnes t or net inflows of us 3 1bn in january across nearly all regions boosting holdings to new all time highs of 2 947t central banks worried about economies cooling and low inflation were buying gold by the truckload and pursuing monetary stimulus in the form of interest rate cuts and or massive bond buying programs like we went through with quantitative easing in the us europe and japan that worked pretty well after the financial crisis when the world economy was more or less back on track with no tit for tat tariffs impeding international trade and the us dollar still carrying enough heft and respect to enjoy exorbitant privilege this time is different we have an unpredictable president in the white house that has already done much damage to the world economy hurt the relationship between the us and china and now appears heading towards a global currency trade war wherein everybody dukes it out over who can devalue and out export the other the outcome is a gradual race to worthless and america s trading partners punting the dollar and replacing it with a basket of currencies likely remember all that central bank gold buying backed by gold the trump administration is going down a very dangerous road with its new currency rule that imbues the us commerce department with incredibly strong powers to invoke across the board trade protectionism from countries all the way down to individual companies the way we see it buying gold or silver bullion is one of the best ways to take a defensive position during what could be the true beginning of a global trade war and a truly global and highly competitive currency devaluation when the winner is the biggest loser by richard rick mills more top reads from safehaven com
last october argentine elections brought a peronist alberto fernández into office as president a dramatic political comeback for a party whose long hold on power had ended four years earlier even before taking office and repeatedly since fernández has declared that argentina is in virtual default on its national debt spooking already frightened investors who understood the country owed some 300 billion more than half its annual gdp to the international monetary fund imf and other creditors the previous government had focused on getting its fiscal house in order in exchange for 57 billion in staggered bailout money from the imf former president mauricio macri had implemented austerity including increased taxes and reduced subsidies yet inflation had soared and the peso was plummeting against the dollar now the comparatively orthodox economic policy of macri appears to have given way to renewed economic populism under fernández peronism named for two time president juan domingo perón eludes precise definition and has at different times accommodated left leaning and right leaning governments fernández campaigned against the imf and multinational driven austerity since election he has raised taxes on wealth temporarily frozen utility rates and provided financial relief in various forms to farmers retirees and parents other initiatives include higher export tariffs and increased taxes on currency exchanges and some financial transactions while these will cause some pain for exporters they could also raise revenues resulting in a lower deficit says gabriel torres vice president and senior credit officer sovereign and subsovereign at moody s investors service still he calls it a huge problem that in argentina there is no continuity in basic macroeconomic policy positives and negatives on the fiscal front the new president has some positive developments to build on one is the primary deficit which includes government revenues and expenses but excludes interest and will hover around 0 5 of gdp for 2019 torres estimates a drop from previous years on the political side the new government can expect a honeymoon which in argentina typically lasts for approximately a year according to raimundo soto economics professor at pontificia universidad católica de chile in santiago those putting pressure on macri will back off to see what happens he predicts the new government may receive a further financial breather interest payments on national debt represent approximately 3 5 of gdp torres says the government is proposing to push out those payments for several years to reduce the fiscal pressure there will be some loss to investors torres says how much of a loss we don t know the new government will have to tread carefully however since it did not score an overwhelming election landslide fernández will need at least some support from the opposition to survive and his team s honeymoon has a uniquely argentine aspect argentine politicians have frequently been trailed by charges of corruption fernández s vice president cristina fernández de kirchner faces charges stemming from her tenure as president depending on the outcome her case could taint the new government as well that would penalize investment and growth soto says with this mix of positive and negative factors argentina s future appears uncertain a sour economy contributed hugely to macri s defeat and his successor will need a sure hand not to suffer the same fate it s like opening a fortune cookie soto concludes it s extremely difficult to say
remmitances are not diaspora investment my favorite diaspora definition is the one by g scheffer modern diasporas are ethnic minority groups of migrant origins residing and acting in host countries but maintaining strong sentimental and material links with their countries of origin their homelands the term diaspora comes from the greek words to sow and over as in the scattering of seed and for them it meant the seeding of greek colonies in distant lands remittances are funds sent by immigrants to their home countries for various uses including paying school fees for relative covering healthcare costs for family as well as activities such as building homes to retire the major driving forces include insurance investment and strategic incentives a report titled leveraging economic migration for development noted that in 2018 the number of international migrants and refugees was estimated to be 266 million persons of whom 240 million 90 were economic migrants the same report highlighted that women made up the majority of the numbers with the exception of africa and asia between the years 2000 and 2018 the share of immigrants as a percent of the global population increased from 2 8 to 3 5 the 2019 report isn t available as of this article but according to the world economic forum the 2019 global remittances are projected to be a remarkable 715billion the 2019 projections have the following countries leading india 82 2b china 70 3b mexico 38 7b the philippines 35 1b and egypt 26 4b the africa diaspora context i posit that the remittances discussion especially in the africa context is often misconstrued we place almost exclusive emphasis on the flow of money from europe and the americas into africa global reports rarely speak to the amount of funds tanzanians in kenya send home or that malawians in ethiopia send back to malawi as a matter of fact about two out of every three migrants from sub sahara africa go to neighboring countries surprisingly only 41 percent of emigrants from east africa 24 percent from west africa 39 percent from central africa and 28 percent from southern africa end up outside africa if we consider the intra continental flow remittances in africa hit the 85billion mark in 2018 if the african diaspora was country we would be the 9th largest economy on the continent just behind ethiopia with a gdp of 90 97 billion the 2018 remittances were more than foreign direct investment in the same year 46b quartz africa reported that nigeria s 2017 revenue from oil was 20b while the remittances in the same year were 22b a more interesting observation is that remittances are more stable than all other sources of foreign exchange some economists have theorized that remittances can improve nations creditworthiness additionally they spur spending in sectors such as education and healthcare recent findings have shown that ethiopian households that received remittances are less likely to sell off productive assets such as livestock amidst hardships such as famine with overwhelming dependence on foreign aid it s perhaps time for the african governments to turn to the diaspora for economic development removing the remittances bottlenecks high transaction fees are cutting into remittances which are a lifeline for millions of africans said gaiv tata the world bank s director for finance and private sector for africa to that end the most pressing issue with remittances today is the exorbitant cost of sending money the global average of remitting 200 is about 7 asia boasts of the lowest average of 5 meanwhile for sub sahara africa is as high as 9 4 this is typically owed to the fees on the sender and recipient intermediaries as well as the exchange rate margins in 2017 the total cost of sending remittances was about 30billion to put this in perspective the requested foreign assistance funds by the usa for 2020 is 32 3b this cost of sending money can build the mombasa nairobi railway cost 3 2b about ten times over sustainable development goal sdg 10 7 has a target of 3 by 2030 now what causes sending money to africa to be so expensive one reason for such high costs is the limited market competition for cross border payments massimo cirasino a senior world bank economist suggested that opening up the remittance market to competition and better information to consumers could bring remittance prices down says governments in both sending and receiving countries in africa and elsewhere should discourage exclusive agreements between providers of remittance services such as commercial banks post offices credit and savings cooperatives microfinance institutions and mobile money transfer services and international money transfer agencies which keep costs high as a matter of fact a recent survey showed that 81 of post offices in sub sahara africa are located outside three of the largest cities it s these locations where 80 of africans reside on the contrary mainstream commercial banks tend to be concentrated primarily in the bigger cities a world bank report leveraging migration for africa remittances skills and investments noted that providing information on available remittance channels maintaining databases of the prices charged and promoting the financial literacy of prospective migrants can strengthen competition in the market over the long term financial development should reduce remittance costs by increasing access to financial services in rural areas and poor communities and reducing the costs of opening bank accounts there is also a loss through converting currencies not to mention fees and time spent waiting for transfer approvals another world bank study found that fees average 7 09 percent of the amount sent one of the proposed solutions is the use of bitcoin to these transactions blockchain platforms are able to reduce fees and transfer money a 5 reduction can add 16 billion a year back in the continents economy additionally governments can support this process by improving their telecommunications infrastructure harmonizing banking and telecommunications regulations to enable mainstream african banks to participate in mobile money transfers and to the extent consistent with public safety simplifying anti money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism aml cft regulations for small value transfers which would facilitate mobile to mobile cross border transactions prior to the activation of the aml cft it was estimated that 2 to 4 trillion dollars was used to finance illicit activities while this slowed down the funding of illicit activities it also presents a bottleneck in the remittances process in a nutshell governments and policy makers should encourage competition and fully exploit the potential of the domestic remittance market examples of this include the african development bank working with african governments to introduce policies and measures that will attract remittance flows and the launch in january 2019 of prime platform for remittances investments and migrants entrepreneurship in africa the aim of prime is to reduce the cost of remittances and increase their impact across africa calling remittances diaspora investment in countries of origin is a misnomer for far too long african diaspora have purported that remittances to their countries of origin is a form of investment and demand special recognition to that end truth is that most remittances are sent directly to family for private and personal use yes local governments might experience peripheral gains from a burundian sending money to treat his mother but if his mother was in bolivia that is where the funds would actually be remitted so the act of sending money isn t a patriotic one rather a personal one yes a kenyan in dallas is building a house in his homeland to use when he retires so does the local kenyan in nyahururu these acts have been misrepresented as investments for far too long diaspora public partnerships dpp now let s examine some deliberate acts that would pass the patriotic test in april 1998 india conducted underground nuclear tests known as the pokhran ii test as a result in may of 1998 the us issued sanctions on india shortly after the sanctions were imposed the indian government turned to the indian diaspora as a source of funding by launching a sale of 5 year bond guaranteed by the state bank of india this bond dubbed as the resurgent india bond was set up to counter the impact of the sanctions impressed upon india furthermore this bond was made more attractive by setting the interest at 2 percent higher than the us bond market india launched an aggressive marketing campaign for the bonds in the us and europe leading to 3 billion dollars in just two weeks this unprecedented fit was evidence enough that the diaspora can serve as a viable alternative source of funding to native countries 22 billion almost half of the sub saharan african remittances go to nigeria pose for a moment and imagine if just 10 of the remittances were converted into investments relieving the nigerian government from foreign aide with endless strings attached the 340km standard gauge railroad in ghana will cost 2 2 billion which is 10 of the nigerian remittances for the year in other words nigerians in diaspora can fund the ghanaian standard gauge railroad in a matter of months what is a diaspora bond anyway a country simply issues foreign currency debt targeting the diaspora the intended outcome here is the country benefitting from a patriotic dividend that offers lower pricing given the india example we see how such funding instruments are crisis resilient on the diaspora side this is an opportunity to contribute to the nation s development governments can potentially enhance access to international capital markets by issuing bonds securitized by future remittance inflows some scholars believe that diaspora bonds can actually improve a country s sovereign credit rating a creative diaspora investment platform accounts receivables and purchasing orders what is an account receivable accounts receivable ar is the balance of money due to a firm for goods or services delivered or used but not yet paid for by customers accounts receivables are listed on the balance sheet as a current asset ar is any amount of money owed by customers for purchases made on credit most common lengths of time to pay the accounts receivable is between net 30 and net 60 imagine john doe delivered 1 000 worth of eggs to hyatt regency hotel in addis ababa now imagine this transaction is visible and part of a diaspora investment platform on this online platform you have four key elements each component of is heavily vetted prior to admission to the platform 1 diaspora investor 2 small enterprise the egg vendor typically too small to qualify for bank loans this comprises the majority of today s entrepreneurs and business owners on the continent 3 buyer in this example it is hyatt regency in addis ababa 4 local bank in this case awash bank the role of the bank of to guarantee the transaction now john doe has delivered the 1 000 worth of eggs to hyatt regency hotel and is waiting for 30 to 60 days to be paid one of the major issues of small business owners is access to capital for day to day running and or expansion this transaction will be visible all members of the platform as outlined above instead of john doe waiting for up to 60 days for the 1 000 he now has an option to get 900 from a diaspora investor within 24 to 48 hours at a cost of 10 what this does is allows john doe to quickly access capital to prepare purchase feed medicine and other infrastructure needed to produce the set of eggs for delivery well under the normal time this means that by the time the 60 days come around john doe would have already possibly been ready for his second supply instead of only now receiving his money to start the process again the diaspora having bought this debt will instead be the one to be paid the 1 000 by the hyatt regency in 60 days there are very few if any investments that would pay you 10 in 60 days today conversely the 1 000 range is where the majority of african diaspora fall the role of awash bank is simply an insurance one awash bank will take 2 of the transaction from the diaspora this assures the diaspora that if hyatt regency doesn t pay in 60 day awash bank will remit those funds to the diaspora and legally pursue the funds from hyatt regency hotel this simple tool has brought in more diaspora into the investment space of their countries of origin small business owners have also found a low risk source of capital where banks wouldn t consider and at a lower rate than the going interest rates for african banks today this win win investment mindset and at that scale is what we as african diaspora in partnership with local entities should be exploring a similar thought process can be applied to purchasing orders purchase orders pos are documents sent from you as the buyer to a supplier with a request for products or services as an order each po will include a number for tracking the purchase order throughout the system as well as the type of item quantity and agreed upon price given that the po represents a promise and not a transaction that has already taken place it implies a higher risk to this end the investment in po s will have a higher return 30 to 40 the africa brain gain there are more ethiopian doctors in chicago than in the whole of ethiopia since the year 2000 out of 85 american nobel prize winners in either physics chemistry or medicine 33 have been immigrants african diaspora have been winning nobel prizes since albert camus in 1957 to claude simon in 1985 and claude cohen tannoudji physics in 1997 examples of diaspora contributions in their countries of residence are replete some common ones include the son of abdul fattah jandali a syrian refugee steve jobs who revolutionized the computer world valued at 115 billion this son of a cuban immigrant jeff bezos is the richest man in the world even more fascinating is the fact that 43 of the fortune 500 companies today were either founded my immigrants or their children this trends dates as far back as the founding 1875 when todays largest telecom company at t was founded by a scottish immigrant alexander graham bell in 1994 a british immigrant nigel morris started capital one sergey brin the co founder of google is a russian immigrant elon must is perhaps the most famous african diaspora this son of pretoria south africa elon musk is better known as the tesla founder is also the founder of paypal space x and many other highly innovative companies philip emeagwali a son of akure nigerian won the gordon bell prize considered as the nobel prize of computing for his contribution to what we know as the internet today it s evident that over the years that diaspora have contributed in every aspect in their countries of residency with a few exceptions such as israel many countries have struggled to attract their diaspora and to also use them as conduits for transfer of knowledge in july of 1950 israel passed the law of return this law gives jews the right to return and gain israel citizenship in 1970 the same privileges were extended to people with one jewish grandparent and a person who is married to a jew in the coming senegalese parliament 10 of the parliamentarians will be members of the diaspora most diaspora do return home upon retirement and almost always demand to be buried home additionally most of the family members of the diaspora are in their country of origin this makes their input in national matters and participation in local politics equally paramount senegalese to vote for expat mps senegal mps vote to allow expatriates to run for office expanding the size of the national assembly most african government have sat back waiting for diaspora to make a case why the top entrepreneurs scientists dons in developing should be allowed to continue being part of the fabric of their country of origin it s time these governments wake up and proactively incentivize these talented individuals to return i am of the view that african governments should set aside budget to lure diaspora back home or at least to maintain ties i would set aside a fund under the ministry of foreign affairs that would facilitate expert diaspora s visit kwatsi alibaruho ugandan is a flight director at national aeronautics and space administration nasa he is the first black flight director at nasa uganda should have a program that pays for his annual vacation to uganda along with a minimum stipend in exchange kwatsi will dedicate time during his visit to lecture at makerere and carrying out various workshops and consultations same can be applied to bisi ezerioha an engineer and former pharmaceutical executive who has built some of world s most powerful honda and porsche engines the list is endless it s similar initiatives that will strengthen the bond between diaspora and their countries of origin conclusively i stress the strength of diaspora because it is essential to the development of the continent technology and infrastructure has made the globe virtually borderless today if america sneezes tanzania might catch a cold african governments can no longer focus on geographical distance in the case of the diaspora meanwhile losing sight of the forest for the trees there is not a better partner for economic and technological development today for africa than her own diaspora it s time to cut ties with old mindsets and wholeheartedly embrace her sons and daughters and work together as partners however fixed african government s mindset may seem the tide of time and events will bring surprising positive changes in the relations between nations and her diaspora it s inevitable it is now time for africa to unleash her developmental secret weapon her diaspora follow me on facebook and linkedin my email bkazora alumni purdue edu website
in july of 2019 the australian bureau of statistics announced average australian household wealth had exceeded the million dollar mark unsurprisingly owner occupied housing was the largest contributor to wealth super was the next biggest contributor followed by other financial assets on the surface it might appear that while average household wealth is most exposed to a housing market decline superannuation and other financial assets such as equities may provide some diversification but it turns out that these assets might not be as diversifying as you think in fact average australian household wealth is even more exposed to a housing crash than the chart above suggests this is due to the indirect exposure of superannuation equities and the broader economy to the housing market superannuation and other assets are exposed to the housing market let s first consider superannuation the second largest contributor to household wealth superannuation savings in australia make up about 40 per cent of the ownership of australian equities if we dig a little deeper we find that within the australian equity market as measured by the asx300 banks comprise 25 and we know banks are very exposed to mortgages i e the housing market figure 2 below shows the value of mortgages across the big four banks to be equivalent to 80 percent of the economy further superannuation funds invest in the corporate bond market of which australian banks comprise approximately 30 of the issuance in total australian superannuation has an approximate 20 exposure to the banking sector through deposits bonds and equities if we next consider the third largest contributor to wealth other financial assets 15 is comprised of direct equities 26 in deposits and 7 in offset accounts again we see the connection to banks and therefore mortgages and the housing market how does the housing market impact gdp wages and wealth australian household wealth is not just exposed to the housing market via home ownership superannuation and equities figure 3 below shows the rba s martin model which seeks to capture the interrelationships between the variables and mechanisms of the australian economy the model illustrates how a shock to gdp say from a housing crash would flow through to the labour market then on to dwelling investment and house and equity prices household wealth and eventually back to gdp again so in short australian household wealth is also a function of wages and employment and these variables are a function of gdp which is also exposed to the housing market so how does the housing market impact the labour market wages and employment and gdp and just how big is this impact it goes without saying that if you work in an industry where income is directly derived from the sale of houses e g real estate agents builders then your wealth via income is directly exposed to the housing market but many industries indirectly derive revenues from the housing industry via the supply of services and products guy debelle rba deputy governer in his october 2019 speech about housing and the economy stated the housing market has a pervasive impact on the australian economy it is the popular topic of any number of conversations around barbeques and dinner tables it generates reams of newspaper stories and reality tv shows you could be forgiven for thinking that the housing market is the australian economy that clearly is not the case but at the same time developments in the housing market both the established market and housing construction have a broader impact than the simple numbers would suggest the residential construction sector has linkages to the business services sector through architects draftspeople and construction engineers and to the manufacturing sector through steel bricks etc if we put that into numbers since 1990 housing s combined contribution to gdp generally averages approximately 24 and construction alone contributes between 6 and 8 figure 4 so what might happen if the housing market crashes at any point in time it s likely you ll find a market commentator who has concerns about a property bubble and is calling a market crash whether this is the case or not currently it is of interest to take a look at some of the key metrics economists use to signal a possible property crash of particular interest is the comparison of ireland s key metrics prior to its property crash during the gfc and australia s metrics today australia s household debt to gdp was 120 5 per cent as of september according to the bank for international settlements one of the highest in the world in 2007 ireland was sitting at around 100 per cent at the same time the rba puts australia s household debt to disposable income at 188 6 per cent ireland was 200 per cent in 2007 while the us was only 116 3 per cent at the start of 2008 rba figures also show more than two thirds of the country s net household wealth is invested in real estate in 2008 that figure was 83 per cent in ireland and 48 per cent in the us meanwhile 60 per cent of all lending by australian financial institutions is in the property sector in 2007 the international monetary fund gave the irish economy and banking system a clean bill of health and suggested that a soft landing was the most likely outcome the imf said australia s property market was heading for a soft landing so what might happen to australian household wealth if there is a housing market crash in australia obviously wealth will decline through direct exposure to the housing market but what about equities and superannuation balances given the large exposure of superannuation and the equity market to banks mortgages it makes sense to test how the banks would perform in a housing crash australian household debt has been trending upwards figure 5 in an environment of very low interest rates and currently about 20 of mortgage borrowers are in mortgage stress the obvious questions are then how will that debt be serviced when interest rates rise and if the housing market crashes what will happen to all those mortgages the banks own ratings agency fitch asked the same questions and did some modelling to identify how the banks might fair in an ireland style property crash mortgage defaults of 13 and house prices down 43 they found that about 40 of bank s operating profits would be wiped out after including recoveries from mortgage insurances a shock of this magnitude to banks earnings would significantly impact the value of aussie bank shares and flow through to the australian share market and superannuation balances and what about gdp some economists have raised red flags about the australian economy s reliance on housing and in particular housing construction cbre s global chief economist professor richard barkham recently remarked that a housing price correction in australia could cause a gdp correction it tends to send a little bit of an alarm bell for me in the period before the global financial crisis gdp in construction crept up in the united states to about 10 per cent and what that means is that a price correction can very quickly translate into a gdp correction i suspect that the australian central bank is observing it closely even a reasonably serious correction now is better than having to pick up the pieces of a major property crash later on it s important however to note many economists have also highlighted how the australian experience differs from the us and ireland and why they think it s unlikely australia will experience a housing market crash ireland s property boom was largely caused by huge capital inflows to the country s banks something australia hasn t had dr oliver said we have a flexible exchange rate we re not part of the euro we can set monetary policy in response to economic conditions we re not like greece or ireland it s a huge difference he added lending standards in australia were nothing like as lax as the us where banks were handing out so called ninja loans no income no job no assets to borrowers who could simply hand the keys back to the bank and walk away 19 but regardless of whether australia is likely to experience a property market crash on the same scale ireland and the us experienced during the gfc australian household wealth is overexposed to the australian housing market this exposure is either direct home ownership or indirect via superannuation the equity market and the broader economy a more diversified asset allocation would help to protect australian household wealth from a housing market crash diversification could be improved through increased exposure to global assets taking a more active role in superannuation asset allocation choice and or decreasing exposure to australian equities within the financial sector for example substituting some australian direct equity investments for international equities is an easy way to increase diversification without sacrificing returns learn more

fourth quarter earnings of 1 18 per share and full year earnings of 3 89 per share an increase of 12 in both periods we achieved this growth despite earnings in both periods being reduced by 0 11 per share due to cash repatriation costs from argentina and a mark to market charge on foreign equity investment in moneygram international neither of these charges were included in our guidance excluding these charges fourth quarter earnings would have been up 23 and full year earnings would have been up 16 organic revenue growth for both the fourth quarter and full year was 6 with reported revenue growth of 7 and despite the unfavorable fx impact of 8 earnings growth for the quarter was driven by a 22 increase in segment operating profit which finished the year up 17 on an organic basis which excludes the impact of fx translation and acquisitions segment profit rose 31 in the quarter and were up 27 for the year the end of 2019 marked the end and final year of our first strategic plan which we call sp1 which we launched at our investor day in march of 2017 in that strategic plan we set out very aggressive revenue and profit goals that we exceeded by a wide margin with a three year organic profit compound annual growth rate of over 20 i want to take a moment on the outset of this call to recognize the incredible efforts put forth by everyone at brink s their hard work strong execution and customer focus drove a share price increase of 200 over the past 3 5 years and i m confident that our goal our global team of over 60 000 employees will execute equally as well on sp2 our next three year strategic plan which is aimed squarely at accelerating the ongoing transformation of brink s and creating even more value to our shareholders as part of sp2 we re already we ve already begun to pilot strategy 2 0 related retail cash management solutions with customers and we expect to start to ramp up these sales in the second half of this year and we re continuing to develop a full range of additional 2 0 related strategies and solutions to serve what we consider to be the total cash ecosystem i want to remind everybody though that in addition to these new initiatives the core of our next three year strategic plan especially in 2020 is our expanded strategy 1 0 initiatives which will drive additional organic growth and margin leverage the continuation of these 1 0 initiatives alone are expected to drive significant value creation over our next three year plan period before being supplemented by a new layer of growth with our 2 0 initiatives this will take hold in 2021 and 2002 we ll disclose more of these details at our june investor day the 2020 guidance we re targeting eps growth of 13 and operating profit growth of 10 our guidance takes into account continued fx related headwinds additional cash repatriation charges and continued operating expenses related to developing and commercializing strategy 2 0 once again this guidance is driven primarily by a continuation of an expansion of our 1 0 organic growth initiatives that we began implementing in 2017 in fact our guidance suggest that a continuation expansion of our proven strategy 1 0 initiatives in 2020 are expected to offset these other significant impacts i ll cover our 2020 guidance in more detail in our closing remarks today we also disclosed an equity investment in moneygram international in the fourth quarter we invested 9 million in moneygram through open market purchases of stock equaling about 4 95 of its outstanding shares moneygram is one of the largest money transfer companies in the world with 350 000 locations in more than 20 countries globally we are in discussions with moneygram to explore a long term strategic partnership agreement that we think will offer significant commercial benefits and long term strategic alternatives for both parties developing this partnership is just one component of our near term strategic 2 0 and longer term payments initiatives in the fourth quarter we recorded a non cash charge of 3 million or 0 05 per share related to a decrease in the fair market value of this initial investment based on the value of the shares at the end of the quarter today we also announced that our board authorized a new 250 million share repurchase program under the previous program which expired on december 31st we acquired 1 3 million shares at an average cost of 69 35 per share as we have stated in the past and based on our past behavior our intent is to use this share repurchase authority only if we view our share price to be materially undervalued while share repurchases is certainly one avenue that we have to return capital to our shareholders we continue to believe that we will have more attractive opportunities to increase returns and create shareholder value by investing capital in organic growth initiatives as well as acquisitions now turning to slide 4 this summarizes our full year results for 2019 as you can see here our team delivered strong growth by all measures revenue growth of 7 it was up 15 on a constant currency basis and an organic basis it rose by 6 operating profit rose 13 up 36 on a constant currency basis adjusted ebitda rose 10 up 27 on a constant currency basis and eps rose 12 up 44 on a constant currency basis even with the negative translational impact of currency we converted 7 top line growth to 12 eps growth and as i mentioned earlier these results include the late in the year charges equal to 0 11 per share that were not in our guidance if these charges were added back and reported the results would have been 4 adjusted out of adjusted eps or a 16 increase the cash repatriation charge reduced operating profit by 5 million and despite our 2019 operating margin despite this our operating margin in the year increased 50 basis points to 10 6 capping off the 320 basis points increase in margin over the sp1 three year plan period now turning to next slide and before i turn it over to ron i d like to quickly recap the results of our strat plan 1 when ron and i joined the company in mid 2016 the board charges with affecting change and driving shareholder value we assessed the challenges as a team which at that time were many but we also saw and we still see great opportunities at our investor day in 2017 we laid bare how brink s have significantly underperformed its peers excuse me and we developed strategies with specific breakthrough initiatives to drive organic profit growth over a three year timeframe ending in 2019 we also recognize that our balance sheet was severely under utilized so we launched our strategic plan for acquisition and acquisition strategy sp1 included specific three year targets for revenue operating profit adjusted ebitda and earnings per share as shown in the middle of these bars and all of these aggressive targets were materially exceeded in summary we achieved 27 growth in revenue or on a compound annual growth rate basis 8 growth per year over the three year period with organic revenue growth of 7 per year and 81 increase in operating profit or 22 on a compound annual growth rate basis 320 basis points of margin improvement a 65 increase in adjusted ebitda or 18 compound annual growth rate and a 71 increase in eps or 19 compound annual growth rate over three years most importantly our shareholders benefited from a share price increase of 200 since mid 2016 with that i ll turn it over to ron for his financial review ron ronald domanico executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks doug and good day everyone turning to our fourth quarter results on slide 6 dunbar was acquired in the third quarter of 2018 was part of our business for the full fourth quarter in both 2018 and 2019 consequently dunbar is not included in acquisitions on this chart what is included in acquisitions is rodoban balance innovations the tvs acquisition in colombia and a small cit bolt on in brazil fourth quarter 2019 constant currency revenue growth was 8 with two thirds driven by organic growth and one third from acquisitions revenue was reduced by 48 million or 5 by negative forex reported revenue was 936 million up 3 versus the fourth quarter last year fourth quarter constant currency operating profit grew 34 results included a 29 million increase in segment operating profit that was partly offset by 17 million in higher corporate charges the corporate increase included 7 million in planned strategy 2 0 investment 5 million in unplanned argentina cash repatriation and 3 million of increased insurance premiums acquisitions added 6 million in operating profit the majority coming from rodoban negative forex translation reduced operating profit by 23 million or 22 which was in line with our guidance reported operating profit was 116 million and the operating margin was 12 4 up 100 bps from the fourth quarter 2018 moving to slide 7 constant currency revenue growth for the full year 2019 was 15 with over 6 driven by organic growth and more than 8 from acquisitions as i mentioned earlier through mid august 2019 the first anniversary of the acquisition dunbar s trailing 12 month results were included in acquisition operating changes and synergies were recorded as organic growth trailing 12 month results for rodoban balanced innovations tvs and the small cit bolt on in brazil were included in acquisition since the time that each deal was closed in 2019 of the 288 million in revenue from acquisitions net of dispositions 7 5 months of dunbar contributed 244 million the other acquisitions added 79 million and the june 2018 sale of our french aviation guarding business decreased revenue by 35 million constant currency revenue was reduced by 268 million or 8 by negative forex reported revenue was 3 68 billion up 7 versus 2018 on an organic basis operating profit rose 91 million and acquisitions added 35 million as full year constant currency operating profit growth was 36 negative forex reduced operating profit by 81 million or 23 in line with guidance including foreign exchange full year segment operating profit increased 76 million and was partly offset by 32 million in higher corporate charges the corporate increase included 21 million in planned strategy 2 0 investment 5 million in unplanned argentina cash repatriation forex and 7 million in higher non cash stock compensation reported operating profit was 392 million and the full year operating margin was 10 6 up 50 bps versus 2018 moving to slide 8 full year 2019 operating profit of 392 million was reduced by 95 million of net interest up 31 million versus the same period last year interest expense increased by 19 million primarily associated with higher debt from the acquisitions the moneygram equity investment mark to market charge of 3 million and other non operating income and expense items comprise the balance tax expense of 93 million was 4 million less than prior year as higher income was more than offset by the 280 bip reduction in the non gaap effective tax rate the 2018 buyout of our minority partner in colombia cut full year 2019 noncontrolling interest by 3 million full year 2019 income from continuing operations of 199 million divided by 51 1 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding generated 3 89 in earnings per share a 12 increase from full year 2018 depreciation and amortization was 152 million up 11 million versus last year interest expense and taxes were 178 million and non cash share based compensation was 35 million in total 2019 full year adjusted ebitda was 564 million excluding the 5 million charge for the argentine cash repatriation and the 3 million equity investment mark to market the ebitda for the year would have been up 12 and eps would have been up 16 turning now to our segment results in slide 9 for the year north america revenue grew 5 organically and was up 22 on a constant currency and a reported basis segment operating profit was up 30 organically 43 in constant currency and up 44 on a reported basis north america s operating profit margin increased 160 bps from 8 9 to 10 5 in the us the 29 year over year growth in revenue and 52 growth in operating profit was driven by the dunbar acquisition and realization of 24 million in synergies when the deal was announced in may 2018 we targeted 45 million of cost synergies and we re confident that we ll exceed that target consolidating dunbar and brink s operations resulted in some customer attrition in line with our expectations the net 2 organic revenue growth in both the fourth quarter and the full year in the us demonstrated our ability to offset this attrition and grow business with new and existing customers we expect higher organic growth in 2020 partially supported by the phase in of additional business from a large financial institution when doug and i joined brink s in mid 2016 the cash us business operations were losing money at our 2017 march investor day we targeted that brink s us would exit the three year strategic plan period in 2019 with a 10 operating margin we did just that exiting the fourth quarter with over a 10 margin for the full year of 2019 the us had an 8 operating margin a 120 bps improvement versus 2018 high us employment levels created wage pressure and made it increasingly difficult to attract and retain employees system upgrades to improve security ineffectiveness have also added costs nevertheless we expect to expand margins in 2020 to 10 and exit 2021 with a 13 operating margin brink s further penetrated the us retail market in 2019 with 4 100 new compusafe orders ahead of our internal target compusafe is a high value service with better margins than our core business which generates recurring monthly revenue and typically with 5 year service contracts mexico continued its strong performance for the last three years we grew revenue and operating profit organically by double digits we aggressively pursued retail accounts and had great success selling high value services for the three years in sp1 mexico s compusafe installed base grew compounded over 50 our sp1 target to double the operating margin in three years was exceeded in two and there is opportunity for further improvement moving to our south america segment south america generated 917 million of revenue in 2019 organic revenue growth was 16 and the rodoban tvs and brazilian cit bolt on acquisitions accounted for an additional 8 in constant currency revenues were up 23 but were more than offset by negative forex of 24 full year operating profit was up 39 organically up 47 in constant currency and up 9 on a reported basis south america operating profit margin increased 230 bps from 21 4 to 23 7 the rodoban acquisition of brazil performed well and synergy realization is on track tvs was the number four cit company in colombia and is providing a solid complement to brink s market leadership in that country our business in argentina had a strong year in local currency inflation driven price increases ad valorem and higher volume more than offset cost inflation increasing margins for the year the peso devalued 42 versus the 2018 average in caused us dollar operating profit to be 7 million below 2018 a new government took power in late october and implemented stringent currency controls in response we went to the blue chip swap market to repatriate excess cash out of argentina this resulted as we said before in a 5 million charge that was not in our guidance the charge was recorded to corporate and reduced consolidated operating profit and adjusted ebitda let s look more closely at argentina by moving to slide 11 austerity measures instituted by the conservative government in 2019 were rejected by the people who elected a socialist government in october international spot response was immediate and as i just mentioned the peso devalued 42 in 2019 we expect the argentine peso in 2020 to devalue an average of 36 to 76 pesos to the dollar historically there have been two to four nationally negotiated wage increases each year the wage increases form the basis for negotiating price increases the business model in argentina includes an ad valorem component or the industry gets paid a percent of the value that s transported and or processed historically price increases plus the ad valorem have exceeded cost inflation and margins have expanded there are always timing differences between cost inflation price increases and currency devaluation that timing affects the reporting of argentina results in us dollars historically it s a three quarters to six quarters for us dollar results to recover from a major devaluation the bars on the left of this slide show brink s argentina revenue in us dollars by quarter for the 2019 actual and our 2020 projection us dollar revenue is expected to recover to 2019 levels indicated by the green circle by the fourth quarter 2020 the late recovery would result in argentina 2020 us dollar operating profit being 10 million lower than 2019 on top of that we expect to incur at corporate 10 million in cash repatriation costs in 2020 5 million more than in 2019 in total we expect a 15 million adjusted ebitda headwind from argentina in 2020 on the right of this slide you can see that in 2020 we expect argentina to generate 5 of total brink s revenue and 12 of total brink s adjusted ebitda through global organic growth and acquisitions argentina s impact on total brink s results has diminished significantly over the years and quite frankly should be less of an issue for all stakeholders turning to slide 12 to review our third segment rest of the world full year 2019 revenue was up 1 organically down 2 in constant currency and negative 6 on a reported basis the constant currency decline was driven by the june 2018 disposition of our 85 million french aviation guarding business organic revenue growth was flat in france as the impact of the year end national transportation strike offset modest year to date increases similarly the civil unrest in hong kong contributed to a revenue decline in that country versus 2018 single digit revenue increases were achieved in the rest of asia israel greece and other emea countries 2019 full year operating profit was up 3 organically 4 in constant currency and 1 on a reported basis segment operating profit increased 80 bps to 11 8 results in france the largest business in rest of world improved nicely versus prior year with operating profit up 12 driven by successful implementation of strategic plan cost reductions achievement of temis synergies and price increases we expect continued improvement in france in 2020 the strategy 2 0 bpce atm outsourcing implication is proceeding on schedule and should positively impact results in mid 2021 and beyond we ve already seen indications of negative impact in 2020 from the corona virus epidemic in our asian businesses but it s too early to estimate the financial impact moving to capex on slide 13 the increase in capital spending in 2017 corresponded with the launch of sp1 in our breakthrough initiatives investments in next generation armored trucks and high speed money processing equipment for our base business and completed acquisitions drove an increase in capex as a percent of revenue from 4 2 in 2016 to 5 4 in 2019 in 2020 and beyond we expect that strategy 1 0 wider and deeper initiatives in our organic businesses will continue to enhance our fleet money processing and network optimization but at a more moderated pace targeted at a normalized rate of 4 5 of revenue and as we previously communicated we expect to invest 20 million of incremental capex at the completed acquisitions to support the full realization of synergies strategy 2 0 is expected to have higher margins and be much less capital intensive than our base business going forward this should improve our return on invested capital turning to slide 14 2019 full year free cash flow was 169 million in line with prior year and 31 million less than our guidance the 564 million of adjusted ebitda was 6 million lower than the guidance midpoint 80 million of cash interest was in line with guidance and due to timing cash taxes and cash capex were each about 15 million favorable to guidance acquisition related cash restructuring was 7 million higher than estimate which should accelerate synergy realization in 2020 but the biggest impact was related to missing our dso target in a number of operations including us global services our free cash flow target for 2020 is 230 million up 61 million or 36 from 2019 and quadrupled the 58 million generated in 2017 moving to slide 15 this slide illustrates our actual net debt and financial leverage from 2017 through 2019 and our targets for 2020 our net debt at the end of 2019 was in line with guidance at 1 35 billion that was up about 150 million over year end 2018 as investments in acquisitions partly offset by cash flow after dividends at the end of 2019 our leverage was approximately 2 4 turns since 2017 we completed approximately 1 1 billion in acquisitions which have been accretive to earnings the acquisition pipeline today is more robust than when we started both in the potential number of transactions and in total enterprise value the gray bars on each half of the slide illustrates the impact of another 1 billion in potential acquisitions and an average post integration multiple of 6 5 the gray bar on the left shows the potential incremental investment to be funded entirely by debt the gray bar on the right illustrates that pro forma adjusted ebitda including all estimated synergies should increase by about 155 million and pro forma leverage would be under three turns we expect that cash flow from our existing business combined with the additional acquisitions could reduce leverage back to 2019 levels within three years with that i ll now hand it back to doug douglas pertz president and chief executive officer thanks ron please turn to slide 16 as discussed earlier on the call our strong 2019 results capped off our three year strategic plan sp1 strategy 1 0 the organic portion of sp1 target accelerating core organic growth and margin improvement and we did just that over the three year period of time our 1 0 breakthrough initiatives created strong operating leverage that drove 76 million of profit growth in just three years from 216 million in 2016 to 292 million in 2019 this profit growth was supplemented by another 100 million of profit from strategy 1 5 acquisitions most of these were core core acquisitions that is core lines of businesses and geographies where we already had operations and can quickly capture cost base synergies together our 1 0 and 1 5 strategies added 176 million of profit from 216 million to 392 million in total these sp1 strategies delivered adjusted ebitda growth of 65 over the planned period to 564 million for three year compounded annual growth rate for ebitda of 18 strategy 1 0 and 1 5 clearly added lots of value over the last three years and we are confident there is lots more in the next strat plan to come in fact these strategies form the foundation of sp2 with our next three years we call the continuation of our strategy 1 0 initiatives and the organic component of this 1 0 wd or wider and deeper wider referring to more of our proven initiatives being implemented across our 41 countries and deeper referring to implementation into all branches in every country so 1 0 wd is a key foundational element of our plan to drive continued growth throughout the next three year plan period the same is true of our 1 5 acquisition strategy as ron mentioned we completed 13 acquisitions and invested about 1 1 billion in during sp1 that will result in approximately a 160 million in ebitda contribution after the full synergies are captured and this includes unfortunately some of the negative impact of fx over this period of time we have a balance sheet capacity and now the proven track record of growing value through accretive acquisitions while we don t forecast growth through acquisition before we complete acquisitions and there are no impact and there is no impact excuse me from potential acquisitions in our 2020 guidance we re confident that our aggressive but disciplined approach to acquisitions will continue to add value during the next three years turning to slide 17 it provides a more detailed look at how we achieved 81 profit growth through this bridge over the three year plan period of sp1 even with significant fx headwinds and some investment in the future the strong growth from our organic and acquisition related initiatives were partially offset by higher corporate expenses 65 million on unfavorable fx translation and our opex investments in 2 1 excuse me 2 0 and it initiatives despite these offsets we still exceeded our initial op income target of 325 million by almost 70 million and generated 20 compound annual growth for op income turning to slide 18 during this sp2 three year plan we will ramp up strategy 2 0 as our third layer of growth this multiple layer this multi layered strategy will expand our presence in the cash ecosystem with high margin cost effective services for the larger for the largely underserved and even the totally unserved retail market and also for our financial institution customers we ll share more details and financial targets behind 2 0 at our investor conference in june but we ve already begun to execute on our overall sp2 objectives of accelerating organic revenue growth and increasing margins all with limited excuse me with reduced capital expenditures versus sp1 most importantly we believe strategy 2 0 will help us to fundamentally change and dramatically increase the value proposition that we offer to our customers supporting our 2 0 strategy we now have initial pilots under way for promising new tech enabled retail cash management service that we plan to roll out in the second half of 2020 other examples of actions we ve taken to lay the base for other parts of our 2 0 strategy include our with bpce in the second the second largest banking group in france to outsource and fully manage their entire network of approximately 11 600 atms we expect to begin generating revenue in late 2021 from this agreement which is a long term agreement with bpce and our 2019 acquisition of balance innovations a us based software company that provides cash management software for the retail market and other services to a national footprint that includes more than 11 000 retail locations and as i mentioned earlier the development of a long term partnership with moneygram is also part of our 2 0 strategy our goal is to help moneygram and its agent partners realize substantial operating efficiencies by improving their cash management processes there any designed closely with our next generation 2 0 retail services offerings and our collective long term strategies offer both of these solutions for solutions and strategies for payments in the future these are just a few examples of our efforts to date to position brink s into the adjacent areas in the cash total cash ecosystem driving growth and margin improvement as we do that we look forward to sharing more of our transformative 2 0 strategies in our upcoming investor day turning to slide 19 for 2020 guidance we re targeting organic growth of 5 and we expect to that we expect to be partially offset by negative fx translation again mostly in argentina operating profit growth of 10 with a midpoint of 430 million or growth of 24 on a constant currency basis adjusted ebitda growth of 8 or 18 on a constant currency basis and eps growth of 13 which equates to a 32 growth in constant currency once again this guidance is driven primarily by continuation and expansion of our strategy 1 0 organic growth initiatives that we began in our last strategic plan we expect to deliver these results despite continued fx related headwinds as outlined earlier and despite 2 0 development cost we expect these 2 0 cost to be offset by both core organic growth and initial 2 0 revenue which we should start to generate in the second half of this year this guidance does not include any revenue or earnings benefits from potential 1 5 acquisitions slide 20 provides a little more detail through the bridge format on our 2020 guidance we expect 90 million to make profit growth an increase of 23 to be driven by continued synergies from our acquisitions and additional growth from the impact of more broadly executed 1 0 wider and deeper breakthrough initiatives and as ron noted we expect to exceed 45 excuse me 45 million in synergy which is our target for the dunbar acquisition as we continue to integrate that business our guidance includes december 31 2019 currency rates for all countries except argentina and as ron mentioned for argentina we re assuming a 36 year over year devaluation for the argentinian peso versus the us dollar which is roughly in line with a 42 devaluation in 2019 the impact of this devaluation is expected to partially offset be partially offset by stronger local currency inflation driven pricing increases that will start to turn argentinian profits as they are reported in us dollars to be profitable and positive versus prior years starting in the fourth quarter of 2020 we are also assuming a 10 million impact of 5 million versus last year to repatriate argentinian pesos to us dollars therefore our guidance assumes a profit reduction versus last year related to argentina of about 15 million from the combination of both devaluation and repatriation in total we expect operating profit to grow 10 to around 430 million at the midpoint and with a margin increase of 80 basis points to 11 our operating profit without the impact of argentina fx related issues would result in approximately a 14 growth and we expect eps growth of 13 on a reported basis and again without the fx related impact of argentina eps growth would be about 18 in closing it s worth repeating that our 2020 guidance is based primarily on our 1 0 wider and deeper organic initiatives with no additional new acquisitions and initial results from strategy 2 0 are not expected until later in the year we expect to accelerate organic growth and margin improvement beginning in 2021 from our 2 0 initiatives as they begin to take off take hold excuse me with existing and new customers sp1 was a great success and our future looks even brighter we look forward to providing more details and a new three years review of financial targets on investor day drew let s open it up for questions questions and answers operator the first question comes from george tong of goldman sachs please go ahead blake goldman sachs analyst hi thanks good morning this is blake on for george regarding the 5 million cash repatriation expense in argentina and the 10 million impact expected in 2020 when do you expect these expenses to begin tapering it sounds like 4q might be a target but just curious about timing there douglas pertz president and chief executive officer well i think you re correct that we are looking for the fx translational impact based on our target of 36 inflation excuse me a devaluation for the full year to start seeing that turn positive in other words in the fourth quarter of 2020 we ll start seeing the inflation driven price increases in domestic will start offsetting the deflation for the year and we ll start seeing profits on a reported us dollar basis in argentina to be favorable and positive but the other three quarters will not be so that s when it will start coming back as we saw in 2019 actually and that s the translational part of this based on the assumptions that we have in place now what we ve seen so far since the election which i think is pretty interesting is that the fx has been much more muted i guess is the way to put it than many might have expected so we ll see where that goes over the course of the year but 36 fx translation issue so to speak is the one that will be offset and start turning positive in the fourth quarter based on our projections the difference in the repatriation is more of an issue that is not across the board on an fx rate it s that it s only applied obviously with the cash that is repatriated so a portion of our current operating income for the year is spent internally in fact the majority of it is spent internally on taxes capex and other expenses in argentina then it becomes the free cash flow that is generated that we would then look to repatriate and at the current as a result of what happened in the late part of the year currently that a premium for that repatriation that is included in the assumptions for the year an additional 5 million versus prior year did that explain it blake goldman sachs analyst yeah that s helpful yes that s very helpful thank you douglas pertz president and chief executive officer i think it s pretty important i know this gets confusing but i think it s pretty important that we don t know when and if that will be taken that repatriation portion will be taken away but they are two totally separate pieces you can t add that to the fx rate because the fx we don t repatriate 100 i wish we could i wish we had a 100 free cash flow on our operating income but but in fact it s only on the portion that is really true free cash flow that we repatriated blake goldman sachs analyst great that s helpful and then regarding the moneygram investment i know it s pretty early but just curious how you see this partnership taking shape going forward and what the potential commercial opportunities are for brink s longer term douglas pertz president and chief executive officer well certainly what we ve suggested is we re looking for technology enabled total solutions that make it much easier much more effective for any retail customers which would include specific areas such as moneygram agents do better new business and for moneygram to do business with our agents and we think that our solutions that we re rolling out and will provide more detail around are a great example of that and a great solution for that it provides a method to make sure the funding is there to give almost instant information about that funding because the tech enablement around that in a fully integrated easy to use solution that we think provide significant value and so there is a near term and hopefully a near term and it turns into a longer term opportunity for both parties in other words for us to sell and provide these services and for hopefully moneygram to gain some benefits and their agents to gain benefits related to those services so that s the first portion of this in the commercial benefits side of this for both sides and then we think there is a longer term joint development of strategies around cash payments in cash to digital and digital to cash payments in the long term that we can work on together we re both very global businesses the fit is very nice and we think there is some great strategies that can be developed together blake goldman sachs analyst great very helpful thank you doug operator the next question comes from sam england of berenberg please go ahead sam england berenberg capital markets analyst hi guys just a couple the first one just around the opex and the 20 million investment for 2 0 is that going to be second half weighted this year and then how do we think about that growing going forward is that something you ll guide to on the strategy day douglas pertz president and chief executive officer yes so i think what we ve said in past conference calls is consistent where we have in place today it will be fairly smooth throughout the year and this is very similar to the if you will opex investment and what do you want to call it investment is opex spend that we will continue to have to continue to develop drive and support the 2 0 initiatives the difference this year versus last year is we are starting to roll out pilots those pilots will then start hopefully to yield additional sales as we go through the year and that additional sales will start translating into revenue as we go forward into the second half of this year so if you think about it we re going to be heavier weighted in the first half of this year to seeing the expenses which what we said in our guidance those expenses will be absorbed if you will and are in the guidance by organic growth and our core business and there may be some benefit but it s only limited in the current plan and the guidance for the second half to start seeing some benefits associated but most of that is not in the plan most of it is not in our guidance but we ll start seeing it in the second half and as we do we ll get both the benefit to offset those expenses and potentially some upside depending on where the ramp up and how the ramp up goes sam england berenberg capital markets analyst great thanks and then the second one is around the 1 0 plan i just wondered what s left to do to bridge the rest of the gaap up to 13 are there any particularly large parts of the plan you still need to deliver on this year douglas pertz president and chief executive officer well so when you say 13 that is the number for the us there are very specific targeted plans as we laid out before to achieve the 13 and frankly more beyond the run rates of 2021 and that s a combination of continued breakthrough initiatives that were laid out as part of our 1 0 strategy for the us as well as 1 5 dunbar synergies and benefits associated with that so that s really the us look on it that hasn t changed from what we laid out before going from the 8 that we ve talked about that we hit this year to a 10 plus full year op income for next year and then going out of 2021 i m sorry next year being this year 2020 i apologize and then the 2021 exit rate of 13 so that s the us but what we re talking about is on a global basis including south america and other countries france is a key piece of this as well continue to see improvements in our core business there by taking initiatives but those countries started out with as part of their 1 0 plan and expanding and widening those having more initiatives to implement in each of those countries more than other countries that we have implemented new strategies and we have helped put together and then making and taking those more that wider initiatives and then driving them deeper into the operations in other words if we have route optimization that was implemented in the first strat plan period of time those route optimization strategies may have been preliminary may have been ones that we test marketed may have been ones that we only put in 10 branches and now they ll be deeper they ll go deeper and go into every branch they ll be implemented throughout the organizations and you can take those and say whether it d be new trucks or other strategies around that money processing room efficiencies that s putting them deeper into the organization it s taking the multiple initiatives that we laid out and are wider and putting more of those in each country so we don t view that there is a set amount of initiatives or amount of cost reduction that can be out there and we re just taking what s left we re continuing to build and grow and implement and expand on those across all of our operations sam england berenberg capital markets analyst great thanks very much i ll pass it over operator the next question comes from jeff kessler of imperial capital please go ahead jeff kessler imperial capital analyst thank you doug i know you re going to be talking a lot about this at on june 1st but i m just wondering you ve alluded several times perhaps many times today to number one a declining amount of capital investments in toward as we move on in 2020 as well as the first inklings of being able to recapture some of the inflationary pressure that you ve got from argentina can you talk about this in terms of free cash flow free cash flow was slightly below our expectation but the way you re talking is that free cash flow will begin to actually begin or i would say maybe become a metric that you re going to start talking about and focusing on more for the fourth quarter and particularly in 2021 and can you elaborate on that a bit given that i think a number of analysts are going to start looking at free cash flow because of what s going that possibly happen in 2021 as a valuation indicator douglas pertz president and chief executive officer yes so they are very good questions let me separate those and then i ll pass the last piece specifically around the free cash flow projections for 2020 and now we re going to impact on at least on a more global basis rather than specifics beyond that for the rest of sp2 period but let me bifurcate and separate some of those the argentina piece on this is a different issue versus free cash flow but it clearly is one that is related to continue to improve our free cash flow it s more of one the projections based on the recovery period of time for the local price increases in argentina offsetting the already seen and projected fx issues that s what we re projecting and i think it s a reasonable projection based on assumptions that we have seen to date for the year and we ve laid it out pretty straightforward with great i think transparency and suggesting that in argentina we will start seeing that turned to be positive in the fourth quarter and suggesting as well but this is at least a 15 million negative impact going into the year and hence that s why we say if you take a look at our business without the argentina piece the rest of the business and the projections in the guidance we re providing are pretty darn healthy so that s one piece of it and obviously as that turns the other way we ll get more of free cash flow generation as we go forward but the 2 0 strategy that i think that we ve laid out is suggesting that a great portion of that strategy is related to opex investment versus capex investment it s related to a combination of a total offering of services that are unique differentiated higher value to the customer but they don t require as much capex and investment to do that what we ve talked about in the last year and this year is this 20 plus million opex investment which if you consider that and you compare that versus our capex investments in the past is relatively low the fact though is if opex and it comes into current year earnings versus being long term capex expenditures and the benefits we think we ll get from the 2 0 initiatives will be higher organic growth our bcpe is one example of it we think will be better total solutions for customers even in our 2 1 or our solutions such as we re talking about for moneygram and others that will be higher organic revenue growth and higher margins that are generated from that with less capital input so over the course of sp2 we anticipate and i d look i d suggest looking at this metric as a new metric as we start looking forward to this how does our capital come down which obviously drives if everything else grows such as our organic growth and our margins then that should drive higher margins higher profitability as well as then higher cash flow and it should also with lower investments it should also drive significantly improved return on capital investments so i would suggest that a good metric and probably the best metric over the course of the three years is to see where our return on invested capital goes over this period of time so you ll see a combination of reduction in capex improvement in margin improvement in organic growth and improvement in invested capital so with that i ll or for more specifics to ron if he wants to talk or address the free cash flow component ronald domanico executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah jeff simple math we had capex in 2019 at 5 4 of revenue of our targets 4 5 that 0 9 times our revenue is about 35 million in improved cash flow just from returning to a normalized spending but on top of that and echoing what doug said we re moving more toward a global lease arrangements on devices associated not only with our 2 0 strategy but also looking at some of our 1 0 wider and deeper investments and our object there is to have the cost of any capital included in the monthly service fees and also increasing the percent of our recurring revenue to make sure that we ve got a model as doug mentioned that has higher margins lower capex and is more recurring it s a trifecta i think that has got a lot of merit jeff kessler imperial capital analyst okay great one follow up question that is on compusafe number one could you reiterate the domestic compusafe number that you said ronald domanico executive vice president and chief financial officer 4 100 units jeff kessler imperial capital analyst okay and as and with that can you talk a little bit about the compusafe strategy internationally given that you ve now expanded internationally where is it taking faster than other places and number two will compusafe be integrated differently into some of the international strategies as well as i guess domestic strategies will be integrated differently into south america rest of world into europe then you re seeing it here ronald domanico executive vice president and chief financial officer i ll tell you that we ve had tremendous success in mexico with compusafe i mentioned 50 compounded annual growth rate of compusafe units installed over the last three years but i would douglas pertz president and chief executive officer brazil alright ronald domanico executive vice president and chief financial officer yes it s working in other countries i would tell you on june 1 you will learn more about a strategy to further penetrate global retail markets with a solution that is less expensive and more profitable for the retailer and for brink s and we re looking forward to that because even though compusafe has been a tremendous asset to retailers certainly larger ones we believe there is an entire segment of the market that s ripe for penetration with a better solution jeff kessler imperial capital analyst alright great thank you very much i appreciate it ronald domanico executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks jeff operator and the last question today will come from jamie clement of brg please go ahead james clement buckingham research group analyst hey gentlemen good morning douglas pertz president and chief executive officer finally jamie james clement buckingham research group analyst hey come on now doug i don t know why i don t know if you could comment on this but obviously looking over the atlantic to europe global competitor of yours lots of stories out there about whether they re going to spin off a business or whether they re going to sell it at all of that kind of thing any comments on kind of how the brink s company looks at that situation from a competitive perspective that sort of stuff douglas pertz president and chief executive officer we think loomis is a great competitor and they did a great job of improving margins in the us and we think it will translate into new good targets for us to hit going forward james clement buckingham research group analyst overall m a i e sort of size of the pipeline versus where it s been seller s expectations all that kind of stuff could you kind of give us a sense of where that s at ronald domanico executive vice president and chief financial officer well i said in my comments jamie the pipeline has more potential deals at the greater enterprise value and as i said in the past all these deals are lumpy we ve also said that we look at everything but as doug mentioned in his comments we re extremely disciplined which means we won t overpay in fact in 2019 we walked away from several deals that got above the point where we believe they would achieve our required rates of return so we really don t want to say more than that i think we ve been consistent and all and we continue to exercise discipline in everything we look at douglas pertz president and chief executive officer yeah and jamie and altering this jamie certainly all we know is the public information that s out there regarding g4s i think they publicly stated that they re going to be looking at what they by the middle of this year and their primary path is a demerger james clement buckingham research group analyst okay ron apologies if i missed this but in terms of organic growth in the us obviously this was a first quarter q4 where you fully annualized the dunbar acquisition certainly didn t expect to maintain all of that business how much of an impact in terms of like planned customer attrition impacted maybe the organic growth rate year over year ronald domanico executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah jamie i would say it was at least 3 it s very hard to quantify but doug is looking at me and said i didn t think it was that big but now we had several customers that had two vendors one was dunbar one was they had invite one of our competitors to take a portion of that business and so it is difficult to quantify we haven t spent a lot of time on it we ve been looking more toward the future and how we represent a compelling opportunity for growth the penetration of a large financial institution is just beginning of that we ve also had some other wins and we re really focused on that but quite frankly we were pleased with the 2 based on the planned attrition james clement buckingham research group analyst okay thank you and then doug last thing as you think about the outsourcing trend whether it s money processing or whether it s atms globally just i m not asking for a global number because i don t know how you quantify it but in terms of the us and obviously some countries are ahead of the us and that sort of thing if you think about your big fi customers or potential customers longer term outsourcing trend what do you think the market opportunity is there for brink s douglas pertz president and chief executive officer well i think for us and the whole industry we think it s fairly significant we saw obviously banks sourcing vaults money processing a number of years ago there is still a substantial amount of that to continue to be done whether it d be in the us or other countries and other locations and we re just starting to see with bpce being the first one globally of the major financial institutions to look at and move forward with the outsourcing of atms we think that s going to be another major place for outsourcing there as well and then we take this the next step we are looking at as our 2 0 strategy for significant look of where the market is going to handle including fis the total cash ecosystem management and so if you take a harder look at rather than just the components associated with that with everything within the cash ecosystem we think there s a lot more to do there it s a combination of outsourcing as well as assuming much more of the total requirements at a lower cost and better value for customers before that follows james clement buckingham research group analyst okay gents thanks very much for the time douglas pertz president and

trading forex during the asian trading hours when looking at trading through the asian session the currency pairings are categorized into the majors cross currency pairings also referred to as the crosses and the exotics the major fx pairings for the asian session are the u s dollar japanese yen or usd jpy aussie dollar a u s dollar or aud usd and the kiwi dollar n u s dollar or nzd usd the global forex markets major currency pairings which also include the euro u s dollar uk pound u s dollar u s dollar swiss france and the u s dollar canadian dollar account for over 70 of market turnover and are considered to be the most liquid as well as the most popular pairings to trade while the eur u s dollar may be the most traded currency globally the u s dollar japanese yen is the most traded currency through the asian session and accounts for close to 20 of fx trades on a daily basis in recent years there has also been an increased influence from china with the markets paying closer attention to china s central bank the pboc and the daily fixing rate for the chinese yuan how the pboc fixes the chinese yuan is a guide on how the central bank views the chinese economic outlook any devaluations and there would be concerns that the economy is about to weaken such a view a negative for the asian emerging currencies the cross currency pairings include the major currencies but with the pairings exclusive of the u s dollar for the asian crosses these would be aud cad aud chf aud jpy aud nzd gbp jpy and nzd jpy with the japanese yen crosses being the more favored during the asian session when it comes to the exotics the currencies belong to economies that have a limited to no impact on the global economy and will have significantly lower trading volumes and therefore much tighter liquidity exotics would as a result be far more volatile and would be considered to be of much greater risk which is reflected in their wider bid offer spreads asian exotics include but are not limited to the thai baht singapore dollar philippine peso malaysian ringgit indian rupee and hong kong dollar to have access to the full suite of asian currencies it is important to select the right platform to trade on with there being little point in using a london or u s based platform when considering the need for liquidity support and the availability of fundamental and technical analysis on the asian pairings during the session alpari is considered to be one of the top brokers to trade during the asian fx market the broker delivers a fast execution environment supported by strong liquidity low transaction fees together with all the necessary analytical tools for a trader to make trading decisions and execute on a daily basis best strategies to trade forex during asian hours the key for anyone looking to trade forex is a strategy based on upon a trader is looking to trade for longer term positions or based on fundamentals or whether a trader is looking for volatility such as day traders the periods during the day to trade become more relevant some day traders who complete multiple trades on a daily basis would make a little gain in a low volatility environment however there are many day traders that are more profitable and know how to take advantage of a low volatility market it is generally advised for long term or fundamental traders to avoid the more volatile periods of a session which are the trading session overlaps which in the case of the asian session would be the new york close asian open and the asian close european open while there may be opportunities to trade fundamentals or for the longer term during the overlaps should price action be favorable the volatility could lead to a trade execution at a less desirable strike price in addition to the session overlaps between the u s asia and europe the economic calendar will also have a material influence on price action which again plays into the hands of short term traders looking for volatility whilst creating uncertainty for the longer term or fundamental trader understanding the economic calendar and the level of influence of the data that is released on a monthly quarterly or on a semi annual basis is certainly an important consideration for short term and long term traders for short term traders being able to predict whether the data release will be positive neutral or negative for a particular currency presents plenty of trading opportunities with much of the price action taking place in the hour prior to the release upon release and in the ten to fifteen minutes following the release it goes without saying that the greater the deviation of the data released from forecasts the greater the volatility upon release and the minutes after release when it comes to the longer term trader having a good knowledge of the key economies how they are performing and the respective central banks outlooks on monetary policy and which economic data release can alter the outlook is important for the asian markets economic data out of australia china japan and new zealand tend to have the greatest impact with china s economic data releases not only influencing the asian markets but also beyond asia though the aussie dollar and kiwi dollar will be most susceptible to china s data particularly when it comes to trade and manufacturing sector data with a plethora of stats scheduled for release each day it is important for traders to focus on the more influential stats and these would be consumer price index trade balance imports and exports consumer confidence business confidence private sector pmis unemployment rates wage growth consumer spending retail sales gdp figures central bank monetary policy decisions the release of central bank policy meeting minutes central bank member speeches so to sum it up traders looking for increased volatility during the asian trading hours should be looking to trade economic data releases during central bank member speeches and in the overlaps between sessions it is recommended to find a local broker that operates during the asian trading hours as decreasing trading errors and having helpful support team from your broker can significantly increase your trading confidence alpari operates since 1999 and considered to be a reliable broker with a wide selection of instruments for a trader looking to take on more risk the crosses and even the exotics are there though with the exotics it s not just the data and sentiment towards the economies that influence but also a geopolitical risk for the longer term or fundamental trader avoiding periods of volatility stemming from session overlaps and economic data releases would be advised and when considering the risks and volatility associated with the exotics avoiding them would also be a wise decision
one belt one road and the future of globalization much ado has been made about china s one belt one road initiative since its announcement in 2013 the massive 5 trillion plan to develop infrastructure across latin america africa and the eurasian landmass has generated a plethora of opinions amongst policy experts and heads of states some view it as china s attempt to use its economic leverage to dominate smaller states while others see it as a welcome endorsement of a global free trade system weakened by self serving protectionist trade policies these two drastically different representations of the same picture have contributed to some of the confusion around the initiative after taking account of its costs and benefits however it is evident that china s one belt one road project will leave a positive impact on the global economy by improving infrastructure promoting trade facilitating the spread of new technologies and ideas and increasing cooperation between nations one belt one road is an ambitious policy plan set out by chinese premier xi jinping and vice premier li keqiang consisting of a network of strategic infrastructure investments aimed at boosting trade and regional economic development across latin america africa southeast asia eurasia and the middle east the centerpiece of the project is a new silk road connecting europe and asia through an overland belt and a maritime road though obor will also encompass investments in all other major continents set to complete in 2050 the initiative seeks to radically transform the global economy and narrow the gap between developed and developing nations it aims to accelerate the trend towards increased globalization especially in poorer countries to better integrate them into the global economy and thereby to achieve prosperity the plan has already opened ports in greece pakistan sri lanka djibouti and sudan railways in laos bangladesh kenya ethiopia and uzbekistan and hydroelectric plants in ethiopia uganda pakistan and tajikistan the lack of infrastructure investment in many nations hinders economic growth widens inequality and impedes progress towards environmentally sustainable growth the world economic forum forecasts a 15 trillion deficit in infrastructure investment by 2035 the one belt one road initiative provides a large portion of these crucial investments which would help alleviate poverty improve access to aid and welfare promote economic development and reach un environmental sustainability targets trade and commerce occur in tandem with the sharing of new ideas allowing the benefits of scientific discoveries and innovations to spread to a greater portion of the world s population such openness would help bring about a future where the quality of healthcare no longer differs drastically between nations where developing nations no longer depend on fossil fuels to drive economic growth and where entire populations are no longer vulnerable to preventable diseases due to lack of existing medication it would mean poorer countries having access to the latest water desalination technologies and agricultural innovations to boost productivity and eliminate food and water shortages and crucially that economic growth bears a stronger correlation to improvements in human welfare thus the aspirations of china s one belt one road initiative are not solely economic in nature but also humanitarian china s belt and road initiative are a manifestation of xi jinping s aspirations for a community of shared future for mankind in which the self interest of disparate nations is aligned with those of the global community his 2015 speech at davos defending globalization reflects his belief that china s future prosperity is linked with those of other nations and that self serving economic nationalist policies do not benefit anyone these values are rooted in china s own experience of rapid economic growth following deng xiaoping s 1979 reform and opening up movement by liberalizing its economy china invited foreign multinational corporations to open up shop and take advantage of its vast pools of cheap labor as well as to sell their products to its massive consumer market according to the national bureau of statistics of china 60 of china s imports and exports came from enterprises with foreign investments companies such as boeing apple and volkswagen acquire a significant portion of their profits from their sales in china as a result chinese workers saw their wages grow 26 times over as the nation underwent year after year of double digit economic growth to ultimately become the world s second largest economy today china s economy is pivoting away from unsustainably high economic growth towards slower but steadier economic growth in light of recent populist victories in the us and in europe as well as the uncertainty in the global environment beijing sees a growing need to defend the international framework of globalization from which it has benefitted so much from one belt one road then can be interpreted as a commitment to the international free trade system as well as a signal of its intention to pursue future growth by investing in nations abroad china s rate of domestic infrastructure investment has slowed in recent years leaving its construction industry with excess capacity by securing building contracts abroad beijing helps its domestic construction companies to continue growing improves its relations with other countries and create new bonds of economic exchange to boost its exports many recipient nations of belt and road funds suffer greatly from a shortage of infrastructure investments plans to build a solar panel plant wind farm and a hydroelectricity dam will help pakistan deal with chronic power shortages which cost its economy 8 4 billion in business losses research conduction by the un economic commission for africa forecasts positive results of obor projects in africa citing under modest assumptions the total exports of countries could increase by 192 million and welfare by about 1 billion the bri would result in a particularly pronounced increase in intra regional trade kazakhstan one of the first countries to sign on to one belt one road has received over 50 projects ranging from power lines to roads and highways which would improve transportation and access to international markets for the landlocked nation in spite of the promise the one belt one road initiative holds for the global economy many in the anti globalist camp have voiced their opposition claiming that globalization has done more harm than good in addition they claim that china s motives are to establish economic hegemony by ensnaring foreign nations in debt and extracting their resources they point to a sharp increase in the level of chinese debt amongst african countries and draw comparisons to colonialism these critiques however are far from the truth while it is true that free trade and globalization have cost jobs in certain sectors as companies routinely outsource labor intensive work to foreign countries with cheaper wages it has also created new jobs and new industries free trade allows companies to sell their products and to overseas markets generating new revenue streams that can be used to create new jobs it raises the average productivity of a country as resources are allocated to industries with large comparative advantages relative to other nations thereby increasing economic growth nobel prize winning economist paul krugman defends free trade in his article in praise of cheap labor arguing that free trade creates much needed jobs in low wage countries and thereby boosts economic growth in regards to the critique that china s motives for undertaking one belt one road are its aspirations for economic dominance the economic benefits brought to other nations by improvements in infrastructure readily disproves this investing in the economic growth of other nations hinders any nation s quest to achieve economic superiority though the debts incurred by particular nations in signing one belt one road contracts have in some cases been sizable the projected benefits are even greater increasing integration into the global economy through the construction of new ports roads airports and power plants allows poorer nations to escape their economic stupor and reach new heights of prosperity additionally most african nations welcome chinese investments in their economies which have improved productivity created new jobs and increased connectivity with neighboring countries the one belt one road initiative has inaugurated kenya s first high speed rail system the 300 mile long mombasa nairobi standard gauge railway brought access to satellite tv to thousands of villages in nigeria and established ports in nigeria egypt and djibouti rwandan president paul kagame has voiced his support for chinese investments in africa stating china can play an important role in supporting african union reforms and promoting africa s development a recent report by the rhodium group an independent research provider comprehensively refutes allegations of debt trap diplomacy in an overwhelming majority of cases beijing has either written off debt 16 cases deferred payment on debt 11 cases withheld further lending 4 cases refinanced debt 4 cases or renegotiated terms of loans 4 cases the sole case of china seizing assets in response to a failure to service debt was the magampura mahinda rajapaksa port in sri lanka in which the sri lankan government leased the port to china after it failed to make good on its debt obligations far from revealing china s neo colonial ambitions one belt one road reflects a commitment to assist other countries in their economic development creating new jobs and opportunities and allowing developing nations to pursue prosperity through environmentally sustainable means the hundreds of billions of dollars in lost trade caused by ongoing us china trade war and trump s unilateral imposition of tariffs on the european union canada and mexico and the incredibly high cost of subsidies given to european farmers to protect them from foreign competition make a pretty convincing case for why protectionism as an economic policy is harmful the great question of our age is whether the global economic order should be one of greater common prosperity through free trade and globalization or one of self serving and ultimately self destructive economic nationalism multilateral institutions such as the world trade organization and regional free trade agreements such as mercosur in south america asean in southeast asia and the eu in europe have come under fire from populist political parties exploiting popular discontentment with the existing economic world order they seek to overturn the system ignoring the rules and pursuing self interest agendas trump s campaign promise of returning jobs to the rust belt and to bring back america s coal industry won him great support amongst discontented workers but are betray a destructive short term view which will eventually cause more damage than good china stands on the side of globalization and commits to a long term vision of increased economic cooperation amongst nations lifting people out of poverty and improving human welfare everywhere the consequences of this question are beyond economic but will affect how we deal with issues such as global warming terrorism extreme poverty and regional conflicts a fractious world order of self interested nation states will hinder our ability to deal with these global issues no single country can solve any of these issues on its own increased connectivity and cooperation between nations is needed if we hope to overcome the challenges of the future the one belt one road initiative will play a big part in realizing this brighter future for all people
democratic party house representatives have voted by a wide margin to approve version 2 of the north american free trade agreement known as the united states mexico canada agreement even rose delauro of connecticut in the past a strong leader within congress in the fight against so called free trade agreements is on board with this one representative delauro and other congressional democrats claim they forced the trump administration to strengthen the agreement by compelling the insertion of language that allegedly creates effective and meaningful labor standards and protect worker rights supports environmental standards and protect access to affordable medicine can this really be true or have congressional democrats reverted to normal form rolling in the dirt at the feet of republicans yet again although democrats and public pressure forced through some improvements the united states mexico canada agreement usmca or nafta 2 isn t substantially different and remains a document of corporate domination it would appear that appearances not substance drove democrats in the house of representatives to approve the deal that was signaled by house speaker nancy pelosi who said she wanted to show united statesians that her party can get things done and is not simply opposing president donald trump for the sake of opposing him that was understood to be a gesture to buttress the re election chances of democrats who won seats in districts previously held by republicans so democrats went along to get along much as they did in approving the massive 738 billion pentagon budget in other words they once again demonstrated that cringing and cowering is their default position one can imagine the discussion behind closed doors yes that will show donald trump we mean business we ll support his most desired policy initiative unfortunately the mexican and canadian governments have not shown much more resistance mexico president andrés manuel lópez obrador despite being elected on a left wave and promising significant change has so far tended to give in to president trump s demands that tendency was underscored by the almost unanimous approval given the usmca by the mexican senate meanwhile canada prime minister justin trudeau has been a willing participant in bringing nafta 2 to fruition even going so far as to be a voice for retaining the ability of corporations to use unaccountable tribunals to sue governments including his own and despite canada s regulations being the most frequent target what the document says isn t what it means so what is really in the usmca text interpretation is what really matters here as the text like all free trade agreements is written in dry technical language that appears to be neutral at first glance but what the words mean in practice and how they will be interpreted by tribunals is not necessarily the same as what the words might appear to say a key portion of the document is chapter 14 the chapter on investment the chapter s first page article 14 1 defines an investment with the standard broad brush not only is any capital outlay covered but so are all forms of financial speculation including derivatives intellectual property rights and intangible property are explicitly named as well so the expectation of a profit across the spectrum of business activities is well covered here and of course the expectation of a profit in actual practice the demand for the biggest possible profit regardless of cost to others is what the owners of capital expect these agreements to help deliver the secret tribunals used to adjudicate disputes frequently presided over by corporate lawyers who in their day job specialize in representing the corporations who sue in the tribunals consistently interpret the language of free trade agreements to mean corporations are guaranteed maximum profits above all other considerations so is the language of chapter 14 substantially different asking that question is important because article 14 3 states that in the event of any inconsistency between article 14 and any any other chapter article 14 prevails the one exception is financial services covered by chapter 17 to which we will return article 14 4 begins with this passage each party shall accord to investors of another party treatment no less favorable than that it accords in like circumstances to its own investors with respect to the establishment acquisition expansion management conduct operation and sale or other disposition of investments in its territory that dry language may sound neutral but it is the exact language that is standard in free trade agreements this is the language that is invoked by multi national corporations to demand damages anytime any law or regulation that upholds health safety worker or environmental standards prevents them from extracting the biggest possible profit this is the language invoked in the secret tribunals that adjudicate these cases to rule in favor of corporate plunder and against regulations when you hear customary international law be afraid that is followed up by article 14 6 which states each party shall accord to covered investments treatment in accordance with customary international law including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security on the surface that passage seems neutral even innocuous but what is customary international law it is whatever the tribunals that have adjudicated disputes between multi national corporations and governments say it is in practice the many outrageous decisions overturning reasonable health safety worker or environmental standards and making corporate profit paramount establishes precedent and thus constitutes customary law the article goes on to state the concepts of fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by that standard and do not create additional substantive rights again what sounds neutral has to been read in context what need for additional rights would be needed when the profits of multi national corporations are elevated above all other considerations we then come to article 14 8 which states no party shall expropriate or nationalize a covered investment either directly or indirectly through measures equivalent to expropriation or nationalization expropriation the word indirectly is crucial here not a reference to a nationalization which would be a verboten act an indirect expropriation can be any government act that regardless of intention or general applicability has the effect of preventing a multi national corporation from extracting the biggest possible profit an environmental regulation or a regulation imposing standards protecting human health are two examples of indirect expropriation and under the rules established here would mean that the government being sued would be obligated to strike such regulations from its law and pay compensation to the corporation the article explicitly states that compensation shall be paid without delay a party is a government that is a signatory to the agreement and what of requiring corporations to act in a socially responsible manner here s article 14 17 in full the parties reaffirm the importance of each party encouraging enterprises operating within its territory or subject to its jurisdiction to voluntarily incorporate into their internal policies those internationally recognized standards guidelines and principles of corporate social responsibility that have been endorsed or are supported by that party which may include the oecd guidelines for multinational enterprises these standards guidelines and principles may address areas such as labor environment gender equality human rights indigenous and aboriginal peoples rights and corruption emphasis added note the provisional language quite unlike the many articles addressing what governments must do for multi national corporations in the standard language of trade agreements rules benefiting capital and erasing the ability of governments to regulate are implemented in trade agreement texts with words like shall and must while the few rules that purport to protect labor health safety and environmental standards use words like may and can the usmca is no different it s the same sleight of hand regulations on banks and internet giants forget about it chapter 17 covering financial services contains the same standard language requiring treatment no less favorable than that it accords to its own financial institutions with respect to the establishment acquisition expansion management conduct operation and sale or other disposition of financial institutions and investments again what appears to be bland language actually means something stronger in this case a prohibition against restrictions on predatory banks article 17 5 explicitly bans

being the most frequent target what the document says isn t what it means so what is really in the usmca text interpretation is what really matters here as the text like all free trade agreements is written in dry technical language that appears to be neutral at first glance but what the words mean in practice and how they will be interpreted by tribunals is not necessarily the same as what the words might appear to say a key portion of the document is chapter 14 the chapter on investment the chapter s first page article 14 1 defines an investment with the standard broad brush not only is any capital outlay covered but so are all forms of financial speculation including derivatives intellectual property rights and intangible property are explicitly named as well so the expectation of a profit across the spectrum of business activities is well covered here and of course the expectation of a profit in actual practice the demand for the biggest possible profit regardless of cost to others is what the owners of capital expect these agreements to help deliver the secret tribunals used to adjudicate disputes frequently presided over by corporate lawyers who in their day job specialize in representing the corporations who sue in the tribunals consistently interpret the language of free trade agreements to mean corporations are guaranteed maximum profits above all other considerations so is the language of chapter 14 substantially different asking that question is important because article 14 3 states that in the event of any inconsistency between article 14 and any other chapter article 14 prevails the one exception is financial services covered by chapter 17 to which we will return article 14 4 begins with this passage each party shall accord to investors of another party treatment no less favorable than that it accords in like circumstances to its own investors with respect to the establishment acquisition expansion management conduct operation and sale or other disposition of investments in its territory that dry language may sound neutral but it is the exact language that is standard in free trade agreements this is the language that is invoked by multi national corporations to demand damages anytime any law or regulation that upholds health safety worker or environmental standards prevents them from extracting the biggest possible profit this is the language invoked in the secret tribunals that adjudicate these cases to rule in favor of corporate plunder and against regulations when you hear customary international law be afraid that is followed up by article 14 6 which states each party shall accord to covered investments treatment in accordance with customary international law including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security on the surface that passage seems neutral even innocuous but what is customary international law it is whatever the tribunals that have adjudicated disputes between multi national corporations and governments say it is in practice the many outrageous decisions overturning reasonable health safety worker or environmental standards and making corporate profit paramount establishes precedent and thus constitutes customary law the article goes on to state the concepts of fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by that standard and do not create additional substantive rights again what sounds neutral has to been read in context what need for additional rights would be needed when the profits of multi national corporations are elevated above all other considerations we then come to article 14 8 which states no party shall expropriate or nationalize a covered investment either directly or indirectly through measures equivalent to expropriation or nationalization expropriation the word indirectly is crucial here not a reference to a nationalization which would be a verboten act an indirect expropriation can be any government act that regardless of intention or general applicability has the effect of preventing a multi national corporation from extracting the biggest possible profit an environmental regulation or a regulation imposing standards protecting human health are two examples of indirect expropriation and under the rules established here would mean that the government being sued would be obligated to strike such regulations from its law and pay compensation to the corporation the article explicitly states that compensation shall be paid without delay a party is a government that is a signatory to the agreement and what of requiring corporations to act in a socially responsible manner here s article 14 17 in full the parties reaffirm the importance of each party encouraging enterprises operating within its territory or subject to its jurisdiction to voluntarily incorporate into their internal policies those internationally recognized standards guidelines and principles of corporate social responsibility that have been endorsed or are supported by that party which may include the oecd guidelines for multinational enterprises these standards guidelines and principles may address areas such as labor environment gender equality human rights indigenous and aboriginal peoples rights and corruption emphasis added note the provisional language quite unlike the many articles addressing what governments must do for multi national corporations in the standard language of trade agreements rules benefiting capital and erasing the ability of governments to regulate are implemented in trade agreement texts with words like shall and must while the few rules that purport to protect labor health safety and environmental standards use words like may and can the usmca is no different it s the same sleight of hand regulations on banks and internet giants forget about it chapter 17 covering financial services contains the same standard language requiring treatment no less favorable than that it accords to its own financial institutions with respect to the establishment acquisition expansion management conduct operation and sale or other disposition of financial institutions and investments again what appears to be bland language actually means something stronger in this case a prohibition against restrictions on predatory banks article 17 5 explicitly bans any limitations on the activities of financial institutions and article 17 6 prohibits any restrictions on taking capital out of a country among other rules article 19 11 prohibits any restrictions on cross border transfer of information which effectively means for example that neither canada or mexico can protect personal information from u s internet companies a cohort not known for responsible use of personal information similar language can be found in chapter 15 covering cross border trade in services this section appears to be modeled on the trade in services agreement tisa a notorious free trade agreement negotiated in secret among 50 countries among them all three nafta countries the european union australia new zealand and japan and purporting to liberalize professional services the cover story for why tisa is being negotiated is that it would uphold the right to hire the accountant or engineer of your choice but in reality is intended to enable the financial industry and internet companies to run roughshod over countries around the world the text of tisa expanded the definition of services to encompass manufacturing and could potentially encompass technology companies like google and facebook as providers of communications services the text of usmca s chapter 15 may not necessarily be stretched as far as it is in tisa but a reasonable reading is that this chapter will provide another weapon that predatory banks can leverage to take over financial systems and halt attempts at bringing them under meaningful regulatory control citigroup microsoft and google are among the many corporate entities celebrating the usmca another area of concern is chapter 11 covering technical barriers to trade this chapter adopts numerous articles from the world trade organization s agreement on technical barriers to trade and makes wto standards obligatory there is also a clause in article 11 7 that requires equal participation by citizens of other countries when technical regulations or standards are developed might this be an invitation for executives and lobbyists for multi national corporations to demand the ability to shape new regulations what might be ruled an unnecessary technical barrier to trade such barriers are intended to be eliminated as stated in article 11 9 ending secret tribunals appears to be an empty promise in free trade lingo when a corporation sues a government the dispute is to be adjudicated in a mechanism known as an investor state dispute settlement that bland sounding bureaucratic phrase means that a tribunal decides the issue under nafta and many other free trade agreements the tribunal is the international centre for settlement of investment disputes icsid an arm of the world bank one of president trump s empty promises was to put an end to the use of these tribunals surprise it ain t so ok it s not a surprise that he lied in disputes between the u s and mexico article 14 d 3 states that disputes will be settled in the icsid but the two sides can agree to have it heard in another forum given the one sided rulings icsid hands down suing corporations have little incentive to use another forum more generally chapter 31 sets the rules for settling disputes there we find article 31 3 which states if a dispute regarding a matter arises under this agreement and under another international trade agreement to which the disputing parties are party including the wto agreement the complaining party may select the forum in which to settle the dispute can a corporation suing a government dragoon the government into the icsid or one of the other two similarly one sided secret tribunals the text later in the chapter is ambiguous on that but does not preclude use of those fora later in the chapter the text speaks of panels without specifying a forum and also mandates in article 31 8 that a roster of up to 30 individuals who are willing to serve as panelists be created the panelists are to have expertise or experience in international law international trade other matters covered by this agreement or the resolution of disputes arising under international trade agreements the exact same expertise required under nafta and virtually all other free trade agreements in other words corporate lawyers who specialize in representing corporations in these kinds of disputes are those who have the expertise and experience to sit in judgment the same hat switching will be in force so even if icsid or the other two secret tribunals are not used and instead a new panel specific to the usmca becomes the new forum the same conditions and same cast of characters using the same precedents will be in force there is no reason to expect any effective difference from nafta some better language but that is not necessarily meaningful as to what potential improvements from nafta exist there are three one is that hearings will be conducted in public article 14 d 8 although there does not appear to be a requirement that a public notice be made the second is that a side agreement in force only between mexico and the u s that purports to uphold workers rights by prohibiting denial of free association or the right to collective bargaining to the extent that doing so impacts the other country annex 31 a a panel is supposed to adjudicate this issue should it arise and apply international labor organization standards the u s government can sue to enforce this annex but can anybody imagine the trump or any other republican administration suing to enforce the right of workers for that matter would a democratic administration seek to enforce collective bargaining standards or the right to form a union if a mexican government acting on behalf of its industrialists discourages it from filing democratic supporters of uscma are taking this provision on faith but it remains to be seen if there will be any use of this annex or if it can be meaningfully enforced even if a future administration does seek to apply it the third improvement is that there is language on the environment that is stronger than in past agreements article 24 2 declares that the parties recognize that a healthy environment is an integral element of sustainable development and are encouraged to promote high levels of environmental protection and effective enforcement of environmental laws there are several articles in chapter 24 discussing various specific environmental concerns but seemingly pro environment language has not been absent from existing free trade agreements and that language has proved to be meaningless window dressing further article 24 2 also says the parties further recognize that it is inappropriate to establish or use their environmental laws or other measures in a manner which would constitute a disguised restriction on trade or investment between the parties here we find a potential giant loophole might environmental laws be interpreted to be such a restriction unfortunately there is ample precedent here a series of rulings culminated in the world trade organization ruling that u s dolphin safe labeling is an unfair technical barrier to trade even though the u s had weakened its laws in response to the earlier wto rulings among rulings handed down under nafta rulings that are considered precedents when similar cases are heard canada had to reverse its ban on a gasoline additive known as mmt a chemical long believed to be dangerous to health because the tribunal ruled the ban a violation of the principal of equal treatment even though had a canadian producer of mmt existed it would have had the same standard applied canada was also successfully sued over its ban on the transportation of pcbs that conformed with both a canada united states and a multi lateral environmental treaty the tribunal ruled that when formulating an environmental rule a government is obliged to adopt the alternative that is most consistent with open trade not only are these types of rulings precedents but recall as noted above that article 14 which elevates expectations of profits above any conflicting consideration supersedes all other articles and to repeat a point made earlier wto standards are obligatory technical barriers to trade as the wto defines them won t be exceptions a billionaires club masquerading as a government so what can we really expect if the usmca goes into effect given not only the history of free trade agreements and the mendacity of the trump administration probably the same as experienced under nafta consider the evidence the trump administration has offered its april 2018 national trade estimate report on foreign trade barriers a document laying out its trade goals no less than 137 countries were cited for raising alleged trade barriers to be attacked barriers that include items like laws requiring food imported to be safe in july 2017 the trump administration quietly published its summary of objectives for the nafta renegotiation which features boilerplate language that in some cases appears to be lifted word for word from the trans pacific partnership and not least is the trump gang s infrastructure plan a macabre joke that mostly consists of massive corporate subsidies and intends the creation of public private partnerships which are scams under which services are privatized for guaranteed corporate profit while becoming more expensive and less subject to public accountability we re supposed to trust this government nafta has been a lose lose lose proposition for working people and farmers in canada mexico and the united states that formula won t be changing the council of canadians has issued a strong warning about what can be expected regulatory cooperation in the new nafta takes away our ability to set standards and regulations to protect our health safety and well being egulations cannot be prescribed for ethical or social reasons the emphasis is on the regulator to prove that a regulation is backed by science and not on the corporation to prove that their product does no harm regulators have to vigorously defend proposed regulations and are even required to suggest alternatives that don t involve regulating they have to provide extensive analysis including cost benefits to industry the new nafta encourages the three countries to harmonize or have similar regulations this is not about raising standards but bringing standards down to the lowest common denominator the national family farm coalition representing organizations in more than 40 u s states said the usmca offers little for family farmers coalition president jim goodman a retired wisconsin dairy farmer said climate change is not mentioned and the new treaty does nothing to curb the environmental damage that was part of the original nafta dairy producers do not support dumping excess us milk on the canadian or mexican markets as that will force family dairy farmers out of business in those countries the sierra club league of conservation voters and national resources defense council also recommended against the agreement being approved the deal that the trump administration produced would encourage further outsourcing of pollution and jobs offer handouts to notorious corporate polluters and prolong trump s polluting legacy for years the deal not only fails to mention acknowledge or address the climate crisis but would actually contribute to it the institute for agriculture trade policy similarly gave a thumbs down to the deal locks in a system of agribusiness exploitation of farmers and workers in the three participating nations while worsening the climate crisis nothing in the new nafta addresses urgent issues plaguing our farm economy low prices rising debt and increased bankruptcy measures in new nafta that open canada s dairy market to increased exports from the u s will not significantly reduce the vast oversupply of u s milk or raise prices paid to u s dairy farmers instead the opening will weaken canada s successful supply management program which has achieved market based prosperity for its farmers added regulatory focused sections will delay and impede the development enactment and enforcement of protections for consumers workers and the environment sadly the main union federation in the u s the afl cio has chosen to endorse the usmca despite its fatal flaws the largest canadian federation the canadian labour congress does not seem to have taken a position although it did issue an ambiguous statement in october 2018 saying the deal had some points of progress the congress specifically cited the eliminating of nafta s notorious chapter 11 that elevated investor rights above all other considerations but that optimism proved erroneous as it is now clear that provision remains in less direct language the governments of canada mexico and the united states have once again put a gun to their own heads free trade agreements continue to have little to do with trade and much to do with imposing a corporate dictatorship a lesson once again being imposed
democratic party house representatives have voted by a wide margin to approve version 2 of the north american free trade agreement known as the united states mexico canada agreement even rose delauro of connecticut in the past a strong leader within congress in the fight against so called free trade agreements is on board with this one representative delauro and other congressional democrats claim

would be a verboten act an indirect expropriation can be any government act that regardless of intention or general applicability has the effect of preventing a multi national corporation from extracting the biggest possible profit an environmental regulation or a regulation imposing standards protecting human health are two examples of indirect expropriation and under the rules established here would mean that the government being sued would be obligated to strike such regulations from its law and pay compensation to the corporation the article explicitly states that compensation shall be paid without delay a party is a government that is a signatory to the agreement and what of requiring corporations to act in a socially responsible manner here s article 14 17 in full the parties reaffirm the importance of each party encouraging enterprises operating within its territory or subject to its jurisdiction to voluntarily incorporate into their internal policies those internationally recognized standards guidelines and principles of corporate social responsibility that have been endorsed or are supported by that party which may include the oecd guidelines for multinational enterprises these standards guidelines and principles may address areas such as labor environment gender equality human rights indigenous and aboriginal peoples rights and corruption emphasis added note the provisional language quite unlike the many articles addressing what governments must do for multi national corporations in the standard language of trade agreements rules benefiting capital and erasing the ability of governments to regulate are implemented in trade agreement texts with words like shall and must while the few rules that purport to protect labor health safety and environmental standards use words like may and can the usmca is no different it s the same sleight of hand regulations on banks and internet giants forget about it chapter 17 covering financial services contains the same standard language requiring treatment no less favorable than that it accords to its own financial institutions with respect to the establishment acquisition expansion management conduct operation and sale or other disposition of financial institutions and investments again what appears to be bland language actually means something stronger in this case a prohibition against restrictions on predatory banks article 17 5 explicitly bans any limitations on the activities of financial institutions and article 17 6 prohibits any restrictions on taking capital out of a country among other rules article 19 11 prohibits any restrictions on cross border transfer of information which effectively means for example that neither canada or mexico can protect personal information from u s internet companies a cohort not known for responsible use of personal information similar language can be found in chapter 15 covering cross border trade in services this section appears to be modeled on the trade in services agreement tisa a notorious free trade agreement negotiated in secret among 50 countries among them all three nafta countries the european union australia new zealand and japan and purporting to liberalize professional services the cover story for why tisa is being negotiated is that it would uphold the right to hire the accountant or engineer of your choice but in reality is intended to enable the financial industry and internet companies to run roughshod over countries around the world the text of tisa expanded the definition of services to encompass manufacturing and could potentially encompass technology companies like google and facebook as providers of communications services the text of usmca s chapter 15 may not necessarily be stretched as far as it is in tisa but a reasonable reading is that this chapter will provide another weapon that predatory banks can leverage to take over financial systems and halt attempts at bringing them under meaningful regulatory control citigroup microsoft and google are among the many corporate entities celebrating the usmca another area of concern is chapter 11 covering technical barriers to trade this chapter adopts numerous articles from the world trade organization s agreement on technical barriers to trade and makes wto standards obligatory there is also a clause in article 11 7 that requires equal participation by citizens of other countries when technical regulations or standards are developed might this be an invitation for executives and lobbyists for multi national corporations to demand the ability to shape new regulations what might be ruled an unnecessary technical barrier to trade such barriers are intended to be eliminated as stated in article 11 9 ending secret tribunals appears to be an empty promise in free trade lingo when a corporation sues a government the dispute is to be adjudicated in a mechanism known as an investor state dispute settlement that bland sounding bureaucratic phrase means that a tribunal decides the issue under nafta and many other free trade agreements the tribunal is the international centre for settlement of investment disputes icsid an arm of the world bank one of president trump s empty promises was to put an end to the use of these tribunals surprise it ain t so ok it s not a surprise that he lied in disputes between the u s and mexico article 14 d 3 states that disputes will be settled in the icsid but the two sides can agree to have it heard in another forum given the one sided rulings icsid hands down suing corporations have little incentive to use another forum more generally chapter 31 sets the rules for settling disputes there we find article 31 3 which states if a dispute regarding a matter arises under this agreement and under another international trade agreement to which the disputing parties are party including the wto agreement the complaining party may select the forum in which to settle the dispute can a corporation suing a government dragoon the government into the icsid or one of the other two similarly one sided secret tribunals the text later in the chapter is ambiguous on that but does not preclude use of those fora later in the chapter the text speaks of panels without specifying a forum and also mandates in article 31 8 that a roster of up to 30 individuals who are willing to serve as panelists be created the panelists are to have expertise or experience in international law international trade other matters covered by this agreement or the resolution of disputes arising under international trade agreements the exact same expertise required under nafta and virtually all other free trade agreements in other words corporate lawyers who specialize in representing corporations in these kinds of disputes are those who have the expertise and experience to sit in judgment the same hat switching will be in force so even if icsid or the other two secret tribunals are not used and instead a new panel specific to the usmca becomes the new forum the same conditions and same cast of characters using the same precedents will be in force there is no reason to expect any effective difference from nafta some better language but that is not necessarily meaningful as to what potential improvements from nafta exist there are three one is that hearings will be conducted in public article 14 d 8 although there does not appear to be a requirement that a public notice be made the second is that a side agreement in force only between mexico and the u s that purports to uphold workers rights by prohibiting denial of free association or the right to collective bargaining to the extent that doing so impacts the other country annex 31 a a panel is supposed to adjudicate this issue should it arise and apply international labor organization standards the u s government can sue to enforce this annex but can anybody imagine the trump or any other republican administration suing to enforce the right of workers for that matter would a democratic administration seek to enforce collective bargaining standards or the right to form a union if a mexican government acting on behalf of its industrialists discourages it from filing democratic supporters of uscma are taking this provision on faith but it remains to be seen if there will be any use of this annex or if it can be meaningfully enforced even if a future administration does seek to apply it the third improvement is that there is language on the environment that is stronger than in past agreements article 24 2 declares that the parties recognize that a healthy environment is an integral element of sustainable development and are encouraged to promote high levels of environmental protection and effective enforcement of environmental laws there are several articles in chapter 24 discussing various specific environmental concerns but seemingly pro environment language has not been absent from existing free trade agreements and that language has proved to be meaningless window dressing further article 24 2 also says the parties further recognize that it is inappropriate to establish or use their environmental laws or other measures in a manner which would constitute a disguised restriction on trade or investment between the parties here we find a potential giant loophole might environmental laws be interpreted to be such a restriction unfortunately there is ample precedent here a series of rulings culminated in the world trade organization ruling that u s dolphin safe labeling is an unfair technical barrier to trade even though the u s had weakened its laws in response to the earlier wto rulings among rulings handed down under nafta rulings that are considered precedents when similar cases are heard canada had to reverse its ban on a gasoline additive known as mmt a chemical long believed to be dangerous to health because the tribunal ruled the ban a violation of the principal of equal treatment even though had a canadian producer of mmt existed it would have had the same standard applied canada was also successfully sued over its ban on the transportation of pcbs that conformed with both a canada united states and a multi lateral environmental treaty the tribunal ruled that when formulating an environmental rule a government is obliged to adopt the alternative that is most consistent with open trade not only are these types of rulings precedents but recall as noted above that article 14 which elevates expectations of profits above any conflicting consideration supersedes all other articles and to repeat a point made earlier wto standards are obligatory technical barriers to trade as the wto defines them won t be exceptions a billionaires club masquerading as a government so what can we really expect if the usmca goes into effect given not only the history of free trade agreements and the mendacity of the trump administration probably the same as experienced under nafta consider the evidence the trump administration has offered its april 2018 national trade estimate report on foreign trade barriers a document laying out its trade goals no less than 137 countries were cited for raising alleged trade barriers to be attacked barriers that include items like laws requiring food imported to be safe in july 2017 the trump administration quietly published its summary of objectives for the nafta renegotiation which features boilerplate language that in some cases appears to be lifted word for word from the trans pacific partnership and not least is the trump gang s infrastructure plan a macabre joke that mostly consists of massive corporate subsidies and intends the creation of public private partnerships which are scams under which services are privatized for guaranteed corporate profit while becoming more expensive and less subject to public accountability we re supposed to trust this government nafta has been a lose lose lose proposition for working people and farmers in canada mexico and the united states that formula won t be changing the council of canadians has issued a strong warning about what can be expected regulatory cooperation in the new nafta takes away our ability to set standards and regulations to protect our health safety and well being egulations cannot be prescribed for ethical or social reasons the emphasis is on the regulator to prove that a regulation is backed by science and not on the corporation to prove that their product does no harm regulators have to vigorously defend proposed regulations and are even required to suggest alternatives that don t involve regulating they have to provide extensive analysis including cost benefits to industry the new nafta encourages the three countries to harmonize or have similar regulations this is not about raising standards but bringing standards down to the lowest common denominator the national family farm coalition representing organizations in more than 40 u s states said the usmca offers little for family farmers coalition president jim goodman a retired wisconsin dairy farmer said climate change is not mentioned and the new treaty does nothing to curb the environmental damage that was part of the original nafta dairy producers do not support dumping excess us milk on the canadian or mexican markets as that will force family dairy farmers out of business in those countries the sierra club league of conservation voters and national resources defense council also recommended against the agreement being approved the deal that the trump administration produced would encourage further outsourcing of pollution and jobs offer handouts to notorious corporate polluters and prolong trump s polluting legacy for years the deal not only fails to mention acknowledge or address the climate crisis but would actually contribute to it the institute for agriculture trade policy similarly gave a thumbs down to the deal locks in a system of agribusiness exploitation of farmers and workers in the three participating nations while worsening the climate crisis nothing in the new nafta addresses urgent issues plaguing our farm economy low prices rising debt and increased bankruptcy measures in new nafta that open canada s dairy market to increased exports from the u s will not significantly reduce the vast oversupply of u s milk or raise prices paid to u s dairy farmers instead the opening will weaken canada s successful supply management program which has achieved market based prosperity for its farmers added regulatory focused sections will delay and impede the development enactment and enforcement of protections for consumers workers and the environment sadly the main union federation in the u s the afl cio has chosen to endorse the usmca despite its fatal flaws the largest canadian federation the canadian labour congress does not seem to have taken a position although it did issue an ambiguous statement in october 2018 saying the deal had some points of progress the congress specifically cited the eliminating of nafta s notorious chapter 11 that elevated investor rights above all other considerations but that optimism proved erroneous as it is now clear that provision remains in less direct language the governments of canada mexico and the united states have once again put a gun to their own heads free trade agreements continue to have little to do with trade and much to do with imposing a corporate dictatorship a lesson once again being imposed

image by jacques boissinot the canadian press via ap introduction historically canada s relationship with the african continent has sat between two competing impulses which have been deeply embedded in the canadian public and policy elite the first impulse sees canada engage when there is a crisis such as famine a disease outbreak or a humanitarian crisis black 2016 in this case canada usually responds with positive rhetoric that is almost always followed by a lack of any long term commitment or a follow up action plan the other impulse sees policy and academic elites realists perceive any significant amount of resources dedicated towards africa whether it is human institutional or financial as not being a priority and being a waste of resources black as a result canada has been caught between two competing interests of seeming to be doing something while committing the least amount of resources limiting itself to as little risk as possible this policy approach has resulted in canada having an unsustained and incoherent relationship with the continent and has resulted in the canadian public having a limited understanding of the continent because africa is viewed through the prism of a particularly prominent issue area most often aid peacekeeping or the extractive sector while the image of the continent thereby projected to canadians is distorted and decontextualized black in a report entitled canada africa relations in changing core periphery dynamics a chance to come back differently elizabeth cobbett suggests canada has an opportunity to reengage africa and come back differently if it can look beyond its mining interests and become a partner in this rapidly changing continent through a new and bold international partnerships she further notes africa s impending economic rise should provide an incentive for the government of canada to engage in a meaningful way if canada can achieve this it might gain political and economic clout on the continent moving forward why does this matter it only took china 35 years to go from an agrarian society to almost a fully industrialized powerhouse as a result of china s rise it has shifted geopolitical power the proliferation of technology will speed up this process even more for african states the fact that canada s bid for a temporary seat in the un security council received virtually no african vote illustrates the disconnect between african states and the government of canada former canadian ambassador to the un yves fortier described it as a lamentable result a reflection of things that canada has done or not done that a majority of nations disapprove of another important factor canadian policymakers should consider is that africa is the world s second fastest growing economic region after east asia coupled with china s meteoric rise as an economic and political power african states have new markets and are becoming less dependent on western countries gray et al 2013 suggest that the structural transformation of the world economic system is going to have important implications for developed countries african countries are seeking alternative trading partners as they move away from the western centered neoliberal world order gray and murphy 2013 moreover canada s traditional trading partners have adopted protectionist economic policies this presents a real challenge for the government of canada and there is a growing chorus from some canadian economists who suggest canada needs to seek alternative markets in developing countries they argue that canada needs to reevaluate its reliance on the u s market for trade and export couple this with the fact that donald trump s undeclared trade war with canadian companies has left many businesses with an uncertain future a recent report called canada economic outlook notes canada needs to look to alternative markets due to the united states dismantling of large parts of the washington consensus in favour of america first unilateralism compromising open markets and the post war liberal economic order the report further states brexit and political struggles worldwide suggest this might become the established norm than the product of an erratic us administration this article is not making an argument for canada to stop trading with arguably the world s biggest economy it is merely suggesting canada needs to look to alternative markets to maintain a competitive edge in unpredictable economic times with the impending economic rise of africa this would seem like a logical policy choice for canadian policymakers britain china the united states france and the european union have all launched initiatives to strengthen bilateral trade and investment relationships with africa the uk is set to host an african investment summit later this year with key mandates to maintain existing trade relationships if or when it leaves the eu and look for other investment opportunities the eu has the joint africa eu strategy which was adopted at the lisbon summit in 2007 it established a partnership of equals and goes beyond development to tackle issues of common interest in an increasingly interdependent and fast changing world canada s and africa s futures are closely linked from threats to peace democracy and economic prosperity to the fight against poverty and climate change what affects africa will eventually affect canada and vice versa canada should look beyond the extractive sector to achieve a sustainable and mutually beneficial economic relationship with the continent canada should look beyond its mining interests and develop an economic relationship which is beneficial to all parties involved as it stands canada s economic investment in africa has been primarily in the extractive sector canadian companies investing in the extractive sector have more than doubled over the last 20 years currently the mining and the extractive sector is ranked the largest source of foreign direct investment in africa by the canadian government mchenry doepel and urama 2017 the mining sector is an integral part of the canadian economy internationally canada is a leader in mining and one of the world s largest producers of minerals and metals the industry accounted for 19 or 97 billion of the value of the goods canada exported in 2017 toronto is the global hub for mining finance the toronto stock exchange tsx and tsx venture exchange are the world s number one mining and exploration listing venues where nearly one third or 8 5 billion of the world s total equity capital was raised in 2017 the different levels of government also rely on the mining sector for tax revenues according to the natural resource governance institute in 2017 the sector paid 9 3 billion to the canadian governments by contrast in developing countries mining activities are associated with human rights violations unethical behaviour deforestation and land degradation in her report entitled peace and security in africa and the role of canadian mining interests new challenges for canadian foreign policy bonnie campell notes that canadian politicians have continually insisted that the need to invest in africa is to bring economic development and strengthen governance however strong empirical evidence shows this has not been the case evidence has shown that under certain conditions investing in mineral rich countries may fuel violent conflict and impede development similarly research conducted by collier and hoeffer 2000 collier 2004 and ross 2001 found similar outcomes a report by the world bank called natural resources and violent conflict found developing countries face substantially higher risks of violent conflict and poor governance if they are highly dependent on one or few primary commodities bannon et al 2003 in 2005 the canadian international development association cida announced that it was creating a new strategic partnership with african countries to increase aide ties this new partnership was informed by a report called canada making a difference a policy statement on strengthening aid effectiveness one of the report s findings was canada needed to increase its ties to developing countries by providing enhance aid the countries chosen would receive priority when it came to the allocation of development assistance to help strengthen their governance structure however some scholars have critiqued this partnership arguing that the government of canada was more motivated by its own economic interests rather than a desire to implement policies that would be beneficial to all countries involved these scholars point to the fact that out of the nine countries selected by canada for an enhanced aid partnership identified in the country s policy statement five were located in africa all had important mineral resources and for three ghana mali and tanzania mining represents the country s leading sector corbett 2017 as this report was being written a canadian convoy carrying employees of a canadian owned mining company was attacked in eastern burkina faso leaving 37 people dead global affairs canada condemned the attack stating to date we have no reports of any canadian citizens being affected canada stands in solidarity with the burkinabè people and supports burkina faso s efforts to consolidate peace and stability and in its fight against terrorism what needs to change i noted earlier that canada has been caught between two competing interests canada engages the continent when there is a crisis which usually results in aid money pouring in however this the wrong policy approach canadian policymakers need to look beyond aid and recognize that focusing on aid as an economic development model is no longer a viable option or solution the world bank published an influential report entitled assessing aid what works what doesn t and why world bank 1998 the report was based on econometric analysis in it the authors argued that aid produces growth only in countries with a good policy environment and sound fiscal monetary and trade policies without which aid is wasted aid is only effective if it is combined with the right policies in recipient countries furthermore canada s economic interests should go beyond the extractive sector there are several economic areas canada should invest in manufacturing is a growing sector on the continent manufacturing production has more than doubled from 73 billion in 2005 to 157 billion in current prices in 2014 or 98 billion in 2005 prices african manufacturing has grown at 3 5 annually in real terms over the past decade which is faster than global growth in manufacturing production the share of manufacturing in total formal and informal employment international labour organization ilo data fell from 6 4 in 1991 to 5 3 in 2013 but the total numbers of employees in sub saharan africa increased from 11 0 million to 17 7 million new economic development model canada also needs to rethink how it promotes economic policies on the continent since the bretton woods conference which under american british and canadian leadership established the postwar international architecture of a rules based global trading system and the institutions to support it imf world bank wto parts of the un these international regulatory institutions have continually insisted african countries liberalize globalization which forced many developing countries to eliminate trade barriers proponents of this economic model argued that trade liberalization would increase productivity foreign direct investment fdi technology and migration flows which would ultimately result in higher incomes and job creation and hence a reduction in poverty vickeri 2006 there is no denying this model has improved the lives of millions of people living in extreme poverty around the world by providing access to basic medicine improved access to education and technology for example former prime minister steven harper instituted a flagship development program initiative of maternal newborn and child health mnch to reduce maternal and child mortality in sub saharan africa the funds provide by the government of canada helped provide nutrition strengthen health care services and reduced the spread of diseases the program has been widely hailed as saving millions of mothers and newborn lives despite these improvements and two decades of unprecedented economic growth the number of africans living in extreme poverty still increased by more than 100 million people beegle et al 2016 v while globalization has reduced inequality between countries it has increased inequality within countries and this is true in both advanced and developing economies a report called growing unequal income distribution and poverty in oecd countries organization for economic cooperation and development 2008a revealed growing inequality and poverty in two thirds of oecd countries and found that the economic growth of recent decades has benefited the rich more than the poor an oxfam report noted twenty six men now own the same wealth as the 3 6 billion people who make up the poorest half of humanity oxfam 2017 this inequality has given rise to populist politics and a significant backlash against globalization the backlash has been most prominent in the very same western economies that promoted these policies most notably the united states and the uk the increase in poverty in developed countries has been felt by the middle class populist leaders have laid blame on unfair foreign competition bad trade deals and have blame immigrants for stealing jobs policy recommendations of course canadian african relationships are much broader complex and it encompasses far more than the issues highlighted in this brief article canada has long standing and steadily expanding trans societal links other dimensions of trade in goods and services the seemingly never ending crisis of humanitarianism in the face of protracted humanitarian emergencies and the challenges and repercussions of climate change however when these issues come together they highlight the need for canada to engage in a more comprehensive and coherent policy approach toward africa as david black notes a more coherent policy towards africa does not mean without any contradictions it simply means that in the course of the policy process the contradictions are recognized confronted analyzed and to the greatest degree possible mitigated one of the practical approaches canada can take is to increase and sustain resources both human and financial devoted to africa policy a systematic engagement will be one of the best ways to address some of the challenges facing the continent partnering with countries with deep knowledge and expertise on the issues and opportunities facing the continent is a good first step secondly policymakers should identify ways that canada can bring distinctive priorities and assets to bear in addressing these issues and build and sustain relationships with key african counterparts in partner countries regional organizations and civil societies evidence based research to inform policy is one area canada can use its expertise to help african states on average sub saharan african governments spend less than 0 5 of gdp to support evidence based research the oecd country average is more than four times that at 2 3 african governments have recognized the importance of research and committed to increasing investment in science and technology to 0 7 of gdp by 2020 and 1 of gdp by 2025 canada can use its expertise in this area to create a strong development research ecosystem such as those found in high performance western countries these research institutions can act as a bridge to civil society and academic researchers and a point of reference for thoughtful policy oriented research the various canadian governmental bodies with relevant responsibilities and expertise will need to be brought into a more concerted policy making process around critical challenges facing the continent the government of canada can develop national and regional initiatives that accelerate and support research and research based education in africa to build the necessary human capital needed and increase the capacity of institutions to provide valuable training and research opportunities more local research should lead to an increase in evidence based policymaking and hopefully generate better outcomes for citizens the african institute for development policy afidep in kenya is a great institution that promote and nurture a culture of evidence informed decision making in government institutions and parliaments and build a stronger community of practice in evidence informed decision making in africa canadian policymakers can look to partner with these organizations from a realists point of view the time and resources spent on africa are largely wasted if the trudeau and subsequent canadian governments take this approach it will damage any hope we have to build or forge a sustained coherent policy with africa what is not in our national interest but continues to be the preference for canadian politicians is inflate our importance in far away trouble spots and exaggerate the nobility of our motivations black noted this approach is not credible certainly in the crowded diplomatic landscape of contemporary africa and should be resisted even as the country aims toward a more comprehensive and cohesive policy approach moreover the traditional bilateral official development assistance oda needs to be re evaluated as other countries and other sources of development finance has grown in importance such as remittances foreign direct investment influential new philanthropists like the gates foundation and new aid providers from rising states of the global south e g china brazil india turkey etc it important for canada to systemically evaluate how it engages africa because africa is the next economic and political powerhouse africa s youth population is currently estimated at 250 million a staggering figure in terms of the potential for african economies and the potential talent pool that could be untapped however it also presents challenges for policies maker this can be area canada can lend its expertise when it comes to research technology and providing the necessary training for educators the world is in a desperate need for leadership but it can t be leadership base on generalities and abstractions there has to be real concrete policies and real initiative if not canada will continue to remain on the periphery when it comes to africa
dear shareholders global stock markets ended 2019 on a high note with the global msci acwi index returning 8 95 and 26 60 for the fourth quarter and full year respectively and the domestic s p 500

for msci acwi and s p 500 indices with 68 4 of its capital at risk on average during the year 3 portfolio the fund has unusual breadth having the ability to invest in more diverse regions sectors and asset classes than almost any other mutual fund yet we will only commit capital when we have determined that upside opportunity exceeds downside risk if we believe prices are attractive we buy if not we hold or sell importantly we don t because we can t try and pick market tops or bottoms santa left coal in our stockings at christmas 2018 as global markets swooned like good little children we did the right thing and took advantage of lower prices increasing the fund s risk exposure by approximately ten percentage points in the second half of 2018 then christmas came early last year as markets rebounded ultimately reaching new highs we similarly took advantage of rising prices in 2019 and reduced or sold positions that we could no longer justify holding at given valuations and therefore ended the year with 9 2 less risk exposure the u s continued to outperform international markets which has made foreign domiciled companies marginally less expensive all else being equal at the end of the year the s p 500 trailing price to earnings ratio or p e was 21 6x higher than the 19 8x of the msci acwi the international component of the msci acwi traded at a p e of 17 4x at year end this almost 20 discount to u s stocks helps to explain why the fund s exposure to international companies has increased at year end the fund had 35 4 of net equity invested outside the u s six percentage points higher than at the end of 2018 the fund s shareholders have entrusted us to decide when upside opportunity surpasses downside risk the fund s investment exposure will therefore swing between more and less invested while the fund was less invested in 2019 we have no doubt that in the future we will deploy more of its capital we continue to focus on companies that have at least a small

dollars before the potential impact of the competitive threats is known the market has sidled over to our thinking on this at least for the time being american international group s aig financial stock lost 32 in 2018 including dividends negatively impacting the fund s performance in that year in 2019 however it delivered a total return of 34 5 the company s multi year turnaround efforts are finally bearing fruit and the market has begun to take notice the fund further benefited by increasing its stake to take advantage of price weakness in late 2018 if aig s return on capital continues to improve as we expect the company should trade at a similar price to tangible book value multiple as its peers were that to be the case we can see its stock trading at 70 to 80 in the next couple of years a healthy premium to its closing price of 51 33 at the end of 2019 as value investors aig is emblematic of so many of our investments that underperform on their way to outperforming glencore lse glen financial shares were under pressure on the back of commodity weakness and regulatory concerns we continue to think the shares at a single digit free cash multiple represent compelling value the other four detractors have all been discussed previously please refer to previous commentaries for additional information investing value investing means investing with a margin of safety so if all doesn t go according to plan whether ours or a company s then investors may nonetheless come out close to whole this may mean having the protection of business and or balance sheet but without that protection the emperor wakes up one day to realize he s not wearing clothes being a value investor in 2019 was like wearing a crew cut in haight ashbury in 1969 not only do you stand out you invite a bit of ridicule we value investors must not acquiesce to the fear of missing out however and instead make our peace with a different kind of fomo the fate of missing out to do well over long periods of time means accepting that we won t do well for lengths of time in between we realize that has made us appear both smart and dumb at different moments in time but our goal is to deliver over the long run rather than at any one point in time when all appears easy it generally isn t what we won t do is redefine value we believe we can help ourselves and you by staying the course and continuing to invest bottoms up taking a look from the top down though helps explain why we find it more challenging to unearth suitable investments today we end up struggling to find great risk rewards against the following backdrop low interest rates and a lack of investment alternatives have lifted the price of risk assets globally global stock markets trade at or near their highs as a percent of their respective economies as shown in exhibit b looking at the stock market from a price to earnings basis it becomes clear that when earnings are smoothed valuations have only been this high once before this is shown in exhibit c using the shiller p e methodology that divides current price by ten year average earnings adjusted for inflation however current p e ratios are not so outlandish in the context of low interest rates and a reasonably good economy should rates remain low and economies avoid weakening measurably markets could reasonably remain at today s elevated levels the long outperformance of growth stocks compared to value stocks has left value much less expensive trading at a relative p e that s about as low as we have ever seen it in our careers this does not make value stocks cheap just less pricey than growth stocks in fact value stocks have performed reasonably well over the last decade the s p 500 value index has compounded at a rate of 12 14 value investments just haven t done as well as growth stocks which have annualized at 14 76 9 however growth stocks have outperformed their fundamentals which has led to p e multiple expansion while value stocks have not side note the s p 500 value index had better 10 year earnings growth than the s p 500 growth index but that is because it started at a point that was at its earnings nadir judging what a company is worth and where its stock should trade requires a great deal of interpretation analyzing a bond s performance is generally easier as the most you can get as a return is the contracted amount though an appreciation for the underlying company s solvency will cause one to accept a higher or lower yield credit investors current acceptance of historically low yields reflects their greater concern for return than for risk whether it be in investment grade high yield or levered loans the investment grade or ig bond market today has the lowest yield and lowest credit quality in its history for instance lowly bbb credits have more than quadrupled in value low yield and low credit quality don t generally go hand in hand in addition at 7 9 years the ig market has the longest duration in its history 11 any increase in interest rates or spread will therefore have a larger impact than has been the case previously the levered loan market has trebled from 527 billion to 1 5 trillion over the last ten years and yields just 6 2 cracks are beginning to show about 4 of the leveraged loan universe was trading below 80 cents on the dollar at the end of the year versus just 2 in may 2019 13 we suspect that busted levered loans will be a future opportunity under the fund s broad mandate the high yield segment of the credit market has been important to the fund since its inception today however we are not getting paid anywhere near enough to invest broadly in high yield we said the same thing a year ago and the high yield market soared but more than half of its 14 return came from tighter spreads and lower yields due to a decline in interest rates 14 we were under no illusion that just because we didn t think the risk reward then in high yield was attractive the market would collapse and we don t mean to suggest it will collapse now we do want to make sure that a prospective return justifies the risk assumed as much as that wasn t the case a year ago we believe it is even less so now we offer five good reasons why we believe that high yield should be avoided low yields trading at 5 4 near its lowest all time yield exhibit g narrow spreads current spread over treasuries is 3 7 well below average exhibit g lower credit quality leverage and interest coverage metrics of corporate america using bloomberg barclays us corporate high yield index as a proxy are at a low which is particularly unusual because the economy is relatively robust exhibit h weak covenants about as weak as they ve ever been weaker covenants give the advantage to the borrower exhibit i larger credit market the corporate bond market has grown from 4 3 trillion to 9 4 trillion in the last decade the high yield and levered loan components of it have almost doubled from 1 5 trillion to 2 8 trillion exhibit j it has recently been a tale of two high yield markets in which the good credits have gotten better and the bad haven t seen much price movement spreads of better high yield bonds have tightened and at year end almost one third of the stocks tracked in the ice bofa u s high yield index trade at yields less than 4 0 on the other hand spreads of ccc rated and riskier bonds have remained flattish over the last 12 months 19 when interest rates increase and or the economy weakens there will be lots of opportunity reaching for yield will have the usual consequence this time the fallout might be magnified further because of the five reasons for caution listed above if there is a run on the bank we wonder at what clearing price a buyer will step in also the rise of passive funds adds another concern at the end of 2019 there was 253 billion in corporate bond exchange traded funds or etfs including 56 billion in high yield and 10 billion in levered loans passive funds that invest in less liquid securities such as small cap stocks high yield bonds and levered loans only offer the illusion of liquidity they give their shareholders the ability to buy and sell daily but the underlying securities these funds own can be quite illiquid any significant selling of high yield etfs could cause lower rated corporate bonds to hit a pricing air pocket with bids dropping precipitously in this world of immediate gratification investors are foregoing future yield for current yield and unwittingly accepting de facto illiquidity in the process we have knowingly accepted some illiquidity for a very small portion of the fund s portfolio investing in private credits including non publicly traded loans to private companies 21 we expect a higher yield for the lower liquidity and that has been the case since 2009 when such investments have delivered approximately 14 weighted average return to the portfolio importantly all of these loans have had first liens with collateral coverage well in excess of the loan amount we believe the higher yields and better asset coverage have made these private loans far less risky than the broader high yield bond market with 30 loans and more than 650 million invested since 2009 the fund has yet to experience a loss on any we will continue to make such loans but given that we manage a public fund with daily liquidity we seek to mitigate the potential for forced selling by keeping these less liquid positions small 22 economy and macro we offer limited value when speaking of the larger global macro environment so here we provide only a skeletal view to help explain the challenge in finding good investments today as david rosenberg of gluskin sheff pointed out in a normal cycle the stock market has a correlation of roughly 60 with the economy the other 40 is explained by factors like valuations sentiment technicals and momentum this cycle was literally off the charts in that respect because only 7 of this entire bull market was due to the economy and that s a good thing if you are long the stock market because this did go down as the weakest economic expansion on record and yet one of the most powerful bull markets ever mr gluskin concluded the fundamentals do win out in the end but it could take time 23 we don t think the stock market s link to the economy has been severed but it has at least been largely suspended when and how deep a future recession might be and how the market might react remain open questions risk does seem skewed to the downside today the show goes on as long as the government puppet masters allow or when the audience leaves the u s deficit climbed just over 1 trillion in 2019 despite a growing economy and the tightest labor market on record central banks have successfully inflated asset prices but failed to ignite real economic activity most americans are not better off today than they were a decade ago extremely low interest rates continue to pervert capital allocation decisions whether or not to buy a piece of equipment repurchase shares or make an acquisition a lower cost of capital can improve an otherwise impractical or marginal decision this doesn t seem likely to change anytime soon the global monetization experiment took a pause but has since restarted and a more expansive fiscal policy is under discussion indebted governments companies and individuals have recalibrated to this low level of rates when or if rates eventually rise many of these same parties may find their finances dangerously askew one only need to look east for a recent example of the failure of low interest rates to keep markets elevated japan cut interest rates throughout the 1990s and has kept them low ever since despite that japan s nikkei stock index declined more than 40 four times between 1990 and 2009 low interest rates are not a panacea and can present or mask other problems debt accumulation at the sovereign corporate consumer and state and local levels has bought economic growth but at an as yet to be determined cost debt has grown far faster than the gross domestic product gdp in the u s a situation that can t mathematically endure unabated since 2009 u s federal debt has increased by 10 8 trillion helping to buy 6 9 trillion in gdp growth the eu and japan have similarly been borrowing to buy gdp as depicted below exhibit l at the end of 2019 the u s national debt stood at over 23 trillion exceeding the country s estimated 21 4 trillion gdp the chart below shows that using gdp as a proxy for income the return on investment for u s spending has declined for decades and is now as low as it has ever been as a nation we are getting less while paying more corporate debt growth has been another contributor to u s gdp growth almost trebling since 2008 without a commensurate increase in gdp relative to the size of our economy we now have more debt on corporate books than at any point in time in history exhibits j and n in good times leverage enhances corporate earnings but the opposite is true in an economic downturn not wanting to be left out households have joined the debt accumulation party consumer debt is now at an all time high in dollars and as a percent of gdp superficially household debt growth doesn t appear so terrible but that perception is biased by the fact that non housing debt has grown much faster than mortgage debt and only 64 of households own a home increasing auto student and credit card loans continue to propel the economy as they reach new heights non housing debt balances have been increasing faster than income and now sit at 32 035 per household unlike governments individuals must one day repay their debts 27 simply the average american s finances are getting strained take auto loans as an example car buyers have stretched their auto loans over longer periods so that they can buy the car they want or just to buy a car at all experian reported in the first quarter of 2019 that the average term for a new car loan is 68 9 months with the term of more than one third of new vehicle loans longer than 73 months and with a few as long as 96 months 29 the credit rating agency also stated that the average initial term for a used car loan is 64 7 months and that s for a car that s already a few years old some 20 of used car loans are for longer than 73 months thus the average used car buyer will still be paying off a loan for a car that s more than eight years old and consumer reports sets the average life of a new car at only about eight years 30 debt accumulation in the form of unfunded liabilities also will likely pose a problem in the future but that problem might lie well beyond a typical investment horizon nevertheless it s good to understand the current state of affairs almost three quarters of state and local pensions in the u s are underfunded despite optimistic assumptions about the expected return on plan assets 31 the state pension funding gap alone is arguably understated by 1 3 trillion or so the u s also has an estimated 122 trillion of unfunded federal liabilities including social security and medicare 33 unfunded federal state and local liabilities could be mitigated by higher taxes and changes to benefits these politically painful options if implemented would likely prove an economic obstacle we will inevitably come upon a time when we will be forced to live within our means and the consequences at least for a time will not benefit the stock market conclusion we will continue to seek to capitalize when equities both domestic and foreign and credit mostly public but some private are ripe if not we shall maintain our more conservative posture there are those who take liquidity and those who provide it we prefer to be the latter a function of temperament and having cash on hand for investment we look for shareholder partners of a like mind those who also prefer an equity like rate of return over time while trying to avoid a permanent impairment of capital we try to field a balanced team playing both offense and defense since we believe that the stock market will generally rise over time we do tilt more towards offense but not indiscriminately if we are given lemons we will make lemonade but we can t even do that if there s a drought it is generally psychologically easier to invest when a rising market validates an investor s purchases we take greater comfort when choppier markets challenge an investor s conviction even more so when a lower price follows each new purchase for now anyway it seems to be buy high and sell higher respectfully submitted steven romick trades portfolio co portfolio manager february 5 2020 us investment grade bonds is

entrepreneurial approach within his presidential campaign as his background is far different from that of his fellow candidates yang has two unique plans in place for reducing student loan payments his bailout for the people plan would entail taking a blanket partial reduction in the principal of student loans meanwhile the 10 10 student loan emancipation act would enable the federal government to buy the student loan debt and then allow students to repay it by using 10 of their salary per year for 10 years after that timeframe the balance would be forgiven michael bennet michael bennet

relieves those teaching full time for five years in a low income school system this forgiveness is up to 17 500 please be aware that student loan forgiveness only applies to federal student loans student loan cancellation it is incredibly difficult to have your student loans canceled altogether it is important to understand the difference between cancelation and discharge borrowers with a federal perkins loan can have up to 100 of their student loan debt canceled if they are advertisement advertisement a teacher serving a low income community a special education teacher in a field of study with a shortage of qualified teachers this cancelation only applies to nonprofit or public school teachers who work in an elementary or secondary school system duties are based solely on job position not the job title student loan discharge there are far more options when it comes to student loan discharge some of the discharge requirements include total and permanent disability discharge if you are totally and permanently disabled you may qualify for a discharge of your federal loans this includes veterans as well as those unable to work because of disability discharge due to death your federal loans may be discharged once a death certificate is issued this only applies if your loan servicer receives documentation of your death closed school discharge if your college closes while you are an enrolled student you could be eligible for discharge borrower defense to repayment discharge this only applies if your school violated state laws related to federal student loan payment this relates to misconduct such as misleading students you may also qualify for a false certification discharge if your school falsely certified you for a loan as well as receiving an unpaid refund discharge for lack of return bankruptcy discharge in extremely rare cases you may be eligible for discharge after declaring bankruptcy however it s important to note that filing for this loan discharge is not automatic and is a separate action from filing for bankruptcy what it would really mean to cancel student loan debt many top contenders for president plan to do away with student loan debt entirely but how would this affect the economy canceling student loan debt may stimulate the economy while also offering a second chance at financial freedom for those drowning in borrowed money with that said eliminating all student loan debt would cost a lot of money and wiping out 1 6 trillion would not be an easy task sanders college for all plan would cost an estimated 2 2 trillion whereas warren s would cost roughly 1 25 trillion over the next decade according to each politician advertisement advertisement look how gen z plans to avoid student loans taxing the wealthy both elizabeth warren and bernie sanders propose taxing the wealthy in order to wipe out student loan debt warren plans to implement an ultra millionaire tax which applies only to households with a net worth of 50 million or more this would equate to the top 0 1 of americans these households would then pay an annual 2 tax for every dollar of net worth above 50 million with a 6 tax for every dollar of net worth over 1 billion warren believes this will bring 3 75 trillion to the economy in just a decade sanders on the other hand wants to implement a wall street speculation tax to cancel all student loan debt and essentially pay for all college this plan will implement a 0 5 tax on stock trades which would be 50 cents for every 100 stock there will also be a 0 1 fee on bond trades and a 0 005 fee on derivative trades this tax will bring 2 4 trillion to the economy over the next 10 years tuition free colleges twenty four states currently offer tuition free community junior college programs most of which only offer associate degrees and not bachelor s but many of the democratic candidates don t want it to stop there while tuition free certainly sounds exciting this doesn t account for other hefty academic expenditures housing books and meals quickly add up while covering tuition is a much needed financial relief for many families it s important to read the fine print before committing to these types of programs and remember students must fill out the free application for federal student aid fafsa in order to qualify for tuition assistance anywhere more grants there are many different types of grants especially for degree programs focused on jobs within the public sector unlike student loans grants do not have to be repaid to the government student loans also come with interest which causes more debt for the borrower if students had the opportunity to receive more grant money there would be less of a need for borrowing federal pell grants are perhaps the most common form of grant which is awarded to undergraduate students on a financial need basis the maximum federal pell grant is 6 195 for the 2019 2020 year however with most public universities ranging from 7 000 to 11 000 a semester one can see why there is such a pressure on democratic candidates to have supplementary plans raising the gross domestic product a 2018 study by levy economics institute of bard college discovered that canceling the total student debt which at the time was 1 4 trillion would boost the gross domestic product gdp by up to 108 billion a year on average for the next decade gdp accounts for the value of all goods and services produced by the united states to compare the current dollar gdp as of the second quarter of 2019 was 21 34 trillion based on these predictions wiping out student loan debt may do more good than harm improving unemployment the levy economics institute of bard college study also reflected on unemployment with job creation at its peak within the first few years following debt relief the study said this elimination will add roughly 1 2 million to 1 5 million new jobs per year this will also decrease the average unemployment rate which will be reduced by 0 22 and 0 36 percentage points the racial and economic issues the racial wealth gap affects economic progress in several ways with many minorities relying heavily on student loan debt to finance higher education poorer families are also choosing riskier forms of student debt due to a lack of funds with many for profit colleges targeting candidates based on race according to the century foundation black students are more likely to experience negative financial events after graduation which is largely affected by lower family wealth and racial discrimination in the workforce with less wealth and more debt financial outcomes are grim for many minority students voters should be looking for policies that seek to decrease racial disparities and narrow the racial wealth gap rather than only focusing on universal debt cancellation as a whole more from gobankingrates this article originally appeared on gobankingrates com what it would really mean to cancel student loan debt
top countries with expanding gold reserve system untied states of america as the markets crashed in 1929 uk left the gold standard system after the frequent attacks made by the speculators effected the pound price to float and to determined by the market forces countries started to disbelieve in the gold standard system and one after another gave up the system by the collapse of the pound against the gold speculators started to focus on us federal gold reserve which refused to give up the gold standard system the us took new actions to recover the world crisis one of the actions was to raise interest rates that was below 20 in order to break down speculations against the dollar as the government pressured the fed the federal open markets operations committee fomc was established to increase supply by decreasing interest rates on governmental and corporate bonds eventually the fed and the government realized that they were not on the right track and they have had to change something they realized that the gold was the pivot point of the fiscal policy and nothing can be changed without system revision by the beginning of president roosevelt period reconsideration of the gold standard system was a priority it didn t take too long to recognize that lifting the gold standard up was a key element to recover the great depression straightaway roosevelt took a decision to let the dollar price float against gold by resetting its value at significant low level wwii burdens were insufferable by that time every country took the decision to give up the gold standard system as it became very exhausting in 1944 before the end of the war the big governments signed the breton woods agreement which stated currencies prices to be fixed to the us dollar instead of gold nevertheless the us dollar should be converted in gold whenever there was a demand and gold to be priced at 38 per ounce the final destination for gold role in the fiscal policy came in 1971 when president richard nixon decided to terminate the gold standard system and to replace it by the petrodollar system starting from that date interest rates replaced gold and became the pivotal point of fiscal policy by that time gold was out of the federal reserve fiscal policy although the importance as a reserve asset did not diminish for the treasury secretary according to the world gold council usa lead the countries gold reserves list it stated that the usa holds 8133 5 usd12 000 000 000 which consists 74 of the total reserves held by the treasury the treasury is responsible to reserve the gold in deep storage since january 31 1934 in three places denver co fort knox ky and west point ny us is the forth gold producer with 209 tons a year moreover if we re consider the classification of gold percentage out of total reserves as no other country is keeping that high percentage of gold reserves but tajikistan the us is placed as the second on that list a question should arise here what does that means a usa as the producer of the most dominating currency doesn t need a large amount of foreign currencies b gold has an inverse movement with the dollar meaning that as the demand for gold rises by the treasury gold price will go up and us dollar will devalue in other words weakest dollar can boost economy and higher reserved gold value european countries using the euro similarly to the us policy the euro considered to be one of the world economy columns despite the fact that ecb holds 26 of its gold reserves by 504 tons every country in the eu represents its treasury by holding a separate amount of gold reserves the form of sell euros buy gold as a reserve is a common policy within eurozone countries germany comes second on the list by holding 3377 tons representing 68 8 followed by italy with 2451 tons representing 67 8 of the reserves however cyprus holds only 33tons represents 64 1 of its reserves france 2435t 63 8 netherlands 612t 63 9 portugal 382t 59 1 and austria 280t 45 the european countries maintain structured formula to hold high gold reserves of their total reserves commodities currencies etc as the gold standard system rules global economy a country must sustain gold reserves in order to control its currency and economy venezuela learnt the lesson venezuela one of the top oil producer was determined to hold anti west policy adopted the anti dollar system by putting 64 8 of its reserves in gold instead of foreign currencies which represents only 187 5 tons the lowest in three decades that wasn t the plan of venezuela in december 2009 venezuela s central bank released the gold reorganizing they had a 10 year plan to increase gold reserves they didn t declare the amount they plan to increase due to the financial crisis and the decreasing confidence in usd and they called this year the year of gold actually the plan worked for while where the reserved amount rose from 355t to 365t by 2011 nevertheless it didn t work for a long time the country faced a severe crisis in 2016 caused a sell off of two thirds of its gold reserves in a lower price than 2010 as a result the increased amount bought after the 2009 reorganization was sold by loss and venezuela is classified as shrinking economy important lesson we should learn from the venezuela model as we go through this research

concerns about coronavirus abated this week as the spread of the virus levelled off while the number of infected increased to 31472 the daily pace of new cases levelled off somewhat while the death toll reached 638 contagion outside hubei province also seems limited with only one death related to the virus outside china signs of containment of the virus boosted global risk sentiment global equity markets rebounded reaching all time highs in many countries with the impact of the virus on global demand likely to be smaller than feared commodity prices also went up although the oil price fell back after opec failed to agree on cuts on thursday investors are now gauging what the economic impact of the virus will be in a note this week we project a v shaped scenario for global growth expecting a large hit to chinese growth in q1 and a nosedive for pmi in february followed by a sharp rebound of pmi in q2 the rest of the world will also feel the impact somewhat due to lower chinese demand and supply chain disruptions with the most exposed being the asian countries due to the negative impact on tourism the spreading of the virus will continue to be a key focus next week and if the number of cases outside of hubei continues to slow and the death rate remains low we think the markets will increasingly focus on other things this week the chinese central bank cut interest rates and injected liquidity into the economy amid heightened risk from the virus furthermore the chinese authorities pledged further monetary and fiscal measures if needed new measures could be announced already next week in the us many fomc members will be speaking next week where we will look for any change in the fed s view on the economic outlook so far it has highlighted the coronavirus as a downside risk but not more than that despite the market pricing in more cuts from the fed most importantly fed chair powell is set to testify tuesday and wednesday leaving the coronavirus aside momentum in the global manufacturing sector appears to be strengthening in the us ism manufacturing surged to 50 9 in january from 47 2 in december while the euro area pmi also increased slightly next week the us retail sales on friday will be one of the week s most important releases private consumption growth has slowed the fed says moderate consumption growth from previously strong growth and the question is whether this is just due to noise in the data while the preliminary consumer satisfaction for february will be the first real post virus break out data although we don t expect the virus to influence us consumers much on the us political side the first democratic primary election in iowa got off to a chaotic start on tuesday with most of the votes counted surprisingly pete buttigieg tied with bernie sanders for first place while elizabeth warren and joe biden placed third and fourth respectively the strong showing for buttigieg and sanders gives them strong momentum going into the upcoming primaries with the new hampshire on tuesday being next in germany shock waves went through the ruling coalition after the cdu voted with the afd to install a liberal fdp candidate as state premier in thuringia a coalition crisis meeting in berlin has been scheduled for saturday scandi market movers in denmark we are scheduled to receive december s export figures and january s consumer prices on monday industry has driven much of the growth in exports this year so the major slump in industrial production of 5 9 in december could very well also spill over onto the final export figures for 2019 we expect cpi inflation to decline to 0 4 from 0 8 in december we expect energy prices to weigh down as we have seen large declines in both electricity and gas prices during december and january on the back of an unusually warm winter so far on top of this comes the reduction in the pso tariff in q1 which in itself reduces electricity prices by 1 7 compared to december finally last year s big increase in the price of district heating in the wake of the lapse of a government subsidy slides out of the inflation measure which also deducts 0 10 percentage points from headline cpi we expect book prices to decline again from a historical high they are currently up by 33 y y adding to the decline in inflation is also the base effect from food and furniture the price of which increased significantly in january 2019 we still expect a significant rebound in inflation during the spring primarily because of the hike in tobacco prices from april the pso tariff should also increase in q2 if forward prices on electricity remain low friday should bring statistics denmark s first take on growth in q4 19 in the form of the gdp indicator which means we will also get the first glimpse of overall growth in 2019 so far both production and demand tend to indicate that q4 was a relatively weak quarter the autumn s preliminary figures for exports and industrial production have not been as stellar as in h1 19 when they were the primary growth engines while retail sales have pointed towards weak private consumption for this reason we expect growth of 0 2 in q4 19 hence most of 2019 gdp growth occurred in h1 19 while growth in h2 19 was more reminiscent of what we have seen in the rest of the world under normal circumstances in sweden riksbank policy announcements are important events we suspect that this time around and probably the next several announcements it might turn out pretty much dull after having moved into holding position almost throughout it is hard to see the riksbank changing stance anytime soon in the macroeconomic section the riksbank can of course point to some improvements in data like manufacturing confidence nier and composite pmi of late however before the virus along with early signs of stabilisation in china and the ez at the same time the coronavirus is a new uncertainty at least for now in other words in terms of policy signals we do not expect the announcement to be a market mover but it is still worth mentioning since the uncertainty about lfs was announced the more important is the pes unemployment rate last print came out at 7 2 and we expect the next number to increase slightly i e our overall assessment is that the labour market continues to deteriorate in norway core inflation trended downwards in h2 last year mainly as a result of prices for imported consumer goods rising more slowly however the sharp drop in the krone towards the end of the year means that the downside risk to imported inflation is fairly limited wage growth also accelerated from 2 9 in 2018 to 3 7 in 2019 which could mean that domestic inflation pushes up during the course of 2020 pulling the other way are weak demand and excess capacity in parts of the retail sector which will make it difficult to raise prices owing to base effects we expect core inflation to climb from 1 8 y y in december to 2 0 y y in january there are however some signs that food prices may have risen more than normal and that there has been something of an increase in transport costs which could pose a slight upside risk to our forecast thursday brings norges bank governor øystein olsen s annual address we do not anticipate any new monetary policy signals since the bank seems very comfortable with the current balance of risks nor has olsen previously used the occasion as a platform to announce any major change of tack as his predecessors sometimes did instead we think much of the speech will be devoted to a discussion of how norway should handle the transition to a low carbon economy we do not however expect him to call for any major changes to economic policy including when it comes to oil download the full weekly focus

provided in this news release are estimates only and there is no guarantee that the estimated reserves will be recovered actual crude oil reserves may eventually prove to be greater than or less than the estimates provided herein all december 31 2019 reserves presented are based on glj s forecast pricing effective january 1 2020 all december 31 2018 reserves presented are based on glj s forecast pricing effective january 1 2019 all december 31 2017 reserves presented are based on glj s forecast pricing effective january 1 2018 it should not be assumed that the estimates of future net revenues presented herein represent the fair market value of the reserves there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil reserves and the future cash flows attributed to such reserves proved developed producing reserves are those reserves that are expected to be recovered from completion intervals open at the time of the estimate these reserves may be currently producing or if shut in they must have previously been on production and the date of resumption of production must be known with reasonable certainty proved developed non producing reserves are those reserves that either have not been on production or have previously been on production but are shut in and the date of resumption of production is unknown proved undeveloped reserves are those reserves expected to be recovered from known accumulations where a significant expenditure e g when compared to the cost of drilling a well is required to render them capable of production they must fully meet the requirements of the reserves category proved probable possible to which they are assigned proved reserves are those reserves that can be estimated with a high degree of certainty to be recoverable it is likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated proved reserves probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves it is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the sum of the estimated proved plus probable reserves possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves there is a 10 percent probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the sum of proved plus probable plus possible reserves it is unlikely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the sum of the estimated proved plus probable plus possible reserves the term boe means a barrel of oil equivalent on the basis of 6 mcf of natural gas to 1 barrel of oil bbl boe s may be misleading particularly if used in isolation a boe conversation ratio of 6 mcf 1 bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead given the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6 1 utilizing a conversion ratio at 6 1 may be misleading as an indication of value light crude oil is crude oil with a relative density greater than 31 1 degrees api gravity medium crude oil is crude oil with a relative density greater than 22 3 degrees api gravity and less than or equal to 31 1 degrees api gravity and heavy crude oil is crude oil with a relative density greater than 10 degrees api gravity and less than or equal to 22 3 degrees api gravity with respect to finding and development costs the aggregate of the exploration and development costs incurred in the most recent financial year and the change during that year in estimated future development costs generally will not reflect total finding and development costs related to reserve additions for that year references to initial production test rates are useful in confirming the presence of hydrocarbons however such rates are not determinative of the rates at which such wells will commence production and decline thereafter and are not indicative of long term performance or ultimate recovery while encouraging readers are cautioned not to place reliance on such rates in calculating the aggregate production for parex parex cautions that short term production rates should be considered preliminary this press release contains several oil and gas metrics including f d costs fd a costs recycle ratio reserve replacement nav and rli these oil and gas metrics have been prepared by management and do not have standardized meanings or standard methods of calculation and therefore such measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies and should not be used to make comparisons such metrics have been included herein to provide readers with additional measures to evaluate the company s performance however such measures are not reliable indicators of the future performance of the company and future performance may not compare to the performance in previous periods and therefore such metric should not be unduly relied upon management uses these oil and gas metrics for its own performance measurements and to provide security holders with measures to compare the company s operations over time readers are cautioned that the information provided by these metrics or that can be derived from the metrics presented in this news release should not be relied upon for investment or other purposes a summary of the calculations of such metrics are as follows finding and development f d costs are calculated by dividing capital expenditures by the change in reserves within the applicable reserves category f d costs including fdc include all capital expenditures in the year as well as the change in fdc required to bring the reserves within the specified reserves category on production finding development and acquisition fd a costs represent the costs of property acquisition exploration and development incurred the aggregate of the exploration and development costs incurred in the most recent financial year and the change during that year in estimated future development costs generally will not reflect total finding and development costs related to reserves additions for that year fd a costs are calculated as capital expenditures plus net acquisition costs plus change in fdc fd a per boe is calculated as fd a costs divided by reserves additions for the applicable period recycle ratio is calculated as funds flow from operations netback divided by f d or fd a as applicable funds flow from operations is a non gaap measure that includes all cash generated from operating activities and is calculated before changes in non cash working capital funds flow from operations netback or funds flow from operations per boe is calculated by dividing funds flow from operations by sales volumes for the period reserve replacement is calculated by dividing the annual reserve additions by the annual production net asset value nav per share is calculated as before or after tax npv10 plus estimated year end working capital converted from usd to cad as applicable divided by basic shares outstanding at december 31 2019 reserves life index is calculated by dividing the applicable reserves category by the annualized fourth quarter production unaudited financial

the case for buying precious metals maurice jackson of proven and probable speaks with andy schectman president of miles franklin precious metals investments about the rationale for buying precious metals and the best values at this time maurice jackson joining us for a conversation is andy schectman the president of miles franklin precious metals investments recently we discussed the prudence of implementing ratios as an effective strategy for readers in identifying buy and sale signals for their precious metals portfolio today we re going to expand the narrative further on buy signals and discuss the best values right now what to buy should we experience a broken down system and a very important topic protecting your financial legacy before we begin mr schectman for first time readers who is miles franklin precious metals investments andy schectman this month miles franklin is celebrating our 30th year in business in minneapolis we re a family owned company we have eclipsed 6 billion in transactions without ever having a customer complaint ever we maintain an a rating with the better business bureau we re one of fewer than 25 companies ever approved by the united states mint as an authorized reseller of their product and in a federally non regulated industry and we re very proud of that reputation we really are an association with people like yourself and rick rule and other icons in the industry we re very proud of all of our accolades and of our reputation but the state of minnesota where we re located could care less about our reputation that s the only state in the industry in the united states that regulates the precious metals industry we are licensed we are bonded and we are background checked everyone in the company from clerical staff to salespeople to principals like myself background checked every single year continuing education and compliance that s mandatory and a surety bond that has made most of the competition throughout the united states boycott minnesota what it means in essence we have a great reputation but the state of minnesota puts an exclamation point on that basically guaranteeing the safest transaction in the precious metals industry maurice jackson andy before our interview you made a valid point there that really should be the theme for today s interview and that was the central banks are preparing and so should we that really resonated with me because all too often i find many investors focus on the federal reserve and what their next move is on interest rates and how the secondary market will respond just what exactly are central banks doing and why andy schectman in the 1990s all the central banks signed on to what was called the washington agreement and i could never understand why they all wanted to sell their gold and so fast and the central banks with the washington agreement were limited to 500 metric tons per year the amount that they could sell so as to not completely destabilize the precious metals market i remember that s when gordon brown and the bank of england finished selling all of their gold as it approached 280 an ounce didn t make a whole lot of sense to me to this day it still doesn t there were four reasons that would ve pushed them into doing that number one gold doesn t pay interest number two gold costs money to store number three the return is not predictable there s volatility but the biggest reason the fourth reason was the tier three asset status where the amount calculated on a balance sheet was only equal to 50 of the value so the denigration of the balance sheet the inability to sell bonds and to transact international business by a factor of 50 would have made the central banks want to line up to sell their gold as of april 1 of last year as you know the reclassification of gold through the basel iii agreement to the only other tier one asset on the planet next to u s dollars and treasuries has made these central banks run from selling gold run to accumulating it in 2018 they bought more gold than at any time in the previous 60 years last year that number was up almost 90 and this year every small central bank from central america to eastern europe is loading up on gold they are de dollarizing quietly and accumulating gold unlike any time i have ever seen in 30 years in this industry maurice jackson when i think about the federal reserve one of their claims to fame is that they d like to be transparent i cannot recall the federal reserve sharing the information you just shared with us with the citizens of the united states am i incorrect in that andy schectman no they don t absolutely not in fact when i was a financial advisor a long time ago i was series 7 licensed which is the ability to sell stocks that s back when people who sold stocks were called stockbrokers instead of financial advisors that all changed with the internet and free trades or 9 trades by scottrade everyone all of a sudden became a financial advisor instead of a trader because traders made their money per trade instead of money under management as an advisor that s a topic for a different day to this day one of the most impactful things i ever saw in 30 years in this industry was page one of the series 7 manual it s about a 300 page book page one you open it up and it says and this was the only writing on the page it said the little man rule the little man rule is that the little man never wins because the big investor is always ahead of the curve so i believe that the central banks were alerted at probably 2017 at the meeting in basel switzerland they probably were told that in 2019 this was going to go into effect that s why they have been accumulating gold so voraciously since 2018 and no one s talking about it until the central banks have properly positioned themselves then it ll become front and center news the old saying about it s less what you know and more who you know in life really is true all too often i think they take care of themselves they being the central banks and the central banks by their movements are de dollarizing and they re taking this very seriously let me put it to you this way gold was up 18 last year that s one of the biggest movements that i can ever remember in a year and no one even notices it because the stock market was up even more the movement in gold i can tell you as someone who owns a precious metals company was not due to retail investment we had a good year last year but our year was characterized much more by large orders by accredited and institutional size investors and less by the average person in 2011 we were getting 200 orders per day last year we were down to 10 of that but the volume we did was probably greater than 2011 all i can simply tell you is this is that the 18 movement in gold last year if i had a gun to my head i would say is 99 attributed to central banks accumulating it on the quiet they ve been doing it since 2018 and they did it in 2019 and that trend continues unabated now at some point when the central banks have properly de dollarized and repositioned maybe it ll be more front and center news but until then that would crowd them out of their own trade so it s the old saying don t do as i say do as i do well that s a prime example of it maurice jackson on behalf of all of our listeners the retail investor the little investor the little guy that you were referring to thank you for sharing your words of wisdom with us because again this is the narrative that we don t hear we see price movements but we don t understand why and the rationale behind it we re truly experiencing a financial system that is breaking down and we have bubbles surrounding us it s not a matter of if what everyone should consider is when and how to prepare can a single individual take the same actions as the central banks are taking andy schectman absolutely the united states by its own admission is north of 120 trillion in debt just between the national debt of 22 trillion and the 53 trillion shortfall in social security we re 75 trillion in the hole why is that not front and center news maurice everywhere you know a trillion seconds ago was 31 688 years ago so why the hell is that not front and center news just like the reclassification of gold the things that matter about the future of our country are being glossed over in favor of trying to impeach donald trump for trying to have joe biden s son investigated the bottom line is it s a misappropriation of efforts and of energy and of money the things that really matter are being completely and totally glossed over when you look at a country that is just between those two things 75 trillion in the hole north of a 100 trillion in the hole in unfunded liabilities and things like medicare and medicaid and government military and pensions and entitlements the u s is broke as we talked about before and i heard on your interview with bob moriarty click here he mentioned the same thing i did the largest single asset in the united states is student debt we have 2 trillion in assets of which 1 8 trillion is in student debt which as he eloquently said that people like elizabeth warren want the taxpayer to pay for it the biggest issue is we are a country that s financially insolvent with nothing in the way of assets so the most important thing is to ask yourself not how much gold and silver should i own but what exposure do you want in a currency that is effectively broke and the most sophisticated well funded and influential traders on the globe are quietly exiting stage left that s the most important thing so you do what you can you mitigate your exposure to the dollar one of the slides that i showed at the sprott show last year was a slide from jp morgan private wealth this is the division of their company that works with the wealthiest investors in the world the centi millionaires and the billionaires and they sent a letter out to all of their clients in this division that s created quite a stir in the industry and it basically said that we want you to mitigate your exposure to the u s dollar through foreign currencies and precious metals because we believe it is inevitable that the dollar will be challenged at some point for singular world reserve status well there you go it s about mitigating your exposure to the dollar it s about trying to take some of that dollar risk off the table in a non dollar denominated asset with no counter party risk as doug casey so eloquently says gold is the only asset that is not simultaneously someone else s liability when i say gold i mean silver platinum and palladium too the bottom line is that you remove counterparty risk when you take possession of it you remove the dollar risk then there s our friends at morningstar through ibbotson have reminded us recently that because of the interest rates being so low the inverse relationship between stocks and bonds used to be called risk on risk off well that s gone because as interest rates rise it kills both markets what they basically said was the only asset left on the planet that has an inverse correlation to the united states stock market are precious metals so you have inversely correlated assets or an inversely correlated relationship between the u s stock market and the u s dollar you see the most sophisticated traders on the globe doing de dollarizing to not recognize this because of price and price alone is a huge mistake because that is the greatest tool of misdirection is price bottom line how do you do it you just simply buy what you can when you can and slowly de dollarize do as the biggest and most in the know and sophisticated traders on the planet are doing you de dollarize best you can as often as you can maurice jackson you referenced some household names here one i d like to interject it is rick rule when he makes his reference to precious metals that they are payment in full that s something we all should consider there precious metals don t have the word note on them they re not an iou they are payment in full let s switch the narrative from rhetoric to arithmetic and talk to the person listening right now and share some specific buying opportunities that you ve identified that will maximize their precious metals portfolio because i find that all too often most buyers don t take advantage of the premium fluctuations within their metal of choice what are you and your most successful clients buying right now andy schectman first of all let s just talk about the pink elephant in the room and that is the silver price there s no question that silver is in my opinion anyway that silver is the most undervalued commodity on the planet while we re still able to get it there s very little that you can think of buying that is as undervalued as silver what commodity can you buy that s trading at a third of its peak 1980 peak i mean you can t think of anything that you can buy today any commodity from food to energy to precious metals that trade at a fraction of what they were trading for in 1980 silver with the 86 to 1 ratio the relative relationship between gold and silver is screaming to buy silver so let s just say that silver is the best buy period with that being said you could also say the same thing about platinum i guess too because the relation between platinum and gold is at its all time high i think silver has more utility not only as an industrial metal but also as money than platinum does platinum doesn t have the history as money but it s a great value too if i m buying gold i m buying the 20 gold pieces the numismatic gold coins are as inexpensive or on par with or only slightly higher than gold bullion coins and that is a price anomaly if i m buying gold on my low grade certified mint state 20 gold pieces for basically the same price as a gold eagle that is in my career almost unheard of in terms of premium as you mentioned it s nonexistent and in 2007 2009 those coins were trading at 60 70 premium to a 1000 gold price but even in the 1990s when gold was in the midst of a 25 year bear market those coins traded at a 20 to 25 premium to gold spot now they re 4 to 5 it s as good of a value in gold as i ve ever seen if i m buying silver i think it s very difficult to ignore the value that we find in junk silver bags 90 by weight dimes quarters and half dollars right now as far as their price i remember when they were 4 6 an ounce over the price of silver and today you can get them for roughly 0 69 over silver it s an incredible value an incredible bargain bottom line is that when you re buying gold and silver it s just most important to focus on maximizing what you get but not crossing over the penny wise pound foolish threshold by buying too large of a piece you always want to maintain good liquidity and flexibility typically i don t go any bigger than one ounce in anything i recommend typically whether you re playing poker or driving on a crowded highway or just investing you can never have too many exits or too many outs or too many options and so i guess you could easily say in this industry by going big by buying 100 ounce bars of silver or 10 ounce bars of gold in lieu of a one ounce piece the savings that you get is not commensurate with the loss of flexibility if i m buying platinum i m buying one ounce platinum maple leafs they re probably the best buy if i m buying silver right now my first choice is going to be 90 junk silver bags if i m buying gold my number one choice is going to be ms61 ms62 or ms63 20 gold pieces which are amongst the cheapest i ve ever seen in 30 years in this industry maurice jackson switching gears let s discuss storage and protecting your financial legacy because i believe a number of precious metals investors make a critical error right here the biggest one in my experience is using safe deposit boxes at their banks andy why would storing your precious metals in a safe deposit box not be in their best interest andy schectman well there ve been a couple of banks i think morgan chase came out and said you re not allowed to store coins or cash in a safe deposit box safe deposit boxes are not insured the contents are not insured they have nothing to do with fdic furthermore if you were to have a bank run into problems or there were a banking holiday they d close it down on a friday night and you wouldn t get into that box until they reopened not a good idea also the banks have programs that scour the obituaries and if someone dies and it s in the obituary those boxes are sealed until they are opened for probate so it would be the last place i would store my precious metals a safe deposit box in a major institution a banking institution in the united states would be the last place i would store my precious metals i would dig a hole in the backyard and become a midnight gardener before i would do that maurice jackson all right does miles franklin offer a more efficient safer storage alternative andy schectman yes we do we offer several both domestic and international but i would like to talk about the international storage and we actually do have a safe deposit box program in canada in toronto and in vancouver we have been given north american exclusive on this program we re the only ones who have access to it these are brand new state of the art safe deposit boxes where there s only one key you as the depositor hold the one key and the only spare most people who have used the safe deposit box before will remember the experience of going into the facility opening up the box with a key at the same time the bank administrator will put a key in you put them in together that s the master key and then the box opens with these they re just one key you hold the only key and the only spare our safe deposit box program is fully insured there are a few things unique about it number one if you google basic questions and answers form 8938 you go right to the irs website and they will say on that website that precious metals held outside the united states in a directly held fashion in a non financial institution are not reportable well the only example the irs has ever given as to what they mean by directly held is a safe deposit box in a non financial institution so what differentiates our program number one state of the art one key boxes instead of two the bank does not or brinks in this case does not hold the master key number two it s held in a non financial institution brinks is not a financial institution like a bank number three it s fully insured whereas stuff held in a safe deposit box in a bank is not insured lastly the way that we bill for this is by the ounce we re the only one in the industry that i know of that bills by the ounce instead of by the value in other words if you believe gold can only go higher from here you have a fixed rate with our storage program so it s not reportable to the federal government in both facta and fbar because of the fact that it s directly held in a non financial institution the client holds the only key and the only spare it is fully insured i think maybe the biggest reason to consider owning metal outside the united states is look at what the central banks are doing we started out this conversation by saying the central banks are preparing so should we but what are they preparing for they appear to be preparing for a dollar that runs into trouble if the dollar runs into trouble the first thing that the u s government will do in my opinion is create or impose currency controls because the inclination of the wealthy if the dollar starts to slide let s just say as we ve talked about before opec says we re going to accept payment for oil in yuan and ruble or let s say the brics nations issue a new currency backed by gold or maybe it comes right out of china or whatever it is that creates panic selling in the dollar the very first thing that the u s would do would be to close the window of getting money out of the country because the first inclination of wealthy people in the united states would be to buy something from another currency they would buy swiss denominated bonds or real estate in another currency but in order to do that you have to first sell dollars to buy a swiss bond or to buy a condo in vancouver by doing that you exacerbate the inflation you increase the velocity at which things happen so currency controls if things get bad with the dollar will be the first thing that will happen having money outside the country non reportable fully insured in a fixed rate structure in my opinion makes our storage program the envy of the industry and non comparable there is nothing like it to be able to have money outside the country that fully is legal and no one knows about and won t go higher in terms of its value no matter how high gold goes based upon the falling dollar to me is much more than just storing your gold outside the country maurice jackson andy last question what did i forget to ask andy schectman i don t think you ve forgotten really to ask anything maurice you re thorough as can be the bottom line is simply this that i think if people are concerned about things going upside down in this country and you want to buy some metal to protect at home to me junk silver dimes and quarters are the best choice in silver and one tenth ounce gold american eagles are the best in gold they re the size of a dime they re clearly marked one 10th of an ounce from a barter standpoint if people are concerned about that those are the two things to own for me my main consideration when i am either buying gold and silver for myself or recommending it to others is to maximize what we re getting without decreasing my flexibility never ever compromising my liquidity the things that we ve talked about today junk silver one 10th ounce eagles low grade certified 20 gold pieces one ounce platinum coins these are all as liquid and vanilla as anything you could ever buy they will maximize your liquidity and your flexibility never compromising them i think that if you follow that rule you ll never go wrong in this industry whatever you re doing maurice jackson andy for the person listening that wants to get more information

provided in this news release are estimates only and there is no guarantee that the estimated reserves will be recovered actual crude oil reserves may eventually prove to be greater than or less than the estimates provided herein all december 31 2019 reserves presented are based on glj s forecast pricing effective january 1 2020 all december 31 2018 reserves presented are based on glj s forecast pricing effective january 1 2019 all december 31 2017 reserves presented are based on glj s forecast pricing effective january 1 2018 it should not be assumed that the estimates of future net revenues presented herein represent the fair market value of the reserves there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil reserves and the future cash flows attributed to such reserves proved developed producing reserves are those reserves that are expected to be recovered from completion intervals open at the time of the estimate these reserves may be currently producing or if shut in they must have previously been on production and the date of resumption of production must be known with reasonable certainty proved developed non producing reserves are those reserves that either have not been on production or have previously been on production but are shut in and the date of resumption of production is unknown proved undeveloped reserves are those reserves expected to be recovered from known accumulations where a significant expenditure e g when compared to the cost of drilling a well is required to render them capable of production they must fully meet the requirements of the reserves category proved probable possible to which they are assigned proved reserves are those reserves that can be estimated with a high degree of certainty to be recoverable it is likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated proved reserves probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves it is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the sum of the estimated proved plus probable reserves possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves there is a 10 percent probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the sum of proved plus probable plus possible reserves it is unlikely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the sum of the estimated proved plus probable plus possible reserves the term boe means a barrel of oil equivalent on the basis of 6 mcf of natural gas to 1 barrel of oil bbl boe s may be misleading particularly if used in isolation a boe conversation ratio of 6 mcf 1 bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead given the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6 1 utilizing a conversion ratio at 6 1 may be misleading as an indication of value light crude oil is crude oil with a relative density greater than 31 1 degrees api gravity medium crude oil is crude oil with a relative density greater than 22 3 degrees api gravity and less than or equal to 31 1 degrees api gravity and heavy crude oil is crude oil with a relative density greater than 10 degrees api gravity and less than or equal to 22 3 degrees api gravity with respect to finding and development costs the aggregate of the exploration and development costs incurred in the most recent financial year and the change during that year in estimated future development costs generally will not reflect total finding and development costs related to reserve additions for that year references to initial production test rates are useful in confirming the presence of hydrocarbons however such rates are not determinative of the rates at which such wells will commence production and decline thereafter and are not indicative of long term performance or ultimate recovery while encouraging readers are cautioned not to place reliance on such rates in calculating the aggregate production for parex parex cautions that short term production rates should be considered preliminary this press release contains several oil and gas metrics including f d costs fd a costs recycle ratio reserve replacement nav and rli these oil and gas metrics have been prepared by management and do not have standardized meanings or standard methods of calculation and therefore such measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies and should not be used to make comparisons such metrics have been included herein to provide readers with additional measures to evaluate the company s performance however such measures are not reliable indicators of the future performance of the company and future performance may not compare to the performance in previous periods and therefore such metric should not be unduly relied upon management uses these oil and gas metrics for its own performance measurements and to provide security holders with measures to compare the company s operations over time readers are cautioned that the information provided by these metrics or that can be derived from the metrics presented in this news release should not be relied upon for investment or other purposes a summary of the calculations of such metrics are as follows finding and development f d costs are calculated by dividing capital expenditures by the change in reserves within the applicable reserves category f d costs including fdc include all capital expenditures in the year as well as the change in fdc required to bring the reserves within the specified reserves category on production finding development and acquisition fd a costs represent the costs of property acquisition exploration and development incurred the aggregate of the exploration and development costs incurred in the most recent financial year and the change during that year in estimated future development costs generally will not reflect total finding and development costs related to reserves additions for that year fd a costs are calculated as capital expenditures plus net acquisition costs plus change in fdc fd a per boe is calculated as fd a costs divided by reserves additions for the applicable period recycle ratio is calculated as funds flow from operations netback divided by f d or fd a as applicable funds flow from operations is a non gaap measure that includes all cash generated from operating activities and is calculated before changes in non cash working capital funds flow from operations netback or funds flow from operations per boe is calculated by dividing funds flow from operations by sales volumes for the period reserve replacement is calculated by dividing the annual reserve additions by the annual production net asset value nav per share is calculated as before or after tax npv10 plus estimated year end working capital converted from usd to cad as applicable divided by basic shares outstanding at december 31 2019 reserves life index is calculated by dividing the applicable reserves category by the annualized fourth quarter production unaudited financial

lenin was certainly right there is no subtler no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency the process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose john maynard keynes the economic consequences of peace 1920 and when we see that we ve reached that level we ll begin to gradually reduce our asset purchases to the level of the underlying trend growth of demand for our liabilities jerome powell january 29 2020 reality wealth is largely a function of the wages we earn the wages we earn are predominately a function of the growth rate of the economy what is inflation one of the most pernicious of these issues in our modern and sophisticated intellectual age is that of inflation most people when asked to define inflation would say rising prices with no appreciation for the fact that price movements are an effect not a cause they are a symptom of monetary circumstances inflation defined is in fact a disequilibrium between the amount of currency entering an economic system relative to the productive output of that same system and when we see that we ve reached that level we ll begin to gradually reduce our asset purchases to the level of the underlying trend growth of demand for our liabilities when hedge funds demand billions to leverage their trading activity when apple which has over 200 billion in cash borrows money to buy back their stock when you borrow money to buy a car the size of the economy increases but not permanently as you are not likely to buy another car tomorrow and the next day data courtesy st louis federal reserve the wealth scheme this scheme works like all schemes by keeping the majority of people blind to what is truly occurring to perpetuate such a scheme the public must be convinced that inflation is low and their wealth is increasing since then inflation measures have been tortured mangled and abused to the point where it scarcely equates to the inflation that consumers deal with in reality for example home prices were substituted for homeowners equivalent rent which was falling at the time and lowered inflationary pressures despite rising house prices since 1998 homeowners equivalent rent has risen 72 while house prices as measured by the shiller u s national home price index has almost doubled the rate at 136 needless to say house prices which currently comprise almost 25 of cpi have been grossly under accounted for in fact since 1998 cpi has been under reported by 40 a year on average considering that official cpi has run at a 2 20 annual rate since 1998 40 is a big misrepresentation especially for just one line item data courtesy st louis federal reserve data st louis federal reserve summary with that one seemingly innocuous statement chairman powell revealed an alarming admission about the supply of money and your wealth the current state of monetary policy explains why so many people are falling behind and why wealth inequality is at levels last seen almost 100 years ago real is a very important concept in the field of economics real generally refers to an amount of something adjusted for the effects of inflation real is equally important for the rest of us the size of our paycheck or bank account balance is meaningless without an understanding of what money can buy for instance an annual income of 25 000 in 1920 was about eight times the national average as your grandfather used to say a dollar doesn t go as far as it used to real wealth and real wage growth are important for assessing your economic standing and that of the nation here are two facts it makes perfect sense now let us consider inflation and the role it plays in determining our real wages and real wealth if the rate of inflation is less than the rate of wage growth over time then our real wages are rising and our wealth is increasing conversely if inflation rises at a pace faster than wages wealth declines despite a larger paycheck and more money in the bank with that understanding of real let s discuss inflation borrowing from an upcoming article we describe inflation in the following way the price of cars cheeseburgers movie tickets and all the other goods and services we consume are chiefly based on supply and demand demand is a function of both our need and desire to own a good and equally importantly how much money we have the amount of money we have in aggregate known as money supply is governed by the federal reserve with the linkage between the supply of money and inflation defined let us revisit powell s recent revelation to clarify one of the fed s largest liabilities currently are bank reserves banks are required to hold reserves for every loan they make therefore they need reserves to create money to lend ergo demand for our liabilities as powell states actually means bank demand for the seed funding to create money and make loans the relationship between money supply and the demand for money may in fact be aligned with economic growth if so then the supply of money should rise with the economy this occurs when debt is predominately employed to facilitate productive investments the problem occurs when money is demanded for consumption or speculation for example now ask should the supply of money increase because of those instances while there is no way to quantify how debt is used we do know that speculative and consumptive debt has risen sharply and takes up a much larger percentage of all debt than in prior eras if most of the debt were used productively then the level of debt would drop relative to gdp in other words the debt would not only produce more economic growth but would also pay for itself the exact opposite is occurring as growth languishes despite record levels of debt accumulation the speculative markets provide further evidence without presenting the long list of asset valuations that stand at or near record levels consider that since the last time the s p 500 was fairly valued in 2009 it has grown 375 meanwhile total u s treasury debt outstanding is up by 105 from 11 trillion to 22 5 trillion and corporate debt is up 55 from 6 5 trillion to 10 1 trillion over that same period nominal gdp has only grown 46 and average hourly earnings by 29 if this is the case why is the stated rate of inflation less than economic growth and wage growth in 2000 a brand new ford taurus se sedan had an original msrp of 18 935 the 2019 ford taurus se has a starting price of 27 800 over the last 19 years the base price of the ford taurus has risen by 2 05 a year or a total of 47 according to the bureau of labor statics bls since the year 2000 the consumer price index for new vehicles has only risen by 0 08 a year and a total of 1 68 over the same period for another instance of how inflation is grossly underreported we highlighted flaws in the reporting of housing prices in mmt sounds great in theory but to wit those two obscene examples highlight that the government reported inflation is not the same inflation experienced by consumers it is important to note that we are not breaking new ground with the assertion that the government reporting of inflation is low as we have previously discussed numerous private assessments quantify that the real inflation rate could easily be well above the average reported 2 rate for example shadow stats quantifies thatwhen one uses the official bls formula from 1980 despite what we may sense and a multitude of private studies confirming that inflation is running greater than 2 there are a multitude of other government sponsored studies that argue inflation is actually over stated so the battle is in the trenches and the devil is in the details as defined earlier inflation is a disequilibrium between the amount of currency entering an economic system relative to the productive output of that same system the following graph shows that the supply of money measured by m2 has grown far more than the rate of economic growth gdp over the last 20 years since 2000 m2 has grown 234 while gdp has grown at half of that rate 117 over the same period the cpi price index has only grown by 53 m2 implies an annualized inflation rate over the last 20 years of 6 22 which is three times that of cpi dampening perceived inflation is only part of the cover up the scheme is also perpetuated with other help from the government the government borrows to boost temporary economic growth and help citizens on the margin this further limits people s ability to detect a significant decline in their standard of living as shown below when one strips out the change in government debt the actual increase in u s treasury debt outstanding from the change in gdp growth it doesn t take an economist to know that a 6 22 inflation rate based on m2 and decade long recession would force changes to our monetary policy and send those responsible to the guillotines if someone suffering severe headaches is diagnosed with a brain tumor the problem does not go away because the doctor uses white out to cover up the tumor on the x ray film those engaging in speculative ventures with the benefit of cheap borrowing costs are thriving those whose livelihood and wealth are dependent on a paycheck are falling behind for this large percentage of the population their paychecks may be growing in line with the stated government inflation rate but not the true inflation rate they pay at the counter they fall further behind day by day as shown below while this may be hard to prove using government inflation data it is the reality if you think otherwise you may want to ask why a political outsider like donald trump won the election four years ago and why socialism and populism are surging in popularity we doubt that it is because everyone thinks their wealth is increasing to quote bill clinton s 1992 campaign manager james carville it s the economy stupid that brings us back to jerome powell and the fed the u s economy is driven by millions of individuals making decisions in their own best interests prices are best determined by those millions of people based on supply and demand that includes the price of money or interest rates if monetary policy is to be set by a small number of people in a conference room in the eccles building in washington d c who think they know what is best for us based on flawed data then they should prepare themselves for even more radical social and political movements than we have already seen

welcome to our fourth quarter call with me today are kevin o shea sean breslin and matt birenbaum sean kevin and i will provide some comments on the slides that we posted last night and then all of us will be available for q a afterwards our comments will focus on providing a summary of q4 and the full year results and a discussion of our outlook for 2020 starting on slide four highlights for the quarter and the year include core ffo growth of 5 2 in q4 and 3 8 for the full year same store revenue growth came in at 2 5 for the quarter and 2 8 when you include redevelopment full year same store revenue growth came in at 2 9 or 3 1 including redevelopment we completed 335 million of new development in q4 and 665 million for the year at a 6 5 yield and started just under 800 million last year and lastly we raised 1 3 billion in external capital for the year in a mix of asset sales new debt net of redemptions and common equity at an average initial cost of 4 3 the next few slides will provide a little more detail 2019 performance and provide context for our 2020 outlook journey first to slide five during the year we saw the east coast surpassed the west coast and rent growth for the first time in eight years and q4 the east outpaced the west by over 100 basis points led by boston in the dc metro area while we experienced some softening conditions in california turning out a slide six development continues to be a big contributor to nav growth in 2019 development completions of 665 million created approximately 300 million in incremental value and a 30 margins margins remains very healthy 10 years into the expansion moving now to slides seven and eight we made good progress in southeast florida and denver over the last year our expansion markets to date we ve committed roughly 600 million to each market through a combination of acquisitions development and partnering with local developers these portfolios are comprised of new assets and as you can see from the maps on slides seven and eight are spread across a broad geography within the markets turning now to slide nine we believe to be a great company we need to take a multi stakeholder approach to our business we can only deliver strong financial results over a sustained period of time by having engaged associates satisfied customers and the support of local communities by taking an active leadership role in addressing important environmental and social challenges and while we always strive to be better we ve been recognized for doing a good job in many of these areas over the past year starting with our associates as engagement scores were in the top decile and we were named the glass doors list of top 100 best places to work for the second consecutive year in 2019 with our customers as we ranked number one nationally among apartment reads bottom line reputation for the fourth consecutive year and then lastly with our communities where our efforts on the esg pride have been recognized by several organizations including glaspie to recognize the avb as the us and global leader in the residential sector by the carbon disclosure project or cdp international organization that creates companies on the carbon emission disclosure practices across all industries and he recently awarded to add agree that a minus one to four reads and the only apartment company three just received such a gread by the science based targets initiative reviewed and approved add submittal for targeted reduction in carbon emissions by 2030 we are one of 11 real estate companies globally and one of five reits that have completed this process and lastly by cr magazine who ranked avb in the top 100 corporate citizens globally for the second consecutive year out of a universe of over 1 000 companies turning now to slide 10 now that the calendar has turned to 2020 we thought it made sense to look back on our performance over the last decade in short it s been a great decade and cycle for the apartment sector and for avalonbay buoyed by strong demand fundamentals and attractive capital market conditions we have seen healthy growth in earnings and nav since 2010 for avb core ffo growth has averaged 10 on a compounded annual basis since 2010 or about 200 basis points above the sector the absolute level of growth has been fueled by both strong internal growth and same store revenue growth has averaged over 4 and as can be seen on slide 11 by strong external growth mainly from contributions to new development as we consistently delivered new development at initial yields well above the marginal cost of capital and roughly 200 basis points above prevailing cap rates as you can see on the right hand side of the slide development deliveries since 2010 of just over 8 billion have generated more than 3 billion in initial value creation or roughly 26 per share turning now to our outlook for 2020 on slide 12 we re projecting core ffo growth of just over 5 this year mainly from a combination of same store noi growth of 3 and from stabilized new development which is expected to generate more than 60 million in noi in 2020 turning to slide 13 and double clicking on this a bit the stabilized portfolio is expected to contribute roughly 3 5 of total core ffo growth in 2020 external growth or noi from new investment net of capital costs is expected to contribute 2 7 and overhead growth and loss of jv and funds income will actually provide a drag of about 110 basis points to growth with about 1 3 of that 110 basis points coming from a loss of jv and fund fee income about 1 3 from normal overhead growth in our base business and the remaining 1 3 coming from expense overhead that represents investment in innovation or other overhead that is projected to generate future roi some of which we will benefit from in 2020 at 5 1 the level of core ffo growth is expected to be 130 bps higher than 2019 the biggest driver for this is stronger external growth of roughly 200 basis points on a net basis driven by higher levels of deliveries in late 2019 and 2020 as well as a lower cost of capital raised last year this is offset in part by the headwind from the loss of jv and fund income as we wind these vehicles down turning to slide 14 this slide provides a summary of the key economic factors driving much of our outlook i won t go through everything here but simply say while the gdp and job growth is expected to moderate from 2019 the strength of the consumer should provide a tailwind with tight labor markets rising wages healthy balance sheet bolstering confidence healthy consumption and household formation the business sector is expected to provide more crosswinds in 2020 versus 2019 as sluggish business investment should be offset in part by less concern surrounding a potential trade war and lastly the government sector should bolster the economy in 2020 as the lack of fiscal constraint and an accommodative fed should provide added support to economic growth so overall it s shaping up as a good macro backdrop to support the economy and the housing sector for the year ahead i ll now turn it over to sean who will provide more color on our outlook for the portfolio sean j breslin chief operating officer okay thanks tim turning to slide 15 this chart represents the actual 2019 and projected 2020 components of total personal income growth both for the u s and for our markets as tim noted the consensus forecast is for decelerating job growth throughout 2020 in part due to continued structural factors constraining growth in the labor force consumers however are feeling reasonably confident given the low 3 wage growth they experienced in 2019 and the outlook for even stronger wage growth in 2020 which supports healthy demand for our business turning to slide 16 new supply for our market footprint is projected to be consistent with what we experienced during 2019 with increases in urban boston northern new jersey los angeles and across the northern california markets being offset by reductions in the mid atlantic pacific northwest and in new york city turning to slide 17 turning to slide 17 we expect seamster revenue growth of 2 7 for 2020 on a quarterly basis revenue growth is projected to be strongest in the first quarter of the year due to a number of unique factors but should be relatively stable throughout the balance of the year on the east coast we expect a material improvement in performance in the boston the mid atlantic regions both supported by a decline in the pace of new deliveries in our sub markets results in metro new york and new jersey however will continue to be weighed down by the impact of the new york rent regulations adopted in mid 2019 shifting to the west coast we expect continued healthy performance in the pacific northwest job growth exceeded 3 in 2019 and consensus expectations reflected job growth rate that s roughly one and a half times the national average in 2020 relatively strong demand combined with a modest reduction in the pace of new deliveries should continue to produce greater than 3 revenue growth in the region turning to california we expect decelerating performance in both regions in northern california job growth is projected to decelerate from roughly 2 6 in 2019 to 1 in 2020 in addition new supply is projected to increase by roughly 800 units in san francisco and between 1 000 and 1 200 units in each of san jose and the east bay weighing on performance throughout the year in southern california job growth is projected to fall from 1 6 in 2019 to about 80 basis points in 2020 on the supply side while new deliveries are expected to be relatively flat year over year in orange county and san diego deliveries in l a are projected to increase by roughly 1 500 units as compared to 2019 and from a broader perspective we continue to expect a headwind from new york rent regulations that were adopted during mid 2019 and implementation of assembly bill 1482 in california the impact of these two rent regulations on our full year 2020 rental revenue growth rate is estimated to be between 15 and 20 basis points turning to slide 18 our outlook reflects sub 2 same store operating expense growth in 2020 with increases in various controllable and noncontrollable expense categories partially offset by a reduction in payroll costs the reduction in payroll expense is driven by our innovation efforts particularly those related to reimagining the leasing experience for our customers and associates as i mentioned last quarter elements of redesigned experience includes the use of an ai powered automated agent for lead management purposes and a more dynamic demand driven staffing model additional elements that are under way and projected to yield a benefit in 2020 include more self guided tours and an express move in process through year end 2019 we have reduced our on site sales and management staff by approximately 7 5 relative to our baseline staffing in 2018 and expect to stabilize at a roughly 10 to 12 reduction later this year of our total increase in same store operating expenses roughly 60 is related to growth in property taxes and insurance given the timing of tax appeals and supplemental assessments in various markets along with the timing of certain items in various expense categories we expect operating expense growth to be front weighted in 2020 as noted in the text box on slide 18 and with that summary of our markets and outlook for the portfolio i ll turn it over to kevin to talk about our development activity and the balance sheet kevin o shea chief financial officer thanks sean turning to slide 19 since the middle of the last decade when new development starts averaged 1 4 billion per year we ve reduced starts to about 800 million per year this shift was driven by both a reduced opportunity set for attractive development and by a desire to limit development activity to an amount we could fund on a leverage neutral basis without needing to access the equity market for 2020 we expect to start about 900 million in new development on projects that we expect will not only improve the quality of our portfolio but also generate compelling value creation in line with recent completions turning to slide 20 as sean has just outlined we continue to innovate across our operating platform investing in initiatives that will allow us to better serve our customer while generating higher returns for our shareholders for 2020 our investment in these initiatives is expected to account for roughly half the increase in expense overhead costs adjusted for noncore items turning the slide 21 we show our 4 2 billion pipeline future development opportunities which are controlled at a very modest cost and offer a lot of flexibility as it relates to the timing of the start of construction out but half of our development rights or conventional conditional agreements or options to purchase land with private third party land sellers the remaining half is split between asset densification opportunities where we are pursuing additional density of existing stabilize assets and public private partnerships which are generally long term development efforts that span a number of years these types of projects allow more flexibility to align the started construction with favorable market conditions in addition it s worth noting that in creating this pipeline we ve been careful to limit our financial exposure so that we enjoy an attractive set of development opportunities at a modest upfront costs at the end of the fourth quarter land held for development was 0 an all time low and pursuit costs represented an additional 70 million this allows us to control over 4 billion of future development across our markets for an upfront investment of less than 2 of projected total capital costs turning to slide 22 as we ve discussed before another way in which we mitigate risk from development is by substantially match funding development under way with long term capital this allows us to lock in development profit and reduce development exposure to future changes in capital costs as you can see on this slide we were approximately 85 match funded against development under way at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019 on slide 23 we show several of our key credit metrics and compare these to the multifamily reit sector average as you can see our credit metrics remain strong in both absolute and relative terms reflecting our superior financial flexibility specifically at year end net debt to core ebitda was low at 4 6x unencumbered noi was high at 93 and the weighted average years to maturity of our debt total debt outstanding remained high at about nine years and with that i ll turn it back to tim timothy j naughton chairman chief executive officer and president all right great thanks kevin so in summary just on slide 24 2019 played out more or less as expected a good year for the apartment sector we delivered 3 plus noi growth we completed 665 million of accretive development and we made good progress in growing our presence in our expansion markets in 2020 we expect the economy and apartment market to remain healthy for avb we re expecting same store noi growth of 3 external growth will be stronger than what we experienced in 2019 due to higher levels of deliveries and lower capital costs and lastly we plan to continue to operate the business as kevin mentioned in a risk measured way with respect to capital formation and deployment recognizing that we are 10 years into the current expansion and with that nadia we ll open up the call for questions questions and answers operator we ll first go to nick joseph from citi please go ahead nick joseph citi analyst thanks sean you talked about the innovation efforts what do you estimate the total opportunity to be in terms of either noi or margin and then how much will you realize in 2020 versus future years sean j breslin chief operating officer yes nick good question what i d probably point you back to and happy to talk about it further is the comments we provided last quarter we went through several slides and we talked about roughly a 50 basis point improvement in margins for each of two primary activities one sort of on the what we call sort of the leasing journeys leasing and move in process combined and then on the maintenance side of the house about another 50 basis points related to efficiency opportunities in that bucket as well in terms of what we are going to see in 2020 i would describe it this way we started this back in late 2018 as we move through 2020 sort of our run rate by the end of 2020 which is associated with the leasing side of this which is really what s paying off in 2020 we ll be somewhere in the range of 7 million to 8 million and then we ll be bleeding in the maintenance activities later this year so you really won t see as much of that benefit until subsequent years and there are additional components to the leasing side that will also bleed in in subsequent years so you ll see more as it moves into 21 22 but as it relates to 20 sort of the aggregate impact that s flowing through represents two years of activity and roughly a 7 million to 8 million benefit nick joseph citi analyst that s helpful and then just on same store revenue growth in 2019 you had 20 basis points benefit from redevelopment and then i know a lot of your peers include that in their same store guidance so for 2020 what do you expect that benefit to be from redevelopment activity sean j breslin chief operating officer yes on rental revenue we expect it to be about 15 basis points and on noi about 20 nick joseph citi analyst right thank you sean j breslin chief operating officer yep operator we ll next go with rich hightower from evercore please go ahead rich hightower evercore analyst good afternoon guys i m just looking at the market by market chart for same store revenue and just as you look at new york what would it take to get to the high end of the range this year that sort of 3 number given what we what you re baking in with respect to the rent regs and maybe as an add on to that you can maybe talk about what the new broker fee rules mean if anything for your portfolio or just the landscape in new york sean j breslin chief operating officer yes rich it s sean i mean the fundamental issue is just better overall rent change as we move through the year if you look at what we re anticipating in the sort of metro new york new jersey region in 2020 versus 2019 is like term lease rent change coming down around 40 50 basis points so depending on what happens with various market conditions and particularly the suburban markets for us is what s going to move the needle so depending on how things manifest themselves with job growth if things are stronger we might see a benefit there but we re trying to reflect what the macro assumptions are for the economic environment there the constraints imposed by the loss of fees that will continue to bleed through those are the fees are known but really it s on the demand side and pushing more rental rate through the suburban portfolio for the most part that would push those numbers up rich hightower evercore analyst okay and any insight on the new broker fee rules sean j breslin chief operating officer yes and then on the broker fees that s sorry that s really not material for us our portfolio there we really haven t paid brokers in quite some time we have a handful of the jv assets that have paid a few but we have paid those fees as opposed to pushing them back on to the residents so from what you see from a total reporting standpoint it s immaterial there s basically no difference for us rich hightower evercore analyst okay yes that s what i thought just wanted to confirm that and then maybe with respect to capital sources guidance for the year and maybe a question for kevin just i guess outside of condo sales which are which you do disclose can you just break down that bucket the 1 4 billion between asset sales and sort of other capital markets whether other equity or debt just help us understand kind of where the most favorable cost of capital is from that perspective right now or how you guys think about it kevin o shea chief financial officer sure rich it s kevin so just a few things as you saw from the release we anticipate sourcing external capital of about 1 4 billion in 2020 and i guess the first thing to point out is we expect to do so on a roughly leverage neutral basis relative to net debt to ebitda where we are at 4 6 turns at the end of 2019 so roughly flat to that in terms of how we bring in the mix of capital as you know there s three markets we intend to look at unsecured debt markets the asset sale market and the equity markets here we do have condo sales happening that are in the mix our capital plan for 1 4 billion we don t typically break it down in detail but when you model it out just bear in mind we tend to be leverage neutral and we do not have equity in the plan it s a combination of debt mostly unsecured debt wholly owned dispositions and condo sales which you can see from our earnings release we expect about 240 million in condo sales over this year rich hightower evercore analyst got it thank you operator we ll next go with richard hill from morgan stanley please go ahead lauren weston morgan stanley analyst hi guys this is lauren weston on for richard hill appreciate your comments on expense guidance if you could just help us understand this is the lowest guidance we ve seen in recent history so i just want to get a sense if this is the new run rate or really particular to 2020 obviously the focus is on payrolls coming down sequentially but can you just give us some more color on sort of what we should expect going forward beyond 2020 sean j breslin chief operating officer this is sean providing expense guidance well beyond 2020 is speculative at best but i mean what i would say is that the big categories to really think about without giving you sort of precise answers in terms of what to think about for 2021 and beyond is our property taxes are more than 1 3 of our expense structure and if you look at that i think values are growing at a pace that s a little bit above inflation but you don t have the same kind of acceleration based on the significant run up in values that we ve seen in this cycle so you should start to see that level off for us and then in addition we don t have really a large portfolio of 421 a assets or other pilot assets that are bleeding in at a very high rate so that will help contain the overall expense growth in property taxes the other big piece is payroll you kind of know what s happening with wage growth in payroll which is sort of in the low to mid 3 range but our job is to try to innovate as best we can to contain that minus 1 5 is not a sustainable run rate as you put things through but we would expect to continue at something below inflationary levels for wage growth based on the innovation that we expect over the next few years and then the other one s really kind of the other like r m and some of those things really sort of grow at inflationary levels for the most part so those are kind of the big pieces and the way i d think about each one lauren weston morgan stanley analyst okay that s helpful and then a follow up if i can just in the pacific northwest a little bit of a spike there i saw a footnote in the supplement but any other color you can add on the appeal process there and the success there sean j breslin chief operating officer yes that change in expenses in pacific northwest was driven by successful appeals actually in the fourth quarter and the prior period as you may know early last year i think all of us benefited from a reduction in rates throughout the various counties within which we operate across greater seattle pacific northwest region but we also had the benefit of appeals that were realized in the fourth quarter of 2018 which put upward pressure on the growth rate in q4 of 19 lauren weston morgan stanley analyst thanks sean j breslin chief operating officer thank you operator we ll next go with alua askarbek from bank of america please go ahead alua askarbek bank of america analyst hi guys thank you for taking the call so just a little bit about seattle further it appears that seattle s continued to weaken can we get any extra color there in terms of the supply impact and when you expect the bulk of it to pass with supply coming down next year sean j breslin chief operating officer yes as it relates to seattle some commentary just on our performance there in the fourth quarter a bit of sort of unusual onetime things coming through that depressed our growth rate in the quarter down to 2 2 our actual base rental revenue growth rate we kind of just think about the residential component was 3 1 but as a result of a number of sort of onetime things in the other rental revenue category we lost about 90 basis points and that relates to payments we received for revenue share in prior years the prior year excuse me as well as a onetime thing in terms of cancellation fees that didn t come through in december and came through in january i would say that our overall performance in the pacific northwest is quite healthy it s probably the strongest in the portfolio right now in terms of rent change january rent change across seattle was almost 5 and revenue growth in january is popping back up and should be in about the mid 3 mid 3 5 range or so so i wouldn t extrapolate from the fourth quarter performance into 2020 we still expect it to be a very healthy market this year alua askarbek bank of america analyst got it and then just a little bit on the supply what are you thinking about it for the rest of the year and when do you think most of the supply will peak or pass sean j breslin chief operating officer in terms of seattle specifically alua askarbek bank of america analyst yes sean j breslin chief operating officer seattle specifically we re expecting it to come down in 2020 the pace of deliveries on a quarter by quarter basis is pretty evenly spread it s 1 800 to 2 000 units a quarter or so there s a little bit more in q1 but for the most part it s not materially different in terms of the pace of deliveries throughout the year alua askarbek bank of america analyst okay great thank you operator we ll next go with john kim from bmo capital markets please go ahead john kim bmo capital markets analyst can you comment on what you re seeing as far as development yields in southeast florida and denver versus your legacy markets matthew h birenbaum chief investment officer sure john this is matt i can comment on that a little bit it s the first thing i d say it s a little bit of an apple and an orange because we have not obviously been in those markets for the same length of time and the same kind of depth of experience so we do expect going in that for us anyway the yields will be a little bit lower at first and that hopefully over time as we establish our position there we ll be able to post even stronger returns so in florida we are we re really partnering with other developers there so the yield to us is thinner because we are not taking the construction risk or the entitlement risk we re really just taking the lease up risk on those deals so we re looking at kind of low five yields for us on those types of deals where there s a sponsor who s taking a significant amount of the value spread if you will in denver we just started the deal last quarter in rino that is our first ground up development in denver and that is not with a partner that was a bi rite deal in the city of denver so a pretty predictable process in terms of getting our permits and that s kind of the high five yields and i think that s probably what we re seeing right now there just given it is a market that s seeing a lot of hard cost pressure so i would imagine over time that both of those markets we d be in the high 5s that maybe even low 6s in certain cases but probably more likely kind of mid to high 5s john kim bmo capital markets analyst and when do you think you d get into enough critical mass to bring management in house in those markets matthew h birenbaum chief investment officer denver we actually have brought management in house we brought management in house late last year and we do think that over time that will be an advantage for us and florida we re kind of looking at that now so i think that s in the plan for later this year john kim bmo capital markets analyst okay and then and just to follow up on the new york announcement banning broker fees i realize maybe not a direct impact to you but i m wondering if you what you think about how this impacts the market and if you subscribe to the view that this will lead to higher rents in new york sean j breslin chief operating officer yes this is sean john hard to say it s really just kind of the cost has been there i think it s the question is how does it affect sort of landlord behavior and whether they continue to encourage brokers in the same way or not there are a lot of people that do and there are a lot of people that don t so i think it s kind of behavioral at this point in terms of how it s going to impact things i mean the demand is the fundamental demand to find a unit to occupy the question is who s paying the transaction costs or if there is one so it s hard too hard to tell in terms of where that s going to come out john kim bmo capital markets analyst what about market share is there a chance that you are better positioned than some of your peers sean j breslin chief operating officer i don t know about that i think certainly the us and our other reit peers in terms of the sophisticated systems we have around digital marketing and penetration efforts there and other sources of demand are probably more well positioned in the short run in the long run the market will correct to reflect the dynamics of the regulatory environment so in the long run it may be at par but i d say those with more scale that can push through more digital marketing efforts on average the margin price should benefit some yes john kim bmo capital markets analyst thank you operator we ll next go with john guinee from stifel please go ahead john guinee stifel analyst great very nice guidance guys gentlemen thank you hey i was looking at the recent cbre stats and i think those guides are pretty good and over the last four years you ve seen completions average about 67 000 a quarter and over the last two years you ve seen starts about 100 000 or more a quarter it just seems with those kind of basic numbers it s only a matter of time before deliveries bounced up over 100 a quarter does that make sense to you guys and if you guys factored that into your medium term thinking timothy j naughton chairman chief executive officer and president it s tim here in terms of our markets starts have actually been pretty flat nationally that s i mean our numbers i think closer to have been running more in the mid 3s and are starting to inch up to 400 if not just a little bit more than that so i your numbers don t sync up quite the same as at least the numbers we use to track national starts but in our markets i think it s been running in the so it s 80 000 or something like that and it s been pretty flat over the last few years last three years john guinee stifel analyst great thank you operator we ll next go with nick yulico from scotiabank please go ahead nick yulico scotiabank analyst thanks in terms of the development starts so just hoping to get a feeling for the yield you expect on the new starts this year and also maybe a preview on the type of product and markets that you re focused on matthew h birenbaum chief investment officer sure nick it s matt our starts basket for this year obviously it can change a little bit based on kind of how the year shakes out but it s probably a low to mid 6s yield kind of somewhere in that 6 3 6 4 6 5 range and that s really driven a lot by the mix of business there s one or two deals in long island that we will hope to start this year one or two deals in northern new jersey both of those are markets that tend to be higher yield higher development yield margin we do have a big deal in l a in downtown the arts district we re looking to start and then probably one deal each in denver and florida so it s a nice mix but on average more in some of those higher yield markets nick yulico scotiabank analyst okay that s helpful and then i just had a question about the condo sales the gross proceeds this year of 230 million to 250 million can you give us a feel for what percentage of the project that is is it 40 to 50 just trying to feel get a feel for how much proceeds are still left to come back as capital after this year matthew h birenbaum chief investment officer sure this is matt again i can speak to that so just where we stand as of right now today we have three units that have actually closed that closed in january that represented about 10 million in gross proceeds we have 51 additional executed contracts with deposits up that represent about another 150 million and of those 51 actually we expect 43 to close before the end of q1 in february and march so most of those proceeds should come in in the next couple of months and then we actually have seven additional offers which we ve accepted but they re not yet in contract so a good amount of that is spoken for but in terms of what s actually in contract or closed it would be those 54 and 160 million now that is not a pro rata share of the building based on which units happen to be selling and settling first so you can t just take that as a percentage of the unit count what s left to sell is probably a little more than that pro rata because there s some high value units at the top of the building that are not in that number but it gives you a good sense of where we are nick yulico scotiabank analyst okay yes i guess i was just wondering i think in the past you guys have said somewhere around 3 million a unit so that would get to right around say 500 million of total gross proceeds from the condos which means you get half of that this year and half of that in 2021 is that the right way to think about it matthew h birenbaum chief investment officer yes i mean we ll see where the market we ll see where the market goes from here sales pace could be better or faster or slower but like i said we know that we have a fair amount of that already kind of spoken for nick yulico scotiabank analyst okay thanks operator we ll next go with drew babin from baird please go ahead alex baird analyst good afternoon this is alex on for drew we were hoping if you guys could provide color on january leasing terms in northern california and maybe if you guys could just speak to kind of the dynamics you re seeing and i know you referenced kind of a pretty significant deceleration in employment growth and it looked like there was another significant deceleration in the like term effective rent in the second half of 19 so just any color on that market and kind of what you saw in january would be helpful sean j breslin chief operating officer yes alex this is sean a couple of things i d say one is northern california overall we expect more supply to come in this year as i noted in my prepared remarks overall it s about a 25 increase across the three markets in terms of deliveries and there s definitely some of that coming into play in the first quarter so one of the things that we did just given what we re seeing in san francisco and how we think about a couple of other markets is we did try to build occupancy a little bit more than we might otherwise have done in the fourth quarter particularly late in the fourth quarter and you see that reflected in the rent change that we reported on last night so northern california was weak it that carried over into january where blended rent change was about 60 basis points or so it is the lowest of the regions in terms of rent change for january and when you look at it in terms of kind of where rents are today asking rents relative to last year they re up about 1 5 which is one of the lowest of the regions at this point in time so it s a little choppy right now with some new deliveries coming in and our expectations for continued deceleration in employment growth we ll see how it plays out throughout the balance of the year in terms of overall performance but we are expecting about an 80 basis point reduction in like term rent change across the region relative to what we actually produced in 2019 alex baird analyst that s really helpful and then one more question for me can you speak to the alderwood mall development is there a retailer kind of mixed use component is your partner related to the mall at all just kind of curious what went into the underwriting there and if there s more opportunity kind of paired with a retail component or kind of next door matthew h birenbaum chief investment officer sure this is matt absolutely well so that deal is a joint venture with brookfield retail partners the former ggp who own the mall it s actually the site of the former sears box and it is part of the densification play at that mall there will be retail on the ground for the building that we will not own that brookfield will own so we don t necessarily have any exposure to the retail but we do think that this is a growing line of business for us we re pretty excited about it and a model that we hope to replicate in a number of other locations this would be the first it s planned to be a long term joint venture where we will own the asset together going forward and we will earn some fees associated with that we did we actually did also start one of our other starts this quarter was woburn in suburban boston that s one of these lifestyle center not a regional mall deals which is a partnership with edens it s actually the second deal we ve done with edens the first was mosaic here in northern virginia which is eight or nine years old now seven years old and we actually have a third deal hopefully to be coming in the next couple of years as well in central new jersey so we do see this as a trend that s growing it s frankly been a little more difficult to get at it than maybe we had originally thought particularly on the mall sites where all of these sites are encumbered with cross easements and there s a lot of parties at the table including sometimes multiple anchors at the mall that have some say in this so but we are making good progress we have other deals in the pipeline that hopefully will be similar and we do think it s something that plays to our strengths as a competitive advantage for us because they re typically not broadly marketed land sites it s important to the seller who s our partner that the quality of the execution and the certainty of the execution the balance sheet all the other things we bring to the table matter just as much as just the raw land value alex baird analyst that s really helpful thanks for taking the questions operator we ll next go with richard skidmore from goldman sachs please go ahead richard skidmore goldman sachs analyst good afternoon just a question on future development slide 19 as you look at that slide over the next two to three years do you stay in that kind of range do you and what might change your view to either go up or down timothy j naughton chairman chief executive officer and president yes tim here of the 4 billion we think that could support about 1 billion a year roughly in starts so plus or minus a couple hundred million as kevin mentioned in his remarks we have been more in the 800 million range recently expect to start around 900 million this year the reality is you can t bring that up too quickly just because of the gestation periods on these deals it s often two or three years so it would take for us to really materially increase starts three years from now we d have to be starting today in effect and the reality is just the other than maybe the mixed use opportunity that matt mentioned the opportunity set isn t as compelling 10 years into the cycle as it was five or six years ago richard skidmore goldman sachs analyst got it and then just to follow up in terms of the future development rights looks like about 50 of the future development rights are in the metro new york new jersey area how maybe talk a little bit about how you re thinking about new york new jersey given the regulations and other things and is that how we should think about the focus as you go forward that you ll be focused a bit more on new york new jersey matthew h birenbaum chief investment officer no not necessarily richard this is matt if you look at where our starts have actually been the last couple of years i think that is probably more representative of what s likely to be the start mix over the next couple of years where metro new york has been i don t think we started anything in metro new york last year it was 20 of our starts in 18 and it s as much as 40 of our starts this year but if you average that over three years then it s maybe 20 25 of our start volume it is a disproportionate share of our development rights pipeline some of that is because some of those deals are long gestating entitlement plays where not all of them may make it through and we don t necessarily have to invest a whole lot to see if they re going to make it through in some markets in new jersey or long island for example and then there s a couple of very large deals there that may or may not come to fruition in this particular cycle that we ve talked about on some prior calls so there s a couple of very large high rise deals in there that we think really do kind of move that needle in a rough sense they re past that 2 billion if you will which is new york richard skidmore goldman sachs analyst thank you operator we ll next go with derek johnston from deutsche bank please go ahead derek johnston deutsche bank analyst to begin we see the boston metro area has experienced some solid rental and revenue growth this year and supply is expected to actually taper in 2020 yet some metrics are pointing toward decelerating rent growth as well i wanted to see how your team views avb s submarket exposure there sean j breslin chief operating officer yes derek we didn t hear the first part of the question would you mind restating the question clearly please timothy j naughton chairman chief executive officer and president you re coming through very faintly derek johnston deutsche bank analyst oh sorry i m looking at the boston metro area we see there is some solid rental and revenue growth and supply is supposed to taper in 2020 and some of the metrics are actually pointing toward decelerating rent growth i was kind of seeing what your team views avb s submarket exposure there sean j breslin chief operating officer yes no got it yes so as i mentioned in my prepared remarks we are expecting deliveries to increase in the urban boston if you look at sort of back bay downtown and sort of adjoining submarkets i think it s an additional 1 200 1 300 units coming into that submarket but if you look at the suburban submarkets overall supply is relatively stable so our portfolio which is primarily suburban we think will continue to benefit and that s why we see some acceleration of rental revenue growth in 2020 as compared to what we produced in 2019 derek johnston deutsche bank analyst awesome and then looking over at expense forecast for the noncontrollable items the full year setup really looks quite similar to 2019 but are there any notable upcoming tax items that we should look for this year sean j breslin chief operating officer notable i don t think there s anything notable per se in terms of the noncontrollable components that represents about 16 of our projected opex increase in 2020 and taxes we re expecting sub 3 growth there may be some benefits there because there were substantial increases in assessments and rates in new england in the fourth quarter that were not anticipated that obviously we had to book so we expect some appeals to work their way through the system and benefit us potentially in 2020 or 2021 so taxes as i mentioned a little bit earlier in response to a question we think are should be relatively stable in terms of the growth rate and the noise you re going to see from quarter to quarter year in year out is going to be more around the timing of supplemental assessments or appeals or things of that sort and so it s just too early to tell where that s going to come out this year derek johnston deutsche bank analyst got it thank you operator thank you we ll next go with john pawlowski from green street advisors please go ahead john pawlowski green street advisors analyst sean i was hoping you could elaborate more on your comments around the choppiness in san francisco as january unfolded and i know there s a lot of supply are you seeing anything on the ground that suggests demand is easing just any comments on concession trends as fourth quarter passed and we re into 2020 now how that s faring one way or the other sean j breslin chief operating officer thanks yes john i d say it s probably a little too early to tell i think ourselves and maybe a couple of others sort of anticipated what was coming online and took a slightly more defensive posture sort of late november december in particular and that bled into some move ins in january that impacted january rent change there are concessions in the market whether you want to call it just a reduction in rent or a concession there s some softness there not to target for ourselves if there s a big shift in demand we re not necessarily seeing that when we pull the marketing levers we get more demand the question is just how much we pull them so i think it s a little too early to tell if it s purely just supply versus demand but my sense is it s more supply i ll probably have a better sense by the time we get to the next quarter call john pawlowski green street advisors analyst okay understood and then i want to matt or tim wanted to head back to the suburban new york and new jersey comments and the market fundamentals right now are decelerating from already pretty restrained levels as the development pipeline just naturally increases your exposure to jersey and suburban new york are you seeing anything on the ground today that gets you a bit more enthused about the demand backdrop over the next three to five years in these markets are you going to let that exposure drift higher as the developments earn in or will there be some disposition activity to pare that development exposure matthew h birenbaum chief investment officer it s matt yes i don t know that our view on the kind of fundamentals about those markets has changed in particular what we have done and what we will continue to do is try and make sure that our portfolio is balanced and so that does sometimes lead to disposition activity there s certainly been if you look back over the last five six years a lot more of our disposition activity has been concentrated in the new york metro area and until we get the jv in late 18 all of that was in the suburbs so we haven t been selling anything in the city so a lot of that we just sold an asset in connecticut that closed in january we have an asset that we would probably sell here in central jersey that may close in the second quarter or late in the first quarter so that s the way we re thinking about it those investments that we ve been making have been among the best investments in our entire portfolio when you look at the total irr on those investments they tend to start out at a very high development yield and then some of usually they actually grow pretty well for the first couple of years as they kind of find their footing in the submarket it s not the most dynamic market among our footprint so obviously it doesn t necessarily have the same long term growth profile and so that s how we try and balance that out is through dispositions particularly some of the older assets there timothy j naughton chairman chief executive officer and president yes john and just maybe to add to that i agree with everything matt said with respect to the 2 2 billion of development rights in new york new jersey i think matt mentioned earlier actually a little over half of it is just two deals one of which is on is a densification play on our site and the other is a public private deal that is not likely to happen anytime soon just given it s sort of caught up in politics at the moment so it s really about it s closer to 1 billion in that in the metro new york new jersey when you kind of correct those 2 which is about 1 3 of kind of what remains which isn t kind of too far off our total allocation to the metro area and as matt mentioned as you ve seen the disposition focus has really been in the northeast as we recycle that back into development as well as acquisitions in other markets particularly the expansion market john pawlowski green street advisors analyst okay excellent operator thank you we ll next go with wes golladay from the royal bank of canada please go ahead steve the royal bank of canada analyst hi guys this is steve for wes just a quick question about cost of capital and insights of development for the next couple of years if we stay in a low yield environment you re looking at pretty low cost of capital going forward are you going to sort of look at your hurdle rates for your next years or years following the development pipeline and start taking i guess what would be lower compared to your historical hurdle rate matthew h birenbaum chief investment officer yes it s we have this is matt we actually do have a target return matrix that does vary with our cost of capital so there is kind of an automatic systematic adjustment in our system as our cost of capital goes up our target returns go up and vice versa and so actually if you look at it today our target returns on new investment are probably as low as they have been in certainly this entire cycle and that is a reflection of kind of what our cost of capital is today now having said that it s not a simple gosh now we ll take 50 basis points lower on the development yield or an acquisition we re also looking at total basis we re also looking at kind of what the risks associated with that are so it s not a simple formula but it does definitely bear on our thinking a bit and we ve seen that some when you look at some of the more recent stores steve the royal bank of canada analyst perfect that s all i got operator thank you we ll next go with rich anderson from smbc please go ahead rich anderson smbc analyst thanks good morning good afternoon excuse me so when i was looking back at this time last year in your guidance one item stuck out at me and that was your supply or you i d say your deliveries estimated for 2019 were 2 3 of stock and ended the year at 1 8 and that s your estimate for this coming year so it doesn t appear like the decline from 2 3 at this time last year to the actual that you re seeing today at 1 8 was a function of slippage so can you explain what the decline came from if there is anything meaningful there sean j breslin chief operating officer yes rich this is sean what i d say is we basically adjusted 2020 numbers to reflect our history in terms of the margin of error on delivery schedules so if you look at it sort of on a gross basis based on what people would say if this is what we plan to deliver and when we plan to deliver it we basically haircut it to reflect sort of a probability weighted estimate given our history so that s really what s factored into what you re seeing there in terms of the 1 8 to 1 8 it would have been probably closer to 2 rich anderson smbc analyst yes yes right and what happened to the 2 3 to 1 8 over the course of the year or do those projects just go turn off or what happened sean j breslin chief operating officer no they bleed into the subsequent period so they ll be bleeding into 2020 but that would have been reflected in the total anticipated deliveries in 2020 that there are other deliveries behind those deals that have now been pushed into a subsequent period timothy j naughton chairman chief executive officer and president this is tim i think this cycle has been more of a shortage of skilled labor than we ve seen in past cycles and we just haven t experienced this in the past these kind of delays i m not talking about avalon i m talking about the market in general and it s very common to hear projects being delayed once they start construction by six to 12 months by the time they finish it and it s just a it really is a labor issue so i think it s an issue for the country but it s certainly an issue for our industry rich anderson smbc analyst okay it s still i would think then the 1 8 would be a higher number that might trend down over the course of the year because of that slippage but i understand timothy j naughton chairman chief executive officer and president yes yes maybe the shortages are a little less acute today than they were a year ago as well rich anderson smbc analyst okay fair enough on the still on development for you guys over 60 million or so assumed development noi in 2020 that s a fairly equivalent number to what you produced in 2017 and 2018 you had a little bit of a hiccup downward in 2019 is this range 60 million ish sort of like what we should expect on a go forward basis for you with the 2019 maybe just being an aberration and the reason why i ask is because what you guys have historically done as a company is produced a certain level of same store growth but also a number at the ffo line that s much larger than that and part of that is a function of capital allocation but also amount of development that comes online so i m just trying to get a sense of the cadence going forward because i hate it when i see same store growth being at or greater than ffo growth timothy j naughton chairman chief executive officer and president yes rich tim here as kevin mentioned in his remarks we ve been talking about 800 million to 900 million a year recently at an average and we ve been stabilizing in the low 6 range so i think it s just math that probably gets you closer to 50 million low 50s going forward rather than 60 million 65 million which is where we were kind of toward mid cycle when we were starting north of 1 billion a year rich anderson smbc analyst okay last question for me this time again last year you predicted your same store number and you nailed it pretty much on the nose in terms of the actual result ffo the prediction the guidance actually was lighter than what you actually produced by about 80 or 100 basis points so when you think about the potential to do better over the course of this year do you think it comes from development or does it or can it still come from internal sources kevin o shea chief financial officer so rich this is kevin in terms of our guidance this time last year for core ffo we were at 9 30 and so we ended up at 9 34 so we beat by 0 04 we didn t come in 80 basis points below so unless there s something else you want to i mean a clarification but that s those are the facts on the core ffo rich anderson smbc analyst okay maybe i miss miss all that but i ll let it go thanks very much operator we ll next go with austin wurschmidt from keybanc capital markets please go ahead austin wurschmidt keybanc capital markets analyst good afternoon tim in your presentation you highlighted the above average compound annual growth in ffo that you ve generated versus peers this cycle but as you shrink the size of the development pipeline and to the extent that maybe same store depending on definition lagging peers at face today how do you generate above average ffo growth versus the sector in the coming years timothy j naughton chairman chief executive officer and president yes and a good question first of all the level of alpha was higher for the first five years of that decade than the last 5 and that i think speaks directly to the point where we have we ve had a little bit less external growth in the last couple of years last two or three years than we did in the prior years on the issue of same store i just would really caution you on that one there s a capex is really distorting numbers for the industry right now so you really have to look closely particularly at that revenue enhancing or noi enhancing capex that everyone is spending in a particular year i think when you sort of cut through it you re going to find that there s not a big outlier there particularly we re not a big outlier i can tell you that so i think and then when you look at sort of the market overlap of the seven large incumbents here there s a lot of overlap we re all kind of have similar exposure there s not a lot of alpha from what i can tell from a week ago so the alphas generally come from external investment activities and virtually all that full 200 basis points has come from raising and deploying that capital in what we believe is the most accretive way which has largely been through development to a lesser extent redevelopment austin wurschmidt keybanc capital markets analyst i appreciate that i mean i know you re below your target leverage today but would you be willing to operate at higher leverage given the reduced funding risk associated with development and a shrinking pipeline kevin o shea chief financial officer yes this is kevin here i mean we are our general range for leverage is kind of five to six turns on a net debt to ebitda basis we re as i mentioned before and as you re alluding to 4 6x at the end of the fourth quarter i think our view is probably 10 years into a cycle being toward the low end of the five to six range is probably about where we should be on the targeting if we were to move it up so i think given where we are at 4 6x while our capital plan contemplates kind of being more or less leverage neutral throughout the year for the right opportunities i think we have the financial flexibility to also increase leverage a little bit but i think probably the upper bound of that would be in the low five turns range austin wurschmidt keybanc capital markets analyst and then just last one for me and kind of touching a little bit on what you just mentioned tim but what drove your decision to change the definition of stabilized operations for 2020 and could you quantify the impact that it s having on the 2020 same store revenue guidance and are you contemplating any additional changes related to redevelopment or revenue enhancing capex in the future kevin o shea chief financial officer yes this is kevin i ll start here and sean may want to chime in yes what we really did there was just adjusted the same store occupancy threshold down to 90 from 95 and in doing so our occupancy threshold is not consistent with the threshold used by five of our six peers so part of the rationale was just to conform our practice to the prevailing practice within the apartment reit sector and the other benefit really is that by virtue of doing that it brings more assets from other stabilizing redevelopment into our same store pool and reduces the size of those other buckets where we don t give guidance to and so as a result more of our overall stabilized and assets are going to be bought within kind of the ambit of our same store guidance so it should make us a lot easier to model going forward sean j breslin chief operating officer yes austin in terms of the impact on 2020 guidance i think i mentioned this previously but collapsing the buckets together represents about a 15 basis point lift in our revenue growth for 2020 austin wurschmidt keybanc capital markets analyst and then anything on the any additional changes you re planning on revenue enhancing or redevelopment sean j breslin chief operating officer i mean we have i think you re going to see our revenue enhancing capex drift up a little bit but still be sort of well below what you see across the peers i mean to give you some perspective last three year average for us we have invested about 350 a home if you look at 17 through 19 kind of on average as compared to our peers i think that number is closer to about 1 000 so more than 2 5x us and so if you put a 10 to 12 return on that kind of back into it you can see what kind of lift it gives you so we re trying to make sure that we re as tim pointed out we re making good capital allocation decisions first to development then to redevelopment where we think it s accretive and not just accretive to same store really value accretive so that s how we think about it we re looking for those opportunities in the market to do that in existing assets where we think it makes sense austin wurschmidt keybanc capital markets analyst appreciate the thoughts guys thank you operator we ll next go with hardik goel from zelman associates please go ahead hardik goel zelman and associates analyst hey guys thanks for taking my questions i know a lot of the questions have been about guidance in the quarter but i just wanted to take a step back and get your thoughts on something as i look at the data we ve collected from you guys over the last decade or so and we have a lot of data now and there s a down cycle included in that d c seems to underperform all the other markets quite significantly and i know tim you ve talked in the past about how in the long term d c and northern california might have similar growth rates and it s a function of volatility in the downturn but it seems like over the last 10 years seems to be a good long term period and i just wonder if the apartment reits in general are missing the trade show with the overallocation of d c because of the lack of supply constraints in the market timothy j naughton chairman chief executive officer and president yes we ve seen this in other markets too by the way that have had sort of a bad decade if you will certainly it was true of boston in the 2000s boston was great in the 90s it was good in the last decade but not so good in the 2000s it s one of the reasons why we try to be in multiple markets you can t always predict what s going to have the best decade seattle certainly outperformed what we had expected it to do this past decade we didn t expect it to be able to absorb a particular level of supply it is probably less supply constrained than d c and yet had a great run we don t think there s really been a secular change with respect to d c we think in some ways the amazon s hq search was kind of informative when you think of ultimately where they landed it is a great knowledge center that happens to be on the east coast you re seeing more and more tech companies sort of diversify their employment base to include d c and new york and so we want to be overallocated and overindexed to college economy and those are largely the markets where we re in and some of the expansion markets a couple of expansion markets we ve gone into and perhaps a couple of other markets down the road that we ve kind of talked about so we really sort of focus first on the demand side recognizing supply more or less it catches up a little more quickly in places like seattle and d c than it does in new york and california but it tends to catch up ultimately a bit with demand and it s really kind of that income and job growth that ultimately is sort of a big driver of ultimate performance so we re good with d c and if anything we re probably more bullish on it today than we were say three or four years ago in terms of investing the marginal dollar hardik goel zelman and associates analyst good that s really helpful for me timothy j naughton chairman chief executive officer and president thank you operator we ll next go with daniel santos from piper sandler please go ahead alex goldfarb piper sandler analyst oh hey graphing it s actually alex goldfarb on for dan so two questions first tim can you just talk about same store and how the developments contribute to that so meaning like you guys are 3 this year which is sort of industry standard and would think that new development once it s part of the same store pool would have faster growth or maybe it doesn t as it ages until it develops a price point below the stuff that s delivered after so can once again have pricing power so maybe you can just talk about how the development interplays with same store noi growth sean j breslin chief operating officer yes alex this is sean if i could take a stab at that one and then tim and matt may want to jump in as well but i mean one thing to keep in mind here is given the size and scale of the portfolio today a development can move the needle but it s not moving it materially i would say in the average here based on the number of deliveries that actually occur in a community a development stabilizes then it sits in our other stabilized bucket for a year and then it comes into same store so we typically see a modest benefit from those communities when they come into same store and they too actually tend to perform well the first two or three years after they stabilize because the pricing whether it s rents or net effective rents after concessions reflect this trend to lease up the entire community typically within 12 months as opposed to the turnover which is closer to half the communities so these communities tend to do well and they typically give us a very modest lift but given the size of the portfolio today as it moves into same store it s not hugely material unless we happen to have one year where there s a very very large slug of deliveries therefore when it comes into same store it s abnormally large alex goldfarb piper sandler analyst okay and then the second question is you guys talked you ve been talking for some time about reducing development you have some severance that s in your numbers this year i think you had severance last year can you just give a sense of two things where you think your development program will ultimately shake out and then the second is how much costs have you cut meaning in aggregate how much have you reduced and as you reduce the development does that mean you have increased costs on the p l or all the reductions are purely costs that were formerly capitalized and that will not end up becoming expense on the p l timothy j naughton chairman chief executive officer and president yes alex it s tim i can start and we have cut back in terms of the capitalized overhead for sure as we ve reduced our development volume we re running i think just a little under 3 in terms of development overhead relative to annualized development overhead relative to starts that includes people s long term compensation you sort of compare that to the private world the private world they tend to get 3 development fees if you will and that doesn t include sort of their promotes and their long term comp so it s still a pretty efficient model but we are very focused honestly the business units are very focused on this because the way they re incentivized is based upon production and profitability relative to basically ftes or overhead expended so it is something that sort of tends to sort of self regulate and it s not exactly linear but it s directionally it kind of works in terms of whether any of it actually is vivid on the p l i think it s just in sort of severances and then in limited certain situations where you may be starting up in a region and you don t yet have new deals to capitalize somebody against there may be some expenses for some period of time but generally on a stable region you re not going to have development expenses sort of being flushed through the p l alex goldfarb piper sandler analyst but then tim so where do you think that like do you still see yourself having a few more years of reducing development and then in total how much costs in total have you reduced over the past few years as you ve done the severance and shrunk the capitalized overhead timothy j naughton chairman chief executive officer and president yes i might have to get to you off line on the second piece but i think as we ve talked about in the last couple of years and we really moved from about 1 3 billion 1 4 billion to about 800 million to 900 million we wanted to get to a level and i think kevin mentioned this in his prepared remarks we wanted to get to a level at which we felt we could fund it without having to be dependent on the equity markets between asset sales free cash flow and additional debt so i would say until there s some kind of economic contraction you should expect we re going to be kind of at this rate the development pipeline that we have in place should allow us to continue to start about 800 million to 900 million a year and then on the second piece we ll just get back to you off line on that alex goldfarb piper sandler analyst appreciate that operator we ll next go with haendel st juste from mizuho so hopefully go ahead haendel st juste mizuho analyst hi my question has been answered thank you operator this concludes today s question and answer session at this time i d like to turn the conference back to mr tim naughton please go ahead timothy j naughton chairman chief executive officer and president well thank you nadia and thanks everybody for being on today and we look forward to seeing you in the

executive officer michael landy michael p landy president and chief executive officer thank you becky good morning everyone and thank you for joining us we were pleased to report our results for the first quarter ended december 31st 2019 during the quarter we acquired one property for 81 5 million consisting of a newly constructed 616 000 square foot distribution center situated on 79 acres in the indianapolis msa this property is leased to amazon for 15 years following last year s 5 growth in our gross leasable area at the end of the first quarter our gross leasable area has increased to approximately 22 9 million square feet representing 6 growth over the prior year period and a 3 increase on a sequential basis as of the quarter end our portfolio consisted of 115 properties geographically diversified across 30 states at quarter end our weighted average lease maturity was 7 6 years we continue to experience strong demand for our properties as evidenced by our 99 2 occupancy rate at quarter end subsequent to the quarter we leased up our 105 000 square foot facility in the buffalo new york msa thereby bringing our occupancy rate up to 99 6 during the quarter we grew our acquisition pipeline to include five new build to suit properties containing 1 2 million total square feet representing 178 5 million in future acquisitions all five properties are leased to investment grade tenants these future acquisitions will have a weighted average lease term of 13 4 years subject to our customary due diligence we anticipate closing each of these transactions upon completion and occupancy which is currently expected to be during fiscal 2020 and the first half of fiscal 2021 in connection with one of these five properties we ve entered into a commitment to obtain a 10 year fully amortizing mortgage loan of 9 4 million with a fixed interest rate of 3 47 we expect to continue to grow our high quality acquisition pipeline further during fiscal 2020 during the quarter we raised approximately 15 5 million in equity capital through our dividend reinvestment plan of this amount a total of 4 2 million in dividends were reinvested representing a 26 participation rate we also raised 43 2 million in net proceeds through our preferred stock atm program with the sale of 1 8 million shares of our 6 125 series c preferred stock at a weighted average price of 25 per share subsequent to the quarter end we raised an additional 27 7 million in net proceeds through our preferred stock atm program with the sale of 1 1 million shares at a weighted average price of 25 04 per share yesterday we established a common stock atm program that provides for the issuance of up to 150 million of our common stock at prevailing market prices we are implementing the common stock atm program for the flexibility that it provides to opportunistically access the capital markets and to best time our equity capital needs as we close on acquisitions atm programs as most of you know are widespread throughout the reit industry our preferred atm which has been in place since 2017 has proven to be a very useful source of long term capital to help fund our growth strategy while we intend to opportunistically raise equity under our atm program based on current prevailing prices we do not expect to utilize the common atm extensively at this time turning to the overall u s industrial market our property sector continues to perform exceptionally well as per cushman wakefield s fourth quarter report net absorption for the fourth quarter was 68 8 million square feet this brings year to date net absorption 233 8 million square feet representing the 39th consecutive quarter of positive net absorption net absorption has been greater than 200 million square feet for six consecutive years u s industrial vacancy rate remained unchanged during the quarter at a record low of 4 8 weighted average asking rents increased 2 4 over the prior year period to 6 51 per square foot currently there is approximately 321 million square feet of industrial product under construction representing a 14 increase over the prior year period the overall u s economy remains healthy with q4 real gdp growing at 2 1 and at 2 3 for the full year driven primarily by strong retail spending and record employment u s manufacturing expanded last month for the first time in six months lastly while it remains to be seen how the coronavirus situation plays out it is a reminder that black swan events do appear suddenly surprising and disrupting the global marketplace in profound ways that algorithms are in my opinion ill prepared for the widespread growth of passive index investing has resulted in the two largest components of s p 500 now becoming bigger than the entire russell 2000 further illustrating this point the five largest companies now make up 20 of the entire s p 500 in other words the broad market has narrowed substantially due in no small manner to the widespread growth of passive index investing because monmouth s income streams are secured by long term leases to investment grade tenants we have been a safe harbor in turbulent times even during the depths of the great recession our shareholder dividends were paid without missing a beat with reliable dividends should come patience and less volatility and now let me turn it over to rich so he can provide you with more detail on the property level as well as our progress on the leasing front richard p molke vice president of asset management thank you mike with respect to our property portfolio our occupancy rate at quarter end was 99 2 representing a 30 basis point increase from a year ago subsequent to the quarter end our occupancy has increased further to 99 6 our weighted average lease maturity was 7 6 years as of the quarter end as compared to 8 0 years in the prior year period our weighted average rent per square foot increased by 1 to 6 27 as of the fiscal year end as compared to 6 22 a year ago from a leasing standpoint in fiscal 2020 approximately 2 of our gross leasable area representing five leases totaling approximately 410 000 square feet is scheduled to expire two of these five leases have been renewed and one of these properties consisting of 55 000 square feet in the hartford connecticut msa is under contract to be sold the two leases that have been renewed representing 157 000 square feet or 38 of the expiring square footage these two lease renewals have a weighted average lease term of 5 9 years and a weighted average lease rate of 5 61 per square foot on a gaap basis and 5 28 on a cash basis this represents an increase of 15 on a gaap basis and an increase of 2 3 on a cash basis the remaining two leases totaling 198 000 square feet that are set to expire during fiscal 2020 are currently under discussion effective last month in january 2020 we entered into a new two year lease agreement with sonwil distribution a 3pl for 105 000 square foot facility located in the buffalo new york msa which increased our current occupancy to 99 6 annual rent is 630 000 representing 6 per square foot over the life of the lease illustrating the strength and visibility of our income streams our occupancy rate has been over 98 for five consecutive years now and our weighted average lease maturity has provided over seven years of lease term for six consecutive years out of our entire 115 property portfolio we currently have only one vacant building representing approximately 40 basis points of our total gla and now kevin will provide you with greater detail on our financial results thank you rich adjusted funds from operations or affo was 19 9 million or 0 21 per diluted share for the first quarter as compared to 21 million or 0 23 per diluted share in the prior year period representing an 8 7 decrease this decrease was largely the result of an increase in preferred dividend expense of 1 7 million and a reduction in dividend income of 1 1 million partially offset by an increase in net operating income of 2 1 million this quarter s affo of 0 21 per diluted share is flat sequentially when compared to our affo of 0 21 per diluted share in the prior quarter rental and reimbursement revenues for the quarter were 41 7 million compared to 38 2 million or an increase of 9 over the prior year period net operating income or noi which we define as recurring rental and reimbursement revenues less property taxes and operating expenses was 34 5 million for the quarter reflecting a 7 increase over the comparable period a year ago our net income was 9 6 million for the first quarter as compared to net loss of 27 9 million in the previous year s first quarter this increase in our net income was due to an accounting rule change which became effective at the beginning of our prior fiscal year in which unrealized gains and losses on our securities investments are reflected in our income statement as we mentioned on prior calls this will at times result in large swings both up and down in our net income this large increase in our net income this quarter was primarily driven by the 39 million decrease in the unrealized loss on our securities portfolio as michael mentioned earlier during the quarter we acquired one newly constructed industrial property for 81 5 million this 616 000 square foot distribution center in the indianapolis msa is leased to amazon for 15 years we financed this transaction with an 18 year fully amortizing mortgage loan in the amount of 52 5 million at a fixed interest rate of 4 27 same property noi decreased by 30 basis points on both a gaap and cash basis over the prior year period this slight decrease was primarily driven by a 90 basis point decrease in noi from the vacancy of our buffalo new york property and was partially offset by a 20 basis point increase in same property occupancy to 99 1 at quarter end as rich mentioned subsequent to quarter end we entered into a new two year lease agreement for the buffalo new york property during the quarter we amended our unsecured line of credit facility increasing the maximum availability of our revolver from 200 million to 225 million with an additional 100 million accordion feature bringing the total potential availability up to 325 million in addition the amended credit facility extended the maturity date of our revolver from september 2020 to january 2024 with options to extend further furthermore the amended facility was enhanced with the 75 million term loan which matures in january 2025 resulting in total potential availability on both the revolver and the term loan of up to 300 million and up to 400 million including the 100 million accordion feature the amended line of credit and new term loan increases our borrowing capacity extends our maturity and reduces our borrowing rates by a range of 5 basis points to 35 basis points depending on our leverage ratios the revolver currently bears interest at a rate of 3 25 we currently have the full 225 million available under our new revolver as well as an additional 100 million potentially available from the accordion feature to reduce floating interest rate exposure on our term loan and to lock in the current historically favorable rates we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to fix libor on the entire 75 million for the full duration of the term loan which is at an all in interest rate of 2 92 as of the end of the quarter our capital structure consisted of approximately 864 million in debt of which 784 million was property level fixed rate mortgage debt and 80 million were loans payable 91 of our debt is property level fixed rate mortgage debt with a weighted average interest rate of 4 05 as compared to 4 08 in the prior year period our weighted average debt maturity for our property level fixed rate debt was 11 5 years at quarter end as compared to 11 8 years in the prior year period 75 million of our loans payable is made up of a term loan that has a corresponding interest rate swap agreement to fix libor at an all in interest rate of 2 92 including the term loan 99 of our debt is fixed rate with a weighted average interest rate of 4 along with the weighted average debt maturity of 10 5 years this represents one of the longest debt maturity schedules in the entire reit sector taking on maturities out even further we also had 392 million outstanding on our series c 6 125 perpetual preferred equity at quarter end combined with an equity market capitalization of 1 4 billion our total market capitalization was approximately 2 7 billion at quarter end from a credit standpoint we continue to be conservatively capitalized with our net debt to total market capitalization at 32 our fixed charge coverage at 2 3 times and our net debt to adjusted ebitda at 6 1 times for the quarter from a liquidity standpoint we ended the quarter with 16 4 million in cash and cash equivalents and as i previously mentioned we currently have no borrowings on our revolver in addition we held 181 8 million in marketable reit securities representing 8 2 of our undepreciated assets with an unrealized loss of 53 1 million at quarter end our securities portfolio currently generates approximately 13 million in annual dividends as we announced last year it is our goal to opportunistically reduce the size of our marketable reit securities portfolio to approximately 5 of our undepreciated assets there have been no open market purchases or sales of reit securities since this announcement was made and now let me turn it back to michael before we open up the call for questions michael p landy president and chief executive officer thanks kevin u s industrial real estate has experienced a protracted period of cap rate compression it is estimated that industrial real estate values have more than doubled during the past 10 years and have increased by 15 in the past year alone consequently the value of our properties has appreciated substantially looking forward it is estimated that the total u s parcel market will double from 50 million packages per day currently to 100 million packages per day by 2026 because of this surging demand fedex ground recently began delivering packages seven days a week all year round this means that our mission critical properties leased to fedex have now become more mission critical than ever before lastly before we open it up to questions i d like to point out that our recently published annual report is now up on our website this report represents an excellent resource for understanding our company and our outlook we encourage you to read it please contact our ir department if you d like to receive a hard copy and we d be happy to fedex it right out to you we would now like to open it up for questions questions and answers operator and our first question comes from jeremy metz of bmo please go ahead jeremy metz bmo capital markets analyst hey good morning guys i m on with frank lee here mike just first on the pipeline obviously there has been some challenges fedex has talked about granted a lot of that seems more in the global scale and some of their global operations versus their ground network obviously you mentioned the expansion in the package delivery needs but just as a historically big component of your acquisition pipeline are you seeing any sort of concerted pull back from them and if so is it increasingly making you shift at all or shift focus to look at other investment grade but non fedex opportunities michael p landy president and chief executive officer well fedex is a public company they report quarterly and consistently the u s ground operation is performing very very well shipments were up 7 year over year for fedex ground fedex ground is the backbone of their e commerce business so like you said the weakness is largely in asia and europe and the beginning of this year they announced that they re shipping out of our building seven days a week so the fact that they re utilizing our buildings all week all year long is a big factor in why we ve had over 98 occupancy for over five years now so capex for fedex is projected to be 5 9 billion this year 5 9 billion for next year and that s because the pie is expanding the demand for increased package shipments is growing from 50 million packages a day in the u s currently to projected to be as high as 100 million packages a day in 2026 so i think the demand is very strong and yeah i think maybe some of the projected metrics for fedex were a little too optimistic given the black swan of global trade slowdown and brexit and weakness in europe jeremy metz bmo capital markets analyst and yeah and i respect or i think it s just more of thinking through of how they think about expanding with new acquisitions versus maybe this creates an increasing opportunity for expansion for you and maybe less on the acquisition front just trying to think through the next 12 months 24 months how we re supposed to be thinking about one versus the other in that context of those needs but maybe they want to flex their existing facilities more in the current environment any thoughts michael p landy president and chief executive officer well by going to seven day shipment obviously their term is sweating their assets they are clearly using their assets more than ever but there are new fedex buildings going up in the u s both fedex ground and fedex express and in our pipeline there is a few of each and we continue to look at additional fedex deals fedex as a percentage of our total square footage went down in 2019 versus 18 and it will probably continue to come down but that s just because we re doing a lot of buildings with large investment grade tenants other than fedex jeremy metz bmo capital markets analyst all right and then in terms of the renewals the two you have left in 2020 i don t think either is fedex which historically get done almost right at expiration so maybe you can just give some color on how we should be thinking about the renewal probability here and in terms of spreads should those two renew should we see a similar modestly positive cash spread or are there any supply risks in those markets where we could potentially see a roll down michael p landy president and chief executive officer yeah well i m going to turn that over to rich he handles that but i m told the prospects are very high for renewal and high for rent increases rich you want to add to that richard p molke vice president of asset management yeah mike you are correct we re down to the end of our negotiations and that s about as much as i ll say but both of those should get renewed shortly jeremy metz bmo capital markets analyst and similar spreads to what we saw richard p molke vice president of asset management similar positive spreads both basis cash and gaap jeremy metz bmo capital markets analyst all right and then i think frank had one question frank lee bmo capital markets analyst yeah hi guys in regards to your goal bringing down the securities portfolio to 5 is the plan still for this reduction to come down naturally as you deliver on the acquisition pipeline or could we expect some near term securities sales and also is there an expected time frame on when you think you can reach the targeted 5 thanks michael p landy president and chief executive officer yeah there s so many variables out of our control as to it coming down as kevin mentioned there have been no purchases or sales since we announced our intention to take the ceiling from 10 of gross assets down to 5 of gross assets and because it s gone up in value that s a variable we can t control it s actually higher as a percentage of assets but given our pipeline it will organically shrink but as far as sales we d like to convert unrealized gains to realized gains but with the whole portfolio in a total loss position albeit a smaller loss position than a year ago a much smaller loss position than a year ago but as the unrealized losses come closer to neutral and realized gains then as we ve done in the past we will harvest realized gains and you ll see the portfolio shrink faster but if and when that s going to occur is beyond our control jeremy metz bmo capital markets analyst thanks for the time operator our next question comes from michael carroll of rbc capital markets please go ahead hey this is jason on for mike i just had a question about the lease up of the buffalo asset looks like there was a rent roll down there so i was just wondering if you could talk about the lease up process michael p landy president and chief executive officer sure i ll turn that over to rich richard p molke vice president of asset management yes sure so we ve owned that asset for 17 years and that building was expanded twice at a 10 cap on costs so those rents kind of went higher above market and it s free and clear now and the rents are back at market and we re happy with the performance of the asset over time michael p landy president and chief executive officer so if i could just add to that so we bought the building in 2002 fedex expanded it twice and all the capital it took to expand it we got repaid over the lease term so the good news is we got free additional square footage you could say and we got all our money back on additional parking however because of a 10 return unlevered return on all the capital we put into the building the rents went well above market and then rich in leasing the building had to roll down to market but we re happy to fill the space and we re happy to have had two very profitable expansions with fedex since 2002 jason rbc capital markets analyst yeah definitely okay that makes sense and then i m wondering if you could put any numbers to a shadow pipeline it seems like you were able to quickly backfill the build to suit pipeline after closing that amazon deal so just curious what other deals you re looking at michael p landy president and chief executive officer yeah i would say the shadow pipeline is another as high as another 0 25 billion but it remains to be seen of that how much we actually win if any because the market is so competitive but yeah we hope to grow the pipeline and we don t announce shadow pipelines we really just talk about things under contract and we have long term relationships with the merchant builder community the deals we win there s no broker involved it s just us doing business with partners we ve done business with for decades so i think that s a distinct advantage and it is very competitive we do have to bid very record low cap rates but fortunately we re financing these transactions with record low interest rates kevin you want to talk about what sort of interest rates you re seeing these days kevin s miller chief financial officer yes sure i mean as we mentioned in the prepared remarks we have one deal in the pipeline locked in currently at 3 47 so less than 3 5 and there s a few more out there that we ve gotten our bids to lock in at even lower rates that we just can t announce yet so we ll be able to announce and i can say that they re going to be record low interest rates on 15 year loans jason rbc capital markets analyst got it thank you guys michael p landy president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from barry oxford of d a davidson please go ahead barry oxford d a davidson analyst great thanks mike could you give us a little more color behind the sale of the building that was empty and how you decided to sell it versus hey maybe i should wait and lease it up did you get kind of pricing that was close to that michael p landy president and chief executive officer yes so the buildings we ve sold have been a result of kellogg keebler changing their supply chain to bigger modern buildings and these buildings are not indicative of our portfolio at all they are small buildings we purchased for very low purchase price and we are selling them at good profits but i wouldn t extrapolate any of the economic returns from these sales as indicative of our portfolio because we re really pruning our portfolio and our portfolio average building age is about nine years average building size is about 200 000 square feet average land to building ratio is over 6 to 1 and the buildings we re selling are smaller buildings that we ve been selling consistently rich you want to talk to them about that any further richard p molke vice president of asset management no other than it s just not as much acreage and not as configurable as some of our other assets michael p landy president and chief executive officer and much older property barry oxford d a davidson analyst is that true mike of the current vacant building too michael p landy president and chief executive officer well the current value of vacant building is also unusual for our portfolio it s in an industrial park everything we own is a single tenant net leased industrial with a long term leased to investment grade tenant but that property is on an industrial park we ve owned for decades it used to be our one multi tenant asset other than the shopping center we own in somerset new jersey which is also an outlier in our portfolio but in monarch pennsylvania outside of pittsburgh a suburb of pittsburgh is this industrial park and the one tenant there in the titanium business their business is strong and growing and now they are our sole tenant and they re talking about taking some of the 80 000 square feet of vacancy so we do feel optimistic that our occupancy will go up and we ll fill some of that space it s just a question of if its 25 or more hopefully as their business will keep growing and they ll take all the excess space in that building but as gene mentioned on our last call and i will turn it over if he wants to talk about it further but as he mentioned on the last call the largest construction site in north america is five miles from our property it s the shell cracking plant going up it s a 7 billion investment it s going to come online in the next couple of years and so there should be strong demand for our real estate once that comes online gene do you want to add to this at all eugene w landy chairman of the board the only other thing i ll add is it is on the ohio river and it s on the navigable portion and i just think it s a wonderful property for the future and that s why i take a long term view of the initiative here s one empty building and the prospects for it long term are excellent and we don t intend to get rid of it we tend to grow with the areas as the cracker plant comes in it is going to be great to manage the space and riverfront properties barry oxford d a davidson analyst great thanks mike one last question switching gears a little bit how do you guys think about unsecured debt going forward michael p landy president and chief executive officer well like kevin mentioned we re locking in 15 year money in the low low threes fully amortizing as we grow and build up our unencumbered asset pool that quadrant of the capital markets will become more accessible for us but a company our size with long term relationships with the lifecos is very happy to go secured and amortizing debt and generate levered returns on equity in the low teens it s very favorable the current process but we are building up our unencumbered asset pool and as that grows we can start looking at the unsecured market kevin anything you want to add to that kevin s miller chief financial officer yes as i said out of the 115 properties that we own 55 of them are free and clear and unencumbered and as mike mentioned in the new acquisitions we get secured amortizing debt and as that amortizing debt amortizes out and it s paid off we leave it free and clear rather than refinancing it and then as i mentioned on the prepared remarks we just refinanced our line of credit with now we have the full capacity the full 225 million revolver available to us so that s a great liquidity tool that we have in our tool belt and then that s how we look at it and right now it s a floating rate debt that s right now in the low threes if we choose to use it barry oxford d a davidson analyst right thanks so much guys i ll yield the floor michael p landy president and chief executive officer okay thank you barry our next question comes from rob stevenson of janney please go ahead robert stevenson janney montgomery scott analyst good morning guys mike or rich can you talk about the cadence of the closings of the five acquisition pipeline properties you said that some of them will close this year fiscal year or next is this essentially one a quarter for the next five quarters is there a point in time where more of these are expected to close just trying to think about it for modeling purposes when we should be bringing these assets on to your balance sheet michael p landy president and chief executive officer yes i broke that down because i anticipated this question so our pipeline is 178 5 million and on a dollar basis you should expect approximately 10 of that to close in the second quarter of fiscal 20 another 7 in q3 approximately 27 in q4 so that totals to 44 of the pipeline closing in fiscal 20 and then the other 56 you should expect to close in the first two quarters of 2021 with 40 of the 178 5 million closing in q1 of 2021 and the remaining 16 in q2 of 2021 now all that s approximate and all that is subject to slippage but that s where it stands right now robert stevenson janney montgomery scott analyst all right perfect that s great the sonwil distribution in buffalo that you just leased is this an asset to now hold or given that it s not investment grade tenant and is income producing is this a disposition candidate how are you guys thinking about that asset now that there is a lease on it it is more desirable out there in the market michael p landy president and chief executive officer well like gene said we really don t like to sell anything we re looking to grow and looking long term having said that and that doesn t have a lot of lease term on it but having said that it s certainly a candidate for a disposition most of our assets are long term leases to investment grade tenants that s a short term lease to a non investment grade tenant so it would be a candidate we do get unsolicited offers to buy our properties all the time and as a company with going on 3 billion in enterprise value we re really not of the critical mass to be public that you need to be these days so we re looking to grow albeit qualitatively albeit slowly and methodically we ve seen new entrants to our space leapfrog out of nowhere to become multiples of our size and as a 52 year old company we know you don t get to be 52 years old growing at such a rate so we re looking to grow we re happy with our portfolio but we re going to continue at our own pace robert stevenson janney montgomery scott analyst okay and then putting together the bread crumbs i think that you were talking about earlier rich the property that you re selling for 4 million with the expiring lease that s the newington connecticut asset leased to kellogg richard p molke vice president of asset management correct okay and then one for kevin what was the nearly 800 000 of severance in the quarter kevin s miller chief financial officer yes so we made an announcement we had our general counsel who was here nearly 20 years and it s part of the agreement of her retirement to recognize her years of service that was just the agreed upon amount and mike prashad is now our new general counsel he s been working alongside our former general counsel for the last few years now so he s up for the task and has been doing a great job robert stevenson janney montgomery scott analyst okay so it wasn t an 800 000 pay day for susan and her retirement kevin s miller chief financial officer no its for the general counsel robert stevenson janney montgomery scott analyst okay thanks kevin s miller chief financial officer but i don t want susan to feel left out we certainly susan had a compensation recognizing her service as well operator our next question comes from craig kucera of b riley fbr please go ahead craig kucera b riley fbr analyst hey good morning guys i think last quarter you disclosed that your pipeline at that point in time was three fedex and one magna seating is the new addition to the pipeline another fedex or something else kevin s miller chief financial officer something else it s a japanese earthmoving manufacturer they re like the japanese caterpillar called komatsu a rated credit it s outside of the pittsburgh market and it s a good new addition to our tenant roster got it and i think last quarter the pipeline at that point in time was a little higher than a 6 2 or so is that still the case on where things stand today with this new addition michael p landy president and chief executive officer yeah the pipeline average cap rate over 13 4 years of lease term is just shy of 6 3 craig kucera b riley fbr analyst got it want to shift gears and talk about the balance sheet i m curious about the capital raise in this quarter particularly on the preferred front and subsequent to quarter end did that pick up because you re pleased with pricing or is that more a function of kind of alluding to this shadow pipeline that you re working on where you could really see an acceleration in acquisition volume michael p landy president and chief executive officer gene i ll let you handle that and then i ll chime in eugene w landy chairman of the board well we re very proud of our balance sheet we also believe it s very important that we think long term we are trying to build up of balance sheet that can withstand changes in the economy not be susceptible to increases in interest rates and we pay 6 125 for preferred and we could borrow money of 3 and that makes a difference of between 5 million and 10 million a year but we re very happy to do that because we re getting our portfolio being clear we have securities we can borrow against we are really trying to build up a very strong financial statement so that whatever happens over the next couple of years we re here for the long term and the long term view is excellent the country is growing 2 3 a year inflation is 2 3 a year our properties are relatively new we have 2 5 billion in assets what are they going to be worth 10 years from now you re really talking about large figures and i find it interesting people look at the 1 million 2 million change in one year and actually we are looking at much larger numbers and the preferred the decision on the preferred we realized cost us money short term but long term there s nothing longer as michael pointed out than a perpetual preferred and there is no cheaper capital than capital that you don t have to repay it s part of our capital stack and it s going to 10 years from now people are going to see that the balance sheet we ve built the properties we ve built have really produced a good return over a 10 year period michael p landy president and chief executive officer very good craig kucera b riley fbr analyst okay great and i guess just kind of dovetailing with that and your thoughts on utilizing that preferred i think from a leverage perspective historically you guys were closer to maybe 7 times ebitda and that s been drifting down closer to 6 times should we think of that as sort of how you re going to manage the balance sheet going forward or do you anticipate maybe levering up a bit in the future michael p landy president and chief executive officer well historically our net debt to ebitda has fluctuated between the high 5s in high 6s if it was in the low 7s it was just by virtue of closing a lot of assets in one lumpy period and not having the earnings come in yet the debt hits immediately but historically it s in the low 6s is a good average and i think right now it s 6 1 times and certainly gives us the capacity to lever up because is rich mentioned with occupancy being over 98 for so many years and lease terms going out over seven years and our debt maturities going out over 11 years i think 6 1 times net debt to ebitda is very low leverage craig kucera b riley fbr analyst okay great kevin s miller chief financial officer i d also like to just add one thing just about that net debt to ebitda number it s just a simple math equation you take your net debt divided by your ebitda but if you look at the components of our debt 90 of our debt is amortizing debt so there s no looming maturities with balloon payments so i think that s a big factor when you look at how that number could be maybe a little higher in our case and the other end of the equation our revenue 80 of our revenue is investment grade tenants and we have one of the longest we have a long lease term of 7 6 years our weighted average debt maturity is 11 5 years so i think if you look at the components of what makes up that ratio you could maybe you could feel that it could be a little higher maybe than some another type of company eugene w landy chairman of the board just one other thing we re increasing our free and clear properties our preferreds are getting to a point where we have the flexibility of calling them in the near future we are keeping a very flexible situation and we can take advantage of changes in interest rates and changes in the capital markets that could be very very positive for monmouth reit craig kucera b riley fbr analyst okay just one more from me just as it relates to the common atm you filed yesterday i appreciate the commentary that you re looking to opportunistically take advantage of where the market is but is there any thought or is that going to serve as any sort of a replacement for the drip which i think you raised about 15 5 million this quarter or is it really just to augment that and the drip will more or less continue as it is today and has been in the past michael p landy president and chief executive officer well it certainly enhances the flexibility and optionality to go to different arrows in our quiver so to speak we ve used the drip and sip for a long time it s worked for a long time as kevin mentioned participation was about 26 your number is correct we raised about 15 2 million over the quarter but having done a preferred atm since 2017 we saw how that s a more flexible mouse trap as far as accessing the capital markets the drip and sip the drip is quarterly the shareholder investment plan is in the middle of every month you can now access capital just in time as the pipeline deals come online and if the stock is favorable and the pipeline is growing you could time things more precisely so you re correct that if things are working with the pipeline timing and the stock price is more advantageous you ll see less money raised through the sip the drip we ll keep the drip the same but through the sip and use the atm instead but as i said at this time we don t plan to use the common atm extensively it s a new year we thought the preferred atm did so well it behooves us to have a common atm in our arsenal craig kucera b riley fbr analyst got it okay thanks michael p landy president and chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from michael mueller of jp morgan please go ahead michael mueller jp morgan analyst hi i was wondering can you talk a little bit about what you see is the early read on the 10 leases expiring in 2021 are there any known renewals or move outs at this point michael p landy president and chief executive officer currently there is no known move outs we ve been talking to a few of those tenants in the first part of that fiscal year but nothing definitive at this time michael mueller jp morgan analyst got it ok that was it thank you kevin s miller chief financial officer thank you just to add to mike s comments the 10 leases roll in 2021 1 2 million square feet that s 5 of our gla 3 5 of our base rent there is a slide in our slide deck slide 24 that shows our lease expirations and i believe the rents expiring next year are well below market the average is 4 61 per square foot rolling in 2021 so good prospects for positive renewal rates okay thank you michael p landy president and chief executive officer you re welcome operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to becky coleridge for

with us today eugene landy chairman michael landy president and chief executive officer kevin miller chief financial officer and richard molke vice president of asset management it is now my pleasure to turn the call over to monmouth s president and chief executive officer michael landy michael p landy president and chief executive officer thank you becky good morning everyone and thank you for joining us we were pleased to report our results for the first quarter ended december 31st 2019 during the quarter we acquired one property for 81 5 million consisting of a newly constructed 616 000 square foot distribution center situated on 79 acres in the indianapolis msa this property is leased to amazon for 15 years following last year s 5 growth in our gross leasable area at the end of the first quarter our gross leasable area has increased to approximately 22 9 million square feet representing 6 growth over the prior year period and a 3 increase on a sequential basis as of the quarter end our portfolio consisted of 115 properties geographically diversified across 30 states at quarter end our weighted average lease maturity was 7 6 years we continue to experience strong demand for our properties as evidenced by our 99 2 occupancy rate at quarter end subsequent to the quarter we leased up our 105 000 square foot facility in the buffalo new york msa thereby bringing our occupancy rate up to 99 6 during the quarter we grew our acquisition pipeline to include five new build to suit properties containing 1 2 million total square feet representing 178 5 million in future acquisitions all five properties are leased to investment grade tenants these future acquisitions will have a weighted average lease term of 13 4 years subject to our customary due diligence we anticipate closing each of these transactions upon completion and occupancy which is currently expected to be during fiscal 2020 and the first half of fiscal 2021 in connection with one of these five properties we ve entered into a commitment to obtain a 10 year fully amortizing mortgage loan of 9 4 million with a fixed interest rate of 3 47 we expect to continue to grow our high quality acquisition pipeline further during fiscal 2020 during the quarter we raised approximately 15 5 million in equity capital through our dividend reinvestment plan of this amount a total of 4 2 million in dividends were reinvested representing a 26 participation rate we also raised 43 2 million in net proceeds through our preferred stock atm program with the sale of 1 8 million shares of our 6 125 series c preferred stock at a weighted average price of 25 per share subsequent to the quarter end we raised an additional 27 7 million in net proceeds through our preferred stock atm program with the sale of 1 1 million shares at a weighted average price of 25 04 per share yesterday we established a common stock atm program that provides for the issuance of up to 150 million of our common stock at prevailing market prices we are implementing the common stock atm program for the flexibility that it provides to opportunistically access the capital markets and to best time our equity capital needs as we close on acquisitions atm programs as most of you know are widespread throughout the reit industry our preferred atm which has been in place since 2017 has proven to be a very useful source of long term capital to help fund our growth strategy while we intend to opportunistically raise equity under our atm program based on current prevailing prices we do not expect to utilize the common atm extensively at this time turning to the overall u s industrial market our property sector continues to perform exceptionally well as per cushman wakefield s fourth quarter report net absorption for the fourth quarter was 68 8 million square feet this brings year to date net absorption 233 8 million square feet representing the 39th consecutive quarter of positive net absorption net absorption has been greater than 200 million square feet for six consecutive years u s industrial vacancy rate remained unchanged during the quarter at a record low of 4 8 weighted average asking rents increased 2 4 over the prior year period to 6 51 per square foot currently there is approximately 321 million square feet of industrial product under construction representing a 14 increase over the prior year period the overall u s economy remains healthy with q4 real gdp growing at 2 1 and at 2 3 for the full year driven primarily by strong retail spending and record employment u s manufacturing expanded last month for the first time in six months lastly while it remains to be seen how the coronavirus situation plays out it is a reminder that black swan events do appear suddenly surprising and disrupting the global marketplace in profound ways that algorithms are in my opinion ill prepared for the widespread growth of passive index investing has resulted in the two largest components of s p 500 now becoming bigger than the entire russell 2000 further illustrating this point the five largest companies now make up 20 of the entire s p 500 in other words the broad market has narrowed substantially due in no small manner to the widespread growth of passive index investing because monmouth s income streams are secured by long term leases to investment grade tenants we have been a safe harbor in turbulent times even during the depths of the great recession our shareholder dividends were paid without missing a beat with reliable dividends should come patience and less volatility and now let me turn it over to rich so he can provide you with more detail on the property level as well as our progress on the leasing front richard p molke vice president of asset management thank you mike with respect to our property portfolio our occupancy rate at quarter end was 99 2 representing a 30 basis point increase from a year ago subsequent to the quarter end our occupancy has increased further to 99 6 our weighted average lease maturity was 7 6 years as of the quarter end as compared to 8 0 years in the prior year period our weighted average rent per square foot increased by 1 to 6 27 as of the fiscal year end as compared to 6 22 a year ago from a leasing standpoint in fiscal 2020 approximately 2 of our gross leasable area representing five leases totaling approximately 410 000 square feet is scheduled to expire two of these five leases have been renewed and one of these properties consisting of 55 000 square feet in the hartford connecticut msa is under contract to be sold the two leases that have been renewed representing 157 000 square feet or 38 of the expiring square footage these two lease renewals have a weighted average lease term of 5 9 years and a weighted average lease rate of 5 61 per square foot on a gaap basis and 5 28 on a cash basis this represents an increase of 15 on a gaap basis and an increase of 2 3 on a cash basis the remaining two leases totaling 198 000 square feet that are set to expire during fiscal 2020 are currently under discussion effective last month in january 2020 we entered into a new two year lease agreement with sonwil distribution a 3pl for 105 000 square foot facility located in the buffalo new york msa which increased our current occupancy to 99 6 annual rent is 630 000 representing 6 per square foot over the life of the lease illustrating the strength and visibility of our income streams our occupancy rate has been over 98 for five consecutive years now and our weighted average lease maturity has provided over seven years of lease term for six consecutive years out of our entire 115 property portfolio we currently have only one vacant building representing approximately 40 basis points of our total gla and now kevin will provide you with greater detail on our financial results thank you rich adjusted funds from operations or affo was 19 9 million or 0 21 per diluted share for the first quarter as compared to 21 million or 0 23 per diluted share in the prior year period representing an 8 7 decrease this decrease was largely the result of an increase in preferred dividend expense of 1 7 million and a reduction in dividend income of 1 1 million partially offset by an increase in net operating income of 2 1 million this quarter s affo of 0 21 per diluted share is flat sequentially when compared to our affo of 0 21 per diluted share in the prior quarter rental and reimbursement revenues for the quarter were 41 7 million compared to 38 2 million or an increase of 9 over the prior year period net operating income or noi which we define as recurring rental and reimbursement revenues less property taxes and operating expenses was 34 5 million for the quarter reflecting a 7 increase over the comparable period a year ago our net income was 9 6 million for the first quarter as compared to net loss of 27 9 million in the previous year s first quarter this increase in our net income was due to an accounting rule change which became effective at the beginning of our prior fiscal year in which unrealized gains and losses on our securities investments are reflected in our income statement as we mentioned on prior calls this will at times result in large swings both up and down in our net income this large increase in our net income this quarter was primarily driven by the 39 million decrease in the unrealized loss on our securities portfolio as michael mentioned earlier during the quarter we acquired one newly constructed industrial property for 81 5 million this 616 000 square foot distribution center in the indianapolis msa is leased to amazon for 15 years we financed this transaction with an 18 year fully amortizing mortgage loan in the amount of 52 5 million at a fixed interest rate of 4 27 same property noi decreased by 30 basis points on both a gaap and cash basis over the prior year period this slight decrease was primarily driven by a 90 basis point decrease in noi from the vacancy of our buffalo new york property and was partially offset by a 20 basis point increase in same property occupancy to 99 1 at quarter end as rich mentioned subsequent to quarter end we entered into a new two year lease agreement for the buffalo new york property during the quarter we amended our unsecured line of credit facility increasing the maximum availability of our revolver from 200 million to 225 million with an additional 100 million accordion feature bringing the total potential availability up to 325 million in addition the amended credit facility extended the maturity date of our revolver from september 2020 to january 2024 with options to extend further furthermore the amended facility was enhanced with the 75 million term loan which matures in january 2025 resulting in total potential availability on both the revolver and the term loan of up to 300 million and up to 400 million including the 100 million accordion feature the amended line of credit and new term loan increases our borrowing capacity extends our maturity and reduces our borrowing rates by a range of 5 basis points to 35 basis points depending on our leverage ratios the revolver currently bears interest at a rate of 3 25 we currently have the full 225 million available under our new revolver as well as an additional 100 million potentially available from the accordion feature to reduce floating interest rate exposure on our term loan and to lock in the current historically favorable rates we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to fix libor on the entire 75 million for the full duration of the term loan which is at an all in interest rate of 2 92 as of the end of the quarter our capital structure consisted of approximately 864 million in debt of which 784 million was property level fixed rate mortgage debt and 80 million were loans payable 91 of our debt is property level fixed rate mortgage debt with a weighted average interest rate of 4 05 as compared to 4 08 in the prior year period our weighted average debt maturity for our property level fixed rate debt was 11 5 years at quarter end as compared to 11 8 years in the prior year period 75 million of our loans payable is made up of a term loan that has a corresponding interest rate swap agreement to fix libor at an all in interest rate of 2 92 including the term loan 99 of our debt is fixed rate with a weighted average interest rate of 4 along with the weighted average debt maturity of 10 5 years this represents one of the longest debt maturity schedules in the entire reit sector taking on maturities out even further we also had 392 million outstanding on our series c 6 125 perpetual preferred equity at quarter end combined with an equity market capitalization of 1 4 billion our total market capitalization was approximately 2 7 billion at quarter end from a credit standpoint we continue to be conservatively capitalized with our net debt to total market capitalization at 32 our fixed charge coverage at 2 3 times and our net debt to adjusted ebitda at 6 1 times for the quarter from a liquidity standpoint we ended the quarter with 16 4 million in cash and cash equivalents and as i previously mentioned we currently have no borrowings on our revolver in addition we held 181 8 million in marketable reit securities representing 8 2 of our undepreciated assets with an unrealized loss of 53 1 million at quarter end our securities portfolio currently generates approximately 13 million in annual dividends as we announced last year it is our goal to opportunistically reduce the size of our marketable reit securities portfolio to approximately 5 of our undepreciated assets there have been no open market purchases or sales of reit securities since this announcement was made and now let me turn it back to michael before we open up the call for questions michael p landy president and chief executive officer thanks kevin u s industrial real estate has experienced a protracted period of cap rate compression it is estimated that industrial real estate values have more than doubled during the past 10 years and have increased by 15 in the past year alone consequently the value of our properties has appreciated substantially looking forward it is estimated that the total u s parcel market will double from 50 million packages per day currently to 100 million packages per day by 2026 because of this surging demand fedex ground recently began delivering packages seven days a week all year round this means that our mission critical properties leased to fedex have now become more mission critical than ever before lastly before we open it up to questions i d like to point out that our recently published annual report is now up on our website this report represents an excellent resource for understanding our company and our outlook we encourage you to read it please contact our ir department if you d like to receive a hard copy and we d be happy to fedex it right out to you we would now like to open it up for questions questions and answers operator and our first question comes from jeremy metz of bmo please go ahead jeremy metz bmo capital markets analyst hey good morning guys i m on with frank lee here mike just first on the pipeline obviously there has been some challenges fedex has talked about granted a lot of that seems more in the global scale and some of their global operations versus their ground network obviously you mentioned the expansion in the package delivery needs but just as a historically big component of your acquisition pipeline are you seeing any sort of concerted pull back from them and if so is it increasingly making you shift at all or shift focus to look at other investment grade but non fedex opportunities michael p landy president and chief executive officer well fedex is a public company they report quarterly and consistently the u s ground operation is performing very very well shipments were up 7 year over year for fedex ground fedex ground is the backbone of their e commerce business so like you said the weakness is largely in asia and europe and the beginning of this year they announced that they re shipping out of our building seven days a week so the fact that they re utilizing our buildings all week all year long is a big factor in why we ve had over 98 occupancy for over five years now so capex for fedex is projected to be 5 9 billion this year 5 9 billion for next year and that s because the pie is expanding the demand for increased package shipments is growing from 50 million packages a day in the u s currently to projected to be as high as 100 million packages a day in 2026 so i think the demand is very strong and yeah i think maybe some of the projected metrics for fedex were a little too optimistic given the black swan of global trade slowdown and brexit and weakness in europe jeremy metz bmo capital markets analyst and yeah and i respect or i think it s just more of thinking through of how they think about expanding with new acquisitions versus maybe this creates an increasing opportunity for expansion for you and maybe less on the acquisition front just trying to think through the next 12 months 24 months how we re supposed to be thinking about one versus the other in that context of those needs but maybe they want to flex their existing facilities more in the current environment any thoughts michael p landy president and chief executive officer well by going to seven day shipment obviously their term is sweating their assets they are clearly using their assets more than ever but there are new fedex buildings going up in the u s both fedex ground and fedex express and in our pipeline there is a few of each and we continue to look at additional fedex deals fedex as a percentage of our total square footage went down in 2019 versus 18 and it will probably continue to come down but that s just because we re doing a lot of buildings with large investment grade tenants other than fedex jeremy metz bmo capital markets analyst all right and then in terms of the renewals the two you have left in 2020 i don t think either is fedex which historically get done almost right at expiration so maybe you can just give some color on how we should be thinking about the renewal probability here and in terms of spreads should those two renew should we see a similar modestly positive cash spread or are there any supply risks in those markets where we could potentially see a roll down michael p landy president and chief executive officer yeah well i m going to turn that over to rich he handles that but i m told the prospects are very high for renewal and high for rent increases rich you want to add to that richard p molke vice president of asset management yeah mike you are correct we re down to the end of our negotiations and that s about as much as i ll say but both of those should get renewed shortly jeremy metz bmo capital markets analyst and similar spreads to what we saw richard p molke vice president of asset management similar positive spreads both basis cash and gaap jeremy metz bmo capital markets analyst all right and then i think frank had one question frank lee bmo capital markets analyst yeah hi guys in regards to your goal bringing down the securities portfolio to 5 is the plan still for this reduction to come down naturally as you deliver on the acquisition pipeline or could we expect some near term securities sales and also is there an expected time frame on when you think you can reach the targeted 5 thanks michael p landy president and chief executive officer yeah there s so many variables out of our control as to it coming down as kevin mentioned there have been no purchases or sales since we announced our intention to take the ceiling from 10 of gross assets down to 5 of gross assets and because it s gone up in value that s a variable we can t control it s actually higher as a percentage of assets but given our pipeline it will organically shrink but as far as sales we d like to convert unrealized gains to realized gains but with the whole portfolio in a total loss position albeit a smaller loss position than a year ago a much smaller loss position than a year ago but as the unrealized losses come closer to neutral and realized gains then as we ve done in the past we will harvest realized gains and you ll see the portfolio shrink faster but if and when that s going to occur is beyond our control jeremy metz bmo capital markets analyst thanks for the time operator our next question comes from michael carroll of rbc capital markets please go ahead hey this is jason on for mike i just had a question about the lease up of the buffalo asset looks like there was a rent roll down there so i was just wondering if you could talk about the lease up process michael p landy president and chief executive officer sure i ll turn that over to rich richard p molke vice president of asset management yes sure so we ve owned that asset for 17 years and that building was expanded twice at a 10 cap on costs so those rents kind of went higher above market and it s free and clear now and the rents are back at market and we re happy with the performance of the asset over time michael p landy president and chief executive officer so if i could just add to that so we bought the building in 2002 fedex expanded it twice and all the capital it took to expand it we got repaid over the lease term so the good news is we got free additional square footage you could say and we got all our money back on additional parking however because of a 10 return unlevered return on all the capital we put into the building the rents went well above market and then rich in leasing the building had to roll down to market but we re happy to fill the space and we re happy to have had two very profitable expansions with fedex since 2002 jason rbc capital markets analyst yeah definitely okay that makes sense and then i m wondering if you could put any numbers to a shadow pipeline it seems like you were able to quickly backfill the build to suit pipeline after closing that amazon deal so just curious what other deals you re looking at michael p landy president and chief executive officer yeah i would say the shadow pipeline is another as high as another 0 25 billion but it remains to be seen of that how much we actually win if any because the market is so competitive but yeah we hope to grow the pipeline and we don t announce shadow pipelines we really just talk about things under contract and we have long term relationships with the merchant builder community the deals we win there s no broker involved it s just us doing business with partners we ve done business with for decades so i think that s a distinct advantage and it is very competitive we do have to bid very record low cap rates but fortunately we re financing these transactions with record low interest rates kevin you want to talk about what sort of interest rates you re seeing these days kevin s miller chief financial officer yes sure i mean as we mentioned in the prepared remarks we have one deal in the pipeline locked in currently at 3 47 so less than 3 5 and there s a few more out there that we ve gotten our bids to lock in at even lower rates that we just can t announce yet so we ll be able to announce and i can say that they re going to be record low interest rates on 15 year loans jason rbc capital markets analyst got it thank you guys michael p landy president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from barry oxford of d a davidson please go ahead barry oxford d a davidson analyst great thanks mike could you give us a little more color behind the sale of the building that was empty and how you decided to sell it versus hey maybe i should wait and lease it up did you get kind of pricing that was close to that michael p landy president and chief executive officer yes so the buildings we ve sold have been a result of kellogg keebler changing their supply chain to bigger modern buildings and these buildings are not indicative of our portfolio at all they are small buildings we purchased for very low purchase price and we are selling them at good profits but i wouldn t extrapolate any of the economic returns from these sales as indicative of our portfolio because we re really pruning our portfolio and our portfolio average building age is about nine years average building size is about 200 000 square feet average land to building ratio is over 6 to 1 and the buildings we re selling are smaller buildings that we ve been selling consistently rich you want to talk to them about that any further richard p molke vice president of asset management no other than it s just not as much acreage and not as configurable as some of our other assets michael p landy president and chief executive officer and much older property barry oxford d a davidson analyst is that true mike of the current vacant building too michael p landy president and chief executive officer well the current value of vacant building is also unusual for our portfolio it s in an industrial park everything we own is a single tenant net leased industrial with a long term leased to investment grade tenant but that property is on an industrial park we ve owned for decades it used to be our one multi tenant asset other than the shopping center we own in somerset new jersey which is also an outlier in our portfolio but in monarch pennsylvania outside of pittsburgh a suburb of pittsburgh is this industrial park and the one tenant there in the titanium business their business is strong and growing and now they are our sole tenant and they re talking about taking some of the 80 000 square feet of vacancy so we do feel optimistic that our occupancy will go up and we ll fill some of that space it s just a question of if its 25 or more hopefully as their business will keep growing and they ll take all the excess space in that building but as gene mentioned on our last call and i will turn it over if he wants to talk about it further but as he mentioned on the last call the largest construction site in north america is five miles from our property it s the shell cracking plant going up it s a 7 billion investment it s going to come online in the next couple of years and so there should be strong demand for our real estate once that comes online gene do you want to add to this at all eugene w landy chairman of the board the only other thing i ll add is it is on the ohio river and it s on the navigable portion and i just think it s a wonderful property for the future and that s why i take a long term view of the initiative here s one empty building and the prospects for it long term are excellent and we don t intend to get rid of it we tend to grow with the areas as the cracker plant comes in it is going to be great to manage the space and riverfront properties barry oxford d a davidson analyst great thanks mike one last question switching gears a little bit how do you guys think about unsecured debt going forward michael p landy president and chief executive officer well like kevin mentioned we re locking in 15 year money in the low low threes fully amortizing as we grow and build up our unencumbered asset pool that quadrant of the capital markets will become more accessible for us but a company our size with long term relationships with the lifecos is very happy to go secured and amortizing debt and generate levered returns on equity in the low teens it s very favorable the current process but we are building up our unencumbered asset pool and as that grows we can start looking at the unsecured market kevin anything you want to add to that kevin s miller chief financial officer yes as i said out of the 115 properties that we own 55 of them are free and clear and unencumbered and as mike mentioned in the new acquisitions we get secured amortizing debt and as that amortizing debt amortizes out and it s paid off we leave it free and clear rather than refinancing it and then as i mentioned on the prepared remarks we just refinanced our line of credit with now we have the full capacity the full 225 million revolver available to us so that s a great liquidity tool that we have in our tool belt and then that s how we look at it and right now it s a floating rate debt that s right now in the low threes if we choose to use it barry oxford d a davidson analyst right thanks so much guys i ll yield the floor michael p landy president and chief executive officer okay thank you barry our next question comes from rob stevenson of janney please go ahead robert stevenson janney montgomery scott analyst good morning guys mike or rich can you talk about the cadence of the closings of the five acquisition pipeline properties you said that some of them will close this year fiscal year or next is this essentially one a quarter for the next five quarters is there a point in time where more of these are expected to close just trying to think about it for modeling purposes when we should be bringing these assets on to your balance sheet michael p landy president and chief executive officer yes i broke that down because i anticipated this question so our pipeline is 178 5 million and on a dollar basis you should expect approximately 10 of that to close in the second quarter of fiscal 20 another 7 in q3 approximately 27 in q4 so that totals to 44 of the pipeline closing in fiscal 20 and then the other 56 you should expect to close in the first two quarters of 2021 with 40 of the 178 5 million closing in q1 of 2021 and the remaining 16 in q2 of 2021 now all that s approximate and all that is subject to slippage but that s where it stands right now robert stevenson janney montgomery scott analyst all right perfect that s great the sonwil distribution in buffalo that you just leased is this an asset to now hold or given that it s not investment grade tenant and is income producing is this a disposition candidate how are you guys thinking about that asset now that there is a lease on it it is more desirable out there in the market michael p landy president and chief executive officer well like gene said we really don t like to sell anything we re looking to grow and looking long term having said that and that doesn t have a lot of lease term on it but having said that it s certainly a candidate for a disposition most of our assets are long term leases to investment grade tenants that s a short term lease to a non investment grade tenant so it would be a candidate we do get unsolicited offers to buy our properties all the time and as a company with going on 3 billion in enterprise value we re really not of the critical mass to be public that you need to be these days so we re looking to grow albeit qualitatively albeit slowly and methodically we ve seen new entrants to our space leapfrog out of nowhere to become multiples of our size and as a 52 year old company we know you don t get to be 52 years old growing at such a rate so we re looking to grow we re happy with our portfolio but we re going to continue at our own pace robert stevenson janney montgomery scott analyst okay and then putting together the bread crumbs i think that you were talking about earlier rich the property that you re selling for 4 million with the expiring lease that s the newington connecticut asset leased to kellogg richard p molke vice president of asset management correct okay and then one for kevin what was the nearly 800 000 of severance in the quarter kevin s miller chief financial officer yes so we made an announcement we had our general counsel who was here nearly 20 years and it s part of the agreement of her retirement to recognize her years of service that was just the agreed upon amount and mike prashad is now our new general counsel he s been working alongside our former general counsel for the last few years now so he s up for the task and has been doing a great job robert stevenson janney montgomery scott analyst okay so it wasn t an 800 000 pay day for susan and her retirement kevin s miller chief financial officer no its for the general counsel robert stevenson janney montgomery scott analyst okay thanks kevin s miller chief financial officer but i don t want susan to feel left out we certainly susan had a compensation recognizing her service as well operator our next question comes from craig kucera of b riley fbr please go ahead craig kucera b riley fbr analyst hey good morning guys i think last quarter you disclosed that your pipeline at that point in time was three fedex and one magna seating is the new addition to the pipeline another fedex or something else kevin s miller chief financial officer something else it s a japanese earthmoving manufacturer they re like the japanese caterpillar called komatsu a rated credit it s outside of the pittsburgh market and it s a good new addition to our tenant roster got it and i think last quarter the pipeline at that point in time was a little higher than a 6 2 or so is that still the case on where things stand today with this new addition michael p landy president and chief executive officer yeah the pipeline average cap rate over 13 4 years of lease term is just shy of 6 3 craig kucera b riley fbr analyst got it want to shift gears and talk about the balance sheet i m curious about the capital raise in this quarter particularly on the preferred front and subsequent to quarter end did that pick up because you re pleased with pricing or is that more a function of kind of alluding to this shadow pipeline that you re working on where you could really see an acceleration in acquisition volume michael p landy president and chief executive officer gene i ll let you handle that and then i ll chime in eugene w landy chairman of the board well we re very proud of our balance sheet we also believe it s very important that we think long term we are trying to build up of balance sheet that can withstand changes in the economy not be susceptible to increases in interest rates and we pay 6 125 for preferred and we could borrow money of 3 and that makes a difference of between 5 million and 10 million a year but we re very happy to do that because we re getting our portfolio being clear we have securities we can borrow against we are really trying to build up a very strong financial statement so that whatever happens over the next couple of years we re here for the long term and the long term view is excellent the country is growing 2 3 a year inflation is 2 3 a year our properties are relatively new we have 2 5 billion in assets what are they going to be worth 10 years from now you re really talking about large figures and i find it interesting people look at the 1 million 2 million change in one year and actually we are looking at much larger numbers and the preferred the decision on the preferred we realized cost us money short term but long term there s nothing longer as michael pointed out than a perpetual preferred and there is no cheaper capital than capital that you don t have to repay it s part of our capital stack and it s going to 10 years from now people are going to see that the balance sheet we ve built the properties we ve built have really produced a good return over a 10 year period michael p landy president and chief executive officer very good craig kucera b riley fbr analyst okay great and i guess just kind of dovetailing with that and your thoughts on utilizing that preferred i think from a leverage perspective historically you guys were closer to maybe 7 times ebitda and that s been drifting down closer to 6 times should we think of that as sort of how you re going to manage the balance sheet going forward or do you anticipate maybe levering up a bit in the future michael p landy president and chief executive officer well historically our net debt to ebitda has fluctuated between the high 5s in high 6s if it was in the low 7s it was just by virtue of closing a lot of assets in one lumpy period and not having the earnings come in yet the debt hits immediately but historically it s in the low 6s is a good average and i think right now it s 6 1 times and certainly gives us the capacity to lever up because is rich mentioned with occupancy being over 98 for so many years and lease terms going out over seven years and our debt maturities going out over 11 years i think 6 1 times net debt to ebitda is very low leverage craig kucera b riley fbr analyst okay great kevin s miller chief financial officer i d also like to just add one thing just about that net debt to ebitda number it s just a simple math equation you take your net debt divided by your ebitda but if you look at the components of our debt 90 of our debt is amortizing debt so there s no looming maturities with balloon payments so i think that s a big factor when you look at how that number could be maybe a little higher in our case and the other end of the equation our revenue 80 of our revenue is investment grade tenants and we have one of the longest we have a long lease term of 7 6 years our weighted average debt maturity is 11 5 years so i think if you look at the components of what makes up that ratio you could maybe you could feel that it could be a little higher maybe than some another type of company eugene w landy chairman of the board just one other thing we re increasing our free and clear properties our preferreds are getting to a point where we have the flexibility of calling them in the near future we are keeping a very flexible situation and we can take advantage of changes in interest rates and changes in the capital markets that could be very very positive for monmouth reit craig kucera b riley fbr analyst okay just one more from me just as it relates to the common atm you filed yesterday i appreciate the commentary that you re looking to opportunistically take advantage of where the market is but is there any thought or is that going to serve as any sort of a replacement for the drip which i think you raised about 15 5 million this quarter or is it really just to augment that and the drip will more or less continue as it is today and has been in the past michael p landy president and chief executive officer well it certainly enhances the flexibility and optionality to go to different arrows in our quiver so to speak we ve used the drip and sip for a long time it s worked for a long time as kevin mentioned participation was about 26 your number is correct we raised about 15 2 million over the quarter but having done a preferred atm since 2017 we saw how that s a more flexible mouse trap as far as accessing the capital markets the drip and sip the drip is quarterly the shareholder investment plan is in the middle of every month you can now access capital just in time as the pipeline deals come online and if the stock is favorable and the pipeline is growing you could time things more precisely so you re correct that if things are working with the pipeline timing and the stock price is more advantageous you ll see less money raised through the sip the drip we ll keep the drip the same but through the sip and use the atm instead but as i said at this time we don t plan to use the common atm extensively it s a new year we thought the preferred atm did so well it behooves us to have a common atm in our arsenal craig kucera b riley fbr analyst got it okay thanks michael p landy president and chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from michael mueller of jp morgan please go ahead michael mueller jp morgan analyst hi i was wondering can you talk a little bit about what you see is the early read on the 10 leases expiring in 2021 are there any known renewals or move outs at this point michael p landy president and chief executive officer currently there is no known move outs we ve been talking to a few of those tenants in the first part of that fiscal year but nothing definitive at this time michael mueller jp morgan analyst got it ok that was it thank you kevin s miller chief financial officer thank you just to add to mike s comments the 10 leases roll in 2021 1 2 million square feet that s 5 of our gla 3 5 of our base rent there is a slide in our slide deck slide 24 that shows our lease expirations and i believe the rents expiring next year are well below market the average is 4 61 per square foot rolling in 2021 so good prospects for positive renewal rates okay thank you michael p landy president and chief executive officer you re welcome operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to becky coleridge for

the export reliant economy at the heart of europe risks letting history repeat itself if it becomes a target in the u s president s trade war a decade after it ran afoul of washington with banking secrecy switzerland is in danger of being labeled a currency manipulator u s treasury officials put it back onto a shortlist for that designation last month citing its high capital account surplus and bilateral trade balance another barrage of foreign exchange interventions by the swiss national bank to limit the franc s gains could be all that s needed to qualify there s quite a big danger of switzerland with its high current account balance winding up in the cross hairs of u s politics and on donald trump s twitter feed in the medium term said adriel jost an economist at consultancy wellershoff partner with the franc one of the world s most traded currencies near a three year high against the euro snb officials might be tempted to act but the trump administration s push for the power to apply punitive tariffs on countries accused of manipulating currencies serves as a reminder of the potential consequences such an initiative could open a new front in trump s trade wars after only a brief lull marked by the signing of an initial agreement on commerce between the u s and china publicly at least swiss officials don t seem worried about being back on the watchlist they escaped in 2018 snb policy makers insist the u s understands switzerland s position and that may be true we never intend to weaken the swiss franc to get an advantage over other countries but rather we have to avoid that the swiss franc becomes too strong snb president thomas jordan said in an interview last month interventions are a key part of swiss monetary policy because too strong a currency will choke off growth the franc was little changed at 1 0716 per euro at 10 18 a m in zurich still there s plenty of precedent for the swiss to ponder international pressure forced the bern government to change the way multinational corporations were taxed just last year the european union threatened to cripple the swiss stock exchange as it sought to extract concessions in a political dispute most famously during the global financial crisis the u s led a crackdown on switzerland s policy of letting bank customers keep account details from tax authorities a decade later after more than 6 billion in fines paid by banks secrecy has been abolished for non residents as the u s president trains his sights on europe switzerland might make an appealing target the country of 8 5 million lacks the clout of the eu which it has refused to join it s big enough to make an example of to bully others but too insignificant to fight back while the u s is switzerland s biggest extra european destination for exports for the u s it accounts for less than 2 for its part the swiss government has said relations with the u s are excellent and that there are regular discussions of financial matters if the u s deems a country a currency manipulator under a 2015 law the u s must embark on talks if the problems aren t corrected the u s can impose foreign investment restrictions and seek redress through the international monetary fund but the fund has already said the snb s monetary policy is appropriate switzerland s exports of more than 40 billion a year might appeal as a target to the white house but the lion s share of those sales are pharmaceuticals including cancer drugs made by basel based roche holding and gene therapies by rival novartis punitive tariffs might not curb demand bern may lack trump cards but it does hold a joker the swiss represent the u s in iran the country s channeling of dialog between the two may have helped avert war at the start of this year trying to forecast trump s trade policy is probably a thankless task said peter rosenstreich head of market strategy at swissquote bank but switzerland may just be too small to make the splash that trump likes

yesterday newsday business examined the losers of last month s supreme court ruling that upheld statutory instrument si 33 of 2019 legislated in february 2019 by tatira zwinoira yesterday newsday business examined the losers of last month s supreme court ruling that upheld statutory instrument si 33 of 2019 legislated in february 2019 si 33 of 2019 allowed for the settlement of united states debts prior to its promulgation to be done as zwl at parity but considering how the local currency has been devaluing creditors have been left with massive losses however while the creditors are nursing their wounds debtors have been given relief in this instalment we look at the beneficiaries of the ruling government as explained yesterday government had a domestic debt of us 8 5 billion at the end of 2018 but the supreme court ruling allows government to settle such debt as zwl 8 5 billion a significantly lower amount when the exchange rate is applied this debt becomes us 480 million in real terms with government struggling with a debt overhang due to years of overspending treasury has been under pressure both locally and externally to deal with this debt to build investor confidence and access fresh lines of credit as such the supreme court ruling has allowed government to address its domestic debt something not lost on information permanent secretary ndavaningi mangwana there are winners and losers in this we cannot totally dismiss that but the court has spoken he told newsday business when pressed further he distanced government from the ruling saying the supreme court is another branch of the state this one to one is not coming from government it is coming from the courts government when it made its decision it said interbank to which the courts have said no it s one to one magwana said he was referring to how cabinet shortly after promulgation of si 33 of 2019 decided that government debt could be settled with its creditors at the interbank rate at the time of us 1 rtgs 2 50 in the previous article mangwana tried to downplay the benefits of the supreme court ruling saying that government was already renegotiating contracts with its creditors suggesting that it would not be total losses for its creditors however in his analysis of the supreme court ruling united kingdom based legal scholar alex magaisa said the ruling was a windfall for debtors whose debts were denominated in us dollars the ramifications of the government s decree si 33 of 2019 were felt across the economic landscape and predictably the drama was soon being played out before judges in the courts of law he said this is because debtors suddenly found the energy to pay up their debts by simply converting their us dollar denominated debts to rtgs dollar debts at the rate of one to one effectively profiting at the expense of their creditors state enterprises and parastatals in the auditor general s report on parastatals and state enterprises for 2018 concern was raised on how the entities continued to fall in arrears thereby remaining unaccountable in the report as at may 31 2019 103 out of 179 state enterprises and parastatals had submitted their financial statements for audit this is because state enterprises and parastatals have become a huge burden on government s finances as these entities have failed to account for state funds annually such poor governance saw the parastatals owing us 490 780 504 19 to the tax collector as at the end of 2018 but with the supreme court ruling this has translated to zwl 490 780 504 19 wiping out at least us 463 4 million in debt in real terms for these state entities apart from zimbabwe revenue authority zimra state enterprises and parastatals also have other creditors under treasury s debt management unit that have still not been disclosed the court decision affects both debtors and creditors given that parastatals have both debtors and creditors they are affected relative to the amount of credit or debt said state enterprises restructuring agency sera executive director edgar nyoni as it looks attractive in paying off their erstwhile us dollar denominated creditors in local zimdollar currency it is painful to them when they are paid by debtors in the same currency the public entity that had a huge creditors book relative to debtors book seems to benefit more property owners thanks to the supreme court ruling property owners have been accorded a chance to buy properties at very cheap prices so basically if a property owner owed us 5 000 to a property developer for a residential stand they now owe zwl 5 000 or us 279 as an example property owners may be affected especially where long term leases have been entered into and tenants are in default real estate institute of zimbabwe president alexander millin said this implies that if and when the arrears are eventually settled time value of money implies the property owner will receive less rental income in real terms he added properties sold in instalments could be affected particularly where the buyer has failed to honour the regular instalment payments this means that such transactions may be terminated or the seller will have to carry the loss as the arrears will be settled on the one to one basis winners and losers with all these winners and losers the question now remains who stands to benefit more from the supreme court ruling you decide
president donald trump s trade war is projected to reduce the average family s real income by 1 277 according to a new report from the congressional budget office cbo the cbo a nonpartisan congressional research arm projected that the tariffs imposed by the trump administration and retaliatory tariffs imposed by countries like china will reduce economic growth while increasing prices to consumers tariffs are expected to reduce the level of real gdp by roughly 0 5 percent and raise consumer prices by 0 5 percent in 2020 as a result tariffs are also projected to reduce average real household income by 1 277 in 2019 dollars in 2020 the report said the figure is more than double the 580 projection in last year s cbo report by comparison the median american household pays about 2 000 in federal income taxes meaning the trade war effectively amounts to a tax hike of more than 60 the report said the negative effects will diminish over time as companies adjust to market conditions but still projects the trade war to lower economic growth every year through 2030 if the tariffs stay in place the cbo explained that tariffs hurt the us economy in multiple ways contradicting trump s claim that trade wars are good and easy to win for one tariffs increase costs on consumer goods they also create uncertainty that leads some u s businesses to delay or forgo new investments or make costly adjustments to their supply chains and tariffs also result in retaliatory policies from trading partners reducing exports by american companies the report also added that the tariffs directly affect deficits and debt the report projected the federal budget deficit to increase to 1 trillion this year and will average 1 3 trillion per year through 2030 the federal debt is projected to grow from 81 of the gdp in 2020 to 98 of the gdp in 2030 and 180 of the gdp in 2050 and despite trump s claim that his policies have led to historic economic growth the cbo projects that the economy will grow by just 1 7 through 2030 trump had claimed that the economy would grow by 4 to 6 but growth has been barely over 2 in each of the last three quarters slower than during the final three years of the obama administration the cbo report is just the latest research showing the consequences to consumers from trump s trade war a 2019 new york federal reserve report showed that the costs of the tariffs were passed on entirely to consumers in the form of higher prices with no impact on foreign exporters a report by economists on the federal reserve board published in december further showed that the tariffs hurt the manufacturing industry that they were intended to protect the report found that the tariffs gave manufacturers a small boost but it was soon offset by larger drags from the effects of rising costs and retaliatory tariffs as a result manufacturing employment fell while prices to consumers continued to increase causing a recession in the manufacturing sector for much of last year the trade war has also hit the retail technology telecommunications and apparel industries many of the retaliatory tariffs imposed by china and other countries in response to trump s escalation also targeted farmers trump responded by announcing two farmer bailouts that were double the size of the 2009 auto bailout under former president barack obama the revenues raised by the tariffs imposed on china are nowhere near enough to cover the cost of the bailouts according to another report from the federal reserve bank of new york despite trump s attempt to throw taxpayer money at a problem of his own creation farm bankruptcies skyrocketed by 20 last year the biggest increase since the period following the 2007 08 economic crisis trump has argued that the pain of the trade wars is worth it because it creates negotiation leverage in trade talks with countries like china trump bragged about two historic victories after he signed a phase 1 deal with china and the us mexico canada agreement usmca trump s highly touted replacement for nafta the usmca is 90 percent identical to nafta noted the washington post s catherine rampell which trump called the worst trade deal ever made much of the rest largely cribs language from the trans pacific partnership an obama era deal trump tore up because it was a disaster and a rape of our country in trump s words the deal does include some protectionist elements for sectors like the us auto industry but the administration s own analysis found that these provisions may actually hurt auto companies by raising costs the phase 1 china deal rolled back some though not nearly all of the tariffs on china in exchange for chinese officials pledging to massively increase us agricultural imports but some farmer groups quickly criticized trump for making a deal based on a promise of one time purchase rather than long term relief president trump said that we re all going to need to go buy bigger tractors north dakota farmer justin sherlock told reuters i don t think many farmers are going to invest much money until we see that this is a done deal and a long term deal chinese officials have already suggested they won t make the purchases if market conditions change according to the post and soybean prices fell despite trump touting china s nonbinding promise to buy billions of dollars of soybeans estimates reported by bloomberg news suggest that the cost of the tariffs to consumers may wipe out what little benefit families got from the trump tax cuts which overwhelmingly flowed to the rich and to corporations gary hufbauer a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics predicted to the outlet that the annual cost to households could continue to increase despite trump s highly touted new trade deals for the average household it will be a net loss no doubt he said it will be painful
a quick google search will bring up dozens of articles proclaiming the passing of value investing mainstream articles are even touting that warren buffett himself has abandoned value principles the past 10 years hasn t been great for value investing strategies if you look at some of the top value funds performance does not include dividends data from yahoo finance all graphs and calculations are the author s own value funds like ive vtv and xsvm have all significantly under performed the s p 500 since january 2009 by 60 55 and 42 respectively even warren buffett s company brkb has trailed the s p 500 by 5 over this time frame just so you don t think i m cherry picking data here the following shows the returns of the above securities for all 1 year 2 year 3 year 4 year and 5 year periods since 2009 and compares those to the s p 500 it doesn t look good the returns for the three value funds all are quite dismal take ive for example there is no 5 year period since 2009 where it has outperformed or even equaled the s p 500 and scarcely a 3 or 4 year period to be found either this may be the worst of the bunch but it doesn t look that much better for the other value funds brkb picked up considerable steam in the second half of the decade leading to more periods of over performance but this is the clear exception to the rule this is a strong reversal from the decade prior 1999 2009 where brkb and our collection of value funds regularly outperformed the s p 500 xsvm ive and vtv all began in the 2000 s xsvm and vtv were too young to log any 5 year periods while xsvm was old enough to log only a few dozen 3 year periods making it s poor performance in that range potentially a result of a small sample size for the decade ending dec 31st 2008 we have outstanding performance by brkb against the s p 500 and still have it beat with most of our value funds values and baseline normalized to account for differing inception dates of the value funds what changed interest rates the cost of financing plummeted as the federal reserve and central banks around the world cut rates to 0 and kept them there for nearly a decade the federal funds rate puts a floor on interest rates in the us banking system lower rates are intended to induce more lending and the expansion of the money supply data from st louis fred the federal funds is the amount that banks can charge for overnight lending on excess reserves this rate is targeted by the federal open market committee fomc and acts as a floor on interest rates this is breaking down a bit in recent months as shown below when this rate rises key bond rates rise and when this rate falls bond rates fall this is incredibly important for value investing strategies for a number of reasons but i ll focus on four valuation models cost of capital yield starvation foreign central bank intervention interest rates and valuation models warren buffett famously uses a discounted future cash flow dfcf model for valuation this has become the preferred method for many modern value investors future cash flows are always uncertain but the analyst makes their best judgment then discounts those cash flows back to the present let s use a simplified example of a company where we look out 10 years and forecast 1 billion dollars next year and with future cash flows growing at 5 per year every year for the next 10 years we want to determine how much that is today so we calculate it as such the key is the interest rate we use if we assume a 5 interest rate then our nominal cash flow will be 12 59 billion but the discounted value or net present value of the future income streams will only be 10 billion the key here is that discount rate you can see in the table above that even through the discounted value remains constant because it s being discounted at the same rate we re assuming it will grow at so the values cancel the difference between the nominal cash flow and the discounted model increases with time the lower the interest rate goes the closer these values come to one another which makes the discounted value of the company look much more attractive what interest rate to use it s not obvious what the correct interest rate ought to be buffett recommends using the rate on the 10 year us treasury bond for valuation purposes the idea here being that 10 years is a reasonable horizon for a value investor and the 10 year treasury is a relatively low risk and highly liquid asset to own this makes it a reasonable proxy for opportunity costs with your investment notice however what this does to the valuation as the rates drop as shown in the graph above this makes companies with large cash flows in the future and hence very uncertain cash flows look much more attractive than they really ought to be to value investors cost of capital because the interest rates closely mirror the rates on loans companies that borrow money at low rate face a reduced cost of capital this has the effect of enabling companies to roll over their debt for cheap when in fact they ought to go out of business these companies are referred to as zombie companies and have become an increasingly worrying phenomenon in this low interest rate environment value investors likely won t be caught purchasing these companies but they do divert valuable resources away from the rest of the economy and bid up prices this has the effect of making it harder for good companies to invest and grow because the zombies which ought to be liquidated continue to receive funding yield starvation many institutional investors such as university endowments pension funds trusts insurance companies and the like rely on safe and steady interest payments to continue to grow their holdings so they can meet future obligations low interest rates force these institutions to look elsewhere for the yield they desperately need for the past few years we have seen more and more of these companies move into riskier assets such as stocks and even engage in venture capital investments this has pushed hundreds of billions of dollars out of bonds into stocks which has pushed up the price of just about everything combined with the factors above the riskier and sexier growth companies wind up reaping far more in than they would in times of normal interest rates which inflates their prices and thus their performance relative to value investments foreign central bank intervention if you think that it has just been the federal reserve that has been manipulating interest rates and pushing investors out on the risk curve think again foreign central banks have been just as bad as the fed if not worse in many respects moreover many banks have explicitly begun using their funds to purchase shares in the us stock market many reports list the swiss national bank snb and the bank of japan boj as the biggest participants in this scheme in order to keep the value of their local currencies down in a misguided attempt at neo mercantialism the snb for example has taken to printing swiss francs en masse and purchasing us dollars euros and other foreign currencies once it has the us dollars it needs somewhere to put them and has been purchasing us tech stocks in essence the bank is printing swiss francs and using that newly printed money to buy us companies the price inflation implications of the bank s actions should be obvious the return of value investing everything i ve stated so far shows that value investing strategies have drastically under performed a simple market benchmark all strategies go through periods where they cease to work as effectively as they have in the past but time shows that they soon rebound this low interest rate environment has created the divergence between value and price over the past decade it is critical to understand that the continuation of current debt money creation and low rates is simply unsustainable debt can t be rolled over forever pension funds and endowments won t hit on every startup and have to liquidate other positions to meet their obligations recessions in asia europe north america and elsewhere will come to pass forcing central banks to pull out of the us market markets for bonds from highly indebted countries will begin to dry forcing rates higher all of these contributing factors will suck the air out of the sky high prices in the us market further we know from austrian business cycle theory that artificially low interest rates set in motion an unsustainable boom that will be followed by an eventual bust if allowed to clear the market of zombie companies and other financial aberrations the ensuing recession will be painful but set the economy on a firmer path for renewed and strengthened growth when this occurs investing based on sound fundamental principles will resume its importance and its performance for the careful investor already we re seeing signs of weakness and financial difficulties on the horizon it s only a matter of time before it hits

with that let me turn the call back over to chris chris leahy chief executive officer thanks brittany 2019 was a year of both excellent financial performance and progress against our three part strategy for growth once again we delivered record quarterly results and both strong sales growth and profitability in the fourth quarter net sales were up 11 3 on both a reported and constant currency basis to 4 5 billion gross profit increased 12 1 to 778 million non gaap operating income increased 14 3 to 342 million and non gaap net income per share was 1 57 increasing 18 4 on both a reported and constant currency basis for the year net sales were 18 billion up almost 1 8 billion year over year or 11 on a reported basis and 11 5 in constant currency gross profit increased by 12 3 to 3 billion non gaap operating income increased 12 5 to 1 4 billion and non gaap net income per share increased 18 to 6 10 on a constant currency basis non gaap net income per share increased by 18 5 our excellent performance reflects the combined power of our balanced portfolio of customer end markets our full suite of solutions and services that address customer priorities across the it landscape and our ongoing success executing our three part strategy for growth i ll walk you through each of these and how they contributed first the balance across our customer end markets as you know we have five u s sales channels corporate small business government education and healthcare each of these channels is meaningful businesses generating annual sales of more than 1 5 billion this scale enables us to further align sales teams into vertical customer end markets including the federal government state and local government k 12 and higher education in addition we have our u k and canadian operations which together delivered over 2 billion of net sales in 2019 these unique sales organizations serve us well when end markets behave differently from each other sometimes that occurs because markets are disrupted by macro or external challenges sometimes it occurs when customer behaviors differ due to different priorities in 2019 the teams did an outstanding job helping customers address their it priorities and achieve their strategic objectives delivering exceptional results i am really proud of our team s accomplishments our 2019 double digit sales increase was driven by excellent results with strong underlying performance as well as some incremental drivers the u s and u k both increased by almost 11 in local currency our competitive advantages drove outsized growth in a market that played to our strength our scale scope and robust distribution capabilities helped minimize the impact of tariffs and supply constraints and helped us gain market share our device as a service solution to the u s census bureau also contributed to our excellent net sales growth the success of the census depends on everyone s participation and that is what our mobile solution is enabling confirming addresses in 2019 and this year collecting census data from households that do not respond otherwise the census project will be completed at the end of 2020 collin will talk more about the expected impact of the census on our financials and lastly the acquisition of scalar recall scalar brought capabilities in security cloud infrastructure and digital transformation to our canadian business bolstering past solutions investments those investments also paid off last year delivering double digit organic gross profit growth i m excited to share that both scalar and aptris are now operating in the market as cdw we are one company one cdw leveraging our integrated capabilities to deliver a seamless experience to customers in short 2019 was a terrific year turning to the fourth quarter you also see the benefit of our diverse customer end markets so let s take a deeper dive in corporate the team delivered 7 growth with balanced transactional and solutions growth as they successfully addressed ongoing customer demand for client devices while driving solid solution results in particular double digit growth in servers and enterprise storage hardware the small business team delivered nearly 8 growth driven by client device strength both channels lapped double digit growth rates customer activity and purchasing remain strong as corporate and small business customers continue to move ahead with technology investments highlighting the importance of technology to achieve business goals the government team increased sales by over 20 federal had another excellent quarter with sales up over 20 driven by very healthy client device performance as the team helped civilian departments move to win 10 the state and the local team delivered high teens growth driven by double digit solutions results the team continued to leverage expanded contracts helping customers secure their environment and modernize their infrastructure with strong growth in enterprise storage and server hardware education increased 1 with low single digit growth in higher ed and flat k 12 results higher ed continued to leverage our sector expertise and broad portfolio to help campuses enhance student and teacher experiences through client device upgrades and collaboration tools for k 12 strengthened net comm hardware and desktops was offset by a decline in notebook due to chromebook performance the healthcare team delivered excellent performance up almost 14 with double digit growth in client devices as well as enterprise storage hardware and software healthcare demand continued to be driven by infrastructure refresh and a heightened focus on patient experience and clinical mobility other which represents our u k and canadian operations increased 27 on a reported basis the u k team delivered excellent double digit growth in local currency the team continued to help customers transform their infrastructures and gain efficiencies which drove double digit solution growth canadian growth was driven by scalar integration is nearing completion and we are providing expanded portfolio options to both legacy customers in canada and scalar customers so as you can see our results demonstrate the power of our balanced portfolio of customer end markets our results also demonstrate the power of our second driver of performance the breadth of our portfolio with over 100 000 products services and solutions for more than 1 000 vendor partners we are well positioned to meet our customers total needs across the it spectrum for the quarter u s transactions increased low double digits led by 16 growth in client devices u s solutions increased mid single digits sales performance was balanced with u s hardware and software increasing high single digits and services increasing 15 let s take a deeper look hardware increased 9 fueled by double digit growth in client devices and datacenter hardware client device growth was broad based and driven by continued customer refresh and market gains for datacenter hardware we saw customers move forward with larger projects driving the strong growth as we ve discussed before our solutions business can be lumpy with the variability driven by the timing of when projects come to fruition and also the mix of hardware and software in the solution customers continue to be focused on optimizing their datacenter infrastructure with economical yet high performing solutions they are leveraging on premise and off premise solutions as well as software based technologies that create efficiencies total software grew 8 with strong double digit growth in storage management operating system software and network management we continue to work closely with our customers to maximize the return on their it investment whether it be hardware software or services which leads me to our services category services strong growth was led by configurations and professional services our services business had a tremendous 2019 with high teens growth reflecting our services led go to market approach cloud also contributed to this quarter s results with double digit increases in customer spend and gross profit growth was driven by productivity security and collaboration as well as public cloud infrastructure as a service as you can see we had an excellent well balanced performance in the quarter and we were able to help our customers across a broad spectrum of it needs that leads me to the final driver of our performance the impact of investments we are making in our three part strategy for growth investments made to ensure we continue to serve our customers it needs in this evolving market whether in a physical a virtual or cloud based environment in the u s or internationally our three part strategy for growth is to first acquire new customers and capture share second enhance our solutions capabilities and third expand our services capabilities importantly these three pillars work in tandem each is crucial to our ability to profitably assess design deliver and manage the integrated technology solutions our customers want and need today and in the future these pillars help us stay in front of our customers emerging and ongoing priorities let me share a couple of examples of our strategy in action last october one of our customers a medical technology company with over 1 million patients had a cyber attack the attacker locked the company s on premise datacenters and public cloud access and proliferated through its entire it environment a few months prior members of cdw sales and technical teams had presented to the company on cdw s approach to information and network security historically this customer had primarily purchased transactional products from us but not fully leveraging our solutions and services capabilities the company s it director called cdw to utilize our expertise in this critical situation due to our team s presentation cdw s security incident response team was engaged and immediately helped to assess in light of the attack it was crucial to maintain patient safety and protect sensitive information ultimately in the coming days and weeks cdw helped to assess contain and remediate the attack then we advised and installed security technology to ward off future attacks and rebuild customers datacenter infrastructure to get the business operations running again with enhanced security cdw had a well orchestrated response providing deep technical knowledge and services in addition to our full suite of product capabilities this is not a unique example in today s environment a cyber attack is a question of when not if security is a top priority for our customers we have made investments in this capability from a coworker and vendor partner perspective to provide the right services and solutions to increase our customers readiness and protection from future attacks another important it priority that cdw is helping customers address is the upgrade of it infrastructure to utilize the internet of things and data analytics customers are pursuing these investments to increase automation improve safety and efficiency manage quality control and drive growth and higher profits one of our manufacturing customers has positioned itself at the forefront of advanced manufacturing in recent years by upgrading its it infrastructure to enable the internet of things technology and enhancing automation throughout its plans several years ago the customer began modernizing all 47 of its manufacturing plants in north america at the start of the customer s modernization journey the executive director of it turned to cdw as its trusted strategic it partner given our past track record successfully completing turnkey projects to take advantage of the data it wanted to collect cdw developed and deployed solutions to upgrade the customer s centralized it capabilities and infrastructure as well as each plant s network infrastructure in each plant cdw designed and deployed high speed state of the art secured network with redundancy and plenty of bandwidth and scalability to serve as the foundation for the customers advanced manufacturing push on top of the secure and reliable high speed network that cdw created the customer deployed scales sensors and robots modernizing its manufacturing and operating processes the customer is now reaping the benefits of its upgraded it capabilities including automating tasks which significantly reduce costs making more informed business decisions at a quicker pace based on the new data and lastly improving security due to the protocols and protections put in place supporting the customer s focus on safety cdw is an integral partner for each step of this initiative and we continue to work on other projects to support our customers goals these examples highlight cdw s three part strategy for growth including how well cdw is positioned for important it trends and how it is crucial to achieving our customers objectives cdw has a proven track record of evolving with it trends these examples also underscore the importance of one of cdw s competitive advantages our coworkers they get it and make meeting and exceeding the needs of our customers their top priority we continue to invest thoughtfully in customer facing coworkers and ended the year up 223 excluding scalar and aptris as our services business has grown the composition of customer facing coworkers has changed to a mix of demand generating coworkers and service delivery coworkers additionally other factors such as leveraging third parties for service delivery have made this metric less meaningful therefore going forward we plan to share stats on our customer facing coworkers periodically rather than quarterly know that we will continue to invest prudently in coworkers and as always adjust our hiring plans based on market conditions and that leads me to our expectations for 2020 financial performance in 2020 we currently expect the u s it market to grow between 2 5 to 3 which is below 2019 u s it market growth reflecting a lower 2020 gdp growth forecast we expect our top line to grow faster than the u s it market slightly above our 200 to 300 bps range in constant currency the census project is expected to partially offset moderating client device growth in 2020 which drives our expectations slightly above our target range for 2020 we expect non gaap earnings per share growth of approximately 10 on a constant currency basis we will of course continue to keep a watchful eye on the macro environment including wildcards like supply constraints the u k eu trade deal tariffs coronavirus and the u s presidential election in the meantime the team will continue to do what they do best out execute the competition and leverage our competitive advantages to help our customers address their it priorities and achieve their strategic objectives i hope you can tell from my comments that 2019 s outstanding performance reinforced our confidence that we have the right strategy in place we want to continue to evolve with the market continue to capitalize on technology trends and continue to invest in fast growing areas of the business we do this by performing a rigorous detailed strategic plan every three years and executing against it we recently kicked off the planning process for our next cycle also we recently made two important leadership announcements chris corley named chief commercial and operating officer and the addition of sona chawla in the newly formed role of chief growth and innovation officer chris is known for her strong sales and operating leadership cultivating talent delivering for our customers and delivering results sona joins cdw with a track record of success shaping omnichannel sales operations building e commerce businesses developing digital platforms and driving innovation they will work with cdw s outstanding executive committee and teams across the organization to enhance our competitive advantages and to continue to drive differentiated performance generating superior returns and serving our stakeholders now let me turn it over to collin to share more details on the financial performance collin kebo chief financial officer thank you chris good morning everyone as chris indicated our fourth quarter and full year results reflect the combined power of our balanced portfolio of channels broad product offerings and ongoing execution of our three part strategy they also reflect successful investments in our business that builds on our long term financial strategy to drive strong cash flow deliver sustained profitable growth and return cash to shareholders turning to our fourth quarter p l on slide 8 consolidated net sales were 4 5 billion up 11 3 on a reported and an average daily sales basis the currency was neutral in the quarter on an average daily sales basis sequential sales decreased 6 1 versus the third quarter of 2019 as expected the sequential average daily sales decline was greater than historical seasonality given the strength in the third quarter but better than expected driven by one strong client device growth in four of five u s channels as we continue to leverage our competitive advantages to gain market share and help customers refresh their devices and two over 20 local currency year over year growth in the u k where we saw solutions projects come to fruition gross profit for the quarter was 778 million an increase of 12 1 gross margin was 17 1 up 10 basis points over last year driven by product margin partially offset by netted down revenue streams not growing as fast as net sales turning to sg a on slide 9 our non gaap sg a including advertising increased 10 4 the increase was primarily driven by sales compensation which moves in line with gross profit growth coworker count of 9 896 was up over 870 coworkers from december 2018 with roughly 50 of the increase from our 2019 acquisitions and the remaining from organic coworker investments gaap operating income was 284 million up 16 8 our non gaap operating income which better reflects operating performance was 342 million an increase of 14 3 non gaap operating income margin was 7 5 moving to slide 10 interest expense was 38 million up 3 2 the increase was primarily due to paying a rate on the term loan in 2019 that exceeded the capped rate in 2018 our gaap effective tax rate shown on slide 11 was 21 4 in the quarter down 150 basis points compared to last year this resulted in fourth quarter tax expense 50 million to get to our non gaap effective tax rate we adjust taxes consistent with non gaap net income add backs including excess tax benefits associated with equity based compensation which is shown on slide 12 for the quarter our non gaap effective tax rate was 23 7 flat with last year s rate our full year 2019 tax rate was favorably impacted by a benefit from research and development tax credits as you can see on slide 13 with fourth quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 146 million gaap net income per share was 1 27 up 21 our non gaap net income was 229 million in the quarter up 14 2 over last year non gaap net income per share was 1 57 up 18 4 from last year turning to full year results on slides 14 through 19 revenue was 18 billion an increase of 11 on a reported and an average daily sales basis on a constant currency basis consolidated net sales were 11 5 higher than the prior year as chris mentioned 2019 was a terrific year reflecting great execution against the right strategy and our balanced portfolio additionally 2019 net sales growth benefited from several extra drivers one the scalar acquisition which contributed just over 100 basis points two our device as a service solution for the u s census which contributed approximately 60 basis points and three a backlog flush in certain categories such as net comm you will recall that lead times extended in 2018 and then returned to more normal levels in 2019 creating a onetime positive flush collectively these three items contributed approximately 250 basis points of net sales growth in 2019 while difficult to quantify we believe our competitive advantages of scale and distribution centers helped us navigate chip shortages and gain additional share in client devices gross profit was 3 billion up 12 3 and gross profit margin was 16 9 up approximately 20 basis points due to product margin and an increase in the mix of netted down revenue streams partially offset by year over year net sales growth outpacing the year over year growth in partner funding gaap operating income was 1 1 billion up 14 8 our non gaap operating income was 1 4 billion for the year up 12 5 non gaap operating income margin was 7 6 net income was 737 million and non gaap net income was 902 million up 13 6 non gaap net income per share was 6 10 up 18 turning to the balance sheet on slide 20 on december 31 cash and cash equivalents were 154 million and net debt was 3 2 billion our cash plus revolver availability was 1 3 billion as shown on slide 21 we maintained strong rolling three month working capital metrics during the quarter our three month average cash conversion cycle was 18 days down one day from last year s fourth quarter full year free cash flow was 789 million which is 4 4 of net sales and slightly above the high end of our free cash flow rule of thumb of 3 75 to 4 25 of net sales the 37 million year over year increase in free cash flow primarily reflects higher cash profit partially offset by higher inventory 2019 capital expenditures totaled 236 million or 1 3 of net sales this higher level reflects capex for the 2020 phase of the census device as a service offering which i ll discuss in more detail at a moment as expected we returned more than 100 of free cash flow to shareholders in 2019 we deployed 840 million of cash to shareholders which included 183 million of dividends and 657 million of share repurchases at an average price of approximately 108 per share turning to capital allocation priorities on slide 22 our priorities remain the same from the previous quarter and continue to reflect our intent to drive shareholder value through returns of capital and strategic investments in order of priority first increase dividends annually to guide these increases we will target the annualized fourth quarter dividend at approximately 25 of non gaap net income and grow in line with earnings going forward second ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio in the range of 2 5 to 3 times we ended the quarter at 2 2 times slightly below the low end of this range our third capital allocation priority is to supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions our acquisitions of scalar and aptris are great examples of this and fourth return excess cash after dividends and m a to shareholders through share repurchases at the end of december we had 679 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization given the current leverage we expect to once again return more than 100 of free cash flow to shareholders in 2020 our capital allocation priorities support our 2020 targets which you ll see on slide 23 before i review our annual targets let me first provide some comments on the device as a service solution for the united states census bureau as you ve heard us discuss the rollout consists of two phases the address canvassing phase which was completed in 2019 and contributed approximately 60 basis points to 2019 growth the majority of which was recognized in the third quarter in the 2020 phase or the census collection phase hundreds of thousands of smartphones and tablets are being deployed into the field to take the census we currently expect the 2020 phase to contribute approximately 110 basis points of incremental net sales growth in 2020 as a reminder cdw is the lessor for the census device as a service offering therefore we will recognize lease revenue over the period that devices are used in the field depreciation from the capex most of which was spent in the fourth quarter of 2019 will be matched to the lease revenue as chris mentioned the census project will be completed at the end of this year to summarize the census really showcases how cdw helps customers achieve their objectives by leveraging cdw s differentiated capabilities integrated solutions from multiple vendor partners professional and configuration services logistics and distribution capabilities all delivered as a service turning to our 2020 targets we expect u s it market growth of 2 5 to 3 this modest deceleration compared to 2019 reflects lower gdp forecasts strong client device comparisons and moving past some end of support dates we expect cdw net sales growth slightly above the high end of the 200 to 300 basis point range of our u s it market growth the incremental contribution from the census helps us overlap 2019 s strong outperformance including some of the extra drivers i previously mentioned currency is expected to be neutral assuming foreign exchange rates of 1 28 to the british pound and 0 75 to the canadian dollar we expect non gaap operating income margin to be in the mid 7 range and non gaap earnings per share growth to be approximately 10 on both a reported and constant currency basis please remember that we hold ourselves accountable for delivering financial targets on an annual constant currency basis slide 24 provides additional modeling thoughts for full year 2020 we expect net sales in the first half of the year to be in line with our historical norm of 48 to 49 of full year net sales keep in mind that the normal rhythm of our business is for first quarter net sales to typically be the lowest dollar amount and sequentially below our fourth quarter over the past five years on an average daily sales basis the q4 to q1 sequential decline has averaged down approximately 7 we expect this year s first quarter sequential decline to be generally in line with historical seasonality moving down the p l non gaap operating income margin is expected to be in the mid 7 range total annual depreciation and amortization are expected to be in the range of 390 million to 400 million this includes approximately 160 million of amortization expense for acquisition related intangible assets and approximately 145 million of cost of goods sold depreciation depreciation and amortization expense and sg a excluding the amortization of acquisition related intangibles is expected to be around 90 million equity based compensation is expected to be several million dollars higher than in 2019 interest expense is expected to be in the range of 156 million to 158 million with the year over year decrease driven by expected lower short term interest rates our 2020 non gaap effective tax rate is anticipated to be in the range of 25 5 to 26 5 we expect share repurchases to drive non gaap earnings per share growth 200 to 300 basis points faster than non gaap net income growth currency is expected to be neutral for the full year to non gaap earnings per share growth we expect constant currency non gaap earnings per share growth in the first half of the year to be higher than our full year constant currency target as we have one additional selling day and more incremental contribution from the census project in the fourth quarter we will have one fewer selling day and the contribution from the census winds down one selling day difference impacts quarterly profit growth by approximately 200 basis points additional modeling thoughts on the components of cash flow can be found on slide 25 our free cash flow rule of thumb remains unchanged at 3 75 to 4 25 of net sales we expect capital expenditures to be roughly 0 7 of net sales slightly above the normal half a point of sales primarily reflecting gross capital investments related to our downtown chicago office move to be clear this slight increase does not change our free cash flow rule of thumb we expect the cash tax rate to be in the range of 25 25 to 26 25 of pre tax income adjusted for amortization of acquisition related intangibles we expect to deliver a cash conversion cycle within the annual target range of high teens to low 20s that concludes the financial summary with that i ll ask shannon to open it up for questions thank you operator our first question comes from matt cabral with credit suisse your line is open matt cabral credit suisse analyst thank you just starting off on the downtick in the wider it spending environment that you talked about just wondering if you could touch on just what you re hearing in terms of customer budget plans heading into 2020 and what s driving your expectation for a return to a more normalized two to three points of share gain this year chris leahy chief executive officer good morning matt this is chris customers have returned the corner in 2019 customers were clear that it continues to be a priority so we saw some good momentum and they re buying and in our business they re continuing to hire they re continuing to focus on investing in it so that felt good coming out of the year the downtick is based on what we see in front of us we ve got gdp forecasts that have come down we ve got uncertainties out there i tick through those wildcards in our prepared remarks and so when we take a look at what s out there that s how we think about it we also frankly from an it growth perspective take a look at a wide variety of data both internal data that are proprietary as well as external factors and try to land on a solid expectation for the upcoming year in terms of our premium you know us we re always going to be focused on outgrowing the market by that 200 to 300 basis points but we re confident this year in guiding slightly above that 300 because we feel good that the census work that we re doing will contribute and will offset some of the client moderating growth that we expect to see matt cabral credit suisse analyst got it and then on that point about client growth monitoring yes pc is definitely top of mind given crosscurrents around win 7 and the cpu shortages can you just talk a little bit more about what you ve baked into your current plans for pcs in 2020 and just how we should think about the cadence of that through the year chris leahy chief executive officer well as we anticipated last year we expected client device to grow but at a moderated rate because we ve got a couple of years of strong strong growth from refresh the end of service that s already happened now in january and our expectation was that we see some growth in the first half of the year because based on past experience when there s the end of service you still get some flow through into the quarter or a little bit beyond there are more wildcards out there right now you look at coronavirus for example and it s too early to tell how that s going to impact but that could impact the supply chain and add to some delays we are still looking at intel shortages of course we leverage our competitive advantages to take inventory but there are a couple more factors now that we weren t looking at 6 months ago that makes it more difficult to understand where those client purchases will be taking place throughout the course of the year matt cabral credit suisse analyst thank you questions answers operator thank you our next question comes from amit daryanani with evercore your line is open amit daryanani evercore isi analyst thanks a lot two questions from me as well i guess maybe to start with the 2020 guide chris could you just help clarify you re basically saying it s it spend at 2 5 to 3 plus share gains of 200 to 300 basis points and then plus 200 million of revenues from census bureau is that the right way to think about your 2020 guide and then just on the census bureau contribution is it going to be fairly linear through calendar 20 or is it going to be more h1 heavy given the way that s going to ramp up chris leahy chief executive officer yes amit let me back up and get that right so we re looking at two components 2 5 to 3 is what we expect the u s it market rate of growth to be and we re saying that our typical target of premium above that 200 to 300 basis points you should expect us to come in slightly higher than that 300 basis points as a premium over it is not a premium plus additional bps does that make sense amit daryanani evercore isi analyst that makes perfect sense chris leahy chief executive officer ok and in terms of the sequencing i ll let collin give you the details collin kebo chief financial officer yes amit we would expect more contribution from the census in let s say the first half or first three quarters of the year as i said in my prepared comments we expect it to wind down by the time we get to the fourth quarter amit daryanani evercore isi analyst got it and then i guess just calling as a follow up your net leverage target at least based on the math we re doing will be well under 2x by the end of the year as you know there are no deals done you maintain the buyback dividends that we ve talked about if that s really the case are you comfortable with leverage going under two times or should we start thinking about 2020 being a year where perhaps buybacks will be more larger to get you back in the 2 5 to 3 times target range collin kebo chief financial officer yes amit so we ended the year at 2 2 times in my prepared comments i did say that we again intend to return more than 100 of free cash flow to shareholders obviously we re mindful that we re sub the 2 5 to 3 times target operator thank you our next question comes from adam tindle with raymond james your line is open adam tindle raymond james analyst ok thanks and good morning chris i just want to revisit the goal to expand the capabilities that you talked about on the slides i think the leverage math would suggest that you have about 2 billion in liquidity to still stay within your leverage target and probably even more if you want to temporarily sit above it as you have in the past i know you ve done some smaller tuck ins but just first question would be wondering if you would consider something more elephant sized to borrow above the term and what would be the key items you look for in that potential asset chris leahy chief executive officer yeah and thanks for the question elephant size i don t know how big that means but i would say this look you know that we are actively looking for potential companies that can supplement our solutions and services capabilities and we re looking at different kinds of organizations small tuck ins frankly can be more simple to do and very easy to gain traction quickly larger organizations we need to think about a lot of factors including the ease of integration and the way that we can operationally bring onboard a large organization do you know the filters that we look at is it a strategic fit for our customers that s first and foremost is it going to create more relevance to our customers we don t get that through that filter we don t get even further than that operational alignment is the second one and then obviously cultural fit and financial return i will tell you on cultural fit when i think about kelway several years ago and scalar and aptris the cultural fit in those firms have been really terrific and i think that s been a very large portion of why we ve been successful the teams have done a great job integrating and becoming cdw one company and going to market as a seamless team to our customers who have really appreciated that and that actually speeds the ability to leverage our solutions capabilities across all of the organization in terms of a larger company if we find one that makes sense and ticks through all those levers we absolutely would take a look adam tindle raymond james analyst ok that s helpful and just as a quick follow up collin thanks for all the model commentary i just wanted to ask you talked about q1 revenue expecting to be down about 7 sequentially per day i think that s maybe a little over 5 sequentially as reported the question is historically eps it s a little bit imperfect but i think generally down somewhere around two times that revenue decline on a sequential basis correct me if i m off here but given your investment plans and timing would this normal seasonality that you re talking about on revenue also apply to eps in q1 whereas reported would be down maybe just over 10 sequentially collin kebo chief financial officer adam i don t normally think of sequential eps quarter to quarter what i did say though in my prepared comments is that we do expect the first half of the year eps to be stronger than the full year some of that is due to census timing and some of that is due to the extra day we have in the first quarter adam tindle raymond james analyst ok that s helpful thank you operatorthank you our next question comes from ruplu bhattacharya with bank of america your line is open ruplu bhattacharya bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi and thanks for taking my questions congrats on the quarter and on the guide collin the guide for full year operating margin at mid sevens i mean that s actually pretty strong i mean your margins have been better than many of your competitors just wondering i mean we assumed you re going to see a mixed shift between client devices versus more of cloud solutions and netted down items so can you talk about what are some of the things that can drive that a little bit higher than mid 7s what do you need to see to get the operating margin a little bit higher collin kebo chief financial officer thanks for the question ruplu yes there are a lot of things that impact our operating margins starting at the gross margin there s the mix of items that we sell which you re referencing there are commoditization headwinds end market mix so there are a whole series of mixes that move in and out as we mix into solutions that does put upward pressure on our gross margin but we do have a higher cost to serve associated with solutions so the flow through to the operating margin might not be as great or i think the operating margin might be closer in line to the transactional side of the business i think the big wild card here is how strong hardware is as we go forward this narrative that our margins are going to float up over time has been out there for several years i think a lot of that we ve had an assumption that hardware growth was going to slow down and not be as robust and clearly we ve been through a pretty heavy cycle here of three years where that hasn t been the case and you haven t seen as much upward movement on the operating margin as you might expect notwithstanding all the success we ve had in cloud and solutions and netted down items so i think if we were to go through an extended period of time multiple quarters or years where we saw that play out i think we would revisit at that point in time at our analyst day a few years ago we took our margin target up a little bit as a result of that trend but again i think we d want to see more sustainability of the strength of the netted down items relative to where hardware is ruplu bhattacharya bank of america merrill lynch analyst yes that makes sense for my follow up i just wanted to touch on the education end market you ve seen some strong growth in the higher ed segment but maybe a little bit slower on the k 12 so any thoughts on how that segment trends in 2020 chris leahy chief executive officer yes it s chris on education we re just under a little pressure right now we ve seen asps declining a bit also the chromebook space has been the one that has been most constrained when it came to supplying opportunities and supply availability this past year and availability simply if it was out there we could get it so we do expect to continue to see into 2020 those same pressures on the business the other thing that s happened is google s extension of its auto update expiration which is simply the equivalent of an end of service they ve extended it a year so that alleviated what i ll call the urgency of customers to refresh and upgrade but that will be an opportunity when the year expires next year but look k 12 we still consider being a growth area for us and the teams are really focused on specific solutions that they can bundle and bring to those customers that have to do with things like modern classrooms that are more collaborative and learning environments that are modular etc so we feel good about k 12 in the long term ruplu bhattacharya bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok thanks for all the details operator thank you our next question comes from matt sheerin with stifel your line is open matt sheerin stifel financial corp analyst yes thank you and good morning a question regarding the strength that you saw in the u k i think you said that was up 20 year on year is that related at all to the brexit transition and post that close are you seeing any impact either positively or negatively chris leahy chief executive officer matt yes thanks for the question the answer is no we haven t seen a lot of change over the last couple of years in client behavior as a result of brexit and the uncertainty surrounding that we ve tried to comment on that regularly with you i think that s just great execution and performance by the team and a number of solution projects coming to fruition we also have as you recall a netherlands entity and so customers are comfortable using that in their regular course of business when i look at the u k business the nice thing is the balance that we ve seen in growth in both their u k local business as well as the referral business meaning u s to u k business and also collectively u k and u s customers doing business outside of those regions so call it widely international all of that is on a good growth trajectory and we re really excited to see that because that reflects the power of the thesis going into the combination and it s working matt sheerin stifel financial corp analyst ok then relative to the expectations on hardware we certainly get the headwinds that you re going to see in terms of the pc refresh cycle but looking at the solution side of the enterprise class hardware networking storage servers you had some strength you talked about networking for some of those reasons but what should we be expecting there in terms of your outlook for the enterprise class products chris leahy chief executive officer yes i think of it this way as i said customers are still prioritizing it investments and they have different priorities sometimes it s client sometimes it s the datacenter depending on where they re focused in their business and what they re trying to accomplish looking forward we expect to see the benefit of that investment and the key thing is that when it comes to these solutions projects they are lumpy and i keep saying we re going to find another word but that really is the best word i mean if you think about 2019 we had some lumpiness throughout the quarters and we just saw a number of deals come to fruition and you saw a nice healthy q4 you got to expect that going forward just because of the timing and also the mix which is a big part of that whether it s hardware software services the more software component the more muted the top line so again customers are focused on using technology to drive strategic outcomes in their business and they re focused on securely running their utility it and we ve got the full portfolio to help them do that matt sheerin stifel financial corp analyst ok thank you operator thank you our next question comes from shannon cross with cross research your line is open shannon cross cross asset research analyst thank you very much for taking my question i just have one chris can you talk a bit about what drove you to put a chief growth and innovation officer in place how you re sort of thinking about that position so work with others within your executive team at this point i m just kind of curious as to what created that role chris leahy chief executive officer yes no sure thanks very much for the question well i ll start with a simple reason when we think about forward looking we re really focused on scaling sustainable growth so this is about focus for growth and in particular when we think about our customers our partners and products and the channels and platforms that we use to sell and the technology and digital capabilities that underpin those the connective tissue between them is becoming more and more important so this rule is really intended to help align and focus our efforts and investments around driving the connectivity there when you take a step back cdw has historically delivered meaningful profitable growth and we ve done that through continual innovation and continual investment disciplined investment and focus on investing where the growth is so when i think about growth and innovation and bringing that team together it s just another natural step in the way that we think about growth in the future shannon cross cross asset research analyst ok thank you operator thank you our next question comes from katy huberty with morgan stanley your line is open katy huberty morgan stanley analyst thank you good morning just thinking through seasonality for the year in the first half you have the bulk of the benefit of census the spillover of some of the win 10 refreshes and the extra selling day so just what are the offsets to those tailwinds that land you at more normal seasonality in the first quarter and first half versus maybe a little bit better seasonality given those factors collin kebo chief financial officer can you repeat the question katy katy huberty morgan stanley analyst yes just thinking through some of the tailwinds in the first half and the first quarter you have the bulk of the census impact in the first half of the year and hopefully get some spillover effect of pc refreshes at least in the first quarter and then you have the extra selling day so i m just curious why you wouldn t see maybe a little bit better than normal seasonality in 1q and the first half because of those factors are there some offsets that you re thinking through collin kebo chief financial officer no i would say no real offsets we do have some pretty meaningful overlaps in the back half of the prior year so i think that s also informing us katy huberty morgan stanley analyst ok and then just as a follow up have you gone back and looked at just spending trends and customer behavior around elections in terms of any expectation around how that might impact spending this year chris leahy chief executive officer yes katy this is chris if you go back to the 2012 and 2016 elections what we did see is we did see a deceleration in it spend it growth so that s why we call out as a wildcard the u s election this year because the uncertainty leading into it could cause some deceleration that came in those two years in the back half of the year katy huberty morgan stanley analyst ok thank you operator thank you our next question comes from paul coster with jp morgan your line is open paul coster j p morgan analyst yes thanks for taking my question chris you ve been pretty specific about the three part investment strategy and investing in the future generically but where do we see this in terms of the dollar spend is it in capex is it in the operating expenses what kinds of people are you recruiting how are you reallocating resources to capitalize on these opportunities internally and could you even argue that you re underearning a little bit because of the investments that opex is a bit higher than it might be otherwise chris leahy chief executive officer yes thanks for the question i think you see it up and down in various line items in the p l so for example we re investing in people investing in technologists solution architects delivery engineers we re also investing in technology and digital capabilities to enable our sales organization and to enable our coworkers to deliver to our customers to create an experience for our customer that becomes more seamless and useful to the sales process so we re investing in a number of different areas as we always do at cdw in terms of the impact on our profitability look i don t think you d see anything different but outperforming the market allows us to deliver on our commitments to shareholders but also reinvest in the business and that s very important for the future growth of the organization when i think about scaling for sustainable growth it s not just about performing for today but it s also about laying the foundation for growth against our growth model in the future and that s where we re investing today and tomorrow collin kebo chief financial officer paul i would just add the investment is both in the opex and the capex line the majority of our normal capex goes against our it infrastructure and then in your question are we underearning i guess the flip of that is are we overinvesting and i would say no we feel like we have the right balance between investment back into the business that allows us to continue to create differentiation in the marketplace that enables the sustainable outperformance versus the market so could we pull back on investment in the short term yes absolutely would the margin float up yes but i think that 200 to 300 basis point premium that we ve consistently been able to deliver over time you would see that they ll get chipped away so we think we have the right balance between investing in the business and growth in margin paul coster j p morgan analyst thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from keith housum with northcoast research your line is open keith housum northcoast research analyst good morning everybody can you help me understand back last year and the past few years spending in the win 10 refresh cycle was that generally done within companies or the customers general budgets or were they special i guess onetime expenditures that either won t repeat or do you expect to be reprioritized going forward chris leahy chief executive officer yes keith my sense having talked with customers and feedback from our sales organization is we didn t hear a lot of chatter about onetime increases in budgets to refresh client it s really the natural process of their it investment cycles collin kebo chief financial officer yes keith again just as we think about how we manage our own business our cio sure didn t get incremental budget to get us upgraded to win 10 i think part of what a customer goes through every year is determining what their priorities are and addressing those priorities within the context of their budget keith housum northcoast research analyst all right that s helpful and then changing gears i guess slightly as my follow up i can respect it s completely early with the coronavirus but can you help us understand like in terms of the supply chain and inventory in the channel how long could the coronavirus go on or how bad does that get before it actually impacts anybody is there enough inventory in the channel that can withstand quarantine for some factories for several weeks chris leahy chief executive officer yes no i wish i had an answer to that keith i just don t it s too early in the process right now and what i can say is we re working very closely with our oems right now to get a better understanding but we don t have visibility to that i think our vendors are still trying to figure that out and it s always going to depend on how long it lasts what alternatives they have but we ll just do the best that we can to ensure that we take care of our customers and if the extensive inventory is available we ll leverage competitive advantages and take that it s just hard to know at this point in time i don t want to project out into the future keith housum northcoast research analyst ok i appreciate that thank you operator thank you and i m currently showing no further questions at this time i d like to turn the call back over to chris leahy for closing remarks chris leahy chief executive officer thank you shannon i d like to recognize the hard work of our almost 10 000 coworkers around the globe and their ongoing dedication to serving our customers they are the reason we had such exceptional performance in 2019 and why we will continue to outperform the it market going forward thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to help you achieve your goals and thank you for your time today and continued interest in cdw collin and i look forward to talking to you next quarter take care operator duration 61 minutes call participants

call i m pleased to report that we finished 2019 with great momentum in addition to having strong revenue growth across all of our biopharma business continued margin expansion and robust cash generation we made great progress in executing our growth strategy and expanding our global capabilities since completing the largest us healthcare ipo in may we have continually improved our leverage position empowering us to drive the innovations and breakthroughs that help our life science customers dramatically improve patient outcomes i would like to begin by covering some business highlights since our lastearnings callon slide 3 in november we announced a new collaboration with the national institute of bioprocessing research and training in dublin ireland nibrt is a global center of excellence for training and research solutions for the biopharmaceutical manufacturing industry its clients include a number of industry leading companies such as pfizer eli lilly amgen bristol myers squibb abbvie and takeda avantor is working with nibrt to address downstream bottlenecks in buffer preparation when producing monoclonal antibodies in december we opened our ninth innovation and customer support center our newest addition is in shanghai china and will support accelerated process development for biologic therapies that will advance the development of life changing treatments for patients in the region it was specifically focused on enhancing industry capabilities and the development and manufacture of safe and effective biologic medicines such as monoclonal antibodies and cell and gene therapy these treatments show great potential in china and are a fast growing segment of the bioprocessing industry worldwide we recently began a capacity expansion initiative at our gliwice poland site that will support the growth of our biopharma production clients across europe we also initiated an expansion to our single use production capabilities in morrisville north carolina we continue to experience a high win rate on new customer accounts as well as on contract renewals i m pleased to report that we are ahead of plan on our integration synergy targets and i remain confident with our goal of achieving 300 million of synergies by the end of 2020 we also recently successfully repriced our term loans lowering the rate on our us dollar and euro denominated term loans by 75 basis points and we re looking forward to repricing our bonds later this year i also want to share some organization enhancements that we ve implemented in recent weeks that will enable us to execute our long term growth strategy to enhance our ability to deliver workflow based solutions in the lab we ve established a global laboratory products group which will be led by frederic vanderhaegen evp europe frederic and his team will work to enrich our product offering and improve our solution selling for critical workflows as with our other platform teams the laboratory products group will work closely with our regional teams to accelerate the growth of our lab products portfolio we recently announced plans to create two commercial sub regions within our emea region the substantial growth potential of this part of the world especially in china warrants more dedicated leadership so avantor will now have a commercial organization specifically for the india middle east and africa region imea and another for the asia pacific region apac that includes greater china korea and southeast asia dev ohri is serving as executive vice president for imea and we ve hired sven henrichwark as our new executive vice president for the asia pacific region sven brings more than 20 years of leadership in the biotech life science and medical technology industries including more than 12 years at ge healthcare we welcome to mark murray to avantor as executive vice president of the biomaterials and advanced technologies platform mark brings extensive global sales marketing operations and strategy leadership in key related industries through his more than 25 years of experience at mckinsey honeywell and celanese lastly marc centrella joined tom s organization in december as vice president corporate strategy and m a while our top priority remains de leveraging the balance sheet it is important that we begin to rebuild our m a capabilities and processes marc has a rich background in the life sciences space and has been tasked with rebuilding our m a capability also earlier today we announced that corey walker executive vice president for the americas region has resigned from his position to pursue to a role outside the life sciences industry that will allow him to move his family closer to other relatives we have already begun our search for his successor and until one is hired i will oversee our high performing americas region we are fortunate to have a very experienced leadership team in our americas region who are committed to capitalizing on the many opportunities before us in this important region and i m confident that we won t miss a beat putting the additions that i just described we have built a high caliber leadership team over the last few years and have added significant life sciences capability in depth aided by the avantor business system the hallmark of the team continues to be its ability to execute and we re well positioned for another great year moving to slide 4 where you can see the financial highlights of the fourth quarter organic revenue growth was 4 3 for the period and 5 1 for the full year including high single digit growth in our biopharma business in the fourth quarter reflecting ongoing strength in our portfolio of customized proprietary solutions the biopharma end markets remain healthy around the world and we experience attractive growth in these regions this segment accounts for approximately half of our total sales and we expect biopharma to continue to be the strongest driver of our future growth the other growth platforms that we have discussed including services and biomaterials also had high single digit growth in the quarter we did experience a continuation of softer trends in industrial markets as we noted in the third quarter and our growth was somewhat tempered by a weaker year end budget flush in both europe and the americas our adjusted ebitda margin for the quarter was up 12 4 excluding adverse currency impacts reflecting an improvement of 131 basis points for the quarter and 95 basis points for the full year these results reflect stronger volumes and pricing a continued improving mix of proprietary product sales the ongoing impacts of the vwr synergies and the execution discipline enabled by the avantor business system our adjusted earnings per share increased nearly 90 this quarter to 0 19 per share and are up approximately 62 for the full year at 0 58 per share hitting the high end of our guidance the excellent performance reflects strong operational execution as well as the benefit of reduced interest expense and an improved tax rate we expect that these factors will continue to drive significant earnings improvement going forward the fourth quarter also reflected significant strength in cash flow generation and deleveraging our unlevered free cash flow in the quarter was 188 million representing 97 of the adjusted net income excluding interest expense net leverage declined to 4 6 times ebitda in the quarter down from 4 8 times ebitda at the end of the third quarter and from 7 times ebitda at the beginning of the year in addition to the impact from the ipo earlier this year our growth in ebitda and focus on working capital have also contributed to 2019 deleveraging and as tom will discuss later we expect further improvements during 2020 with that let me turn it over to tom thomas a szlosek executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you michael i am on slide 5 where you can see the breakdown of the 4 3 organic growth for the fourth quarter by region we experienced improved growth in the americas reflecting continued strength in the biopharma and education end markets partially offset by lower government and healthcare spending europe growth was solid at 3 5 reflecting high single digit growth in the biopharma business and double digit growth in the healthcare end market partially offset by declines in education and government the amea region enjoyed a very strong 22 7 increase in sales this period reflecting high double digit growth in our biopharma business most notably in proprietary materials for bioproduction let me move to slide 6 which shows sales by end market and product group for the quarter as you can see biopharma which comprises about half of our sales grew in the high single digits while healthcare and advanced technologies and applied materials grew low single digits education and government had a low single digit decline which reflects softer government spending across the enterprise by product group q4 was a strong quarter for proprietary materials and consumables which had a high single digit increase continuing to outpace the low single digit growth in the third party materials and consumables services and specialty procurement continues to grow very strongly reflecting strength in all of our service offerings the equipment and instrumentation group reported a mid single digit decline reflecting a soft close to the year as michael noted earlier let me move to q4 adjusted ebitda on slide 7 we were pleased with the 12 7 growth and 131 basis points of margin expansion the sales growth converted very well reflecting volume leverage continued management of pricing versus cogs inflation the growth in our higher margin proprietary offerings and productivity including the vwr synergies these were slightly offset by the impact of growth investments that we continue to make particularly in the amea region in the middle of slide 7 you can see that fourth quarter free cash flow improved from 65 million to 75 million an increase of 16 and unlevered free cash flow was 187 8 million for the quarter i ll cover cash performance more on a later slide last as michael mentioned the 90 growth in our adjusted earnings per share for the quarter primarily reflects the strong operational performance driven by organic sales growth and margin expansion as well as the ongoing reduction in interest expense from our deleveraging slide 8 has our segment results the americas reported 3 1 organic revenue growth this quarter which i discussed earlier despite the sales growth management ebitda in the americas declined by roughly 2 million and about 70 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2018 we had a favorable adjustment to inventory without which the q4 19 management ebitda would have grown ahead of the sales growth reflecting strong price management relative to cogs inflation offset by lower sales of higher margin biomaterials products and some unfavorable manufacturing variances in europe the organic sales growth of 3 5 resulted in management ebitda growth of 10 4 excluding adverse impacts of the stronger us dollar and margin expansion of 110 basis points we benefited in europe from higher sales of higher margin biomaterials bioproduction and other proprietary offerings amea had a very strong performance this quarter as i previously mentioned with a 22 7 organic sales growth management ebitda in amea increased nearly 70 and the margin rate improved by over 850 basis points to 32 4 the strong sales of proprietary materials into bioproduction and overall volume growth were the main drivers and were slightly offset by the additional growth investments we are making in the region in the form of sales and marketing resources slide 9 provides an update of our free cash flow performance for the quarter and the full year for the quarter we generated 75 million in free cash flow a 16 increase for the full year we generated 302 million in free cash flow a 140 million increase or 86 from 2018 operational performance and lower interest expense drove 129 million and 71 million of this full year improvement respectively these benefits were offset by a 47 million growth in taxes paid reflecting a significant growth in our income notwithstanding the improved effective tax rate the capex requirements to support the growth in the business continue to be modest and overall capex grew from 38 million in 2018 to 52 million in 2019 slides 10 and 11 provide summaries of our performance for the full year slide 10 presents the organic growth which ended up at just north of 5 pretty much in line with a model we presented at the outset of the ipo as expected amea growth exceeded double digits and each of americas and europe reflected mid single digit growth on slide 11 you ll see a summary of our full year results in operating profits cash flow and earnings per share following the 5 1 organic sales growth adjusted ebitda grew 11 and ebitda margin improved from 16 1 to nearly 17 1 despite some headwinds from higher than expected public company costs share based compensation and adverse foreign currency movements on cash flow i discussed the drivers of the free cash flow earlier even excluding the benefit from deleveraging cash flow grew 24 which compares nicely to an already attractive 11 adjusted ebitda growth adjusted eps was 0 58 at the high end of our guidance and up nearly 62 over 2019 again a reflection of attractive growth margin expansion and the ongoing impacts from deleveraging and debt repricing turning to slide 12 we are pleased with the pace of deleveraging and the reduction in the cost of our debt during 2019 we reduced debt outstanding by 1 9 billion comprised of 1 6 billion from our ipo proceeds and 300 million from operations we started the year at 7 times ebitda leverage and ended at 4 6 times as we ve noted before we are targeting a leverage of 2 to 4 times ebitda and we expect to be within this range by the end of 2020 we ve also been working down the cost of our debt through the repricings we have done on our term loans in 2019 we reduced the weighted average cost of our debt to 6 5 looking ahead we see further deleveraging and significant repricing opportunities in particular we have 2 billion in senior unsecured debt with a 9 coupon and 1 5 billion in senior secured debt with a 6 coupon both of which offer attractive opportunities for repricing in the second half of 2020 we will share more details as we get closer to that date our 2020 earnings guidance is on slide 13 we expect organic revenue growth of 4 to 6 this assumes that the market conditions from 2019 prevail and the events out of our control such as the coronavirus do not have a meaningful impact on growth we are also assuming that the geographic mix of our growth that is high single digit growth in amea and low to mid single digit growth in the americas and europe remains unchanged we expect adjusted ebitda of 1 090 billion to 1 135 billion an increase of 6 to 10 this reflects our ongoing expectation of a stronger growth in our proprietary offerings versus growth in third party offerings operating leverage on our fixed cost base continued focus on managing the price versus inflation dynamic and the remaining integration synergies our guidance for adjusted earnings per share is the range of 0 74 to 0 79 per share representing growth of 27 to 36 this reflects continued strong operational improvement lower interest expense from deleveraging and already completed repricing action and an effective tax rate in the 25 to 26 range we also maintain a flat share count for guidance purposes last free cash flow is expected to be in the range of 450 million to 500 million versus 302 million in 2019 also reflecting the strong operational performance lower interest payments from de leveraging and already completed repricing actions as well as our capex light business model i want to thank you sincerely for your interest and investment in avantor and for your ongoing advice and support i will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the question and answer section questions and answers operator thank you and our first question today comes from the line of tycho peterson from jpmorgan your line is open tycho peterson jpmorgan analyst hey good morning i d like to start with the ebitda outlook at the high end of the guide here you re still about 40 million below the street so can you maybe just talk comment there some offsets on ebitda expansion things we have to factor in in terms of incremental investments that would lead you to be guiding below the street and i think what people were assuming for longer term ebitda growth michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer yeah certainly thanks for the question tycho first of all the guide implies on the high end about 75 basis points of margin expansion certainly we are shooting and targeting for more internally we do have some incremental headwinds from what we would have had in our long term model there s a little bit more public company cost between having to become a sox adaptor this year and a little bit of other things like directors and officers insurance we re doing a little bit more inflation than we had anticipated as well but again certainly we re shooting for higher we re early in the year we want to be a little bit more prudent in terms of what we commit to at this point and obviously we ll update you every quarter in terms of how we re progressing on that tycho peterson jpmorgan analyst okay and then in terms of trends on the fourth quarter i guess two questions here the government piece was that the weakness here to spill over from the third quarter or was there anything incremental on the government side and then for equipment and instrumentation saw mid single digit you reflected you commented on the soft close to the year can you maybe just talk on the dynamics of the equipment business michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer yeah i mean i mean first of all the overall growth we re really pleased with the biopharma piece of it it continues to track away at that high single digits and when you look at the government piece of it a smaller piece of the business certainly down sorry the government and education is certainly down in aggregate the government was the bigger driver there tycho i mean it was weird it was almost all of the month of october was just coming out of september it was a slowdown across all three regions then after that it picked up and kind of flattened out by the end of the year on the equipment piece of it probably similar in terms of the month december was a bit lighter than the other two months and we really didn t see as intense equipment purchases in the month of december as we sometimes do when we re closing out the year more so in europe than anywhere else but i don t view either of them as long term trends i think it s timing i mean the government piece was clearly behind us by the time november started tycho peterson jpmorgan analyst okay thank you operator our next question comes from the line of derik de bruin from bank of america your line is open juan avendano bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi good morning this is juan avendano for derik i have a question i guess can you give us an idea of what is the penetration level of the higher margin proprietary legacy of avantor products in the vwr distribution channel i m curious about what percentage of the legacy avantor products are already being fully offered and distributed globally versus what percentage of these products are yet to be offered in the vwr catalog michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer yeah juan this is michael thanks for the question clearly you re hitting on an important aspect of our model in that the growth in margins associated with the proprietary part of our business are really strategic and obviously an area that we spend a lot of time investing in when you look at our core portfolio that you re referencing a lot of that content flows into our bioproduction platform which has been growing for most of the year in the mid teens levels and we saw that again in the fourth quarter and that s led by our single use portfolio our excipients portfolio as well as a lot of our process ingredients and such prior to the combination of the two companies majority of that portfolio was being offered through the vwr channel and clearly as we ve come together we ve only deepened that especially in the geographies outside the americas our biomaterials platform is a unique platform with real strength in the medical technology and implant area a lot of overlap in the customer set between our legacy new cell customers and the vwr channel customers and there has been many examples throughout the year where we ve been able to leverage that customer access to drive growth on both sides of the equation and those teams continue to work very well so the trends are positive it s obviously business like this where your earnings specifications and customizing solutions there s a bit of tail here as to how you would expect to see the benefits of the better channel access that we have we would anticipate those playing out over the next number of years but we have fully integrated these businesses and are seeing a very strong uptick in our pipeline of opportunities around the world by having proprietary content falling through our channel juan avendano bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it thank you and then second question is are there any other major supplier agreements that are coming up for renewal or that are being renegotiated in the near term michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer yeah juan i mean the things we ve said before we ve got a very diverse portfolio here i don t think any single supplier represents more than a few percentage of our total revenue we don t have any significant contracts that would change our ability to access products in the near term great relationships overall and when you look at the growth that we ve been driving with these partners over the last couple of years and the solutions that they help us enable together with our own content we re excited by the partnerships that we ve forged over many years with these suppliers and look forward to working with them going forward juan avendano bank of america merrill lynch analyst thank you operator our next question comes from the line of jack meehan from barclays your line is open jack meehan barclays analyst yeah thank you good morning i want to focus a couple of questions on the 2020 outlook the first one was i was hoping if you could weigh in on the pacing of growth this year you called out in asia pac i think you i heard high single digit growth for the year but maybe obviously small percentage of revenue but what are you assuming in terms of how that might impact the overall growth and then also i think you have an extra day in the first quarter too i don t know where that necessarily falls but maybe if you could just talk about the pacing of growth and the different factors that would be helpful michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer thanks jack yeah in terms of the 2020 plan when you look at where we ended up in 2019 most of the trends were intact to close the year we re fairly consistent in terms of how that stacks up for 2020 so you can think of it as i was saying on the notes mid single digit growth for both americas and europe and it will be we ll be in the mid teens kind of for amea that s the overall expectation is that getting at what you re asking jack meehan barclays analyst yeah thanks for the clarification but also i guess as you think about how it grows first quarter through fourth quarter do you think it s more linear or are there things that just timing wise for the first quarter we should be aware of michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer yeah i mean when you look when you consider the comps over the course of the year q1 will probably be on the lower end of the mid single digits if not low single digits and then ramping up in the second half of the year on the higher end of mid single digits is the way i d characterized it jack meehan barclays analyst okay and then tom just as a second question you highlighted the potential for some of the refinancings ahead within the 2020 guidance what are you assuming in terms of interest expense and is there a way you can help quantify us for us just what you think that could translate to in 2021 for the refinancing thomas a szlosek executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah the way i look at it jack is well first of all to answer the question we have not assumed any additional refinancing repricing or anything in the plan that we presented to you so as you know and as probably most people who follow avantor know we have some opportunities in the second half of the year specifically around october november timeframe we re beginning to make more economic sense to consider repricing some of the bonds that we have we have 2 billion of unsecured bonds at 9 we have another 1 5 billion of secured senior secured at 6 and depending on where the market conditions are we ll obviously pursue opportunities you can kind of think of it as overall as every on a quarterly basis every 100 basis points is probably worth 5 million or so of interest cost and so you can pick your favorite number and do the math in terms of the impacts that a repricing could potentially have but going back to what we put into the plan it is only the pricing that we had after the january repricing that we successfully did which as you might know we ve reduced the rates on the term debt we have about 1 billion of a term debt we reduced it by 75 basis points so that alone gives us a nice pre tax headwind or tailwind of about 8 million so continue to keep our eye on that and continue to make good traction on the debt portfolio jack meehan barclays analyst thanks tom thomas a szlosek executive vice president and chief financial officer okay operator our next question comes from the line of vijay kumar from evercore isi your line is open vijay kumar evercore isi analyst hey guys thanks for taking my question so maybe mike big picture question for you past two quarters we ve had some these one offs and you ve shed the color on the marco and the guidance range just in terms of modeling purposes should this lead you looking at the bottom half of the range just given how the last two quarters have shaken out is that a more prudent approach or i m just curious on where you guys feel comfortable about the guidance range on the top line michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer yeah vijay good to hear from you i mean actually we were really pleased with our overall performance in q4 and we look at it relative to some of our prior prints i think it was really characterized by almost an absence of kind of one offs very little noise in the quarter and i think if you would have asked me kind of 2 5 months through the quarter kind of where i felt we were going to come in at probably at that point what i told you we were trending toward the high end of our guide the last five to 10 days of the month really were slower than what we had seen historically and we hadn t planned for anything unusual to finish the year but certainly it came in slower than what we expected both in the americas as well as in europe had we had a normal budget flush out of i think we ll be talking about a number that was probably 100 to 200 basis points higher from an organic growth standpoint so overall when you look at the core business biopharma production the biopharma platform broadly speaking printing at just a tick under 10 a return to growth of our biomaterials platform at nearly 10 continued strong double digit growth of our services platform our core engine is running at full speed here so when we then think about the guide going into 2020 i think it certainly falls squarely in line with the messaging that we ve been sharing with you all over the last number of quarters in that we view this platform as a mid single digit plus grower i think our 2019 performance falls right in line with that as does the guide that we ve given you here so i think we re optimistic about the year ahead i think we see the end market conditions at least as we reflected in our guide essentially continuing in 2020 in a similar fashion as 2019 vijay kumar evercore isi analyst that s helpful mike and just one follow up on i think you mentioned coronavirus i m assuming the guide does not bake in coronavirus given you guys are under indexed in china how if what if any impact does coronavirus have to your business and you mentioned that there s some leadership transition here in americas did that have any impact at all on sales performance thank you michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer yeah let me address your second question first around the leadership changes that we ve announced today first i m super excited by some of the capabilities that we ve been able to bring to the team over the last couple of years we ve brought a tremendous amount of life science depth and capability to the business in the recent additions particularly in china are no different we ve been excited to introduce you all to sven as we get an opportunity to interact in the coming months but he has lived in the asia region for better part of a decade driving some of the pure platforms in the bioprocessing space really deep experience set there and i m looking forward to having him take the lead here in driving our growth in the region especially in china relative to the change in the americas corey has been an integral part of the team here over the last three years or so he s still here we ll go through a transition in the month of february really nothing to do with the business as to why he s electing to move on he has got a personal situation that he s needing to resolve and we re fully supportive of helping him address that through the transition so corey has been in place throughout the quarter we ll continue to be in place here through part of the month here in february and we have a really senior team probably understating how senior our team is in the americas all of the commercial leads that are driving that platform forward 25 plus years of experience in our business we re in good hands there relative to your first question around the coronavirus i think we d echo probably the comments as you ve heard others reflect which is i think we re early innings into this we do have a very formal structure set up to manage a number of key work streams including the health and safety of our own associates making sure we re able to address any supply chain concerns as we sit here today we re certainly seeing an uptick in demand around the world for some of the clean room supplies and personal protective equipment but it s hard to tell the impact that will have these are kind of sitting on top of chinese new year and any event and i think you ve rightfully mentioned china for us is a more modest exposure so at the moment probably too early to call but i wouldn t anticipate it having a meaningful impact on us one way or another vijay kumar evercore isi analyst thanks guys thomas a szlosek executive vice president and chief financial officer hey vijay when michael was talking about the leadership changes he forgot to mention the quality of the interim leader that we re putting in the americas so you should keep that in mind as well he s quite capable vijay kumar evercore isi analyst appreciate the comments tom and i look forward to meeting the leadership team thomas a szlosek executive vice president and chief financial officer good operator our next question comes from the line of doug schenkel from cowen your line is open doug schenkel cowen analyst good morning i wanted to talk about three things biopharma gross margin and tax rate so on biopharma it was another quarter of really strong growth what s embedded for biopharma growth within 2020 guidance and recognizing the comparisons are difficult this year particularly in the first half kind of going back to an earlier question should we be thinking about that in the context of how we model out things from a quarterly cadence perspective michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer yeah let me doug take the question on biopharma obviously it s been a tremendous year for that platform and would just reground the audience here on the call today biopharma for us is about half of our revenue and it reflects the offering both into the laboratory environment and the workflows that we service there as well as into the production environment and we would typically see a little bit stronger growth rates in the production environment and a little bit more muted growth in the laboratory environment and on an aggregate basis that platform for us in 2019 grew at 10 which is a reflection of kind of high single digit growth in the lab environment and double digits think kind of mid teens level growth of our bioproduction platform and as we think about the transition into 2020 we really see no reason to change the outlook for 2020 based on that finish pretty similar conditions going forward is our asking doug schenkel cowen analyst okay so to be clear another year of high single or close to double digit growth is how you re thinking about that end market michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer exactly doug schenkel cowen analyst okay all right gross margin so it s up 210 basis points year over year but considering the strong proprietary products growth we actually thought it could have been up a little bit more sequentially versus q3 how did q4 gross margin fare versus your internal expectations and again recognizing some positive trends here what are you expecting for 2020 thomas a szlosek executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean when you look at q4 and the full year i mean we were able q4 we were up about 100 basis points year over year on gross margins certainly as we ve talked about the volume leverage is a big help but and we re doing a nice job on managing the price cogs mix but the shift the continued growth higher growth proprietary products is also a big factor for us we get good growth in biopharma production as an example biomaterials it works out quite well for us when you look at the full year it was similar i mean not quite as dramatic from a gm improvement perspective but still 30 to 40 basis points of gross margin improvement and still seeing those same factors we expect a similar kind of growth rate over the course of 2020 as we drive the continued proprietary growth in our proprietary products doug schenkel cowen analyst okay thank you for that and last one on the tax rate tax rate was well below our expectations in the quarter you guided 2020 to 25 to 26 do you see any room for upside versus that and then i guess at this point i guess just a question on how you re thinking about the long term opportunity should we expect a steady cadence of annual declines for say the next three to five years building off of what you guided to for 2020 thomas a szlosek executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah just to address the fourth quarter first of all the rate was abnormally low i think you picked up on and it s just a matter of cleaning up our year end reserves and finalizing some of the positions around the inter company financing that we ve talked about we started before the ipo with a 30 plus tax rate run rate and we explained that a big part of that was some inefficiencies in our rate structure or structure for financing some of our international operations over the course of 2019 we ve kept you up to date on that in the fourth quarter it really finalized the new structures to enable us to have a much more efficient tax rate that enabled us to adjust the overall tax rate for the full year and you saw that impact come through in the fourth quarter i d say i would consider the run rate for the full year to be if i take out that one time kind of impact somewhere in the 28 range and when i look at 2020 the guide is 25 to 26 hopefully we ll be at the lower end of that but we ve got a pretty clear line of sight to being within that range i think longer term doug we should be low 20 s kind of company we see a path and in the timeframe you talked about three to five years to certainly get there it s the activities we have to undertake impact our operations more than what we ve had to undertake so far to drive improvement and so it s a more enterprisewide type of initiative involving the supply chains commercial teams and the like and we have to engage in to keep that progress going doug schenkel cowen analyst okay that s super helpful thank you thomas a szlosek executive vice president and chief financial officer all right thanks operator our next question comes from the line of dan brennan from ubs your line is open dan brennan ubs analyst great thank you thanks for the questions i guess i wanted to go back to the 2020 ebitda margin outlook could you just walk through what you re assuming the impact is from synergies how much of the expansion is organic and kind of how does that organic expansion compared to what you ve achieved in 2019 thomas a szlosek executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah when you look at the synergies for 2000 where we are in the program through the end of 2019 we ve made and just to take you back for everybody s benefit the program at the outset started in november 2017 we identified 300 million or so of acquisition synergies 70 million or so would have been on the commercial side and 230 million or so would have been on the cost side making a good progress on the impacts of each of those we re probably nearing completion with the commercial synergies part of it and overall we re probably on a run rate basis close to 230 million as of the end of the actually closer to 250 million as of the end of 2019 so actions required to get to 300 million about 50 million more in terms of the impact on the ebitda margins next year you can think of it as somewhere in the 40 million to 50 million range of incremental p l benefit on our ebitda in 2020 dan brennan ubs analyst okay great and then maybe i wanted to go back to a couple of the customer groups here you addressed biopharma but just a few of the areas that or even by product areas excuse me that we re more kind of deviated from i think some of the growth rates that you had kind of outlined when you guys came public so in particular advanced materials and then on the equipment instrument side just how do we think about those going into 2020 like what s kind of baked in and if you can provide any color around what the environment looks like for those thank you michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer yeah on the equipment and instrument side is as tom i think articulated earlier we certainly saw a lower finish to the year in that category than what we ve seen historically at a pretty pronounced in europe and ended up contributing about a mid single digit decline overall in the quarter we wouldn t expect that to continue into 2020 that would tend to be more in the low single digit growth levels and that s probably how we would think about it in 2020 thinking about some of the proprietary platforms that we have obviously we ve talked a bit here on the call today about our bioproduction platform led by our single use offering that we would expect to continue to grow probably close to 20 netting us somewhere in the mid teens overall levels that s kind of what we saw in 2019 and i think we see a similar environment going forward into 2020 our biomaterials platform is a platform we ve talked a bit about this year particularly in the third quarter where we saw a little bit of inventory drop leading to more of a flattish environment in that quarter and we re obviously pleased to see as we expected a return to high single digit growth not quite 10 in the fourth quarter that s a platform that when you think about it over a 12 to 18 month cycle that s a high single digit growth platform and we modestly underperformed that level in 2019 really owing to the inventory corrections in the third quarter that we ve discussed but we d anticipate in 2020 a normalized demand environment and kind of high single digit growth our advanced technology platform which is a collection of a large number of end markets applied markets including aerospace defense our semiconductor exposure as well as kind of a collection of a lot of other industrial applications it s been pretty solid throughout the year and we saw that again in 2019 and while we would be thrilled to see those markets recover in 2020 as we think about our guidance we ve really anticipated and reflected a continuation of those trends into the new year here dan brennan ubs analyst great thank you operator our next question comes from the line of glen santangelo from guggenheim your line is open glen santangelo guggenheim analyst yeah thanks for taking the questions mike obviously a lot of focus on this call on the top line growth rates and in your prepared remarks you called out some of the softness in europe and the us and i m just kind of curious i mean have you really considered the competitive landscape here and any assessment in terms of market share and maybe how that maybe has shifted with respect to some of your major business lines or geographies anything on the market share worth calling out at all or you re purely thinking just market driven michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer look if you look just specifically the fourth quarter if you take out the last five days of the year which really is very very difficult to call driven by vacation schedules and the like we had a very very strong quarter like i said earlier probably in the quarter probably wanted to be 100 to 200 basis points stronger which would have been at the high end of our expectations in the quarter at the level of growth that you see us driving a little over 5 on a full year basis that s at worst case in line with what we see these end markets growing and in many instances whether that be in the bioproduction space or whether that be in the education market we do see ourselves running ahead of the market growth rate and extending our share around the globe so we re pleased with the positioning that we have in being able to leverage the unparalleled customer access that we have through the channel really has positioned well to continue to bring a more complete offering to our customers around the world glen santangelo guggenheim analyst tom maybe if i can just follow up with a quick question on the balance sheet i think in your prepared remarks you suggested that you d hope to get the leverage within that target range of 2 to 4 times by the end of 20 but based on us i think you d have to pay down another 600 plus million in debt and sort of given where your free cash flow estimates are for the year could you just help us bridge that gap and how you can get there by the end of 2020 and then when you think about the capital deployment opportunities from there any comments to make on the m a environment based on where you sit now thanks very much thomas a szlosek executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah thanks glenn yeah we talked about finishing the year at about 4 6 times leverage and talked about being able to get underneath 4 times by the end of 2020 there is basically two factors that are driving that obviously the increase in ebitda is a big lift and you can see you can pick your number out of the range that you have the most confidence and but if you think of anywhere between 75 or so of ebitda growth that is a contributor here and the other one is the free cash flow that we generate we re guiding to between 450 and 500 when you apply that to the debt between those two factors that gets you underneath the 4 times in terms of alternative capital deployment first and foremost we continue to just focus on deleveraging and that s where we plan for most of our cash flow to go in 2020 and that will continue to be the priority but once we get into that range once we get into that 2 to 4 times we think that we ll be in a position to pursue some of the opportunities on the market particularly in things that be in the proprietary offering space that michael was referring to particularly around biopharma biopharma production and the like we as michael mentioned have brought on an m a leader we re excited about that and that s something that we clearly focused on the long term horizon try to find and be prepared for opportunities when our capital structure allows it so that s kind of overall the short term medium term long term the way we re thinking about the leverage and the alternative capital deployment opportunities glen santangelo guggenheim analyst okay thanks for the comments thomas a szlosek executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah operator our final question today will come from the line of erin wright from credit suisse your line is open erin wright credit suisse analyst great thanks in the asia region you did mention some of the stepped up sales investment that you are making and that maybe that was a little bit of a potential offset to the strong growth that we saw across that region in the quarter i guess was that meaningful at all should that stabilize and what exactly is going on there if you could just describe thomas a szlosek executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah thanks erin it s pretty consistent with what you would have seen over the course of 2019 we ve stepped up our investments particularly on sales and marketing and also we have a new lab that we ve opened up in shanghai we ve got a new digit clean room and distribution center in singapore so clearly making some investments to drive the future growth in a region that we know we re underrepresented in we re also expanding in a way to help us grow further mike will talk about the organizational enhancements that we ve done in that regard so it has resulted in higher g a costs but we think we consider those to be investments to further the growth erin wright credit suisse analyst okay thanks and bigger picture here over the past few quarters now you ve spoken about customer retention contract wins i guess how is the merger enhancing your positioning in the marketplace overall and enhancing your win rate and how is it resonating with your customer base thomas a szlosek executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah thanks for the question when we put these two businesses together we were optimistic that the broad customer access that the vwr channel would provide together with a really strong mix of technologies coming from the legacy avantor space would have been certainly lead to new opportunities over the long term and as we ve now got a couple of years under our belt here in bringing these models together i see i think as you see that reflected in the lift in the revenue profile of the combined businesses you see that in the momentum that we re seeing especially in our biopharma business with our offering now into the lab running over the last year plus at high single digit levels our customers certainly are benefiting from a more complete integrated offering that we re able to take into this into their important workflows and we see that playing out perhaps the piece i m most excited about actually is the when you just look at the opportunity the number of drugs that we re partnering with our customers on customizing solutions earning those specifications that will really see our longer term growth opportunities and play out as those molecules that we re that we re supporting those new therapies that we re supporting work their way through the clinical processes and ultimately get commercialized and to me that s probably the more important value driver of bringing these businesses together is just what this does to enhance sustainability and growth of the platform over the long term erin wright credit suisse analyst thank you operator i d now like to turn the call back over to michael for closing remarks michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer great thank you on behalf of our more than 12 000 associates around the world we appreciate your support of our business and for participating in our call today as you can tell from our comments today we are excited about our 2019 performance our first year as a public company and are looking forward to another great year of revenue growth and margin expansion significant cash generation as tom discussed here we continue deleveraging our balance sheet i think we see the power of our business model in our 2019 results we re confident that we re well positioned for another great year and are excited about enabling innovations and breakthroughs that help our life science customers dramatically improve patient outcomes

a mixed picture the fx poll is pointing to gains in the medium and long terms the australian dollar initially benefited from receding fears about the coronavirus and upbeat statements from the central bank while ignoring weak data only to flip back down and hit decade lows both topics in focus in the upcoming week this week in aud usd rba coronavirus whipsaw is a coronavirus cure on the cards not so fast but markets have seized upon medical efforts to develop or reuse existing medicine to cure the respiratory disease the virus originating in wuhan has taken the lives of hundreds of people but financial markets are pleased with the immense efforts to contain the outbreak the recovery of stock markets has helped the australian dollar a risk currency recover however australian prime minister scott morrison has warned of the economic damage from the disease citing his country s high dependency on the world s second largest economy nevertheless aussie traders seemed to lean more towards another policymaker phillip lowe governor of the reserve bank of australia the rba left its interest rates unchanged at 0 75 as expected seeing the glass half full and especially content with the labor market moreover lowe spoke later on and seemed to play down the chances of further rate cuts the rba slashed borrowing costs three times in 2019 the central bank and markets seemed to ignore downbeat economic figures retail sales slipped by 0 5 in december and the trade surplus fell short of expectations with only 5 22 billion the governor had the last word of the week when he presented the bank s statement of monetary policy where he sent the aussie down by suggesting the rba considered a rate cut moreover the a succumbed to us dollar strength a winning streak of robust economic indicators from the forward looking purchasing managers indexes through productivity figures and culminating in job numbers all benefitted the greenback the american economy gained 225 000 jobs in january beating initial estimates chinese economic indicators were satisfactory but do not reflect the coronavirus outbreak caixin s manufacturing purchasing managers index ticked down to 51 8 points in january yet continues reflecting growth the official manufacturing pmi stood at 51 1 australian and chinese events seeing the impact of the virus the coronavirus outbreak also known as the wuhanflu is set to continue dominating the headlines for at least another week apart from the number of cases and the rising death toll the global mood will likely be set economic developments these include flight cancelations the shutdown of plants in china downgraded forecasts and any hard statistics that may lower the level of uncertainty the economic calendar provides some data albeit partial chinese inflation figures for january kick off the week economists expect the annual consumer price index to remain hot driven by high pork prices an unexpected drop due to the coronavirus may weigh on markets several australian consumer figures are of interest but the main event of the week is another speech by governor lower the central banker may shed further light on the economic situation primarily if he refers to the bank s response to the outbreak china closes the week with top tier economic indicators for january industrial production and retail sales both figures may be skewed by a duo of factors activity ahead of the lunar new year and the wuhanflu it will be interesting to see if markets will shrug off the data as messy or become more sensitive to any drop here the most prominent australian and chinese releases on the economic calendar us events further trade speculation housing pmis while us politics is fascinating with president donald trump s impeachment and the democratic party s primaries markets will likely continue ignoring these developments the economic calendar is centered on the consumer starting with inflation figures energy prices have likely driven the headline consumer price index level higher but core cpi which is watched by the federal reserve has probably slipped economists expect underlying inflation to have decelerated from 2 3 to 2 2 in january the retail sales report for january carries expectations for rises in all gauges most importantly the control group is set for another healthy advance of 0 4 after rising by 0 5 in december an up to date look at shopping trends awaits traders at the close of the week the university of michigan s preliminary measure of consumer sentiment in february is set to remain near 100 representing an upbeat mood here are the top us events as they appear on the forex calendar aud usd technical analysis the relative strength index on the daily chart is flirting with 30 which indicates oversold conditions and implies a bounce bulls may also be encouraged that downside momentum is not at its worst on the other hand aud usd is trading well below the 50 100 and 200 day simple moving averages the recent trough of 0 6675 remains a significant battle line it is closely followed by the october low of 0 6665 and then by the january 2019 flash crash low of 0 6620 which was momentary more importantly aud usd would fall to the lowest since early 2009 the weakest in over a decade resistance is at 0 6720 which was a support line in october followed by 0 6755 a low point in late november it is followed by 0 6785 february s high the next lines to watch are 0 68 0 6845 and 0 6860 which is the confluence of the 100 and 200 day smas aud usd sentiment while the aussie may respond to oversold conditions with a bounce the fresh dovishness by the rba and the coronavirus outbreak which is far from over may continue weighing on aud usd the fx poll is showing a bearish trend in the short term but a robust recovery afterward do experts think the sell off is exaggerated perhaps yet the average targets have been downgraded in the past week related forecasts

national oilwell varco s fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call with me today are clay williams our chairman president and ceo and jose bayardo our senior vice president and cfo before we begin i would like to remind you that some of today s comments are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal security laws they involve risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially no one should assume these forward looking statements remain valid later in the quarter or later in the year for a more detailed discussion of the major risk factors affecting our business please refer to the latest forms 10 k and 10 q filed with the securities and exchange commission our comments also include non gaap measures reconciliations to the nearest corresponding gaap measures in our earnings release available on our website on the us gaap basis for the fourth quarter of 2019 nov reported revenues of 2 28 billion and a net loss of 385 million or 1 01 per share our use of the term ebitda throughout this morning s call corresponds with the term adjusted ebitda as defined in our earnings release later in the call we will host a question and answer session please limit yourself to one question and one follow up to permit more participation now let me turn the call over to clay clay c williams president chairman and chief executive officer thank you blake nov s results continue to improve sequentially during the fourth quarter of 2019 as revenue increased 7 from the third quarter and ebitda increased to 288 million or 12 6 of revenue despite continued deterioration of the north american market all three of our segments increased ebitda sequentially on a year over year basis nov was able to post an increase in ebitda during the fourth quarter of 2019 despite revenue being down more than 100 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 aggressive cost reductions and facility downsizing contributed significantly to nov s improving financial performance and jose and i will speak more to this in just a moment revenues for the full year 2019 were 8 48 billion a 0 3 improvement from the prior year full year ebitda of 885 million declined 3 from the prior year 2019 was a pivotal year for the energy industry we entered 2019 with commodity and equity markets signaling strongly to market participants that growth for growth sake without commensurate returns to capital providers would no longer be tolerated sources of all forms of capital to the industry public equity private equity bank debt public debt became scarce and expensive as evidence for example by the collapse in trading multiples of oilfield public equities in early 2019 at the time we interpreted this as the evaporation of a widely held narrative gauzy conventional wisdom that a commodity price spike would someday soon lead us back to a more prosperous oilfield and save us all through the first four years of the downturn 2015 to 2018 this narrative was responsible we think for a significant structural option value component in equities and asset values in the oilfield this makes sense to me because the oil and gas industry has a 160 year history of extreme volatility and sophisticated investors recognize the corresponding option value that goes with this volatility as the leading provider of capital intensive capital equipment to oilfield service companies we tend to watch such trends our customers frequently rely on external capital to buy the equipment that we provide them and by the beginning of 2019 providers of external capital to oil and gas producers and service companies were exhausted tired of waiting patiently for recovery that felt like you continued to slip over the horizon so they choked back on the capital that they were previously pumping into the operations of our customers our capital is to oil and gas what oxygen is to the rest of us petroleum is arguably the most capital intensive undertaking of all industrial enterprises and oilfield services is probably second operators react quickly when you choke off their air supply they pulled back hard on capex budgets particularly in the us unconventional plays resulting in a peak to trough decline of 27 in the us land rig count over the course of the year while international and offshore projects with favorable return characteristics continued to receive fid green lights the industry as a whole particularly the us finally seem to be resigning itself to the fact that commodity price spike is not going to save the day and the old way of doing business is not going to cut it it will unfortunately be lower for longer and as the new conventional wisdom that emerged at the beginning of 2019 i wanted to step through this perspective with you this morning because i believe it has important implications for our company and our industry over the next few years and this perspective has guided our strategic decisions through 2019 first with respect to the elusive recovery through this year of capital austerity some might say capital starvation i ve been struck by the number of conversations i have had with other oil patch all timers where we agree that this lack of capital is as bad as anytime we saw during the 1980s or 1990s they re in light of seeds of a return to prosperity because the new grim view that has taken hold is now driving the industry to reduce its structural overcapacity taking actions that will return this industry to health asset retirements facility closures regional withdrawals exits from businesses and consolidations got under way in earnest in 2019 while individually none of these will heal the space collectively they inevitably lead the industry to better disciplined pricing and shareholder returns nov shared the task began materially back in 2015 when we started reducing our overcapacity facilities footprint and sg a but our efforts were accelerated sharply beginning in 2019 as a reality of the new market normal became apparent our team has undertaken many difficult decisions including pulling back from unprofitable markets and closing numerous facilities around the world some of which had been nov mainstays for decades since 2015 we have closed 483 facilities to shrink our own internal capacity to better fit market demand we ve adopted a more efficient shared services model in many regions and through the hard work of our team through this past year we ve established a clear and tangible path to at least 230 million in annual cost savings as compared to the first quarter of 2019 thus far we have obtained approximately 170 million in annualized savings up about 82 million sequentially in the fourth quarter and we continue to evaluate every opportunity to increase that number second every product line no matter how well established has fallen under the microscope of an in depth returns analysis those do not currently meet our internal threshold have either developed a tangible plan for near term improvement or have been slotted for divestiture or closure ultimately 2019 was a year about building and solidifying our staying power operationally we re leaner more efficient and more agile to react to the shifts in the market third from a balance sheet perspective we continue to increase the strength of our capital structure in order to maintain the flexibility to act opportunistically during the fourth quarter we called 1 billion in debt due in 2022 repaying a portion with cash and a portion with longer tenor notes a new in a new issue that is due 2029 fourth we tailored our strategy to fit a world where oilfield services customers have limited access to capital commercially nov won much of this race during the period from 2006 to 2014 when we won a significant portion of the largest build out of oilfield service equipment the industry has seen in a generation we deliver 379 offshore new build drilling packages since 2006 for instance so today we benefit from having the largest installed base of oilfield equipment in the world this enormous installed base gives rise to new attractive business opportunities that are unique to nov aftermarket spares and services support software system enhancements the application of big data driven predictive analytics products to drive efficiencies the evolution of mechanization to automation of processes in the oilfield for instance we are creating differentiated digital offerings built on over three decades of gathering big data in the oilfield through our m d totco products and ehawk service offerings among others due to our installed base of equipment that touches nearly every well site in the world we re uniquely positioned as perhaps the only common thread between hundreds of unique equipment suppliers with thousands of non standardized sensor tags our new product development with capital scarce and oilfield equipment oversupplied it makes less sense for oilfield service contractors to spend millions of dollars on new units rather we see the next attractive opportunities as being smaller dollar investments that our customers can make in bigger impact enhancements that will enable them to differentiate their equipment in a crowded market place while there will be certain large new build project opportunities that arise even in this tough market we will remain disciplined and will choose not to follow our competitors in doing the stupid stuff that desperate competitors inevitably do a strong balance sheet and a large installed base of equipment requiring ongoing oem support is the best way to write out an industry downturn the good news for nov is that we have both new product development has zeroed in on bolt on products that carry a price tag our customers can afford with value added efficiency or useful life improving profile that they can justify to their shareholders i think in terms of track id tags for drill pipe monitoring and auto tally s on rigs novos operating system enhancements that our customers can charge their oil company customers for new directional drilling tools like selectshift which have no similar peer in the marketplace powerblade energy management systems which reduce diesel consumption and carbon footprint for offshore drillers affordable products which can be used to retrofit existing capacity to improve its attractiveness in the marketplace lastly with respect to our outlook for the year we re prepared to endure continued levels of reduced activity in north america with a meaningful market recovery unlikely to take hold before 2021 the kind of market that suits affordable fit for market solutions international activity continues to be a bright spot as we enter 2020 for nov as customers in the middle east and other regions around the world look to harness the technologies that enable the us unconventional revolution where our rig technology segment is experiencing limited demand for new equipment in north america we re scheduled to deliver multiple new rigs and rig upgrade packages this year to the middle east as several countries in the region seek to upgrade their fleets we are pleased with our progress on our saudi joint venture and expect to begin delivering the first 50 modern highly efficient super spec rigs to the kingdom in 2021 offshore drilling and production continues to grow at a measured pace our wellstream processing business an industry leader in production processing technologies including monoethylene glycol regeneration units is tendering at twice the pace that it was at this time last year indicative of greater activity in the offshore as the world continues to learn more about the coronavirus outbreak we re hopeful first that authorities around the globe were able to ease the suffering that is causing so many we also hope that its impact on the world s economy broadly and the oil and gas industry specifically is short lived but we re realistic in acknowledging that globalization leaves us exposed to market uncertainty as it does for other industries we expect our scale and global footprint will help us mitigate any direct supply chain repercussions but the situation nevertheless remains fluid in early 2020 finally before i hand it over to jose i d like to finish where i began if i ve learned anything from business it s to be skeptical of conventional wisdom because collectively we are all well frequently wrong i would be surprised to see a robust global recovery emerge in the oilfield in 2020 or even 2021 so we are managing the business accordingly however i do think a recovery will emerge when no one is predicting it the only facts i know for certain is that the oil industry has seen global growth in demand for almost every single one of its 160 years and that the industry has always been highly cyclical the current time feels an awful lot like the 1990s when then as now capital providers to oil and gas were fatigued and frustrated another period of capital starvation and then as now the industry responded by trimming overcapacity history doesn t repeat itself but it does rhyme and i m encouraged that here in the sixth year of the downturn the oil and gas industry are serious about reducing it s structural oversupply there is a parallel narrative embedded in conventional wisdom about a looming energy transition one that fully displaces fossil fuels and therefore one that likely further diminishes the option value of oilfield assets at least in the minds of some investors while i m confident will transition to better forms of energy in the future the shape and pace of that transit transition are probably going to surprise us all in the near term oil and gas remain critical fuels that play a key role in for instance air travel and feeding the planet so they will be part of the energy mix for many years perhaps generations to come nevertheless an energy transition is emerging as potentially the most valuable and interesting business opportunity of the 21st century so there is one more small but important element to our strategy which is figuring out how nov can capitalize on this and how we can make money by facilitating it we quietly launch this initiative a few years ago to play offense rather than defense against this emerging backdrop we re not spending much money in this area but i have been very encouraged by what our teams are developing and i hope to be able to share more with you on future calls about the opportunities emerging for nov in this space to our employees listening around the world thank you for all that you do your resiliency your dedication your hard work made a tough year a great year for nov and jose and i could not be more thankful to have you on our team with that i ll turn it over to jose jose bayardo senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you clay nov s consolidated revenues increased 155 million to 2 28 billion or 7 sequentially as the continued momentum in international and offshore markets helped drive a 15 sequential improvement in international revenues more than offsetting the impact of a rapid decline in north american activity levels during the fourth quarter ebitda increased 26 million sequentially to 288 million driven by strong operational performance and continued progress on cost savings initiatives partially offset by favorable project closeout variances from q3 not repeating and a less favorable product sales mix in our completion production solutions and rig technology segments as clay mentioned we continue to make progress on efforts to rightsize our business and improve efficiencies across the organization and expect to realize another 24 million in annualized cost savings in the first quarter or a 6 million improvement in q1 over q4 we ve also been reducing the working capital intensity of our business we converted 246 million of working capital to cash in the fourth quarter and generated 473 million in cash flow from operations after deducting 67 million of capital expenditures free cash flow for the quarter was 406 million bringing our second half 2019 free cash flow to 689 million significantly exceeding our target despite our expectation the capital expenditures for nov will increase to around 325 million in 2020 as we ramp spending on our new rig manufacturing facility in saudi arabia we believe we will increase free cash flow by at least 100 million year over year and that working capital will be a source of cash for nov in 2020 during the fourth quarter we took measures to further strengthen our balance sheet by redeeming 1 billion of senior notes due december 2022 and issuing 500 million of new senior unsecured notes due 2029 these transactions extended the maturity of 500 million of existing debt by seven years and reduced our debt by approximately 500 million leaving us with 1 989 billion in gross debt as of december 31 cash flow generated in q4 allowed us to reduce net debt to 818 million at year end our actions demonstrate what we ve long said that defending the balance sheet is our top capital allocation priority our actions are designed to ensure nov can successfully manage tumultuous market conditions and provide the flexibility to be opportunistic with compelling high return investments that we may identify as you know nov has a share buyback authorization that is contingent on the company achieving gross debt to annualized ebitda of less than 2 times if 2020 continues to unfold as we expect we will likely begin stock buybacks later in the year a few housekeeping items before we dive into our segment level results during the fourth quarter we took 537 million in mostly non cash impairment and other charges due to the further deterioration in north american market conditions in our ongoing restructuring efforts lower intercompany sales from cross segment projects resulted in a 3 million sequential decrease in revenue eliminations in the first quarter of 2020 we expect intercompany sales to remain in line with the fourth quarter of 2019 other expenses increased 44 million sequentially and included 26 million in expenses associated with the retirement of 1 billion of our 2022 notes and a 14 million increase in foreign exchange losses and finally while our effective tax rate may continue to be volatile over the near future we expect our tax rate will average approximately 35 for 2020 moving to results from operations our wellbore technologies segment generated 764 million revenue in the fourth quarter a decrease of 29 million or 4 sequentially revenues from north america declined 13 slightly more than the fall off in drilling activity while revenues from the segment s international operations increased 7 despite the decline in revenue ebitda for the segment increased by 10 million sequentially to 143 million primarily due to the successful implementation of cost savings initiatives and structural improvements to operational efficiency across the business units in this segment our reedhycalog drill business posted a less than 1 decline in revenue due to continued weakness in the north american market that was mostly offset by growth in most international markets and continued market share gains in the us our high performing bits are allowing us to gain share and preserve pricing in a competitive market revenues in our downhole business unit fell 12 as reduced demand and increased pricing pressures in the north america were partially offset by higher revenues in most eastern hemisphere markets despite the challenges in the north american market we continue to see healthy demand for our leading edge motor elastomer and other technologies including our selectshift adjustable motors which are enabling customers to complete single run wells with greater consistency and reliability during the fourth quarter we helped the customer in the marcellus basin drill a record setting 19 132 foot single run well our m d totco business unit realized a slight increase in revenue as the contribution from our growing number of drilling automation projects and the norwegian north sea more than offset a decline in revenue for m d totco s business in north america our tuboscope business units saw revenues fall 5 sequentially revenue from the business units coating operations were down slightly and inspection service revenues fell 6 as lower drilling activity levels in the us and holidays reduced output from mills and outside processors revenues in our wellsite services business unit declined 12 sequentially on fewer us fluids jobs but the units core solids control business only experienced a 5 sequential decrease in revenues it s us operations performed in line with the 11 fall off in drilling activity that was partially offset by growing opportunities in international and offshore markets we re encouraged to have begun working on several projects in the gulf of mexico recently in addition to seeing rising demand overseas our grant prideco drill pipe business realized a sharp increase in revenues in the fourth quarter as we shipped large volumes of high spec drill pipe for international markets additionally as was the case in the third quarter more than 50 of the business units revenues were derived from offshore products while orders for drill pipe in the us have been sparse over the past few quarters customers drill pipe inventories that we hold in the us are at the lowest levels in recent history we believe any material increase in drilling activity will require a healthy increase in orders meanwhile as international customers restock diminish inventories we continue to see rising demand for our delta drill pipe connection technology looking to q1 for the wellbore technologies segment the coronavirus oil prices seasonality and evolving e p budgeting practices all remain wild cards but at this time we expect revenues for our wellbore technologies segment will decline between 6 to 12 with decremental margins in the mid 30 range our completion production solutions segment generated 799 million in revenue in the fourth quarter an increase of 71 million or 10 sequentially growing demand from offshore and international markets was partially offset by lower demand for completion equipment in us land markets ebitda increased 14 million sequentially to 96 million or 12 of sales incremental margins were limited to 20 as modestly higher sequential cost savings were offset by favorable credits related to the close out projects in q3 that did not repeat in the fourth quarter segment began realizing a considerable increase in orders during late 2018 largely driven by offshore and international projects this trend continued to the fourth quarter resulting in orders of 502 million and its fifth straight quarter with a book to bill in excess of 100 while the project pipeline remains robust for 2020 at this point we expect lower orders in the first quarter due to the timing of specific projects our fiber glass systems business unit posted an 8 sequential improvement in revenues achieving the highest levels of revenue in its history increased deliveries of spoolable pipe from our new manufacturing plant in dammam saudi arabia and marine scrubber system components needed to retrofit vessels for imo 2020 compliance drove the sequential growth but was partially offset by rapidly contracting demand in north america where orders decreased 15 sequentially we expect the need for additional scrubber systems to remain robust with experts estimating that owners of shipping vessels can achieve paybacks on their investments in less than a year based on current price spreads between low sulfur and traditional bunker fuel our intervention and stimulation equipment business realized a 3 sequential increase in revenue on strong year end shipments of coiled tubing and wireline units however margins decreased roughly 100 basis points on a less favorable product mix as revenues from pressure pumping aftermarkets parts and services declined to a level that is less than half its recent highs results from this business unit remain depressed due to the structural overcapacity of the north american completions market however the business continues to advance it s technological leadership by assisting our customers and finding new less capital intensive ways to improve profitability for themselves and their end customers our fracmaxx big bore quicklatch and frac hose products are examples that are lower cost solutions for improving operational efficiencies and safety in a cash constrained environment business is also focused on pursuing opportunities in other markets such as the middle east latin america and china where the development of tight and unconventional natural gas formations is driving equipment needs that mirror what is used in north america in the fourth quarter we booked and delivered a large package of high pressure equipment to an operator in northwestern china where there has been a rapid increase in the amount of hydraulic fracturing activities and as therefore experiencing a corresponding increase in demand for high pressure flowline equipment in the chongqing and jiangyin gas fields our process and flow technologies business unit realized revenue growth in each of the unit s major product lines the unit s production midstream product offerings saw a sequential decrease in demand in north america that was more than offset by large shipments of pump packages to india and an uptick in sales of production chokes including the first batch of chokes built in our new manufacturing facility in dammam saudi arabia business unit also realized its third straight quarter of improved results from its offshore market focused wellstream processing and apl mooring product offerings primarily driven by growing lng related activity headlining the order book was a monoethylene glycol regeneration and reclamation unit for an lng project in mozambique and in order for our newly developed electrostatic coalescer technology epack that will be installed at the equinor johan sverdrup tendering activity for the offshore market remains the strongest in recent memory which is reflected in the business ability to post a book to bill in excess of 150 and which should begin to allow for incremental pricing improvements during the year our subsea flexible pipe business posted a 15 sequential increase in revenues but at low flow through as the market for flexible pipe remains very price competitive bookings improved from the third quarter generating a book to bill of 134 and included more than 56 miles of flexible pipeline systems for a project in the north sea our team continues to use as technology advantages to focus on higher value add projects for the first quarter of 2020 we expect revenues from our completion production solutions segment to decline 10 to 15 sequentially with decremental ebitda margins in the upper 20 to lower 30 range our rig technologies segment generated 759 million in revenue in the fourth quarter an increase of 110 million a sharp increase in land rig equipment sales including sales of older inventory at low margins and improved progress on offshore projects drove the 17 sequential improvement in revenue however an unfavorable shift in product mix together with old inventory we ve moved at a discount were only partially offset by cost savings which limited incremental margins and resulted in a 7 million increase in ebitda to 112 million or 14 8 of sales orders declined 10 million or 5 to 211 million in the fourth quarter and the total segment backlog at year end was 2 99 billion sharp improvement in land revenues resulted from a significant increase in year end equipment deliveries and better progress on land rig projects during the fourth quarter we booked orders for six land rigs destined for multiple customers in the middle east with three of the rig orders specifying our novos control system we are seeing nocs more frequently pushing their contractors to provide high spec land drilling rigs that can meaningfully improve performance and operator returns the growing number of international operators pursuing development of tight gas formations is accelerating the demand for this equipment and similar to what we re seeing in our intervention and stimulation equipment business unit the equipment these customers are seeking is beginning to look like the high spec equipment found in west texas we ve seen this in argentina for several years and are now seeing customers across the middle east and asia pursue 1 500 horsepower rig packages with three gensets that are almost identical to what we re selling into the us during the fourth quarter we also realized a substantial increase in revenues from deliveries of offshore capital equipment and from improved progress on our offshore wind construction vessel projects we continue to see gradual improvement in offshore markets with steady demand for rig equipment and technology upgrades as well as a growing opportunity set for our marine construction business including replacement cranes for fpsos equipment for pipelay vessels and additional offshore wind construction vessels nov continues to leverage our core competencies to assist in the development of solutions that help our customers reduce their environmental footprint while also improving operational efficiencies in the fourth quarter we introduced our powerblade hybrid system that is currently being installed on a rig in the norwegian continental shelf powerblade allows drilling contractors to reduce their carbon footprint and fuel costs by recycling the captured energy back into the rig we estimate that the powerblade system will allow the drilling contractor to reduce diesel consumptions by 771 000 gallons per year saving them 1 75 million in cash reducing 110 tons of nox emissions per year and reducing their carbon footprint or co2 emissions by 6 200 tons per year revenues from our rig aftermarket operations were flat sequentially due to a decrease in spare part sales that resulted from budget exhaustion that sit in with our customers near the end of the year additionally the significant increase in the number of rigs enrolled in our total cost of ownership programs moderates the q4 uplift we ve historically seen in our service and repair operations we ve increased the number of offshore rigs in our programs to 83 at year end and an increase of over 2 4 times since the end of 2018 in the first quarter of 2020 we expect lower deliveries of capital equipment to be partially offset by a slight increase in aftermarket sales resulting in a 10 to 15 sequential decrease in revenues and a 100 basis point to 300 basis point reduction in ebitda margins while we know there is much more work to be done in 2020 we were pleased with the strong finish to 2019 and the progress the organization made on key initiatives throughout the year actions taken by the talented hard working employees of nov allowed us to balance our efforts to reduce costs and improve operational efficiencies with advancing our technologies and supporting our customers with cost effective solutions those actions have nov well positioned for the future with that we ll now open the call to questions questions and answers operator our first question comes from byron pope with tudor pickering holt company your line is now open byron pope tudor pickering holt co analyst good morning guys clay c williams president chairman and chief executive officer hi byron jose bayardo senior vice president and chief financial officer hi byron byron pope tudor pickering holt co analyst clay recognizing the extra uncertainty injected into the market by the recent pullback in brent prices could you just frame for us at a high level how you think about the international growth drivers among the three business segments again just at a high level clay c williams president chairman and chief executive officer yes we re big picture north america we expect to i think like everyone else to enter a slowdown continued slowdown in activity and we re preparing for that but we re more much more encouraged overseas and in offshore markets in particular so that continues to move higher and what we re hearing from our customers is that they re moving forward with a lot of projects that they ve been working on reducing costs and engineering and over the last several years and so excited about that for 2020 and then the middle east has continued to remain very active and as you re well aware we ve increased our presence in those markets and are encouraged by the needs that our customers have there for equipment and technologies that nov provides so generally north america drifting down in offshore and international moving up current oil price volatility notwithstanding byron byron pope tudor pickering holt co analyst thanks and then my second question just again in qualitative terms could you as you think back on the five incremental nov growth drivers growth opportunities that you guys laid out back at the 2018 analyst day just from your perspective how things are progressing again notwithstanding the near term north america headwinds but just how those have played out relative to your expectations clay c williams president chairman and chief executive officer well the main thing i m most proud of is our continued investment in technologies and products through the downturn and we certainly highlighted that in our analyst day which was well over a year ago and in a very different sort of commodity price environment but i look back on the progress we ve made really since the downturn started i think you know we ve probably introduced more new products and new technologies than any of our peers out there we launched our novos sort of test rig at the very end of 2014 and that s been responsible for dozens of products and technologies we ve come out with very impactful digital solutions through this time period predictive analytics for bops for example are novos operating system our goconnect digital products things like that and so i think we ve balanced the cost cutting in the retrenchment that has been necessary with continuing to invest in the long term future of the company and the technologies that are going to make that happen and so i m very proud of our organization in terms of progress on these things and i think a lot of ways through the downturn we ve been focused on addition to efficiencies and getting better working capital management i m really laying the foundation for what the next up cycle looks like byron pope tudor pickering holt co analyst thanks clay appreciate it clay c williams president chairman and chief executive officer you bet thank you byron operator thank you our next question comes from tommy moll with stephens inc your line is now open tommy moll stephens inc analyst good morning and thanks for taking my questions clay c williams president chairman and chief executive officer good morning tommy tommy moll stephens inc analyst so i wanted to touch on the portfolio review that you ve been undertaking for some time now it s clear it s a returns driven analysis that you re running through and so my question is as you re evaluating what to keep and what to prune how many years forward are you willing to look for a business line or a unit to hit the kind of returns that you d like to see to keep it in the portfolio and the reason i m asking is clearly offshore and international have some momentum but we need to play that forward for some reasonable time horizon to get comfortable to where you re willing to underwrite so anything you could do to help us frame that up would be helpful clay c williams president chairman and chief executive officer yes that s a great question i m going to let blake chime in here in a minute because he s heading up this effort but i would say it depends on the potential to achieve what we always aim at in the application of capital which is a defensible business that has a demonstrable competitive advantage over the long haul is the ultimate goal and so when we look at these different businesses and kind of the current state of affairs and the current state of their markets and so forth we take a view necessarily on what s the likelihood and probability that we ll get to that state that defensible competitive advantage in a reasonable period of time and so i would say our patience level is somewhat dependent upon the potential payoff and attractiveness of that particular business opportunity but it s really kind of opportunity by opportunity that we evaluate this blake mccarthy vice president corporate development investor relations yes tommy i think we touched on this last quarter but this is not just a quantitative exercise but also qualitative and so we just take a step back and say like oh if this business is below the return threshold but it s been bouncing along the bottom of the down cycle and we could see a clear tangible path to the orders have completely pivoted on this one and done a full 180 we re not going to sell at the bottom of its earnings potential now i will say we have quite touched upon our patience level for a lot of these that did all below the threshold we were able to implement some discrete action plans that are in process right now that we will reevaluate and most of these action plans only take about three to nine months so it s just more self help which is part of our job is managing these businesses and those that we find are to be unfixable those will be evaluated for divestiture or just pure exit clay c williams president chairman and chief executive officer yes that s our first inclination is around we re paying to fix these things and run these things and so are there steps we can take first so that s probably where our default is for businesses that fall below the threshold initially tommy moll stephens inc analyst very helpful thank you both and as a follow up i wanted to double back on the international and offshore outlook again looks like we ll be up for 2020 versus the prior year just in terms of the addressable market there are there any particular aspects where you think nov could maybe outperform the broader market business lines or parts of the world where you re most excited that you would call out for us clay c williams president chairman and chief executive officer yes probably what we re we re certainly well known for drilling equipment offshore rigs all things with drilling what s probably less well known by investors on wall street is the fact that we ve sort of quietly assembled a really interesting portfolio of products that are more focused on production going into fpsos fixed platforms processes around production in terms of sand separation oil water separation monoethylene glycol regeneration units things like that and so i m really really proud of that portfolio and i think there s really interesting opportunities that are going to continue to emerge in the offshore where nov is likely to play maybe a little larger role than we would have in a prior upturn tommy moll stephens inc analyst thank you that s all for me and i ll turn it back clay c williams president chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from chase mulvehill with bank of america your line is now open chase mulvehill bank of america merrilll lynch analyst hey good morning so i guess clay you talked a bit about kind of energy transition and so i m just kind of curious if you can kind of flush it out a little bit more here and kind to talk about your strategy toward energy transition and maybe organically what you re doing and then also maybe on the m a side clay c williams president chairman and chief executive officer yes first i d say that we have a presence in this space going back many years and in fact many decades with respect to geothermal for instance where you probably be hard pressed to find a geothermal well that doesn t have nov technology involved with it anywhere in the globe and then secondly i think last year we had a couple of announcements around offshore wind installation vessels which is a space that nov has a very has a market leading position in terms of the technologies and vessels install offshore wind turbines and so we ve been in renewables for going back a long time my comments in the prepared remarks though really are just to let you know that we re thinking about other ways to participate in this and viewing it as potentially a terrific business opportunity when i think about energy energy really is all about infrastructure about capital deployment historically pivoting from one form of energy to another is sort of a decade long process but involves enormous amounts of capital it involves project execution it involves application of technology it involves creative ideas nov has a lot of those in abundance and so i do think there s a role here that we can play and in helping make that happen but what i want to stress is we re aiming at capital returns coming out of that at the opportunity to develop technologies and services and methods that help in that transition but also earn excellent returns for our shareholders and so that s how i m framing this i don t have a lot more to add to that other than what i said earlier some ideas in the space that we think are unique that potentially can turn into a really interesting and profitable businesses and but we i generally don t won t get into the details until we re earning making revenue with these things chase mulvehill bank of america merrilll lynch analyst okay great thanks clay i guess if we kind of come to the supply chain a little bit and think about the coronavirus you mentioned it a little bit there s obviously a direct impact and maybe some direct indirect impact as we think about the supply chain being so interconnected is there a certain segment that we should look at and try to understand better about the impact from what s going on over in china and then help us understand how much of that is actually in your guide on their blake jose bayardo senior vice president and chief financial officer hi chase it s jose i ll fill this and clay can chime in but no it is a situation that is evolving rapidly and it s something that we re monitoring very closely so i think our base exposure to this is more from a supply chain standpoint than it is from a customer revenue opportunity set but as we did talk about in some of the prepared remarks china is an emerging and growing market for our end products in which we re having more and more success with our differentiated technology offerings we do have a very global and diversified supply chain but as we sit here today and we re looking at an extended shutdown of the china new year holiday system that is impacting our ability to produce certain products to a certain degree at this point we still have a lot of latitude to make up lost ground but if this were to extend much longer there are areas for instance within our fiber glass business where we have limitations in terms of the amount of resin that s on the ground at our manufacturing plants right now so there s some risk there but so far so good similar type of exposure related to drill pipe manufacturing other businesses to a lesser extent but so far we think our team is managing through it pretty effectively but still a lot of uncertainty related to the extent to which this will impact operations clay c williams president chairman and chief executive officer yes and those are sort of first order impacts i m equally concerned about second quarter impacts which is the impact that this has on global demand for oil what it s done in the commodity price markets and go to the point kind of what it does to the psychology of oil and gas producers as they think about how much to drill in 2020 so it s as we said the situation remains very fluid chase mulvehill bank of america merrilll lynch analyst yes understood all right i will turn back over thanks clay c williams president chairman and chief executive officer thank you chase operator thank you our next question comes from scott gruber with citigroup your line is now open scott gruber citigroup analyst yes good morning clay c williams president chairman and chief executive officer hi scott jose bayardo senior vice president and chief financial officer hi scott scott gruber citigroup analyst turning to c p how should we think about the c p margin profile over the course of 2020 i m just thinking about the interplay between the mix shift in the revenue stream toward more international and offshore but also the cost out program i know you don t want to provide too many specifics beyond one quarter out but just any general color on how that margin profile should progress given that interplay jose bayardo senior vice president and chief financial officer yes scott it s jose i ll start off on this one so we re not going to really deviate from the typical way we describe in terms of thinking about margin progression for the cap segment which is really think of it in terms of incremental margins basically dollar dropping between 0 25 to 0 35 down to the ebitda line and obviously that is dependent on the mix of the business and really what you re getting at is with the decline that we re seeing in demand for equipment in the north american market and the solid growth that we re seeing overseas particularly for offshore markets typically some of those offshore projects in the early phases of recovery have been slightly more challenged from a margin perspective but as clay alluded to and i think we touched on a couple of times during our prepared remarks with the amount of tendering activity we think we re starting to now see more opportunities for pricing improvements but here as we stand today you also need to think about the latency time associated with some of these offshore projects where they sort of reside in our backlog a bit longer than the shorter cycle north american centric product offering so what s going through converting to revenue right now is to a large degree stuff that was booked 9 12 months ago and so as we start capturing better pricing we should see the incremental margin profile improve along with being further supported by the cost cutting initiative efforts that we have under way scott gruber citigroup analyst got you but overall for the year do you think that we should be thinking about that are lighter than normal margins or given some of the pricing trends you end up doing closer to the normal incremental for the year clay c williams president chairman and chief executive officer i think on a blended basis it s more there s a lot of puts and takes here jose bayardo senior vice president and chief financial officer a lot of parts and pieces so i would assume fairly normal scott gruber citigroup analyst okay and then maybe if you could just give us a quick update on the rental initiative that you guys really push forward a couple of years ago particularly on the drilling tools side of the business but even more broadly just an update on the rental model initiative particularly as the international markets pick up further in 2020 clay c williams president chairman and chief executive officer scott you re talking about our drilling tools business the rental we have a couple of rental business around i think you re talking about the investment we ve made in directional drilling technologies rotary steerables and selectshift and we d tell you that we re continuing to gain traction in that we ve got three different rotary steerable tools in the marketplace including what we think is the lowest cost a very highly differentiated rotary steerable tool our selectshift motor that we introduced last year which is the adjustable bent housing motor that could be adjusted downhole a very large operator in the us is testing that this week we ve had a lot of excitement around that mwd tools also that we have in the space so we re continuing to make progress in here but that strategy was built on the recognition that unconventional drilling unconventional shales really rely on geosteering on horizontal drilling and it is a kind of enabling and key technology for unconventional technologies or unconventional shales that nov has an opportunity here to be a larger provider of technology into that space jose bayardo senior vice president and chief financial officer and maybe one thing i d just add just so there s no confusion about it so as clay mentioned there s a number of areas where we do provide rentals of equipment the space that we re talking about is a combination of both rentals and sales but just want to make it clear that we re somewhat agnostic on that but what we do want to make clear is that this is not a service that we are providing we are enabling those directional drilling service companies out there clay c williams president chairman and chief executive officer yes scott gruber citigroup analyst got it appreciate the color clay c williams president chairman and chief executive officer you bet thank you operator thank you our next question comes from kurt hallead with rbc capital markets your line is now open kurt hallead rbc capital markets analyst hey good morning everybody clay c williams president chairman and chief executive officer hi kurt kurt hallead rbc capital markets analyst hey clay thanks for that historical perspective resonates with me that s for sure so in the context of what you guys see going forward and clay yes nov s always been at the forefront of evolving on the technology front and creating some value propositions that ultimately oil companies and service companies find useful you threw out that teaser about some things that you re working on in the hopper can you maybe elaborate a little bit maybe give us a little bit more of a teaser as to what kind of value propositions you may be looking at for the next leg of growth for nov clay c williams president chairman and chief executive officer on renewables i m going to demur on that on the are you talking about renewals or you re talking about traditional oilfield kurt kurt hallead rbc capital markets analyst well i ll go wherever you want to take it clay so if you want to demur on renewables that s fine clay c williams president chairman and chief executive officer well as a matter of fact we like we much prefer to talk about things that are in the marketplace that are starting to get traction and so in terms of what i m most excited about really the predictive analytics products that we introduced a few years ago continue to gain traction i think jose referenced the growing number of rigs in our programs we re monitoring equipment and able to predict in advance operational challenges before those happen novos operating system for drilling rigs both land and offshore is gaining a lot of traction and really beginning to contribute meaningfully our wired drill pipe intelliserv data transmission downhole data transmission technology combined with machine learning and artificial intelligence is improving results for operators in fact there s a great article in this month s journal of petroleum technology about what we ve done for us driller in space and so i again just to reiterate could not be more proud of sort of the enhancements that we have going on and those are actually just a few of many many things that nov has introduced through the downturn kurt hallead rbc capital markets analyst got it and then just a follow up in the context i appreciate that color by the way in the context of the capital allocation you indicated that if all goes well you could be potentially in a position to kind of restart a share repo program just kind of curious as to the decision framework between the say the share repo versus maybe bumping the dividend a bit any insights would be appreciated on that front clay c williams president chairman and chief executive officer well thank you yes with respect to where our stock has been trading we think there s good value in that and have gone through that in a great detail with our board we ll continue to look at it by the way but we re i think the way we view that right now is that share repurchase is preferred but the key thing is that our capital priorities remain unchanged in all of our you look back to 2019 all of our actions were really geared toward continuing to improve we implement a lot of cost savings that are driving better ebitda we refinanced and paid down a lot of our debt and so we re continuing to work toward being in achieving the credit metrics that we talked about that will pave the way for a greater level of capital return to shareholders kurt hallead rbc capital markets analyst okay thanks appreciate that operator thank you our next question comes from sean meakim with jp morgan your line is now open sean meakim jp morgan analyst thank you good morning clay c williams president chairman and chief executive officer good morning sean sean meakim jp morgan analyst maybe i ll try to ask the prior question just with the different angle so in terms of the free cash guide for 2020 and uses of that cash so we noted buybacks could be coming earlier this year obviously dividends well covered capex may be a bit elevated this year but that s discrete very specific you ve also in effect supplemented some of your capex spend with technology bolt ons over time has been a big part of the strategy this cycle in particular is something like 200 million a good run rate for bolt ons just i m trying to capture other uses of cash that could come before the buybacks in 20 clay c williams president chairman and chief executive officer yes that s a great point sean we re always looking at opportunities in the m a space and i think we ve been pretty transparent about that and so what i d say is in 2019 and this sort of fits with my prepared comments around the fact that oilfield assets and equities have gotten a lot cheaper in the current environment and so we re always looking at kind of what s the next best application of nov s shareholders capital and to the and that m a outlook changes from time to time as we kind of work through the year blake mccarthy vice president corporate development investor relations yes sean this is blake here i d just like to add that we both clay and our board gives us the flexibility like we don t have a run rate on like a target for acquisitions for a year every acquisition is an individual investment decision that we raised that we also compare relative to the investment in our own stock so at this point like i think there s a lot of opportunities out there it s a very crowded field of sellers right now and a very limited set of buyers so we think that there could be some attractive valuations out there but we re going to be very very patient sean meakim jp morgan analyst got it thank you for that that s helpful feedback and then so well done to see all the efforts on working capital start to come through and convert the cash and that s been a top priority especially for jose so with the 4q results and your expectation that working capital will be a source of cash again in 20 just curious to get any updated thoughts on seasonality as we go through the year in terms of working capital and then just how you re targeting working capital efficiency by the end of 2020 or 21 maybe any updated thoughts around working capital to sales or dsos inventory turns dpos etc jose bayardo senior vice president and chief financial officer yes i don t think we ll get super granular in terms of specifying the targets but what i would like to spend just a moment talking about is that what we are seeing is a lot of good progress and a lot of good momentum by a lot of hard working people across the organization we ve been at it a while but obviously the results really started to come through in the second half of 2019 and we have a lot more work to do but with the momentum that we have and opportunities that we ve identified we re confident and our ability to harvest more cash from our working capital and just become a lot more capital efficient as we progress through 2020 so we finished 2019 with that working capital to revenue run rate just a tiny bit over 30 which was a good outcome for us now what we re really going to be focused on during 2020 and you asked the question related to seasonality it s really going to be more focused on the average level of working capital intensity really throughout the life of the organization so a lot of progress through the course of the year but if you look at the average for 2019 average the starting balance sheet and ending balance sheet apply the total annual revenue to it that was 37 so we re trending in the right direction but we certainly want that average to come way down during the course of 2020 and that would put us at a q4 run rate that will be better than where we finish this year sean meakim jp morgan analyst fair enough that s really helpful thank you clay c williams president chairman and chief executive officer you bet blake mccarthy vice president corporate development investor relations thanks sean operator thank you our next question comes from vebs vaishnav with scotiabank your line is now open jose bayardo senior vice president and chief financial officer hi vebs vebs vaishnav scotiabank analyst hey good morning and a very good quarter i guess just a clarification you guys talked about 230 million of cost savings is i guess i just want to confirm that that s comparable to the 200 million number earlier that you had guys guided to jose bayardo senior vice president and chief financial officer yes yes we found another 30 million in annualized both those numbers are annualized cost savings as compared to our structure in the first quarter of 2019 vebs vaishnav scotiabank analyst got it okay c p orders you talked about it could be somewhat lower in 1q can you just talk about what kind of visibility do you have beyond that and that s both for c p orders and rig tech orders can we sustain what we saw by in the first q can we sustain what we saw in 2019 clay c williams president chairman and chief executive officer well q4 was i think our fifth quarter in a row of book to bill north of 1 for completion and production solutions a lot of these orders particularly for offshore projects we have a lot of lead time into because there s a lot of work that goes into them sometimes there s feed studies behind them things like that and so a lot of the near term the downturn that we expect in q1 in orders in completion production solutions it s really just the timing of how those things fall and but that notwithstanding what i m most encouraged about is the fact that our tendering activity across the portions of completion production solutions that are focused on the offshore remains very strong i think we mentioned that our pft group for instance the pipeline there is twice what it was a year ago and so it feels to us like the offshore infrastructure is continuing to move forward and that s a really good backdrop i think to move into 2020 with respect to orders for completion production solutions vebs vaishnav scotiabank analyst great and maybe just one last question for me and on the guidance for wellbore so it sounds it seems like yes you guys did like only down revenues 4 versus guidance of 5 to 7 so like not very different from the guidance you talked about north america only declined 11 so never spectacular in 4q i was a little surprised by the guidance of down 6 to 12 for 1q i think like you talked about china and could have an impact could you just elaborate like what is guiding that and how should we think about north america versus international in the guidance clay c williams president chairman and chief executive officer yes part of the overachievement in q4 was a higher drill pipe sales than we had expected going into the quarter part of our expectation for q1 is that turns around that s a little lumpier than some of the other businesses within wellbore technologies jose bayardo senior vice president and chief financial officer and i d also add you look at the guidance across the board related to the sequential decline from q4 to q1 we do look back the last couple of years in terms of the fall off that we ve had from q4 to q1 feels like that the e p budgeting process both within north america and the international markets is getting a little bit more prolonged and gets certainly gets amplified when you add in a pullback in commodity prices and the fears related to the coronavirus so that is certainly factored in to an extent into the q1 guidance clay c williams president chairman and chief executive officer yes one more thing we like a lot of business for instance has seasonality exposure in russia and the rockies and places like that so it s just our expectation is that that will all contribute to wellbore technologies moving down in q1 vebs vaishnav scotiabank analyst got it that s very helpful thank you for taking my call clay c williams president chairman and chief executive officer you bet thank you operator thank you that concludes our question and answer session i would now like to turn the call back over to clay williams for any further remarks clay c williams president chairman and chief executive officer i want to thank everyone for joining today and in particular i want to take the opportunity once again to thank any

february 08 2020 12 02 am updated 01 30 am ist india s international trade posture appeared to turn protectionist in the past week with two indicators the government sent out the first which played out live on television was contained in the union budget announced by finance minister nirmala sitharaman on february 1 the other that went virtually unnoticed was that india declined to attend a meeting of trade negotiators in bali february 3 4 that was discussing the next step in the association of southeast asian nations asean led regional comprehensive economic partnership rcep trade agreement laying out the budget for the year ms sitharaman made several references to the problems with free trade and preferential trade agreements ftas and ptas raised tariffs on the import of more than 50 items and changed the customs act provisions substantially to penalise imports suspected to originate from third countries ms sitharaman told parliament it has been observed that imports under free trade agreements ftas are on the rise undue claims of fta benefits have posed threat to domestic industry such imports require stringent checks adding that the government will ensure that all ftas are aligned to the conscious direction of our policy while the motive may be to protect indian markets from dumping primarily by chinese goods the consequence of the changes will be to put indian importers on notice and discourage imports in general describing a new chapter incorporated into the act the finance minister said the aim is to put certain obligations on importers even as the government reserves the right to modify or cancel preferential tariffs and ban the import or export of any goods that it deems fit rise in trade deficits the government s problem with ftas was a key theme in its decision to walk out of the rcep negotiations of 16 countries in november 2019 where prime minister narendra modi and members of his cabinet cited the rise in trade deficits with fta partners the government says it will now review all those agreements in particular tas signed with the 10 nation asean grouping fta japan comprehensive economic partnership agreement or cepa and south korea cepa and wants to correct asymmetry in negotiations with new partners this is easier said than done if india makes a complete break with rcep as its absence from the bali meeting indicates it is determined to negotiating the bilateral trade agreements tas will not be a priority for the other countries until rcep is done the process of legal scrubbing is likely to take most of the year and any talks with india will probably only follow that it is also hard to see any of them being able to offer india a better deal bilaterally once they are bound into the multilateral rcep agreement the case of the comprehensive economic cooperation agreement ceca being negotiated with australia which mr modi hopes to give a boost to when australian prime minister scott morrison visits will be a difficult task not the least due to its history india and australia began ceca talks in 2011 mr modi and then australian prime minister tony abbott had even set a deadline of december 2015 to complete ceca however talks hit a dead end in september 2015 with the focus on rcep no progress has been made since then tough road ahead a similar scenario awaits the announcement of the india united kingdom fta talks british prime minister boris johnson is to visit delhi in the next few months while mr modi heads to the u k in november for an environmental summit and their bilateral bonhomie is expected to boost chances of an fta post brexit however it is unlikely that the u k will actually be able to talk until next year after terms for the u k s full withdrawal from the european union eu are completed for the same reason india s talks with the eu for a bilateral trade and investment agreement btia are unlikely to make much headway this year although they will be in the spotlight when mr modi travels to brussels for the eu india summit next month there both sides will have to decide how to revive from where they left off in 2013 making the negotiations harder is the government s decision to scrap all bilateral investment treaties with 57 countries including eu nations and bringing in a new bilateral investment treaty bit model in 2015 only three countries kyrgyzstan belarus and most recently brazil have agreed to sign a new investment treaty based on that model finally there is the much anticipated resolution of u s india trade issues ahead of the visit of u s president donald trump expected in the last week of february that could also talks on an fta at present there have only been some non paper talks on the issue and given that the u s has expressed deep misgivings about india s bit model these talks will also take several years to come to fruition no safety net while the absence of a ta with any country does not mean that trade will not grow other changes in the world trading order may become significant hindrances when added to this present scenario the decline of multilateralism accelerated by retrenchment of the u s and china s intransigence have all meant the world trade organization wto has lost steam as a world arbiter this leaves states that are not part of arrangements without a safety net on dispute settlement mechanisms second the government has invoked the massive 57 billion trade deficit with china to explain protectionist measures but it forgets its own trade surpluses with smaller economies particularly in the neighbourhood where indian exports form more than 80 of total trade with nepal bangladesh bhutan and sri lanka respectively even with pakistan before india cancelled most favoured nation mfn status and pakistan suspended all trade in 2019 india s exports stood at about 2 06 billion of a total of 2 55 billion rise of regional agreements third it is clear that most of the world is now divided into regional ftas including the north american free trade agreement nafta for north america the southern common market mercosur for its spanish initials for south america the eu the eurasian economic union russia and neighbours the african continental free trade agreement afcfta the gulf cooperation council gcc fta in west asia and now the biggest of them all rcep which minus india represents a third of the world s population and just under a third of its gdp with the door to rcep all but closed and the south asian association for regional cooperation saarc virtually abandoned india is not a part of any regional fta finally the trend across the world does not favour trade in services the way it does in goods as most countries have turned migration averse india s strength in the services sector and its demand for more mobility for indian employees is thus becoming another sticky point in fta negotiations the debate over trade is as much about india s leadership ambitions in the world and the factors that could inhibit its rise it would be hard to argue that india can rise in asia without closer trade links with the east or the backing of south asia india s demographic might is certainly attractive for international investors but only if that vast market has purchasing power and is not riven by social unrest and instability historically the decline of colonial powers and more ancient empires can be traced to times when they turned inward and disengaged from foreign trade it flows logically that in the modern economically interconnected and technologically inseparable world india s global rise cannot but be accompanied by an open mind on trade as well suhasini h thehindu co in

in 2019 retailers including payless shoesource dress barn and barney s closed 9 200 stores payless alone cut 16 000 jobs already this year chains including macy s pier 1 and fairway have announced closures and layoffs employment in retail in january was down 8 percent from the same time last year according to new bureau of labor statistics bls data released friday morning at the same time jobs in transportation and warehousing industries critical for e commerce were up 28 percent department stores have shed 241 000 employees in the last five years according to bls data and clothing stores cut 67 000 jobs but there is no national outcry as workers like reich lose their jobs no movement to protect the people being thrust out of work calling for an end to store closures or to find funding to ensure these workers end up in better jobs sure there was a savebarneys campaign but it traded on nostalgia featuring vintage tv spots and magazine ads rather than on concern for workers and it failed the high end retailer which filed for bankruptcy last year was sold to authentic brands group which started closing and liquidating stores in november compare this with the commotions that have surrounded smaller job losses in industries such as manufacturing or mining when carrier an air conditioning company said it was moving 1 400 jobs to mexico then candidate donald j trump seized on the issue in his stump speech and eventually struck a deal to keep some of the jobs in indiana we hear politicians talk about the loss of factories and manufacturing and mining but there has not been the same level of outcry around the loss of retail jobs says nicole mason the president of the institute for women s policy research a think tank based in washington d c i would conjecture that one of the reasons we re not talking about it is that it impacts predominantly women nearly 80 percent of cashiers were women in 2018 according to iwpr data as online shopping grows and employment in warehouses grows retail jobs for women are shrinking while men s jobs are growing an iwpr analysis found that the retail industry lost 54 300 jobs between 2016 and 2017 over that time women lost 160 300 jobs while men gained 106 000 in the past when factories shut down or jobs moved overseas the government stepped in to protect workers who lost their jobs the federal trade adjustment assistance taa program first authorized in 1962 and expanded in 1974 2002 and 2009 assists workers whose jobs have been displaced because of trade it offers training subsidies and a weekly income for people who have run out of unemployment benefits workers over 50 who find new jobs at a lower wage than they d been making can also receive money from a wage insurance program to supplement their new income but those funds aren t available to retail workers because they weren t trade affected they can t get that monthly stipend says liz skenandore a career services specialist at great lakes training and development in wisconsin who deals with a steady flow of laid off retail workers it would be ideal if there was a you were affected due to the internet category similarly in the 1980s after a series of factory shutdowns in the rust belt a group of ohio legislators pushed for the warn act which required employers to give advance notice of mass layoffs and plant closings and to pay back wages if they did not provide that warning around the same time under pressure from unions congress created manufacturing extension partnership programs which use federal state and private dollars to retrain displaced manufacturing workers for jobs in high demand fields another thing sue reich didn t receive when she was laid off from shopko severance pay she spent decades working for the company and says she was told that if she worked through the store s liquidation she d receive severance but shopko never paid reich or workers like her anything beyond a small sum for vacation days they hadn t taken it s been challenging every month says reich who scrambled to find another job and now works part time at a credit union though it has not turned into full time work as she had hoped her husband a saw operator at a factory is working overtime so the family can pay its bills in contrast the thousands of workers who have lost jobs at places such as general motors and ford over the past year have received months of severance pay based on the amount of time they had worked at the companies sun capital a private equity firm that owned shopko did not respond to time s request for comment it s no accident that there are government policies protecting workers in industries such as manufacturing these are industries that have long been unionized and in the 1980s and 1990s as the united states negotiated trade deals such as nafta unions worked with elected officials from districts that were in danger of losing factories says kate bronfenbrenner a professor at cornell university s school of industrial and labor relations they made sure that any trade deal included programs to help workers who would be displaced to sell the trade deal congress had to agree to fund worker retraining and subsidy programs lawrence katz a harvard economist who served in the labor department under president clinton says the administration tried to introduce a universal dislocated worker training program in the 1990s that would have helped retrain any displaced worker but couldn t get widespread support but retail is disappearing not because of a trade deal but because the way consumers buy things is changing tech companies like amazon didn t have to negotiate with congress to be able to sell things online they could just start doing it that s meant that there is no constituency that must make sure retail workers end up on their feet in order to get a bill passed when people lose their jobs in the service sector and retail sector those are women and people of color and there is no congressional constituent for them like the ones that were negotiating the trade bill bronfenbrenner says factory shutdowns are visually jarring hulking abandoned factories dot landscapes across the united states in detroit entrepreneurs made a business out of giving tours of the ruin retail s meltdown is also visually jarring but is hidden inside america s malls time recently walked through a mall in green bay wisconsin that had lost a shopko and payless store and there were twice as many vacant stores as operating ones the lights were off in large sections of the mall that were blocked off with crime tape and the only foot traffic was women in workout clothes walking the long wide corridors for exercise in the cold winter months as more sudden retail layoffs happen jack raisner a professor of law at st john s university says he sees an opening for states or the federal government to pass more protections for retail workers he recently helped new jersey pass a bill that updates the warn act to apply to more retail workers which he hopes will inspire similar bills in other states the new jersey bill which was signed into law last month was a response to mass layoffs that left hundreds of toys r us workers who had worked through the holidays with the promise of severance without any such pay he says it says that any company that employees at least 50 people in the state is required to give 90 days notice of a mass layoff without such notice it must pay all laid off workers at least four weeks of back pay if they don t give 90 days notice employers must also pay terminated employees one week s pay for every year they ve worked there putting people out on the street after years of service without anything is a horror and a tax on the public says raisner he also worked with senators sherrod brown of ohio and chuck schumer of new york to craft the fair warning act of 2019 which would update the warn act nationally the bill was introduced in november the anxiety over these layoffs is unabated despite what everyone says about this economy raisner says i think there s a real grassroots movement interested in something happening about this though business owners in new jersey say that the state s new law will deter companies from coming to the state broader protections for retail workers in the form of retraining or re education programs could be good for the larger economy as technology changes the nature of work people who get more education or increase their skills are best positioned to do the types of jobs that computers and robots can t yet do this in turn grows the nation s productivity rate and its economy now technological change is happening faster than ever before mckinsey estimates that by 2030 growing automation will mean that as many as 375 million workers 14 percent of the global workforce will need to switch occupational categories in retail where the average hourly wage for people who aren t managers is just 16 86 laid off workers don t have the resources to stop working for six months or two years to get a certification or degree in another industry for the most part these workers are living paycheck to paycheck and the idea of being without a job is scary says anthony snyder the chief executive officer of the fox valley workforce development board in northeast wisconsin which helps laid off workers find new jobs that s why many retail workers are on what snyder calls the retail merry go round where their employer dissolves or closes down they find another retail related job and then get laid off from it too amanda padgett has been on this merry go round for years padgett a 36 year old mother of two was laid off from shopko last year before that she worked at an ice cream store and a call center for a national retail chain that laid off all its employees with each layoff she has wanted to go back to school and get a degree in something that would get her out of retail maybe learning to become a medical coder or a radiology tech but as long as she needs to pay the rent put food on the table and take care of her kids she needs to bring in a paycheck so she finds herself in another low wage job making minimum wage until it too ends when she heard the rumblings last year that shopko was closing padgett says all i could think was here we go again the united states has systematically disinvested in resources that would help low wage workers without a big financial cushion go back to school federal investments in workforce training have fallen 40 percent over the past 15 years when adjusted for inflation according to the national skills coalition a group that advocates for worker training this means many federally funded job centers only offer perfunctory classes such as building a resume or using a computer rather than the type of longer term interventions that typically help people switch careers says amanda bergson shilcock a senior fellow at the national skills coalition you have a lot of workforce boards trying to figure out what interventions they can provide that are meaningful to the lives of workers and responsive to the needs of the industry says bergson shilcock but at the same time they re doing it with less and less money from the federal level there are some scattershot examples of states trying to help retail workers specifically in wisconsin a grant for laid off retail workers will pay for tuition for retraining in high demand fields as well as help with mortgage payments and cover books transportation and child care it s helped people like ginger gillis 42 who did data entry for shopko for 14 years until the company closed gillis always wanted to go back to school but never could make the financials work she s now getting an associate s degree in architectural technology from northeast wisconsin technical college but gillis has an advantage her husband has a good job which means she doesn t have to worry about having an income while she s going back to school many retail workers don t have a nest egg so they run into the next retail job before we can even talk to them says snyder of the fox valley workforce development board only 27 of the 400 dislocated retail workers in his district have taken advantage of the grant and even then he s run out of money to give out there is not enough money to serve everyone we d like to serve with the greatest investment he says other countries have much more robust safety nets for laid off workers whether in retail or other fields in canada workers whose jobs are eliminated in mass layoffs are guaranteed termination pay if their employer doesn t give at least eight weeks notice and severance pay if they have worked for an employer for five or more years in european countries like sweden laid off workers receive financial support a job counselor and money for retraining provided they are members of a union which about 70 percent of sweden s workers are in the united states those types of strong supports are almost only available to workers in a union which is a shrinking share of the workforce just 10 3 percent of american workers were members of a union in 2019 but those unionized workers are reaping the benefits some partnerships between labor and management have started training low wage workers for new positions before they even lose their jobs in the building skills partnership in california a local union struck a deal with dozens of businesses agreeing that the businesses could take a small amount out of workers paychecks to fund retraining efforts unite here a union that represents service workers in las vegas bargained with casinos such as mgm resorts international to require that they alert the union to new technology being used and guarantee job training for all displaced workers the question now is whether the government will step in to protect retail workers as it did manufacturing workers even though retail is not unionized economists largely agree that retail is about to go through what manufacturing did says anthony carnevale the director of georgetown s center on education and the workforce manufacturing was once one third of the workforce now it s eight percent there s no question he says that retail is up next

appreciate you joining our fourth quarter earnings call i m pleased to report that we finished 2019 with great momentum in addition to having strong revenue growth across all of our biopharma business continued margin expansion and robust cash generation we made great progress in executing our growth strategy and expanding our global capabilities since completing the largest us healthcare ipo in may we have continually improved our leverage position empowering us to drive the innovations and breakthroughs that help our life science customers dramatically improve patient outcomes i would like to begin by covering some business highlights since our last earnings call on slide 3 in november we announced a new collaboration with the national institute of bioprocessing research and training in dublin ireland nibrt is a global center of excellence for training and research solutions for the biopharmaceutical manufacturing industry its clients include a number of industry leading companies such as pfizer eli lilly amgen bristol myers squibb abbvie and takeda avantor is working with nibrt to address downstream bottlenecks in buffer preparation when producing monoclonal antibodies in december we opened our ninth innovation and customer support center our newest addition is in shanghai china and will support accelerated process development for biologic therapies that will advance the development of life changing treatments for patients in the region it was specifically focused on enhancing industry capabilities and the development and manufacture of safe and effective biologic medicines such as monoclonal antibodies and cell and gene therapy these treatments show great potential in china and are a fast growing segment of the bioprocessing industry worldwide we recently began a capacity expansion initiative at our gliwice poland site that will support the growth of our biopharma production clients across europe we also initiated an expansion to our single use production capabilities in morrisville north carolina we continue to experience a high win rate on new customer accounts as well as on contract renewals i m pleased to report that we are ahead of plan on our integration synergy targets and i remain confident with our goal of achieving 300 million of synergies by the end of 2020 we also recently successfully repriced our term loans lowering the rate on our us dollar and euro denominated term loans by 75 basis points and we re looking forward to repricing our bonds later this year i also want to share some organization enhancements that we ve implemented in recent weeks that will enable us to execute our long term growth strategy to enhance our ability to deliver workflow based solutions in the lab we ve established a global laboratory products group which will be led by frederic vanderhaegen evp europe frederic and his team will work to enrich our product offering and improve our solution selling for critical workflows as with our other platform teams the laboratory products group will work closely with our regional teams to accelerate the growth of our lab products portfolio we recently announced plans to create two commercial sub regions within our emea region the substantial growth potential of this part of the world especially in china warrants more dedicated leadership so avantor will now have a commercial organization specifically for the india middle east and africa region imea and another for the asia pacific region apac that includes greater china korea and southeast asia dev ohri is serving as executive vice president for imea and we ve hired sven henrichwark as our new executive vice president for the asia pacific region sven brings more than 20 years of leadership in the biotech life science and medical technology industries including more than 12 years at ge healthcare we welcome to mark murray to avantor as executive vice president of the biomaterials and advanced technologies platform mark brings extensive global sales marketing operations and strategy leadership in key related industries through his more than 25 years of experience at mckinsey honeywell and celanese lastly marc centrella joined tom s organization in december as vice president corporate strategy and m a while our top priority remains de leveraging the balance sheet it is important that we begin to rebuild our m a capabilities and processes marc has a rich background in the life sciences space and has been tasked with rebuilding our m a capability also earlier today we announced that corey walker executive vice president for the americas region has resigned from his position to pursue to a role outside the life sciences industry that will allow him to move his family closer to other relatives we have already begun our search for his successor and until one is hired i will oversee our high performing americas region we are fortunate to have a very experienced leadership team in our americas region who are committed to capitalizing on the many opportunities before us in this important region and i m confident that we won t miss a beat putting the additions that i just described we have built a high caliber leadership team over the last few years and have added significant life sciences capability in depth aided by the avantor business system the hallmark of the team continues to be its ability to execute and we re well positioned for another great year moving to slide 4 where you can see the financial highlights of the fourth quarter organic revenue growth was 4 3 for the period and 5 1 for the full year including high single digit growth in our biopharma business in the fourth quarter reflecting ongoing strength in our portfolio of customized proprietary solutions the biopharma end markets remain healthy around the world and we experience attractive growth in these regions this segment accounts for approximately half of our total sales and we expect biopharma to continue to be the strongest driver of our future growth the other growth platforms that we have discussed including services and biomaterials also had high single digit growth in the quarter we did experience a continuation of softer trends in industrial markets as we noted in the third quarter and our growth was somewhat tempered by a weaker year end budget flush in both europe and the americas our adjusted ebitda margin for the quarter was up 12 4 excluding adverse currency impacts reflecting an improvement of 131 basis points for the quarter and 95 basis points for the full year these results reflect stronger volumes and pricing a continued improving mix of proprietary product sales the ongoing impacts of the vwr synergies and the execution discipline enabled by the avantor business system our adjusted earnings per share increased nearly 90 this quarter to 0 19 per share and are up approximately 62 for the full year at 0 58 per share hitting the high end of our guidance the excellent performance reflects strong operational execution as well as the benefit of reduced interest expense and an improved tax rate we expect that these factors will continue to drive significant earnings improvement going forward the fourth quarter also reflected significant strength in cash flow generation and deleveraging our unlevered free cash flow in the quarter was 188 million representing 97 of the adjusted net income excluding interest expense net leverage declined to 4 6 times ebitda in the quarter down from 4 8 times ebitda at the end of the third quarter and from 7 times ebitda at the beginning of the year in addition to the impact from the ipo earlier this year our growth in ebitda and focus on working capital have also contributed to 2019 deleveraging and as tom will discuss later we expect further improvements during 2020 with that let me turn it over to tom thomas a szlosek executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you michael i am on slide 5 where you can see the breakdown of the 4 3 organic growth for the fourth quarter by region we experienced improved growth in the americas reflecting continued strength in the biopharma and education end markets partially offset by lower government and healthcare spending europe growth was solid at 3 5 reflecting high single digit growth in the biopharma business and double digit growth in the healthcare end market partially offset by declines in education and government the amea region enjoyed a very strong 22 7 increase in sales this period reflecting high double digit growth in our biopharma business most notably in proprietary materials for bioproduction let me move to slide 6 which shows sales by end market and product group for the quarter as you can see biopharma which comprises about half of our sales grew in the high single digits while healthcare and advanced technologies and applied materials grew low single digits education and government had a low single digit decline which reflects softer government spending across the enterprise by product group q4 was a strong quarter for proprietary materials and consumables which had a high single digit increase continuing to outpace the low single digit growth in the third party materials and consumables services and specialty procurement continues to grow very strongly reflecting strength in all of our service offerings the equipment and instrumentation group reported a mid single digit decline reflecting a soft close to the year as michael noted earlier let me move to q4 adjusted ebitda on slide 7 we were pleased with the 12 7 growth and 131 basis points of margin expansion the sales growth converted very well reflecting volume leverage continued management of pricing versus cogs inflation the growth in our higher margin proprietary offerings and productivity including the vwr synergies these were slightly offset by the impact of growth investments that we continue to make particularly in the amea region in the middle of slide 7 you can see that fourth quarter free cash flow improved from 65 million to 75 million an increase of 16 and unlevered free cash flow was 187 8 million for the quarter i ll cover cash performance more on a later slide last as michael mentioned the 90 growth in our adjusted earnings per share for the quarter primarily reflects the strong operational performance driven by organic sales growth and margin expansion as well as the ongoing reduction in interest expense from our deleveraging slide 8 has our segment results the americas reported 3 1 organic revenue growth this quarter which i discussed earlier despite the sales growth management ebitda in the americas declined by roughly 2 million and about 70 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2018 we had a favorable adjustment to inventory without which the q4 19 management ebitda would have grown ahead of the sales growth reflecting strong price management relative to cogs inflation offset by lower sales of higher margin biomaterials products and some unfavorable manufacturing variances in europe the organic sales growth of 3 5 resulted in management ebitda growth of 10 4 excluding adverse impacts of the stronger us dollar and margin expansion of 110 basis points we benefited in europe from higher sales of higher margin biomaterials bioproduction and other proprietary offerings amea had a very strong performance this quarter as i previously mentioned with a 22 7 organic sales growth management ebitda in amea increased nearly 70 and the margin rate improved by over 850 basis points to 32 4 the strong sales of proprietary materials into bioproduction and overall volume growth were the main drivers and were slightly offset by the additional growth investments we are making in the region in the form of sales and marketing resources slide 9 provides an update of our free cash flow performance for the quarter and the full year for the quarter we generated 75 million in free cash flow a 16 increase for the full year we generated 302 million in free cash flow a 140 million increase or 86 from 2018 operational performance and lower interest expense drove 129 million and 71 million of this full year improvement respectively these benefits were offset by a 47 million growth in taxes paid reflecting a significant growth in our income notwithstanding the improved effective tax rate the capex requirements to support the growth in the business continue to be modest and overall capex grew from 38 million in 2018 to 52 million in 2019 slides 10 and 11 provide summaries of our performance for the full year slide 10 presents the organic growth which ended up at just north of 5 pretty much in line with a model we presented at the outset of the ipo as expected amea growth exceeded double digits and each of americas and europe reflected mid single digit growth on slide 11 you ll see a summary of our full year results in operating profits cash flow and earnings per share following the 5 1 organic sales growth adjusted ebitda grew 11 and ebitda margin improved from 16 1 to nearly 17 1 despite some headwinds from higher than expected public company costs share based compensation and adverse foreign currency movements on cash flow i discussed the drivers of the free cash flow earlier even excluding the benefit from deleveraging cash flow grew 24 which compares nicely to an already attractive 11 adjusted ebitda growth adjusted eps was 0 58 at the high end of our guidance and up nearly 62 over 2019 again a reflection of attractive growth margin expansion and the ongoing impacts from deleveraging and debt repricing turning to slide 12 we are pleased with the pace of deleveraging and the reduction in the cost of our debt during 2019 we reduced debt outstanding by 1 9 billion comprised of 1 6 billion from our ipo proceeds and 300 million from operations we started the year at 7 times ebitda leverage and ended at 4 6 times as we ve noted before we are targeting a leverage of 2 to 4 times ebitda and we expect to be within this range by the end of 2020 we ve also been working down the cost of our debt through the repricings we have done on our term loans in 2019 we reduced the weighted average cost of our debt to 6 5 looking ahead we see further deleveraging and significant repricing opportunities in particular we have 2 billion in senior unsecured debt with a 9 coupon and 1 5 billion in senior secured debt with a 6 coupon both of which offer attractive opportunities for repricing in the second half of 2020 we will share more details as we get closer to that date our 2020 earnings guidance is on slide 13 we expect organic revenue growth of 4 to 6 this assumes that the market conditions from 2019 prevail and the events out of our control such as the coronavirus do not have a meaningful impact on growth we are also assuming that the geographic mix of our growth that is high single digit growth in amea and low to mid single digit growth in the americas and europe remains unchanged we expect adjusted ebitda of 1 090 billion to 1 135 billion an increase of 6 to 10 this reflects our ongoing expectation of a stronger growth in our proprietary offerings versus growth in third party offerings operating leverage on our fixed cost base continued focus on managing the price versus inflation dynamic and the remaining integration synergies our guidance for adjusted earnings per share is the range of 0 74 to 0 79 per share representing growth of 27 to 36 this reflects continued strong operational improvement lower interest expense from deleveraging and already completed repricing action and an effective tax rate in the 25 to 26 range we also maintain a flat share count for guidance purposes last free cash flow is expected to be in the range of 450 million to 500 million versus 302 million in 2019 also reflecting the strong operational performance lower interest payments from de leveraging and already completed repricing actions as well as our capex light business model i want to thank you sincerely for your interest and investment in avantor and for your ongoing advice and support i will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the question and answer section questions and answers operator thank you and our first question today comes from the line of tycho peterson from jpmorgan your line is open tycho peterson jpmorgan analyst hey good morning i d like to start with the ebitda outlook at the high end of the guide here you re still about 40 million below the street so can you maybe just talk comment there some offsets on ebitda expansion things we have to factor in in terms of incremental investments that would lead you to be guiding below the street and i think what people were assuming for longer term ebitda growth michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer yeah certainly thanks for the question tycho first of all the guide implies on the high end about 75 basis points of margin expansion certainly we are shooting and targeting for more internally we do have some incremental headwinds from what we would have had in our long term model there s a little bit more public company cost between having to become a sox adaptor this year and a little bit of other things like directors and officers insurance we re doing a little bit more inflation than we had anticipated as well but again certainly we re shooting for higher we re early in the year we want to be a little bit more prudent in terms of what we commit to at this point and obviously we ll update you every quarter in terms of how we re progressing on that tycho peterson jpmorgan analyst okay and then in terms of trends on the fourth quarter i guess two questions here the government piece was that the weakness here to spill over from the third quarter or was there anything incremental on the government side and then for equipment and instrumentation saw mid single digit you reflected you commented on the soft close to the year can you maybe just talk on the dynamics of the equipment business michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer yeah i mean i mean first of all the overall growth we re really pleased with the biopharma piece of it it continues to track away at that high single digits and when you look at the government piece of it a smaller piece of the business certainly down sorry the government and education is certainly down in aggregate the government was the bigger driver there tycho i mean it was weird it was almost all of the month of october was just coming out of september it was a slowdown across all three regions then after that it picked up and kind of flattened out by the end of the year on the equipment piece of it probably similar in terms of the month december was a bit lighter than the other two months and we really didn t see as intense equipment purchases in the month of december as we sometimes do when we re closing out the year more so in europe than anywhere else but i don t view either of them as long term trends i think it s timing i mean the government piece was clearly behind us by the time november started tycho peterson jpmorgan analyst okay thank you operator our next question comes from the line of derik de bruin from bank of america your line is open juan avendano bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi good morning this is juan avendano for derik i have a question i guess can you give us an idea of what is the penetration level of the higher margin proprietary legacy of avantor products in the vwr distribution channel i m curious about what percentage of the legacy avantor products are already being fully offered and distributed globally versus what percentage of these products are yet to be offered in the vwr catalog michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer yeah juan this is michael thanks for the question clearly you re hitting on an important aspect of our model in that the growth in margins associated with the proprietary part of our business are really strategic and obviously an area that we spend a lot of time investing in when you look at our core portfolio that you re referencing a lot of that content flows into our bioproduction platform which has been growing for most of the year in the mid teens levels and we saw that again in the fourth quarter and that s led by our single use portfolio our excipients portfolio as well as a lot of our process ingredients and such prior to the combination of the two companies majority of that portfolio was being offered through the vwr channel and clearly as we ve come together we ve only deepened that especially in the geographies outside the americas our biomaterials platform is a unique platform with real strength in the medical technology and implant area a lot of overlap in the customer set between our legacy new cell customers and the vwr channel customers and there has been many examples throughout the year where we ve been able to leverage that customer access to drive growth on both sides of the equation and those teams continue to work very well so the trends are positive it s obviously business like this where your earnings specifications and customizing solutions there s a bit of tail here as to how you would expect to see the benefits of the better channel access that we have we would anticipate those playing out over the next number of years but we have fully integrated these businesses and are seeing a very strong uptick in our pipeline of opportunities around the world by having proprietary content falling through our channel juan avendano bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it thank you and then second question is are there any other major supplier agreements that are coming up for renewal or that are being renegotiated in the near term michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer yeah juan i mean the things we ve said before we ve got a very diverse portfolio here i don t think any single supplier represents more than a few percentage of our total revenue we don t have any significant contracts that would change our ability to access products in the near term great relationships overall and when you look at the growth that we ve been driving with these partners over the last couple of years and the solutions that they help us enable together with our own content we re excited by the partnerships that we ve forged over many years with these suppliers and look forward to working with them going forward juan avendano bank of america merrill lynch analyst thank you operator our next question comes from the line of jack meehan from barclays your line is open jack meehan barclays analyst yeah thank you good morning i want to focus a couple of questions on the 2020 outlook the first one was i was hoping if you could weigh in on the pacing of growth this year you called out in asia pac i think you i heard high single digit growth for the year but maybe obviously small percentage of revenue but what are you assuming in terms of how that might impact the overall growth and then also i think you have an extra day in the first quarter too i don t know where that necessarily falls but maybe if you could just talk about the pacing of growth and the different factors that would be helpful michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer thanks jack yeah in terms of the 2020 plan when you look at where we ended up in 2019 most of the trends were intact to close the year we re fairly consistent in terms of how that stacks up for 2020 so you can think of it as i was saying on the notes mid single digit growth for both americas and europe and it will be we ll be in the mid teens kind of for amea that s the overall expectation is that getting at what you re asking jack meehan barclays analyst yeah thanks for the clarification but also i guess as you think about how it grows first quarter through fourth quarter do you think it s more linear or are there things that just timing wise for the first quarter we should be aware of michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer yeah i mean when you look when you consider the comps over the course of the year q1 will probably be on the lower end of the mid single digits if not low single digits and then ramping up in the second half of the year on the higher end of mid single digits is the way i d characterized it jack meehan barclays analyst okay and then tom just as a second question you highlighted the potential for some of the refinancings ahead within the 2020 guidance what are you assuming in terms of interest expense and is there a way you can help quantify us for us just what you think that could translate to in 2021 for the refinancing thomas a szlosek executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah the way i look at it jack is well first of all to answer the question we have not assumed any additional refinancing repricing or anything in the plan that we presented to you so as you know and as probably most people who follow avantor know we have some opportunities in the second half of the year specifically around october november timeframe we re beginning to make more economic sense to consider repricing some of the bonds that we have we have 2 billion of unsecured bonds at 9 we have another 1 5 billion of secured senior secured at 6 and depending on where the market conditions are we ll obviously pursue opportunities you can kind of think of it as overall as every on a quarterly basis every 100 basis points is probably worth 5 million or so of interest cost and so you can pick your favorite number and do the math in terms of the impacts that a repricing could potentially have but going back to what we put into the plan it is only the pricing that we had after the january repricing that we successfully did which as you might know we ve reduced the rates on the term debt we have about 1 billion of a term debt we reduced it by 75 basis points so that alone gives us a nice pre tax headwind or tailwind of about 8 million so continue to keep our eye on that and continue to make good traction on the debt portfolio jack meehan barclays analyst thanks tom thomas a szlosek executive vice president and chief financial officer okay operator our next question comes from the line of vijay kumar from evercore isi your line is open vijay kumar evercore isi analyst hey guys thanks for taking my question so maybe mike big picture question for you past two quarters we ve had some these one offs and you ve shed the color on the marco and the guidance range just in terms of modeling purposes should this lead you looking at the bottom half of the range just given how the last two quarters have shaken out is that a more prudent approach or i m just curious on where you guys feel comfortable about the guidance range on the top line michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer yeah vijay good to hear from you i mean actually we were really pleased with our overall performance in q4 and we look at it relative to some of our prior prints i think it was really characterized by almost an absence of kind of one offs very little noise in the quarter and i think if you would have asked me kind of 2 5 months through the quarter kind of where i felt we were going to come in at probably at that point what i told you we were trending toward the high end of our guide the last five to 10 days of the month really were slower than what we had seen historically and we hadn t planned for anything unusual to finish the year but certainly it came in slower than what we expected both in the americas as well as in europe had we had a normal budget flush out of i think we ll be talking about a number that was probably 100 to 200 basis points higher from an organic growth standpoint so overall when you look at the core business biopharma production the biopharma platform broadly speaking printing at just a tick under 10 a return to growth of our biomaterials platform at nearly 10 continued strong double digit growth of our services platform our core engine is running at full speed here so when we then think about the guide going into 2020 i think it certainly falls squarely in line with the messaging that we ve been sharing with you all over the last number of quarters in that we view this platform as a mid single digit plus grower i think our 2019 performance falls right in line with that as does the guide that we ve given you here so i think we re optimistic about the year ahead i think we see the end market conditions at least as we reflected in our guide essentially continuing in 2020 in a similar fashion as 2019 vijay kumar evercore isi analyst that s helpful mike and just one follow up on i think you mentioned coronavirus i m assuming the guide does not bake in coronavirus given you guys are under indexed in china how if what if any impact does coronavirus have to your business and you mentioned that there s some leadership transition here in americas did that have any impact at all on sales performance thank you michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer yeah let me address your second question first around the leadership changes that we ve announced today first i m super excited by some of the capabilities that we ve been able to bring to the team over the last couple of years we ve brought a tremendous amount of life science depth and capability to the business in the recent additions particularly in china are no different we ve been excited to introduce you all to sven as we get an opportunity to interact in the coming months but he has lived in the asia region for better part of a decade driving some of the pure platforms in the bioprocessing space really deep experience set there and i m looking forward to having him take the lead here in driving our growth in the region especially in china relative to the change in the americas corey has been an integral part of the team here over the last three years or so he s still here we ll go through a transition in the month of february really nothing to do with the business as to why he s electing to move on he has got a personal situation that he s needing to resolve and we re fully supportive of helping him address that through the transition so corey has been in place throughout the quarter we ll continue to be in place here through part of the month here in february and we have a really senior team probably understating how senior our team is in the americas all of the commercial leads that are driving that platform forward 25 plus years of experience in our business we re in good hands there relative to your first question around the coronavirus i think we d echo probably the comments as you ve heard others reflect which is i think we re early innings into this we do have a very formal structure set up to manage a number of key work streams including the health and safety of our own associates making sure we re able to address any supply chain concerns as we sit here today we re certainly seeing an uptick in demand around the world for some of the clean room supplies and personal protective equipment but it s hard to tell the impact that will have these are kind of sitting on top of chinese new year and any event and i think you ve rightfully mentioned china for us is a more modest exposure so at the moment probably too early to call but i wouldn t anticipate it having a meaningful impact on us one way or another vijay kumar evercore isi analyst thanks guys thomas a szlosek executive vice president and chief financial officer hey vijay when michael was talking about the leadership changes he forgot to mention the quality of the interim leader that we re putting in the americas so you should keep that in mind as well he s quite capable vijay kumar evercore isi analyst appreciate the comments tom and i look forward to meeting the leadership team thomas a szlosek executive vice president and chief financial officer good operator our next question comes from the line of doug schenkel from cowen your line is open doug schenkel cowen analyst good morning i wanted to talk about three things biopharma gross margin and tax rate so on biopharma it was another quarter of really strong growth what s embedded for biopharma growth within 2020 guidance and recognizing the comparisons are difficult this year particularly in the first half kind of going back to an earlier question should we be thinking about that in the context of how we model out things from a quarterly cadence perspective michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer yeah let me doug take the question on biopharma obviously it s been a tremendous year for that platform and would just reground the audience here on the call today biopharma for us is about half of our revenue and it reflects the offering both into the laboratory environment and the workflows that we service there as well as into the production environment and we would typically see a little bit stronger growth rates in the production environment and a little bit more muted growth in the laboratory environment and on an aggregate basis that platform for us in 2019 grew at 10 which is a reflection of kind of high single digit growth in the lab environment and double digits think kind of mid teens level growth of our bioproduction platform and as we think about the transition into 2020 we really see no reason to change the outlook for 2020 based on that finish pretty similar conditions going forward is our asking doug schenkel cowen analyst okay so to be clear another year of high single or close to double digit growth is how you re thinking about that end market michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer exactly doug schenkel cowen analyst okay all right gross margin so it s up 210 basis points year over year but considering the strong proprietary products growth we actually thought it could have been up a little bit more sequentially versus q3 how did q4 gross margin fare versus your internal expectations and again recognizing some positive trends here what are you expecting for 2020 thomas a szlosek executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean when you look at q4 and the full year i mean we were able q4 we were up about 100 basis points year over year on gross margins certainly as we ve talked about the volume leverage is a big help but and we re doing a nice job on managing the price cogs mix but the shift the continued growth higher growth proprietary products is also a big factor for us we get good growth in biopharma production as an example biomaterials it works out quite well for us when you look at the full year it was similar i mean not quite as dramatic from a gm improvement perspective but still 30 to 40 basis points of gross margin improvement and still seeing those same factors we expect a similar kind of growth rate over the course of 2020 as we drive the continued proprietary growth in our proprietary products doug schenkel cowen analyst okay thank you for that and last one on the tax rate tax rate was well below our expectations in the quarter you guided 2020 to 25 to 26 do you see any room for upside versus that and then i guess at this point i guess just a question on how you re thinking about the long term opportunity should we expect a steady cadence of annual declines for say the next three to five years building off of what you guided to for 2020 thomas a szlosek executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah just to address the fourth quarter first of all the rate was abnormally low i think you picked up on and it s just a matter of cleaning up our year end reserves and finalizing some of the positions around the inter company financing that we ve talked about we started before the ipo with a 30 plus tax rate run rate and we explained that a big part of that was some inefficiencies in our rate structure or structure for financing some of our international operations over the course of 2019 we ve kept you up to date on that in the fourth quarter it really finalized the new structures to enable us to have a much more efficient tax rate that enabled us to adjust the overall tax rate for the full year and you saw that impact come through in the fourth quarter i d say i would consider the run rate for the full year to be if i take out that one time kind of impact somewhere in the 28 range and when i look at 2020 the guide is 25 to 26 hopefully we ll be at the lower end of that but we ve got a pretty clear line of sight to being within that range i think longer term doug we should be low 20 s kind of company we see a path and in the timeframe you talked about three to five years to certainly get there it s the activities we have to undertake impact our operations more than what we ve had to undertake so far to drive improvement and so it s a more enterprisewide type of initiative involving the supply chains commercial teams and the like and we have to engage in to keep that progress going doug schenkel cowen analyst okay that s super helpful thank you thomas a szlosek executive vice president and chief financial officer all right thanks operator our next question comes from the line of dan brennan from ubs your line is open dan brennan ubs analyst great thank you thanks for the questions i guess i wanted to go back to the 2020 ebitda margin outlook could you just walk through what you re assuming the impact is from synergies how much of the expansion is organic and kind of how does that organic expansion compared to what you ve achieved in 2019 thomas a szlosek executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah when you look at the synergies for 2000 where we are in the program through the end of 2019 we ve made and just to take you back for everybody s benefit the program at the outset started in november 2017 we identified 300 million or so of acquisition synergies 70 million or so would have been on the commercial side and 230 million or so would have been on the cost side making a good progress on the impacts of each of those we re probably nearing completion with the commercial synergies part of it and overall we re probably on a run rate basis close to 230 million as of the end of the actually closer to 250 million as of the end of 2019 so actions required to get to 300 million about 50 million more in terms of the impact on the ebitda margins next year you can think of it as somewhere in the 40 million to 50 million range of incremental p l benefit on our ebitda in 2020 dan brennan ubs analyst okay great and then maybe i wanted to go back to a couple of the customer groups here you addressed biopharma but just a few of the areas that or even by product areas excuse me that we re more kind of deviated from i think some of the growth rates that you had kind of outlined when you guys came public so in particular advanced materials and then on the equipment instrument side just how do we think about those going into 2020 like what s kind of baked in and if you can provide any color around what the environment looks like for those thank you michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer yeah on the equipment and instrument side is as tom i think articulated earlier we certainly saw a lower finish to the year in that category than what we ve seen historically at a pretty pronounced in europe and ended up contributing about a mid single digit decline overall in the quarter we wouldn t expect that to continue into 2020 that would tend to be more in the low single digit growth levels and that s probably how we would think about it in 2020 thinking about some of the proprietary platforms that we have obviously we ve talked a bit here on the call today about our bioproduction platform led by our single use offering that we would expect to continue to grow probably close to 20 netting us somewhere in the mid teens overall levels that s kind of what we saw in 2019 and i think we see a similar environment going forward into 2020 our biomaterials platform is a platform we ve talked a bit about this year particularly in the third quarter where we saw a little bit of inventory drop leading to more of a flattish environment in that quarter and we re obviously pleased to see as we expected a return to high single digit growth not quite 10 in the fourth quarter that s a platform that when you think about it over a 12 to 18 month cycle that s a high single digit growth platform and we modestly underperformed that level in 2019 really owing to the inventory corrections in the third quarter that we ve discussed but we d anticipate in 2020 a normalized demand environment and kind of high single digit growth our advanced technology platform which is a collection of a large number of end markets applied markets including aerospace defense our semiconductor exposure as well as kind of a collection of a lot of other industrial applications it s been pretty solid throughout the year and we saw that again in 2019 and while we would be thrilled to see those markets recover in 2020 as we think about our guidance we ve really anticipated and reflected a continuation of those trends into the new year here dan brennan ubs analyst great thank you operator our next question comes from the line of glen santangelo from guggenheim your line is open glen santangelo guggenheim analyst yeah thanks for taking the questions mike obviously a lot of focus on this call on the top line growth rates and in your prepared remarks you called out some of the softness in europe and the us and i m just kind of curious i mean have you really considered the competitive landscape here and any assessment in terms of market share and maybe how that maybe has shifted with respect to some of your major business lines or geographies anything on the market share worth calling out at all or you re purely thinking just market driven michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer look if you look just specifically the fourth quarter if you take out the last five days of the year which really is very very difficult to call driven by vacation schedules and the like we had a very very strong quarter like i said earlier probably in the quarter probably wanted to be 100 to 200 basis points stronger which would have been at the high end of our expectations in the quarter at the level of growth that you see us driving a little over 5 on a full year basis that s at worst case in line with what we see these end markets growing and in many instances whether that be in the bioproduction space or whether that be in the education market we do see ourselves running ahead of the market growth rate and extending our share around the globe so we re pleased with the positioning that we have in being able to leverage the unparalleled customer access that we have through the channel really has positioned well to continue to bring a more complete offering to our customers around the world glen santangelo guggenheim analyst tom maybe if i can just follow up with a quick question on the balance sheet i think in your prepared remarks you suggested that you d hope to get the leverage within that target range of 2 to 4 times by the end of 20 but based on us i think you d have to pay down another 600 plus million in debt and sort of given where your free cash flow estimates are for the year could you just help us bridge that gap and how you can get there by the end of 2020 and then when you think about the capital deployment opportunities from there any comments to make on the m a environment based on where you sit now thanks very much thomas a szlosek executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah thanks glenn yeah we talked about finishing the year at about 4 6 times leverage and talked about being able to get underneath 4 times by the end of 2020 there is basically two factors that are driving that obviously the increase in ebitda is a big lift and you can see you can pick your number out of the range that you have the most confidence and but if you think of anywhere between 75 or so of ebitda growth that is a contributor here and the other one is the free cash flow that we generate we re guiding to between 450 and 500 when you apply that to the debt between those two factors that gets you underneath the 4 times in terms of alternative capital deployment first and foremost we continue to just focus on deleveraging and that s where we plan for most of our cash flow to go in 2020 and that will continue to be the priority but once we get into that range once we get into that 2 to 4 times we think that we ll be in a position to pursue some of the opportunities on the market particularly in things that be in the proprietary offering space that michael was referring to particularly around biopharma biopharma production and the like we as michael mentioned have brought on an m a leader we re excited about that and that s something that we clearly focused on the long term horizon try to find and be prepared for opportunities when our capital structure allows it so that s kind of overall the short term medium term long term the way we re thinking about the leverage and the alternative capital deployment opportunities glen santangelo guggenheim analyst okay thanks for the comments thomas a szlosek executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah operator our final question today will come from the line of erin wright from credit suisse your line is open erin wright credit suisse analyst great thanks in the asia region you did mention some of the stepped up sales investment that you are making and that maybe that was a little bit of a potential offset to the strong growth that we saw across that region in the quarter i guess was that meaningful at all should that stabilize and what exactly is going on there if you could just describe thomas a szlosek executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah thanks erin it s pretty consistent with what you would have seen over the course of 2019 we ve stepped up our investments particularly on sales and marketing and also we have a new lab that we ve opened up in shanghai we ve got a new digit clean room and distribution center in singapore so clearly making some investments to drive the future growth in a region that we know we re underrepresented in we re also expanding in a way to help us grow further mike will talk about the organizational enhancements that we ve done in that regard so it has resulted in higher g a costs but we think we consider those to be investments to further the growth erin wright credit suisse analyst okay thanks and bigger picture here over the past few quarters now you ve spoken about customer retention contract wins i guess how is the merger enhancing your positioning in the marketplace overall and enhancing your win rate and how is it resonating with your customer base thomas a szlosek executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah thanks for the question when we put these two businesses together we were optimistic that the broad customer access that the vwr channel would provide together with a really strong mix of technologies coming from the legacy avantor space would have been certainly lead to new opportunities over the long term and as we ve now got a couple of years under our belt here in bringing these models together i see i think as you see that reflected in the lift in the revenue profile of the combined businesses you see that in the momentum that we re seeing especially in our biopharma business with our offering now into the lab running over the last year plus at high single digit levels our customers certainly are benefiting from a more complete integrated offering that we re able to take into this into their important workflows and we see that playing out perhaps the piece i m most excited about actually is the when you just look at the opportunity the number of drugs that we re partnering with our customers on customizing solutions earning those specifications that will really see our longer term growth opportunities and play out as those molecules that we re that we re supporting those new therapies that we re supporting work their way through the clinical processes and ultimately get commercialized and to me that s probably the more important value driver of bringing these businesses together is just what this does to enhance sustainability and growth of the platform over the long term erin wright credit suisse analyst thank you operator i d now like to turn the call back over to michael for closing remarks michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer great thank you on behalf of our more than 12 000 associates around the world we appreciate your support of our business and for participating in our call today as you can tell from our comments today we are excited about our 2019 performance our first year as a public company and are looking forward to another great year of revenue growth and margin expansion significant cash generation as tom discussed here we continue deleveraging our balance sheet i think we see the power of our business model in our 2019 results we re confident that we re well positioned for another great year and are excited about enabling innovations and breakthroughs that help our life science customers dramatically improve patient outcomes again appreciate everyone s support here on the line thanks for joining the call have a great day everyone operator duration 59 minutes call participants helen o donnell investor relations contact

insights derived from analytics we believe our culture of driving change to meet these heightened expectations from the c suite and boards is a huge differentiator in the market and is one of the reasons we win during 2019 we drove global client growth across our chosen verticals led by growth of more than 30 in transformation services our consulting digital and analytics transformation services rooted in domain and process expertise acts as a tip of the spear for many large long term transformational engagements our consistent growth performance over many years supports my long held view that digital and analytics comes to life when implemented with a deep understanding of domain and process highlighting the impact of transformation services on our business our fastest growing relationships are greater than 20 of revenues coming from transformation services these accounts are growing at more than double the company average during 2019 for the second consecutive year we signed total new bookings close to 4 billion fed by our high quality pipeline that remains near historic highs with steady win rates as a comparison during 2016 and 2017 new bookings averaged approximately 2 7 billion global client bookings had a solid growth in 2019 with proactive sole sourced deals accounting for roughly half of our new wins large deals continued to be a meaningful contributor to total bookings and almost three quarters of our bookings had transformation services embedded in them up from 60 range in 2018 as expected the bookings declined in 2019 given the large deal we signed late in 2018 let me call out some key highlights for 2019 we continued to add iconic brands to our client list in our focused industry verticals we closed two acquisitions to enhance our capabilities in critical areas financial crimes and risk management and digital experience supply chain services a strategic focus area showed dramatic growth in inflows pipeline bookings and revenue during the year we successfully launched genome a reskilling and training platform for our global workforce that has been a huge hit we continued to leverage new commercial models reflecting the changing nature of work we do for our clients and finally through the last phase of the large ge deal we significantly enhanced our strategic sourcing capability expanding on some of these during the year we elevated our brand recognition and solidified our reputation as a thought leader providing innovative transformative solutions for a growing roster of iconic clients for instance as discussed last quarter we entered into a strategic relationship with cardinal health where our deep expertise in finance and accounting and ability to leverage data analytics to provide insights will help transform their fp a analytics function to drive timely as well as insightful decision making fp a represents another ripe area for disruption and provides opportunities for growth these relationships are creating a heightened level of new inbound c suite calls as companies want to explore engaging with us to transform their businesses we expect to fully leverage such new skill sets from a number of these relationships that has added significant new capabilities over the last two years these include highly leverageable teams in financial planning and analysis order management and supply chain particularly in consumer goods retail commercial and pricing analytics and sourcing and category management a lot of this depth is in market and onshore we acquired riskcanvas early in 2019 which bolstered our already strong market offerings in financial crimes and risk management services for banks a large opportunity for growth our expanded capabilities in this space are already showing results we were selected by a global bank to transform their kyc process for their wholesale banking business to better define customer risk profiles and improve regulatory compliance our risk domain team along with our digital and analytics experts are deploying a first of its kind as a service solution with a transaction based commercial model this unique offering leverages the riskcanvas proprietary cloud platform to collect and organize customer data populate customer profile templates and provide risk scores replacing the bank s current manual processes with a streamlined digital as a service model this solution is expected to cut processing time in half and provide an industrialized kyc process with much higher accuracy and timely regulatory reporting during the fourth quarter we closed the acquisition of rightpoint to deepen our capabilities in experience which is becoming increasingly important to our clients while still early days we re already seeing the value of bringing together our process innovation and rightpoint s experience innovation supply chain management now led by the team that joined us from barkawi in late 2018 is allowing us to build traction in a vastly underpenetrated market our pipeline has expanded more than three times since the beginning of 2019 and we recently won a new engagement with a large global consumer goods company to help transform and run their end to end supply chain operations the redesigned operating model is aimed at helping the client drive better customer relationships improve fulfillment rates accelerate new product introductions and optimize trade promotions thereby driving higher revenue and better working capital levels for them i am excited to report that we now have three global relationships that crossed 100 million in annual revenue up from just one at the end of 2018 we expect many more of our relationships to hit this milestone over time as our solutions increasingly leverage ai machine learning robotic process automation and cloud based solutions our commercial models are becoming more outcome based at the end of last year more than 40 of our total revenue is from newer constructs not just based on fte pricing up from the mid 30 range only a couple of years back our talent has always been the most important pillar of our success like many of our clients we are going through a transformation in the way we excite our workforce to reskill and help them continuously learn the launch of our genome platform early last year provides the right tools and methods to up skill our 95 000 plus global team members with relevant digital transformation and other professional skills at scale we are well on our way to achieving our first year goal of reaching 70 penetration with the amount of learning hours continuing to expand as we move into 2020 we continue to expect our overall demand to be robust and continue to be led by transformation services coupled with the power of our domain and process expertise we believe we are uniquely positioned to leverage innovative new digital technologies as well as data and analytics in a focused way to solve for specific business outcomes this allows us to drive end to end digital transformation for clients in unprecedented ways delivering significant outcome improvements and superior experiences we have been building these solutions through a combination of internal development partnerships acquisitions and large targeted carve outs from our clients we now have an active portfolio of solutions that we manage allowing us to leverage them for scale over time we will continue to take decisions to proactively pull the plan on some of these recent examples of this include our mortgage origination platform the kyc jv and the wealth management platform this proactive culling allows us to double down on areas such as dynamic workflows in the cloud customer experience solutions supply chain optimization financial crimes and risk solutions and many others that are demonstrating market traction with that let me turn the call over to ed ed fitzpatrick chief financial officer thank you tiger and good afternoon everyone today i will review our full year results in detail then briefly touch upon some highlights of our fourth quarter performance as well as provide our financial outlook for 2020 let me begin with a review of our full year 2019 results total revenue was 3 52 billion up 17 year over year or 18 on a constant currency basis total growth was greater than expected with transformation services leading the way total bpo revenue which represents approximately 84 of total revenue increased 19 year over year and total it services revenue was up 10 year over year global client revenue which represented approximately 86 of total revenue increased 11 year over year or 12 on a constant currency basis at the high end of our expected range within global clients bpo revenue increased 13 year over year or 14 on a constant currency basis led by growth in transformation services up more than 30 while it services revenue increased 3 during the year as we become a bigger transformation partner for an increasing number of global clients we have meaningfully expanded the size of a number of our client relationships during 2019 we increased the number of our global clients with annual revenues over 15 million to 49 from 45 this included clients with more than 25 million in annual revenue growing to 25 from 21 ge revenue increased 78 year over year above our expectations largely due to incremental scope added during the year related to the large deal we signed late in 2018 adjusted income from operations grew 18 year over year to 559 million recall that we had assumed approximately 22 million at the beginning of the year related to the india export subsidy in our adjusted operating income outlook as it became clearer throughout the year that we would only receive approximately 4 million of that expected benefit we put plans in motion to cover the 18 million shortfall with other items during the fourth quarter we were able to finalize the plans to monetize a property we owned in india which generated a gain of approximately 31 million included in other operating income this gain was partially offset during the quarter by certain other costs including an 11 million nonrecurring impairment charge in cost of revenues related to a european wealth management platform that we no longer plan to leverage beyond the current scope adjusted operating margin of 15 9 was 10 basis points or 4 million lower than our 16 target primarily due to a 4 million impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter related to certain retirement plan assets in india gross margin was lower year over year primarily due to higher stock based compensation of 20 basis points and approximately 50 basis points due to the nonrecurring charges i just mentioned better than expected revenue growth with higher onshore scope and the additional ge revenue also impacted margin sg a expenses totaled 795 million compared to 694 million last year as a percentage of revenue sg a expenses were down 50 basis points year over year driven by operating leverage despite a 50 basis point dilution related to higher year over year stock based compensation as well as a 10 basis point impact from rightpoint acquisition related expenses adjusted eps of 2 05 was up 14 year over year compared to 1 80 in 2018 this 0 25 increase was primarily driven by higher operating income of 0 34 partially offset by lower foreign exchange remeasurement gains higher tax expense and higher net interest expense of 0 03 each 2019 represents the fifth consecutive year of double digit adjusted eps growth that produced a 15 compound annual growth rate over that period this growth was driven by solid revenue growth and disciplined cost management that has consistently driven increased operating income and related operating margins in each of those periods in line with our stated key strategic objectives our effective tax rate was 23 7 compared to 22 3 last year driven by the expiration of special economic zones benefits in india changes to the jurisdictional mix of income and the impact of india tax law changes let me now provide some additional color around our fourth quarter performance global client revenue increased 7 year over year or 8 on a constant currency basis largely driven by continued growth in our consumer goods retail banking capital markets and high tech verticals recall that our growth rates during the fourth quarter last year made for a tougher comparison this year ge revenues were up 61 year over year driven by the large deals signed late last year and incremental scope of work added during the quarter adjusted operating margin during the quarter was 16 9 largely in line with the level reported during the same period last year but slightly lower than we expected primarily due to the nonrecurring impairment of the india retirement plan assets in the quarter that i mentioned earlier gross margin for the quarter was approximately 33 compared to 35 5 level we generated during the first three quarters of 2019 the decline was primarily driven by the two nonrecurring charges i referred to earlier that total approximately 14 million in addition lower margin on the incremental ge scope and lower margin on the ramp up of a new account in our banking vertical negatively impacted gross margin levels during the quarter the new banking account margins are expected to return to more normalized levels in the first quarter of 2020 we also expect overall ge full year 2020 gross margins to be largely aligned with ge s 2019 levels since 2019 was impacted by nonrecurring charges of approximately 50 basis points we are expecting full year gross margins to be up by 50 basis points in 2020 total sg a expenses were 213 million compared to 179 million in the same quarter of last year and included approximately 7 4 million of nonrecurring rightpoint related acquisition expenses and approximately 16 million related to stock based compensation adjusted eps for the fourth quarter was 0 57 compared to 0 52 last year the 0 05 increase was driven by higher operating income of 0 07 as well as 0 01 related to the impact of higher foreign exchange balance sheet remeasurement gains partially offset by higher effective tax rate of 0 02 and increased share count of 0 01 our effective tax rate was 28 1 compared to 25 8 last year due to the expiration of special economic zones benefits changes in the jurisdictional mix of our income and the impact of india tax law changes turning to our balance sheet and cash flows during the year we returned 95 million of capital to shareholders this included approximately 65 million in the form of our regular quarterly dividend of 0 085 per share which increased by 13 in comparison to the prior year we also repurchased approximately 766 000 shares totaling 30 million at a weighted average price of 39 16 per share during the year since we initiated our share buyback program in 2015 we ve reduced our net outstanding shares by 17 over this period we repurchased 37 4 million shares at an average price of approximately 26 per share for a total of 976 million the weighted average annual return on these share repurchases has been approximately 18 from 2015 through the end of january this year we currently have approximately 274 million of authorized capacity under our share repurchase program cash and cash equivalents totaled 467 million compared to 368 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018 our net debt to ebitda ratio for the last four rolling quarters was 1 7 with undrawn debt capacity of 428 million and existing cash balances we continue to have sufficient liquidity to pursue growth opportunities and execute on our capital allocation strategy days sales outstanding were 86 days which were down from 87 days sequentially and increased three days from the last year driven by delayed collections on certain accounts where cash was received in early january despite the higher dsos we were able to generate 428 million of cash from operations in 2019 up 26 year over year exceeding the high end of the range we expected for the year the majority of this outperformance was driven by higher adjusted operating income capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue was 3 3 in 2019 in line with our expectations finally let me update you on our outlook for 2020 we expect total revenues to be between 3 89 billion and 3 95 billion representing year over year growth of 10 5 to 12 5 on a constant currency basis we expect the rightpoint acquisition to contribute approximately 250 basis points to total company growth in 2020 this impact is approximately 100 points higher than the contribution from acquisitions to our top line in 2019 for global clients we expect revenue growth to be in the range of 12 to 14 on a constant currency basis we expect ge revenues to normalize and be approximately flat year over year we will continue our strategic objectives to expand our adjusted operating margin and expect to drive 10 basis points of improvement to 16 as i mentioned earlier we are expecting our full year gross margins to improve by approximately 50 basis points in 2020 due to the impact of nonrecurring charges incurred in 2019 we believe our gross margins have stabilized the impact of large deals has driven even higher revenue growth than we expected and thus has had a greater impact on gross margins than we initially expected given the tremendous amount of capabilities we have been adding to our team from these iconic companies we made the strategic decision to accept initially lower gross margins on these deals we plan to fully leverage these skill sets well into the future due to the historic seasonality we see in our business we currently expect our adjusted operating margin for the first quarter of 2020 to be in the 14 to 15 range we have seen in the last two years we also expect the ramp of operating margins to be more in line with the trajectory we have seen over the past two years our 2020 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23 5 to 24 5 up from 23 7 in 2019 driven primarily by the expiration of special economic zones in india we continue to expect our effective tax rate to stabilize in a mid 20 range as the special economic zone expirations reduce over time given the outlook i just provided we are estimating adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2020 to be between 2 24 and 2 28 this increase in earnings per share of 9 to 11 includes the negative impact of higher tax rate of approximately 0 01 per share in 2020 and includes no fx remeasurement related impact recall that we recorded a gain of 0 03 for fx remeasurement gains in 2019 we have assumed our ending share count as of december 31 2019 in this estimate we are forecasting cash flow from operations to grow by approximately 10 largely in line with total company revenue growth capital expenditures as a percentage of revenues are expected to remain at approximately 3 to 3 5 we continue to expect the free cash flow to net income ratio to be approximately one to one on average over time and finally we just announced an increase to our quarterly dividend from 0 085 to 0 0975 per share which equates to annualized dividend of 0 39 per share up 15 year over year with that let me turn the call back over to tiger tiger tyagarajan president and chief executive officer thank you ed we saw terrific momentum in our business in 2019 driven by disciplined strategic choices and strong execution our investments in our service lines along with the successful integration of our acquisitions particularly in digital and analytics has positioned us well for a multiyear growth trajectory our large deals with iconic brands have solidified our reputation as a transformation partner of choice leading to higher levels of inbound activity beyond our traditional buying centers as we enter 2020 we are seeing the experience economy rewrite the rules of digital transformation we are extremely excited about how we have bolstered our capabilities in this area through the acquisition of rightpoint on the heels of the addition of the tandemseven a few years back we have also been able to leverage our automation to ai platform genpact cora in many of our engagements and solutions and we see it being a huge differentiator cora allows us to bring more standardized repeatable offerings to the market clients increasingly need predictive insights to make more informed decisions with the acceleration of the digitization of data and the maturation of data management our opportunity in analytics has expanded dramatically we saw terrific growth in analytics in 2019 and we expect this trajectory to continue to be a key driver of transformation services growth going forward as noted earlier we will continue to be maniacally focused on reallocating investment and talent resources to high growth areas and we ll continue to be thoughtful in our choices in summary we have a growing top line primarily made up of sticky long term global relationships with inherent operating leverage driving long term margin expansion and the ability to tap our cash flows and balance sheet to take advantage of opportunities in our underpenetrated market we have the right leadership team and talent base to go after this i m pleased with our 2020 outlook which is very much aligned with our long term growth and profitability goals roger sachs head of investor relations thank you tiger we d now like to open up the call to your questions gigi can you please provide the instructions questions answers operator and our first question comes from the line of ashwin shirvaikar from citi your line is now open ashwin shirvaikar citi analyst thank you hi tiger tiger tyagarajan president and chief executive officer hi ashwin shirvaikar citi analyst good quarter yeah so what i was hoping for was maybe a bridge to connect your 2019 performance to 2020 expectations on a revenue basis i get the 250 basis point contribution from rightpoint but total contribution from acquisitions the ge delta how we think about that how much is existing client growth versus new client ramp and i might have missed the fx comment you had tiger tyagarajan president and chief executive officer so let me take that ashwin to begin with and ed will add to that i ll start with ge ge as i mentioned and i think ed added will be broadly flat as we look at 20 versus 19 which is kind of the way we thought about ge for many years until various changes happen so that s one way to think about ge and then that leads to global clients if you back off the 250 basis points driven by acquisitions which is about 100 basis points more than 19 then really you re talking about a global client growth that is just a little bit above in 2020 versus 2019 which is a great position to be in and the confidence of that is driven by obviously the pipeline the wins we ve had which we continue to execute on i d also say that all the execution during the year of the various large complex deals that we won have gone really well and it s important to call that out because that sets the stage for continued growth both in those relationships as well as what it does to other relationships as far as reputation is concerned and on fx ed fitzpatrick chief financial officer and on fx really expecting no rate right now the as reported and constant currency is consistent so it s kind of a small difference so no change if anything changes during the year we ll update you tiger tyagarajan president and chief executive officer yes and maybe the final wrapper to both our comments would be visibility to revenue kind of very similar as we look at 2020 as it was at the beginning of 2019 ashwin shirvaikar citi analyst got it that s very helpful and then the second question just drilling down on rightpoint obviously a good size acquisition how much was the 4q contribution first of all i guess and then any thoughts on what the core margins are versus integration costs in terms of margin impact any early views on what clients have said one pushback i do get from investors is people try to compare rightpoint to headstrong from years ago and not necessarily a fair comparison but i want to hear your viewpoint tiger tyagarajan president and chief executive officer yes i ll start with the last one because that s the easiest one that is a completely disconnected comparison there is no comparison at all not even remotely rightpoint is a business that is focused on improving consumer experience for b2c companies business to business experience for business to business companies and user experience in large employee bases of large enterprises it s multi vertical it s working with clients to drive change from design strategy to digital execution to bring that strategy to life and then when you combine that with our capabilities that came to us through tandemseven and then our capabilities on process innovation that s where we are already beginning as i said to see real great conversations with our existing clients and actually interesting conversations with rightpoint s own client base so that one is the easy one contribution to fourth quarter is about 150 basis points in the fourth quarter ed fitzpatrick chief financial officer yes one to one and a half yes one to one and a half tiger tyagarajan president and chief executive officer one to one and a half 100 to 150 basis points of contribution to revenue margin broadly similar to our margin at the operating margin level ed fitzpatrick chief financial officer well i think with the integration expenses it was a bit more dilutive so all in with the integration expenses it probably caused pressure to the extent of about 15 basis points in total for the fourth quarter as we get into next year the impact is lesser but it will be below company average next year because we ll continue to do the integration that we re supposed to do right but overall we re managing that in the 16 operating margin guidance that we gave ashwin shirvaikar citi analyst thanks thanks for that congratulations operator thank you our next question comes from the line of dave koning from baird your line is now open david koning baird analyst yeah hey guys thanks and nice year tiger tyagarajan president and chief executive officer thank you dave thank you david koning baird analyst yeah and i guess so first of all just one more thing on rightpoint so it seems like based on where you were in q4 and then the way you guided 2020 it s probably in the ballpark of a 90 million or so run rate how do you see that growing over the next couple of years between cross selling different products to the genpact organization and vice versa like is that something that might grow well faster like 25 or something tiger tyagarajan president and chief executive officer so dave actually your zip code is pretty good i would say the starting point of the zip code is right the math is right and one would think about rightpoint in the same way one thinks about transformation services it is new digital skills it s new age skills it s consulting it s experience therefore it should lead company growth for sure and it should get closer to the transformation services type of growth that would be our expectation combination of their capabilities brought into our client base and our capabilities taken into their client base david koning baird analyst ok great and then just a couple of quick modeling ones typically from q4 to q1 you fall off 40 million 50 million or so this q1 i would assume it s going to be a little less than that just because the incremental rightpoint acquisition so is it more like a 30 million 40 million falloff sequentially and then interest expense is the other one ed fitzpatrick chief financial officer as we look at it we re still somewhere in the range of 2 5 to 3 5 is kind of what we ve seen i wouldn t model different than that i d say 2 5 to 3 5 is about the right range david it will help a bit i would stick to that range sequential decline yes tiger tyagarajan president and chief executive officer yes we ve seen that now for historically so many years dave that it s a good way to model the business david koning baird analyst ok thank you tiger tyagarajan president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of joseph foresi from cantor fitzgerald your line is now open steven chang cantor fitzgerald analyst hi this is steven chang coming on for joe thanks for taking my question so just maybe more of just any more color on rightpoint i m just wondering if possible maybe you could quantify how much of that digital revenue growth you saw was due to integrating rightpoint as you ve seen so far and maybe how you look on that moving forward ed fitzpatrick chief financial officer can you repeat yes i didn t get the did you get it tiger tyagarajan president and chief executive officer yes so if the question was how much of what we ve seen so far in digital growth is because of rightpoint i would say by the time we close the rightpoint acquisition we were well into the middle of the fourth quarter so i wouldn t say a lot of the growth of the fourth quarter came from the capabilities that came into the company through rightpoint however if the question is a broader question around how much is experience and how much have you seen experience being important for digital growth in the last couple of years the answer is quite a lot and the importance of that is one of the reasons that gave us the confidence to go forward and bring rightpoint in that confidence was built with the tandemseven team and that team has been with us now for more than two years and we saw that play out in banking we saw that play out in insurance and we started seeing that play out in a number of other verticals that s the confidence that we have with rightpoint as we look at 2020 and beyond steven chang cantor fitzgerald analyst ok great that s helpful and just one more follow up moving on to kind of the pipeline on larger deals do you see any slowdown in the future are you expecting inflows to kind of continue at the same rate and maybe if you could provide some color on these deals in specific verticals or any clients especially if you could touch on maybe digital please tiger tyagarajan president and chief executive officer i would say we haven t seen any change in the behavior of clients we haven t seen any change in inflows pipeline and closure which is bookings as we ve gone through the year the only thing i would call out as a question mark is the recent events around coronavirus and what does that mean we haven t seen anything so far but i think it s prudent for us to think about if that kind of epidemic continues to play out in a certain way then what does that mean to global travel what does that mean to clients ability to travel and what does that do to decision making we just want to be watchful and cautious and obviously we are in discussion with clients we haven t seen anything so far steven chang cantor fitzgerald analyst ok great thank you tiger tyagarajan president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of tien tsin huang from jp morgan your line is now open puneet jain j p morgan analyst yeah hi this is puneet sitting in for tien tsin so 2019 clearly was a banner year for you in terms of ramping up multiple large deals as we look forward and your growth begin to normalize why is gross margins not expected to expand by more than impairment benefit of 50 basis points as some of those deals ramp up or is that too early and that s more of a long term lever for gross margin expansion ed fitzpatrick chief financial officer yes i think as i said in my prepared remarks we believe that the margins have stabilized but as you heard tiger say too the pipeline is still pretty robust and the level of large deals in the pipeline have not decreased right so we re pleased with that level and to the extent that we do more large deals kind of if margins stay in and around this range we ll all be very happy because we ll be able to drive through incremental operating margin as well as income and free cash flow right so our view is to the extent that the services that we provide for our clients provide higher value absolutely we should see appreciation in gross margins for right now our view is stable it seems like the right place to be given the pipeline and the extent of large deals that are there so for now we think it s reasonable to assume flat and as we make progress on that we ll update it tiger tyagarajan president and chief executive officer yes and puneet two other things to add to what i just said if you go back to the commentary on global client growth after you remove the impact of rightpoint global client growth is actually just a tad bit better in 2020 versus 2019 which means the ramps continue and we re going to based on our pipeline and inflows we will have more deals that come in that need to continue to ramp and our deals as you know take time to ramp so therefore i think we would not be able to use that ramp to get the steady state gross margin in year 2020 itself obviously over time that should play itself through the second one is on transformation services particularly if you peel off into digital most commentary from most peer group companies will tell you that digital takes time to deliver on margins as you scale and that scaling effort is not a single or two year effort it s a multiyear effort and we are still in that journey of scaling so i think if you put those two together longer term margin trajectory should be positive i don t think we expect to see that in 2020 ed fitzpatrick chief financial officer yes puneet as you ve seen us manage too we re really looking at driving eps growth driving free cash flow growth for the value of the firm to drive the value of the firm we do that by driving operating margin right so the operating margin is where we ve been so maniacally focused as well and making sure we re currently improving you ll see some geography where maybe gross we might make a call i think gross margin will be a bit lower on the deal but if we re able to drive operating margins up we ll take that we ll take that every day and in fact you heard us talk about a lot of what we ve done in some of these gross margins being lower the onshore skill sets that you heard tiger talk about that we re more than happy to do it s effectively building out new service lines if you will where we d be developing that in our r d line right so these are calls that we ve made consciously and strategically and we re happy with them tiger tyagarajan president and chief executive officer yes absolutely puneet jain j p morgan analyst got it and ed can you also talk about potential impact from the recent india budget on your tax rate and subsidies or any other line item in operations and will that also impact in any way your ability to move cash in or out of india ed fitzpatrick chief financial officer sure there s a few different things happening some just recently announced some kind of a little bit announced a little bit earlier the first one is the tax rate that india has announced in the elections that companies are able to take going forward with the reduction of the overall corporate tax rate is somewhere in the mid 30s to mid 20 25 range or thereabouts that was one of the reasons why you saw actually our tax rate increase this year because we had to revalue our deferred tax assets at that lower rate so the tax increase that you saw happen a little bit higher than what we expected even in the quarter was due to the revaluation of those deferred tax assets at that lower tax rate so a good thing for the company to stem tax increases going forward for us actually led to a bit of a writedown of the assets which seems counterintuitive but it makes sense on the other tax provision that talks about dividends related tax and being able to get cash allowed the cash to be more fungible that s certainly a positive at least it gives more flexibility or you re penalized less if you want to take cash out of the jurisdiction potentially so that s a potential positive but we ve been able to manage that without much impact over the years but it s certainly another potential positive in terms of flexibility it gives us tiger tyagarajan president and chief executive officer as you know that s still on the table to be passed by parliament if i remember right so we ll have to wait and see ultimately what happens but it gives us more flexibility if that s the way it turns out ed fitzpatrick chief financial officer that s right puneet jain j p morgan analyst got it thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of maggie nolan from william blair your line is now open maggie nolan william blair and company analyst hi thank you so you ve obviously still got some flexibility in the balance sheet to do some acquisitions in 2020 but you re already coming into the year with a pretty decent inorganic contribution so i m just wondering can you update us on your appetite for m a in the coming year and what you re looking for tiger tyagarajan president and chief executive officer yes so i ll start it off and ed can add our appetite maggie has never been driven by how much growth contribution it would have or should have we ve always driven our m a from our strategic choices and we still have a set of strategic choices where we would love to find the right target to bring in just as we ve done over the last four to five years around certain specific digital capabilities analytics capabilities certain domain capabilities across the various geographies so we do have a pretty good m a pipeline as you know a number of those while they are in the pipeline never ultimately get done because of a variety of reasons including in our business a match of cultures and so on so i wouldn t necessarily say that our m a decisions are based on what contribution to growth do we expect from acquisitions we have the firepower available to do the right acquisition if we find one and our m a team continues to look for the right ones and engage in those conversations ed ed fitzpatrick chief financial officer yes that s a good point i d just add two other things we re at 1 7 net debt to ebitda so feel pretty good about our flexibility do more as we see appropriate but again it s all based upon what we think makes sense not for growth because it s been around 1 to 1 5 rightpoint was bigger right we said it s about 2 5 and it was bigger but also kind of i was happy to do it because it was probably one of the more profitable companies that we ve acquired right they re coming in with largely aligned operating margin they could be a little bit lower in the first couple of years because of the integration related expenses but we love the product we love the profit margins they re driving so at the end of the day the eps impact of this business is going to be accretive 0 02 0 03 and we love that right and that will grow over time so that one was bigger and we kind of like the fact that it was bigger maggie nolan william blair and company analyst ok great and then you had a strong quarter in q4 clearly the core bpm business is doing well it did have slightly weaker performance out of global client it so i m just wondering if there are any dynamics there that we should be keeping an eye on and what your expectation is for both global client it and ge it in 2020 and any kind of quarterly considerations there too tiger tyagarajan president and chief executive officer so i ll address the ge it one very quickly maggie overall we are assuming as i said flat ge specifically within that it etc is dependent so much on ge s own budgets to a single client etc so predicting that in a very specific way is more difficult i think global clients is a better conversation because it s a portfolio on global client it over the years we ve talked about making our choices in it and narrowing them down to the areas where we think we have a real strength in connecting it to our process and domain and industry understanding and we ve been undertaking that journey for many years as a result of which we are now back to growth versus having quite a few years where we were declining as we continue to undertake that journey we are finding material pieces of our it business that are getting closer and closer to our digital business and in fact the lines of differentiation between those two are blurring so as we go forward we expect some portions of the it business to actually start mirroring some of our digital business growth and as that keeps expanding the portions of our it business that are more unconnected to all those will become smaller and smaller and less material and have less material impact on the overall company and that s already beginning to show itself in the numbers if you look at the numbers today versus five years back ed anything else to add ed fitzpatrick chief financial officer i would just say as a result of this you ve heard me say we re talking about it separately it seems unusual because of how this has all been kind of coming together particularly over the past year or two so as we move forward our plan is to not talk about it separately given how that has come together so we ll cover it on this call but going forward you shouldn t expect us to cover it and then maggie to answer your specific question the fourth quarter i think part of was a couple of things we had some larger impacts and a good comparison year over year because we had some fourth quarter and ge was part of that so that was part of the year over year shrinkage in the full year actually some of the large deals had some it associated with it and that wound down a bit as we got into the fourth quarter so just to answer your specific question tiger tyagarajan president and chief executive officer and some capital markets related banking related customers and you ve heard that commentary from most of our peer group i mean that obviously to the extent that we have some portion of our business there that also got impacted maggie nolan william blair and company analyst thank you tiger tyagarajan president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question is from the line of justin donati from wells fargo your line is now open justin donati wells fargo securities analyst hi thanks for taking my question i just had one can you talk about how many transformation service professionals you have and if you re having any issues finding talent tiger tyagarajan president and chief executive officer no it s an interesting question justin we don t count head count based on specific number of transformation services professionals because that s a combination of people who are deep in a particular industry some of them by the way come from our operating teams across the globe and now we have 100 plus operating centers across the globe some of them are subject matter experts in specific services and domain finance supply chain risk financial crimes and so on and then a number of them come from our digital teams who are kind of pods of capabilities ai machine learning the experience group and a number of them sometimes are deep inside our transformation services engagement think about them as consultants and other times they re actually solutioning a very large managed services deal which is not a plain engagement so i don t think we ll be able to specifically answer the question you re asking which is head count in transformation services we don t monitor and manage transformation services as a specific separate headcount justin donati wells fargo securities analyst got it and then if i could sneak one more in are you seeing a greater percentage of revenue coming from transaction and outcome based work are you getting better margins in that area tiger tyagarajan president and chief executive officer so the simple answer to your question is we should and we will but it takes time particularly because in those outcome based contracts depending on the nature of the contracts some of them are transaction based pricing if it s transaction based pricing then we start getting better margins pretty early particularly as we start driving digital technologies and driving productivity automation and so on some of them are fixed price and again as we drive productivity we should but that takes some time and then we have truly outcome based contracts where if you reduce fraud if you increase revenue if you improve our on time fulfillment and supply chain those take significant time you ve got to hit milestones so those then don t show up as better margins immediately they take time to show up justin donati wells fargo securities analyst understood tiger tyagarajan president and chief executive officer thank you justin operator thank you our next question comes from the line of bryan bergin from cowen your line is now open bryan bergin cowen and company analyst hi guys good afternoon thank you tiger tyagarajan president and chief executive officer hi bryan bryan bergin cowen and company analyst i was curious i wanted to ask first consulting and transformation services can you just give us some color on how you re thinking about managing resource utilization as you move past the year end particularly as you re adding this rightpoint consulting workforce as they come on here in 4q just talk about your confidence in making sure to avoid any potential air pockets on resource utilization as you re moving through the early parts of 2020 ed fitzpatrick chief financial officer yes it s a great because i was going to answer that on the last question that justin was asking kind of added on that wasn t exactly aligned with what his question was because you do remember coming into i think it was 2018 we kind of got ahead of ourselves in the hiring and i think i used words that were less than complementary of how we managed it but i said we re getting after it and the company has gotten after the meaningful way i think a lot of brute force as we got through 2018 and we saw those margins improved and we saw further improvement as we gotten into 19 and we now have the system i think largely in place where we re measuring those resources and measuring utilization and we ve improved utilization significantly that is no longer an issue for us so now those margins have come up significantly as we expected and we re continuing to drive utilization metrics and drive those metrics positively up to improve margins so that is definitely a positive for us as we move forward in terms of our ability to improve margins and utilize those resources not just utilize them better but get visibility to the skill sets of the folks we have so we can deploy them on the right jobs at the right time so that is happening i would say we ve been impressed with how rightpoint is managing their own resources using a similar system that we ve deployed so we re kind of in lockstep in terms of the way that we re thinking about managing those resources bryan bergin cowen and company analyst ok all right good and then just on bookings how should we translate the 3 9 billion of bookings being comparable to let s say 2018 i heard the ge comments about obviously the new work that you had won back in late 18 but otherwise anything to call out in the nature of bookings average duration any metrics you can share there tiger tyagarajan president and chief executive officer no nothing other than in the prepared remarks i had said that if you look at two years 16 17 and compare them to 18 19 and the reason why two years is the way we would look at it is because it becomes very lumpy and episodic whether a booking gets done in the last week of december or the first week of january and that is really beyond all our control when you re talking about 100 million deal so to that extent we prefer to look at in all our modeling we look at two year cohort of bookings and if you look at that the previous two years 2 7 billion average the last two years 4 billion average within that 4 billion average 2018 having a higher proportion of ge than 2019 therefore by definition global clients being higher in 19 versus 18 all that is good metrics to look at and that s one of the reasons why our guidance and outlook for 2020 is what it is ed fitzpatrick chief financial officer and what we said bryan too is we do think over time that it should align with our overall growth of the firm right as we look back we were looking at it today or yesterday and saw that it was largely aligned with the company you could do your own cagr i mean the past five years it s been in the low double digit range which kind of aligns with total company growth bryan bergin cowen and company analyst thanks ed ed fitzpatrick chief financial officer thanks bryan operator thank you our next question comes from the line of mayank tandon from needham your line is now open mayank tandon needham and company analyst thank you good evening tiger just given some of the industry sources it would suggest that the market is probably the healthiest it s been in a long time maybe ever so what are the constraints to growth in other words why can t you grow faster would just love to hear about what might be limiting your growth potential just given the health of the market backdrop tiger tyagarajan president and chief executive officer so mayank i ll start by saying we love the growths that we have seen not just in 19 but actually pretty consistently in global clients over four or five years and the question that you re asking is and that global client growth by itself if you leave the volatility that we ve seen over five seven years with ge has been very very good and if you take global client bpm it s been pretty industry leading why can t it be higher i ll start by saying execution is at the forefront of continuing to drive that growth reputation is incredibly important when we build multi decade relationships that allows us to drive growth with that relationship and these are relationships where we get growth even after 10 years and it allows us then to get phone conversations between clients who then want to engage with us because they heard something from someone else so i will start and end with execution and the importance of execution and there is a point at which the ability to execute complex deals to execute complex solutions in a global delivery environment across multiple markets that we typically deal with in many of these client situations becomes a constraint that you have to think about and make sure that you don t do something that then hurts your reputation and we are very conscious of that we ve been conscious of that from the day we became an independent company in 2005 it s one of the guiding principles of the company net promoter score is the way we measure it mayank tandon needham and company analyst right that makes sense on a related basis i was wondering given the shift to more digital type work analytics all the newer technologies that you mentioned that are clearly impacting the bpm and analytics space are you seeing a change in the typical productivity gains or the headwinds you see in any given year as you pass on the productivity benefits to your end clients tiger tyagarajan president and chief executive officer mayank yes i wouldn t call it headwinds passing on productivity benefits to clients using new technologies is a good thing and we feel proud about that i think our clients think that we are really good at that have always been now we have new technologies to do that so we don t think about it as headwinds but obviously our growth has to take into account that and it does take into account that so the way to think about it is if traditional ways of driving productivity used to drive 3 to 4 annual productivity in the same kind of work then today that should be 7 to 8 on the average across all the work that we do now some of that becomes 20 in some cases and some of that is nothing because there s nothing new we can do because everything has been done so obviously it changes depending on the type of work and that takes into account the final growth that we deliver so to deliver 12 13 growth it means total growth has to be of the order of magnitude of 20 mayank tandon needham and company analyst great that makes a lot of sense thank you for the color appreciate it thanks guys operator thank you our next question comes from the line of moshe katri from wedbush securities your line is now open our next question comes from the line of justin donati from wells fargo securities your line is now open justin donati wells fargo securities analyst hi thanks for the follow up just wondering does the 2020 guidance embed anything for potentially taking market share in some social media content from competitors who are exiting that business tiger tyagarajan president and chief executive officer so justin i ll start by saying that content moderation trust and safety as a service line a couple of years back we chose as a very important service line and a strategic service line for us and we ve been investing we ve been creating capabilities we have a set of great relationships there so we obviously have planned for continued growth in that service line having seen growth over the last few years in that service line and we have a fantastic team with a great reputation in the marketplace with the clients that we serve do some of the things that have happened in the marketplace provide opportunities the answer is yes but is that the only opportunity there the answer is no it is a space that is changing rapidly it s providing a lot of opportunities across a range of clients so we ve of course factored in growth in that service line as part of our strategy but it s not dependent on one event justin donati wells fargo securities analyst thank you operator thank you at this time i m showing no further questions i would like to turn the call back over to roger sachs for closing remarks roger sachs head of investor relations thank you everybody for joining us today and we look forward to speaking to you again next quarter operator

on tuesday the commerce department issued a final rule that will allow the use of tariffs to offset imports from countries whose governments take action to depress the value of their currency the rule is controversial and raises a number of questions regarding u s economic and trade policy perhaps of most immediate relevance the rule adds another arrow to the trump administration s trade policy quiver once again placing currency front and center of an america first economic policy q1 what specifically does the administration s modified rule allow a1 the rule allows for currency undervaluation to be treated as a subsidy under u s trade remedy law and as a result permits the application of countervailing duties cvd on goods from countries the commerce department deems to have an undervalued currency the modified rule clarifies to which entities countervailing duties for undervalued currency can be applied this is an essential element of the rule because subsidies can only be offset with countervailing duties if they meet a bar of specificity one aspect of which is that they are provided to a certain group of enterprises or industries the rule takes an extremely broad definition of group for this purpose defining group as enterprises that buy or sell goods internationally i e enterprises in the traded goods sector of an economy which in practice should cover essentially all firms that export goods additionally the rule lays out how currency devaluation will be assessed this aspect of the rule is discussed below q2 what is the significance of including currency undervaluation for purposes of determining the scope for countervailing duties a2 as noted in our august 2019 commentary the trump administration has taken a number of steps to place currency front and center of an america first economic policy tuesday s rule modification is the latest proof point equating currency undervaluation with countervailable financial support beyond expanding the basis and applicability of cvds the ruling is significant because of the role it gives commerce in determining currency undervaluation historically within the exclusive purview of treasury the agency responsible in consultation with the federal reserve system for u s exchange rate policy while the modified rule commits commerce to seek and generally defer to treasury s expertise in currency matters the final assessment will come from commerce setting up the possibility that the two agencies might reach different conclusions internationally treasury s main counterparts are other finance ministries who in turn are empowered to make commitments including to refrain from competitive devaluation of currencies and to resist all forms of protectionist measures by contrast the commerce department is appropriately focused on enhancing job creation domestically and increasing u s exports the final rule effectively gives the agency in charge of u s export promotion an important voice on exchange rate assessments a precedent that may well complicate international agreements down the road and confuse understanding of u s policy and objectives q3 how will currency undervaluation be assessed what are the differences between the commerce and treasury approaches a3 assessing currency misalignment under or overvaluation is notoriously tricky business comments received in response to commerce s draft rules underscore that point the commerce department s final rule attempts to address some of the concerns first it clarifies that in determining whether a country s currency is undervalued it will take into account the gap between a country s real effective exchange rate reer and the reer that achieves an external balance over the medium term an approach used by the international monetary fund imf in making its own country specific external sector assessments second the final rule states that commerce normally will make an affirmative finding of currency undervaluation only if there has been government action on the exchange rate that contributes to an undervaluation of the currency the rule does not define government action but indicates that commerce will not normally include monetary and related credit policy of an independent central bank or monetary authority the commerce department acknowledges the subjectivity of any assessment as required by the trade facilitation and trade enforcement act of 2015 treasury attempted to address the subjectivity inherent in such assessments by developing objective criteria including thresholds for an economy s bilateral trade balance with the united states overall current account balance and foreign exchange intervention to determine whether an economy may be pursuing foreign exchange policies that could give it an unfair competitive advantage against the united states at the same time treasury maintained the authority to label an economy a currency manipulator under the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of 1988 which calls on treasury to consider whether countries manipulate the rate of exchange between their currency and the united states dollar for purposes of preventing effective balance of payments adjustments or gaining unfair competitive advantage in international trade it s worth noting that treasury relied on the 1988 act to label china a currency manipulator last year q4 does the rule violate world trade organization wto rules a4 the question of whether using countervailing duties to offset currency undervaluation is a violation of wto rules has been debated for years critics of the approach claim that currency undervaluation does not meet the characteristics of a subsidy necessary for a response of countervailing duties set out by the wto proponents claim the opposite there are two major points of contention in the debate whether currency undervaluation meets the definition of a financial contribution by a government or public body and whether currency undervaluation subsidizes a specific enterprise or industry or group of enterprises or industries for currency undervaluation to be legitimately considered countervailable under wto rules it would have to meet the definitions of both financial contribution and specific enterprise or industry or group of enterprises or industries these issues are addressed under the agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures ascm as per the ascm a subsidy is deemed to exist if there is a financial contribution by a government or a public body within the territory of a member or if there is any form of income or price support and a benefit is thereby conferred critics claim currency undervaluation meets neither of those definitions the commerce department in its final rule pushed back against this argument with two arguments of its own first the department pointed out that determinations regarding this question are made on a case by case basis and not in rulemaking second the department simply asserted that the exchange of domestic currency to u s currency could constitute a financial contribution regarding the specificity question the ascm requires that a subsidy be specific to an enterprise or industry or group of enterprises or industries within the jurisdiction of the granting authority decisions in wto disputes have previously defined the concept of industry or a group of industries as related to producers of certain products see for example u s upland cotton while conceding that the specificity question should be assessed on a case by case basis the commerce department s modified rule defines group as enterprises that buy or sell internationally it does not limit the enterprises on the criteria of producers of certain products or a group of products which critics of the rule claim does not fulfill the specificity criterion and therefore breaches wto rules the administration argues that the definition of group provided in the modified rules refers to an identifiable group of enterprises and therefore it is specific the commerce department also claims that prohibited subsidies those contingent on exports or the use of domestic goods over imports are deemed specific under wto rules and are outright prohibited the department argues that currency undervaluation could be considered a prohibited subsidy because it underprices exports and overprices imports creating the effect of an export and import substitution subsidy critics of the rule claim that it does not suffice to demonstrate solely that the government granting the subsidy anticipated exports or import substitution instead a member must establish that the subsidy is contingent on export performance or on import substitution see canada aircraft and other disputes critics argue that currency undervaluation is tied to the exchange of currency and not to exportation or import substitution and therefore cannot be classified as a prohibited subsidy that is specific additionally currency undervaluation has not been mentioned in the illustrative list of export subsidies see annex i ascm with each side of the debate armed to the brim with arguments dressed in legalese the united states is almost certain to face a formal complaint at the wto q5 does the rule violate u s law a5 regarding u s law there has been some question over whether commerce has the statutory authority to take currency undervaluation into account particularly without congress modifying the current cvd law a foreign company or government could use this legal argument in u s litigation in response to a cvd order justified on grounds of currency undervaluation the commerce department claims that it has the authority to administer the cvd law including in instances where currency undervaluation should be countervailable and has the authority to promulgate regulations to do so the commerce department also argues that it does not have a history of finding that currency undervaluation is not countervailable and even if it did it is always able to change its practices stephanie segal is a senior fellow with the simon chair in political economy at the center for

and gaap effective tax rate which preclude the company from providing accurate guidance on certain forward looking gaap to non gaap reconciliations the company believes that providing estimates of the amounts that would be required to reconcile the range of the company s adjusted operating expenses and the effective tax rate on adjusted earnings would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors for the reasons identified above capital management the company paid cash dividends of 40 1 million or 0 36 per share during the fourth quarter of 2019 and

allocated to common stockholders and adjusted diluted earnings per share effective tax rate on adjusted earnings adjusted cash and financial investments ebitda ebitda margin adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin management believes that the non gaap financial measures presented in this press release including adjusted operating income and adjusted operating expenses provide additional and comparative information to assess trends in our core operations and a means to evaluate period to period comparisons non gaap financial measures disclosed by management are provided as additional information to investors in order to provide them with an alternative method for assessing our financial condition and operating results amortization expense of acquired intangible assets we amortize intangible assets acquired in connection with various acquisitions amortization of intangible assets is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is significantly affected by the timing and size of our acquisitions as such if intangible asset amortization is included in performance measures it is more difficult to assess the day to day operating performance of the businesses the relative operating performance of the businesses between periods and the earnings power of the company therefore we believe performance measures excluding intangible asset amortization expense provide investors with an additional basis for comparison across accounting periods acquisition related expenses from time to time we have pursued small bolt on acquisitions and in 2017 completed a larger transformative acquisition which have resulted in expenses which would not otherwise have been incurred in the normal course of the company s business operations these expenses include integration costs as well as legal due diligence and other third party transaction costs the frequency and the amount of such expenses vary significantly based on the size timing and complexity of the transaction accordingly we exclude these costs for purposes of calculating non gaap measures which provide an additional analysis of cboe s ongoing operating performance or comparisons in cboe s performance between periods the

revenues less cost of revenues net revenue it is presented as supplemental information that the company believes is useful to investors to evaluate its results because it excludes certain items that are not directly related to the company s core operating performance ebitda is calculated by adding back to net income interest expense income tax expense depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda is calculated by adding back to ebitda acquisition related expenses and impairment charges attributed to noncontrolling interest ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered as substitutes either for net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or for cash flow as a measure of the company s liquidity in addition because ebitda and adjusted ebitda may not be

officer and member of board of directors thank you irene and good morning everyone thanks for joining us 2019 was another great year and a step forward for firstenergy marked by solid execution on initiatives that benefit our customers shareholders communities and our company one of the accomplishments that makes us most proud is our record of delivering on the commitments we ve made to the financial community this morning we announced 2019 gaap earnings of 1 70 per share and operating earnings of 2 58 per share which is at the top end of the guidance range we provided on our last earnings call by executing on our customer focused growth strategy along with some benefits from third quarter weather we successfully mitigated the absence of the ohio distribution modernization rider in the second half of the year we ve reached five years of consistently meeting or exceeding the midpoint of the quarterly guidance that we provided the culture of execution and ownership that our leadership team has established at firstenergy is one you can continue to count on as we improve service for our customers and communities and deliver strong results for our shareholders two years ago we introduced our first long term growth rate projection of 6 to 8 compounded annually from 2018 to 2021 in the first year we hit it out of the park our 2019 growth versus our original 2018 guidance was 12 excluding both the ohio dmr and weather impacts our culture of strong execution is clearly evident and has gotten us off to a great start on what now is a five year growth plan and we re looking forward to another solid year in 2020 as we reaffirm our operating earnings guidance of 2 40 to 2 60 per share we continue providing investors with clarity into our long term expectations for earnings growth in november we extended the cagr at a rate of 5 to 7 through 2023 as we ve discussed this projection includes plans to issue a modest amount of equity up to a total of 600 million annually starting in 2022 when this happens it will represent the first infusion of equity into our growth initiative since early 2018 and we will have invested approximately 12 billion in our business during that period by successfully executing on our regulated growth strategies we have driven strong results for investors in 2019 our total shareholder return was 34 placing our stock within the top quartile of the eei index the tsr over the last two years 2018 and 2019 was 71 making firstenergy the number one stock in the eei index over that period over the past several years the rating agencies have acknowledged our transition to a fully regulated company with primarily transmission and distribution operations resulting in a lower risk profile in 2019 we received numerous ratings upgrades across the firstenergy family as well as at the parent level with the november upgrade from fitch we are making solid progress toward our goal to achieve solid bbb ratings at all three agencies while we remain focused on making steady improvements to our balance sheet we believe we are well positioned to support our plans for growth including the extended cagr and associated equity issuance in 2019 we continued executing on our long term customer focused growth plans this included an annual capital investment of approximately 3 billion in our transmission and distribution infrastructure which we expect to continue for the foreseeable future in our transmission business we successfully completed year six of our energizing the future investment program with more than 6 8 billion in investments during that period as we reported to you throughout 2019 our customers in the atsi footprint are seeing measurable reliability improvements including a nearly 50 reduction in equipment related transmission outages as a result of the work we re doing to modernize the grid as we continue extending the program into our eastern footprint we expect those customers to experience similar benefits we took another important step in 2019 to continue the expansion of our energizing the future initiative in december ferc accepted our application to move jcp l s transmission assets in the forward looking formula rates effective january 1 2020 subject to refund with this change nearly 90 of our transmission business is on forward looking formula rates the forward looking rate structure in new jersey supports our plan for approximately 175 million in customer focused capital spending on the jcp l transmission system this year on the distribution side of our business last month we received approval from the public utilities commission of ohio to implement a decoupling mechanism for our residential and commercial customers in the state the commission also removed the requirement that our ohio companies file a distribution rate case by 2024 decoupling provides rate transparency and stability for these customers while providing revenue certainty to our ohio companies rates for 2019 and each year thereafter will be reconciled to 2018 baseline revenues and adjusted through a conservation support rider there is no impact from the rider on 2019 earnings that adjustment will be recognized in the first quarter of 2020 going forward the rider will be reflected in current period results also in ohio our utilities are moving forward with 516 million three year grid modernization program that was approved by the puco in july as we ve discussed the plan includes modernization projects designed to help reduce the number and duration of power outages and allow our customers to make more informed decisions about their energy usage we expect to complete approximately 170 million of grid mod work this year this initial phase includes deploying 250 000 smart meters to ohio customers implementing time varying rates and installing more than 600 reclosers and capacitors on the electric distribution system which will help automatically isolate problems prevent entire circuit lockouts and quickly restore electric service to customers in pennsylvania we completed work on the initial phase of our original 350 million long term infrastructure improvement plan in 2019 last month the public utility commission approved our ltiip ii spanning 2020 through 2024 the ltiip ii program includes a 572 million investment across our four pennsylvania utilities to accelerate distribution infrastructure projects in the state the improvement plan for each utility complements the work we already perform on our distribution network to reduce the number and duration of outages experienced by our 2 million pennsylvania customers investments include replacing older poles lines and fuses installing new substation equipment network vaults and manual covers and reconfiguring circuits approximately 120 million of the work is expected to be completed in 2020 across our pennsylvania service area with the remainder spent over the next four years costs associated with these service reliability investments are expected to be recovered through the pennsylvania distribution system improvement charge if you recall that earlier in 2019 the maryland public service commission approved our rate case an electric distribution investment surcharge and a five year electric vehicle pilot program while the new jersey board of utilities approved our jcp l reliability plus initiative together these initiatives position us to improve service to our customers as we enable new technologies and the grid of the future later this month we plan to file a distribution rate base rate case in new jersey we will seek to recover increasing costs associated with providing safe and reliable electric service for our customers along with recovery of storm costs incurred over the last few years to sum up my discussion of our regulated investments i want to remind you that after the conversion of the jcp l transmission assets to a forward looking formula rate more than 60 of our annual investment will now be in formula rates and distribution riders making our investment profile very transparent finally i hope you ve taken the time to review our five year strategic plan and our corporate responsibility report which were both published to our website in the fall these reports are an important element of our commitment to provide transparency and it has enhanced engagement with our stakeholders they also offer a platform to track progress on our goals and strategies including esg initiatives such as our carbon reduction target efforts to build a more diverse and exclusive workforce and our iss governance score we are excited to recently earn the bloomberg gender equality index designation for the second consecutive year and last month we were named to forbes list of the best employers for diversity in addition we are one of only four companies in our sector to achieve the best possible rating in the iss governance quality score we will refresh the data in our corporate responsibility report when we publish our annual report next month and we intend to update the strategic plan later this year to maintain a five year outlook i think you will see that we are continuing to drive firstenergy toward our mission of becoming a premier forward thinking electric utility that our stakeholders can trust and believe in as i mentioned earlier we are affirming our 2020 operating earnings guidance of 2 40 per share to 2 60 per share we re also pleased to affirm our expected cagr of 6 to 8 through 2021 and 5 to 7 extending through 2023 in addition we are introducing operating earnings guidance of 0 60 per share to 0 70 per share for the first quarter of 2020 thank you for your time we had a great year and we look forward to building on our progress now i ll turn it over to steve for a review of the fourth quarter and 2019 steven e strah senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning it s great to speak with you today all reconciliations and other detailed information about the quarter are available in the strategic and financial highlights document that is posted to our website we also posted an updated fact book to the website this morning which includes additional supporting materials related to 2022 and 2023 such as our capital and load forecasts now let s review our results we reported a fourth quarter gaap loss of 0 20 per share driven by our annual non cash pension and opeb mark to market adjustment i ll spend a few minutes discussing our pension performance later in my comments adjusting for special items fourth quarter operating earnings were 0 55 per share which is above the midpoint of the guidance we provided on our last earnings call in the distribution business earnings were flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 o m expenses were lower this quarter compared to the same period in 2018 and distribution revenues were higher this offset the absence of the ohio dmr and the impact of more mild temperatures across our footprint total distribution earnings increased due to incremental rider revenue in ohio and pennsylvania but customer usage decreased compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 both in actual and weather adjusted basis heating degree days were 2 below normal and 7 lower than the fourth quarter of 2018 residential sales were down 1 3 on an actual basis compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 but increased slightly on a weather adjusted basis in the commercial customer class fourth quarter sales decreased 4 3 on an actual basis and 3 5 when adjusted for weather compared to the same period in 2018 finally in our industrial class fourth quarter loads decreased 2 4 while shale while the shale gas sector continues to grow we saw a sales decline in every other major sector including steel automotive coal and chemical looking at our load trends for the full year of 2019 we are encouraged to see the stability in the residential sector where we ve recorded two consecutive years of modest growth in weather adjusted sales however full year 2019 sales to commercial customers were down 2 compared to 2018 drivers include weaker economic conditions energy efficiency and distributed generation measures initiated by customers in the education and food and beverage sectors and lower usage from the real estate sector related to decreases in new construction while it s widely recognized that the u s has entered into a manufacturing recession the impacts of that slump combined with a couple of large plant closings resulted in a 1 7 decrease in deliveries to industrial customers for the year turning back to fourth quarter results for the transmission business earnings increased primarily due to higher rate base at our formula rate companies related to our continued investments in the energizing the future program and in our corporate segment fourth quarter results primarily reflect lower operating expenses in the absence of a fourth quarter 2018 contribution to the firstenergy foundation before we open the call to your questions let s spend a moment on a few other financial matters starting with the pension performance and its impact on our future funding requirements in 2019 our pension plan investments produced a return on assets of 20 3 far exceeding our original assumption of 5 7 this superior plan performance coupled with the low discount rate of 3 34 produced two outcomes first our 2019 non cash after tax pension and opeb mark to market adjustment is approximately 480 million which is at the lower end of the range we provided in october second our pension plan funding requirements for 2022 and 2023 have decreased significantly a year ago our 2022 funding requirement stood at 382 million as a result of the robust plan returns last year this has decreased to 159 million and for 2023 our funding requirement has decreased to 375 million compared to 455 million at the end of 2018 as we indicated during the third quarter the lower interest rate environment has resulted in a higher pension liability but our funded status has improved to 79 compared to 77 at the end of 2018 as you know we normally only mark the pension at year end but we will need to remeasure it again when fes emerges from bankruptcy assuming that they emerge in the first quarter of this year we anticipate an after tax non cash loss of up to 400 million based on the discount rate and pension performance finally our corporate liquidity continues to be strong with 3 5 billion of undrawn credit facilities and approximately 465 million in cash this cash position plus a portion of revolver borrowings will fund the final payment of 853 million to fes upon their emergence please keep in mind 2020 will be a transitional year from a rating agency perspective as this final fes payment will impact our credit metrics however when you exclude this payment our 2020 credit metrics will be compliant with the thresholds established by each of the three rating agencies with respect to equity we have no incremental needs through 2021 and as we told you at eei we plan to issue up to 600 million of equity annually in 2022 and 2023 the ultimate amount will be determined by a number of factors including customer load storm activity weather trends pension performance and rating agency metrics thank you we re proud of our results in 2019 and we look forward to continuing our strong progress this year now let s take your questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now be conducting a question and answer session our first question comes from the line of greg gordon with evercore isi please proceed with your question greg gordon evercore isi analyst hey thanks congrats on a good year guys charles e jones president chief executive officer and member of board of directors good morning greg greg gordon evercore isi analyst a couple questions the looking at the cash flow disclosure you gave there are some changes relative to what the outlook look like in the last fact book but i guess when i unpack it it looks like the major change is just the delay in the cash payment to the fes creditors and a decision to pay them out in cash rather than take on that tax note associated with the prior settlement so can you just walk through i know the former is just timing but the decision making on the latter and why you see that as value accretive steven e strah senior vice president and chief financial officer hey greg it s steve starh so the way you explained it is exactly what happened we were planning to make the payment in 2019 assuming an fes emergence at that point but obviously that didn t happen it s going to happen here sometime in february at which point in time we will fund the cash payment of 225 million and we will also pay what we were previously thinking would be issued as a tax note we will also pay that tax note in cash and so from an economics perspective it just makes more sense for us to use cash on hand to pay off that tax note now rather than have to deal with it by the end of 2022 and refinance it again at that point charles e jones president chief executive officer and member of board of directors and i ll just emphasize that point that means we won t be answering questions about fes for the next five years greg gordon evercore isi analyst no we re all happy about that two more questions the as it pertains to just obviously a lot of moving parts when you think about the 22 and beyond equity potential equity needs you ve set up to 600 million but one of the pieces that looks like it s gotten better is pension performance means future pension contributions are down by a little over 300 million so all things equal does that mean that your equity needs are down by potentially up to 300 million steven e strah senior vice president and chief financial officer well i would say this we put a range in there that allows for flexibility for lots of things to change between now and then the range of zero to 600 million including the drip is a range that we expect to stay in i don t think it should be extracted that it will be 600 million every single year but it will be within that range depending on where we re at when we get to that point greg gordon evercore isi analyst all right that s a fair not answer and my final question is i know this has no direct economic impact on your definitely it has an impact on your customers what do you think the ohio government s response is going to be ferc decision on the mopr rules with regard to the capacity market is it possible that the state of ohio will consider leaving pjm through frr charles e jones president chief executive officer and member of board of directors i would say that the state of ohio has already kind of talked about their disappointment with the pjm market and their intention to use the next year or so to look at energy policy for the state the last time they looked at energy policy of the state was 20 years ago 1999 when senate bill 3 deregulated the state i think there is a lot of disappointment that some of the goals they though would be achieved through that never materialized i think there were some unintended consequences that happened that they didn t expect to happen and so i think they re going to fully look at everything from how the utilities interact with the public utilities commission to how we ensure a long term secure supply of generation for ohio customers to how we get back to us the ohio being a state that has an energy surplus as opposed to a shortfall i think there is a lot of things they re going to look at but beyond that what our intention is we ll be at the table helping where they want help providing our guidance where they want guidance and expressing our views where we feel strongly about certain things should go a certain way greg gordon evercore isi analyst do you feel strongly about frr one way or the other charles e jones president chief executive officer and member of board of directors i don t i m not in the generation business anymore so but i feel strongly that we need to come up with a long term solution for customers that ensures they have adequate secure cost effective generation not just right now and i mean it s no my views on these markets has not changed a one year capacity signal three years out and the next hourly short run marginal cost signal is no way to do this business for the long haul and they are failing and so something needs to be done whether ohio decides to step up and do something is up to them but i do not think the market as constructed today is going to provide the best long term outcome for my customers greg gordon evercore isi analyst thank you operator our next question comes from the line of praful mehta with citigroup please proceed with your question praful mehta citigroup analyst thanks so much hi guys charles e jones president chief executive officer and member of board of directors hi praful praful mehta citigroup analyst hi so maybe just firstly clarifying something more specific on page 11 you have regulatory charges for the fourth quarter in the distribution business which is being adding which is adding back about 0 15 of earnings to get to more operating earnings what specifically does that 0 15 relate to jason j lisowski vice president controller and chief accounting officer yeah praful this is jason lisowski chief accounting officer that is related to a ferc order that reallocated some transmission expenses across our utilities and as you may recall in ohio we at the time in the past did not have the ability to pass those on to customers so it ends up being actually a refund and a credit back to our companies and since in the past we were excluding that from our non gaap operating earnings when you receive that credit we consistently also excluded from our non gaap operating earnings praful mehta citigroup analyst i got you that s helpful thank you and then in terms of longer term growth the 21 to 23 earnings profile based on the growth that you ve talked about looks like a 4 5 earnings growth if i just were to use the math for the last two years i m assuming some of that is obviously a slower rate base growth and then the equity need can you just walk through or help us understand what kind of rate base growth you re assuming for the last two years in the current forecast and like how much dilution you expect was from rate base to eps charles e jones president chief executive officer and member of board of directors i ll answer this the cagr that we ve given you for the next five years is the cagr that we expect to hit which is 6 to 8 for the first three and then 5 to 7 after that i ll let jason try to walk you through the rate base accounting that gets to that but as i ve told you many times when you look at our company from the outside in trying to align up what you look at with the regulatory accounting that goes on because it s no longer just the same simple math that it used to be is difficult but we ll have jason try jason j lisowski vice president controller and chief accounting officer yeah so praful if you look at the fact book that we released this morning we actually do show our expected rate base growth both separately for the regulated distribution and regulated transmission through 2023 broken down by each state and you will see that in 2022 and 2023 there is still growth but that growth does slow down a little bit praful mehta citigroup analyst okay fair enough i ll dig through that a little bit more and discuss that and then just finally on the equity needs point i understand that clearly the pension has helped so that should help reduce the equity need a little bit i wanted to understand in terms of balancing other goals right around leverage holdco debt what are the key guide posts that we should be thinking about as you think about the equity up to 600 million what could help bring it down apart from pension what could help what could kind of lead to pushing it up just a few of those guide posts would be helpful charles e jones president chief executive officer and member of board of directors well obviously one thing that could help bring it down is if we eventually see some reasonable load growth throughout our footprint just a little bit of load growth can have a huge impact i we give a range for a reason i mean what could the performance of the pension plan can continue to affect what s needed there it s i wasn t trying to dodge greg s question i can t sit here today and tell you how much equity we re going to recommend we issue in 2022 23 24 it s not going to be more than 600 million i can confidently say that praful mehta citigroup analyst got it really appreciate it guys thank you operator our next question comes from the line of julien dumoulin smith with bank of america merrill lynch please proceed with your question julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey good morning team charles e jones president chief executive officer and member of board of directors good morning julien julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey so perhaps just to pick up on a slightly different state and angle can you talk a little bit more about new jersey and the energy master plan here and specifically how do you see opportunities emerging from that and or some of your peers in their respective clean energy filings in parallel i m thinking ami or otherwise and then as well can you touch on some of the commentary in the e p with respect to a reduction or meaningful reduction in gas and obviously you guys aren t in gas but conversely how do you think about the electrification implications that seem to be pretty clear in the e p as well so perhaps such holistically on the new jersey business given everything going on if you don t mind charles e jones president chief executive officer and member of board of directors okay well there s a lot in that question i was just over in new jersey last week i met with three of the bpu commissioners i met with the governor and his policy team the afternoon after he rolled out the energy master plan so i had a lot of opportunity to talk with him and his team in particular about how i think our company can help him be successful with it i think there are opportunities for us to help particularly in the electric vehicle area if the state decides to embrace utilities investing and building out a robust charging network throughout the state i think advanced metering is something the state has to decide what their policy is on but we ve got a lot of experience now in pennsylvania with nearly 2 million meters there and we re going to be rolling out a 0 25 million in ohio so what i offered is we re we ll come to the table and help them understand the pros and the cons because there are both that we see to help them make an informed decision on that i was very honest with him that i have no intention to get into investing in offshore wind that s not something i see us taking on at this point in time talked with him about transmission and i know the bpu president made some comments about transmission so i might as well just address those here because i know i m going to get a question and his comments were specific to the network transmission service charges in the bgs auction for one company and that company was not us by the way i saw what happened in the market with our stock yesterday after his comments became public i think the market should be smart enough to figure out that that involved one company should also be smart enough to figure out as he said at the end that ferc sets transmission rates not the bpu and they re not going to set different ones for new jersey than they do everywhere else it should also be smart enough to figure out that what we ve told you all along is 90 of our transmission capital investment is in states other than new jersey and 90 of all of our 3 billion of investment is in states other than new jersey but what i talked to the governor and his team about is the fact that our transmission plan if we work together can be complementary to what he is trying to do with his energy master plan and actually enabling of what he wants to do with his energy master plan and they were very receptive to that and we agreed to continue to work together to figure out how to make that happen so all in all i think firstenergy is at the best place that it s ever been in new jersey in terms of our relationships in terms of the things that we re doing in terms of us being trusted advisors to the governor s office on his energy master plan there was nothing in that energy master plan that scares me in any way but there are pieces and parts that i think we can help more on and there s pieces and parts that we don t want to be part of julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst but just to clarify on that could this be incremental capital i know you guys talked about a very specific and committed equity capital plan and financing plan through the forecast period but i just also hear your comments about helping the state of new jersey here too charles e jones president chief executive officer and member of board of directors the reason we have a range in this capex plan that we ve communicated is so that we have the ability to have flexibility to move it around state to state transmission to distribution i m not going to say here and tell you that we re going to add incremental capital beyond the range that we ve given you and the range that we re giving you is has got a couple control rods in it one is our customers ability to pay and a constant awareness of the fact that without load growth these are going to be rate increases for customers and we have to be careful with that and the other control rod be in the balance sheet and managing the amount of equity that we re ultimately going to need to do to maintain our credit where we want it and get to that goal be bbb rated with all three agencies so we re going to use this range that we have to satisfy what we re going to execute from a work plan in all five states i m not planning to change that range in the near term julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst all right great well best of luck thank you charles e jones president chief executive officer and member of board of directors thanks julien operator our next question comes from the line of michael lapides with goldman sachs please proceed with your question michael lapides goldman sachs analyst hey guys thanks for taking my question chuck you only really owned general regulated generation in one state west virginia just curious how you re thinking about kind of the potential for kind of changes to the generation fleet the composition of the generation fleet maybe especially since the state kind of sitting on the marcellus shale whether the economics make sense for the company and the customer to add a little bit more gas fired generation into the regulated mix there and then obviously is there a need for kind of an uptick in either renewable or even kind of smart grid on the distribution side capex in west virginia charles e jones president chief executive officer and member of board of directors well you make a good straight man because you can help me reemphasize the point that one of the things that i think differentiates us from many others in our sector is we are a transmission and distribution company buy and large we have four states that are deregulated so we don t own generation there and that creates a risk profile that s very low risk we don t have the risks that go along with owning massive fleets of generating plants particularly coal and coal waste disposal sites and so forth in west virginia the process is real simple we re going to file a integrated resource plan in west virginia by the end of this year we ll share our ideas with west virginia about where we see their capacity needs being some thoughts on how to meet that but those decisions are going to be made in conjunction with the state of west virginia and i think that there are opportunities to embrace what s going on with the shale development and they re capitalizing on it with a lot of industrial growth in that state in terms of collection and compressing and so forth whether they want to capitalize it in terms of generation sources that remains to be seen and i don t want to speak for the state of west virginia but up until now at least haven t been real welcoming to renewables there but from a synergy perspective as we get separation from the whole fes issue and put that behind us i think investment in renewable generation in a regulated context is something that we need to be thinking about adding to our portfolio not deregulated in any fashion we worked so hard to get to this company that i just said it s a t d company low risk no exposure to markets that s where we want to stay any generation we might invest in there s going to be earning a regulated rate of return just like those two plants in west virginia do michael lapides goldman sachs analyst got it one other question totally unrelated just curious can you what s embedded in guidance in terms of kind of o m growth rates across the distribution business and also at the corporate level charles e jones president chief executive officer and member of board of directors what s embedded in our guidance is keeping o m flat over that period so and so what i ve challenged the team to do is to get more efficient at how we deliver service to customers we re in the process of rolling out an innovation center at firstenergy we ve got a number of employees who have earned black belts in innovation engineering we re going to put them all into one group we re going to use that group to help drive innovation throughout this company as a way to make us more efficient and offset the annual we d give a this year a 3 5 wage increase on the average to our employees about half of which ends up o m we ve got to find a way to offset but what s in the guidance period is flat o m throughout that period michael lapides goldman sachs analyst got it starting off of 2019 base or starting off 2018 base and was there anything unusual in 2019 charles e jones president chief executive officer and member of board of directors starting off of the when we finished fe tomorrow and finish dealing with our corporate costs which by the way our t d costs are bottom decile for as far as o m and our corporate costs are bottom quartile in terms of low being good in both cases so we ve got this company very lean and we expect to keep it that way throughout this period michael lapides goldman sachs analyst got it thank you chuck much appreciate it charles e jones president chief executive officer and member of board of directors thank you operator our next question comes from the line of charles fishman with morningstar research please proceed with your question charles fishman morningstar research analyst yeah chuck 90 of your transmission now on the one slide you showed was formula base or forward looking and what gets you to that last 10 is it a process similar to what we saw in new jersey or and what s the timing on that do you think charles e jones president chief executive officer and member of board of directors well it s what s left that is not forward looking formula rate it is the former allegheny system and yes the process would be to either eventually merge that into one of our existing transcos or form another transco but the timing is what is such that we ll do that when it makes the best sense in terms of there will be a crossover point where the investment returns more returns to shareholders in a forward looking formula rate than it does in a stated rate right now he stated rate is better for all of you charles fishman morningstar research analyst and then second question when we last talked in november you hadn t finished the planning process and you wanted to hold off on guidance through 23 as you wrapped up that process in your mind was there anything that i don t know surprise is probably a too strong of a word but maybe it was a little different than you thought as you wrapped up that process charles e jones president chief executive officer and member of board of directors no not at all i mean i think it s very difficult to predict the future five years out so a lot of what we had to get comfortable with in that planning process is what what s the world going to look like not today but what s the world going to look like in 2023 what s going to happen with inflation what s going to happen with growth etc etc and bracket those types of things one thing i can tell you i m confident in is that we re going to execute on the plan that we put out to this company and if it s 3 2 billion or 3 3 billion or 2 9 billion it s going to deliver the results that we intend to deliver and by getting to the point where more than 60 of all of it is in formula rates it s very transparent and easy to calculate and where we need to have rate cases we re going to have them just as i said we re going to file a rate case probably this month in new jersey to get that trued up recover some storm costs that we ve deferred up until now so our ability to execute on rate cases we ve demonstrated we can do that too but it was just really more getting comfortable with a range of outcomes that could happen between now and then to get comfortable with the cagr and get comfortable with the equity assumptions both charles fishman morningstar research analyst okay that s all i have thank you charles e jones president chief executive officer and member of board of directors and the only other thing i d add and i said this repeatedly at eei i m not going to tell you something until i know the engineer in me is still in there we got to have the plan and we got to have the numbers work and i know we can execute on it which is why i was probably a little slow in getting into a five year cagr but that s also what results in five straight years now of meeting or exceeding every single quarter that we ve given you guidance operator our next question comes from the line of andrew weisel with scotiabank please proceed with your question andrew weisel scotiabank analyst hey good morning everybody charles e jones president chief executive officer and member of board of directors good morning andrew weisel scotiabank analyst my first one i just want to follow up on the new jersey questions earlier i believe excuse me in the capex outlook do those forecasts include some level of spending related to things that were covered by the energy master plan like energy efficiency evs ami and will those buckets be part of the upcoming jcp l rate case filing or would they come later in separate compliance filings or something like that charles e jones president chief executive officer and member of board of directors no they don t include anything for that right now it s about 175 million in transmission you know what the iip is we re going to round out the first round of iip and at some point in time hopefully you ll see iip 2 just like you saw ltiip ii in pennsylvania and when that comes again that s why we have a range of capex so that we have the ability to have flexibility from state to state and t to d andrew weisel scotiabank analyst okay so that would be upside to the current numbers if they were to be spending on that charles e jones president chief executive officer and member of board of directors might be upside in new jersey but it would probably come away from somewhere else i mean you can count on the capital plan being what i ve told you it is and we re going to get the cagr that i ve told you we re going to get but the pieces and parts of it may move around from state to state andrew weisel scotiabank analyst got it that s helpful and then last this is just kind of a small one but in pennsylvania you congratulations on getting the ltiip ii approved in full my question is on the dsic rider the benchmark roe was just reduced by 10 basis points i believe yesterday to 9 45 does that apply to your subsidiaries and if so can you give any sort of earnings sensitivity i know that s just came out yesterday so didn t give you a whole lot of time but any thoughts on that charles e jones president chief executive officer and member of board of directors eileen s on top of it eileen mikkelsen vice president rates and regulatory affairs good morning it s eileen mikkelsen i m vice president of rates and regulatory affairs thank you chuck yes we are aware that the pa puc reduced the benchmark for the roe in pennsylvania yesterday to 9 45 where that benchmark is used is really relates to our dsic calculation and four utilities that have not had a base rate case in the last two years they substitute that roe benchmark number into their calculation when they calculate their dsic revenues so for our four distribution utilities in pennsylvania going forward will use in our return calculations a return on equity of 9 45 rather than the 9 45 that we ve been using in the past which really is the 10 basis points across those dsic calculation s immaterial change to the revenues that will collect under those riders the second thing that that roe benchmark is used for is really a customer protection to say to the extent that the utilities have earnings in excess of that benchmarks that they report in their quarterly earnings reports if they exceed that benchmark they will then have to turn off their dsic recovery until such time as their earnings fall below that so we ve looked at those numbers overnight we re confident that it doesn t change our outlook for disc collections during the planning horizon i would put a caveat on it to say we do have a settlement pending before the pennsylvania public utilities commission to increase the cap we have in penn power so assuming that s approved we expect to be able to continue to collect dsic across all of our utilities throughout the planning period andrew weisel scotiabank analyst okay great that s very helpful you mentioned penn power is there a potential for penn power rate case sometime soon eileen mikkelsen vice president rates and regulatory affairs i don t think we re expecting a penn power rate case over the planning horizon and largely that s because we were able to reach a settlement with the other parties in pennsylvania that s pending before the commission to allow us to collect dsic revenue up to 7 5 of our base distribution rates in penn power where for all the other utilities it s capped at 5 so that really allowed us to cover that additional investments through the dsic rider and eliminated the need for a base rate case andrew weisel scotiabank analyst that s great so chuck and is it fair to say that jcp l might be the only rate case through 2023 charles e jones president chief executive officer and member of board of directors i d say that s a fair way to look at where we re at today yeah eileen mikkelsen vice president rates and regulatory affairs i would just again it s eileen i agree with chuck put a caveat on it that we do have an obligation in 2023 to file an additional base rate case in the state of maryland andrew weisel scotiabank analyst right good reminder okay thank you so much operator our next question comes from the line of sophie karp with keybanc capital markets please proceed with your question sophie karp keybanc capital markets analyst hi good morning charles e jones president chief executive officer and member of board of directors good morning sophie karp keybanc capital markets analyst i had a question on load growth so you guys clearly mentioned that there s one of the factors that can help offset equity needs or impact you re planning in a way and despite sort of a strong overall economy it doesn t seem like we see in a lot of that in ohio or elsewhere may be new territories could you discuss that a little bit and maybe give us some sense of what you have seen on the ground and what can change that to actually see some positive load growth thank you steven e strah senior vice president and chief financial officer sophie this is steve strah and we re conservative in terms of the load growth that we do put into our plan and right now i believe we will see more of what we ve seen in 2019 and that is basically flat load growth to slightly declining load growth but i also just looking at 2019 for a moment we were down 1 1 and that was slightly lower than our guidance which was 0 6 so when we estimate it we re pretty good at estimating where we re going to land we didn t miss it significantly and in terms of sensitivities the 1 decline that we saw in 2019 versus the guidance really impacts earnings only about 2 and that s really driven by the residential sector our commercial and industrial loads are really and rates are fixed or having demand rates which are not as impactful so right now we do see the manufacturing recession continuing on in 2020 before we start to see recovery we re hopeful to start to see that recovery in mid year or a little bit later so right now i would just say look forward to flat load growth within our territory we don t really see that changing significantly charles e jones president chief executive officer and member of board of directors so the only thing that i would add that i think at in the back half of this planning period that we re talking about that could be significant is this shell cracker plant in western pennsylvania and empirically as economists look at the world it s difficult to factor that in but i just drove over there for a meeting last week it s due to come online end of 2021 so it s a year and a half away it won t be a lot of load itself because they re going to self generate with the methane that s a waste product of the cracking process but the industrial load that s going to pop up and is already popping up you re starting to see cranes in the air on other sites i think can have an opportunity to jump start this economy in eastern ohio western pennsylvania northern west virginia and we are now starting to see construction progress on the cracker plant in ohio too so the combination of both of those i think can be something that could be a good surprise and it s difficult to factor into the numbers steven e strah senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah i would also add sophie lastly we are encouraged by seeing the two consecutive years of residential load growth albeit modest we look at that as being very positive for some of the reasons i mentioned earlier so i don t want to be too much of a downer or at all sophie karp keybanc capital markets analyst thank you charles e jones president chief executive officer and member of board of directors and look i mean you re in northeastern ohio i mean we ve got forward investing of over 1 billion in two plants in northeastern ohio gm just announced the state of the art battery manufacturing facility in ohio the former lordstown plant is being repurposed into an electric vehicle light duty medium duty truck facility so when those things all get done the job market and the economy is going to benefit from all of that so in the back end of this planning period i m optimistic that we can see some growth sophie karp keybanc capital markets analyst got it thank you charles e jones president chief executive officer and member of board of directors okay i see no other questions in the queue so thank you again for your support really over the last five years since i ve been in this job and i think we intend to have another year in 2020 just like we ve had in the last five years expect to be a fully regulated company here by the end of this month with fes behind us and then just move on from there thank you operator duration 56 minutes call participants irene

by emmanuel onwubiko nigeria is a hoax nigeria is a paradox nigeria is a wonder of the world these three phrases sum up the sentiments that run through the minds of most critical thinkers of nigerian origin who are unable to decipher or offer any logical explanation for why nigeria is rated as a resource rich nation but doubles as home to the largest population of absolutely poor and dejected members of the human community broadly speaking however it is known that the reason for the unwelcomed paradox is because of the crass ineptitude of the political class that have through extensive manipulations of the electoral system managed to hold on to political power since the last half a century after flag independence professor chinua achebe s summed up the above scenario of incompetent leadership that nigeria has been cursed with almost in perpetuity the trouble with nigeria is simply a failure of leadership the nigerian problem is the unwillingness or inability of its leaders to rise to the responsibility to the challenge of personal example which are the hallmarks of true leadership professor chinua achebe to underscore the debilitating leadership crisis that nigeria is faced with all that a person needs to do is to understudy the administrative style of the current president who was once a military dictator retired major general muhammadu buhari since he assumed office five years back this president has rolled back nigeria right into the inglorious class of a member of the world s heavily indebted nation nigeria has under president buhari made a negative detour to become a notorious borrower to an extent that there is now hue and cry from all concerned patriots who are sounding loud note of warning that the current administration will lead nigeria into an economically enslaved nation to the lenders such as china this sordid tale of an inglorious reversal of the gains made by the previous president olusegun obasanjo s administration who led nigeria out of the debts trap need to worry every nigerian because of the dimension that the addiction to borrow has become with president buhari s government and his aversions to public opinion which is of against the toxic move but why make nigerians the unwilling slaves of china through the ireational borrowing patterns did the nigerian customs service not told us that in 2019 alone it raked in n341 trillion as revenues did the federal inland revenue services not claiming to raking in billions from taxes where are these money and why does government borrow so much and claims to be building national infrastructures which still remained collapsed these conundrums are what every reasonable nigeria is asking because it is a notorious fact that only few years back we exited from that disgraceful class of heavily indebted nations from www cgdev org we are told the story of nigeria s freedom from debts as follows nigeria home to one in five africans has been the continent s most indebted nation with 36 billion in external debt 100 million people living on less than a dollar a day and a fledgling democratic government attempting reforms nigeria should have been a strong candidate for debt relief yet in part because of its oil revenues nigeria slipped through the cracks of debt relief programs in 2004 cgd set out to provide analytical support to nigeria s efforts to persuade creditors to agree to an appropriate debt relief package in october 2005 nigeria and the paris club announced a final agreement for debt relief worth 18 billion and an overall reduction of nigeria s debt stock by 30 billion according to the authors the deal was completed on april 21 2006 when nigeria made its final payment and its books were cleared of any paris club debt cgd fellow todd moss who led cgd s work on nigeria s debt explains the outcome of the deal this watershed deal was the result of months of tireless work by both nigerian officials and the creditors the research platform known as cgd stated that it is proud that its work contributed to this historic outcome it says a september 2004 cgd working paper double standards debt treatment and world bank country classification the case of nigeria argued for nigeria s reclassification as an ida only country within the bank a prerequisite for debt relief this overdue change in status announced in june 2005 enabled paris club negotiations to begin in earnest cgd s work also influenced the structure of the final agreement which included the first ever discounted buyback within the paris club an innovation first proposed in an april 2005 cgd note resolving nigeria s debt through a discounted buyback also it says that the center s contribution to the deal has been recognized by participants in the negotiations by others close to the process and by major media your catalytic work and analysis made a difference especially the work of cgd in facilitating the reclassification of nigeria as an ida only country as well as putting forward an innovative solution to the debt problem ngozi okonjo iweala minister of finance as she then was cgd has played a critically important role i have it first hand from negotiators in the paris club that it was the cgd concept of a buyback that was the tipping point that led creditors to agree debt relief for nigeria this is a great achievement for all concerned and is in no small part due to the work of cgd ann pettifor co founder jubilee 2000 and director of advocacy international cgd was described by the new york times as a nonpartisan research institution in washington that proposed elements of the deal oct 21 2005 and by the economist as the washington think tank that first proposed the buy back october 20 2005 nigeria s debt relief deal is historic although the short term financial windfall will be modest the real potential impact is for the future the long term challenge for nigeria will be to consolidate the gains from the debt deal by pushing forward with economic reform and ensuring that the benefits from debt relief are shared with the population this is by no means assured but the debt deal is an important step in the right direction these lofty aspirations have all evaporated due to poor economic management of the muhammadu buhari led administration which sleeps dreams and wakes up thinking of the next loan to apply for nigeria under this government has sleep walked back into the unfortunate class of heavily indebted nations and in five years the government has accumulated what took successive governments in the past over two decades to build up the below story is why every nigerian should worry the media is awash with the frightening moves by the government of muhammadu buhari to once more borrow heavily from china the muhammadu buhari led federal government has offered a lame and irrational explanation why it decided to approach the china exim bank for a 17bn loan request it said other lending institutions like the world bank and the african development bank were not showing much interest when nigeria approached them during recession the minister of finance zainab ahmed stated this in the senate while defending the decision of the regime of the president major general muhammadu buhari retd to borrow 29 96bn loan to fund critical infrastructure across the country she explained that the 8th national assembly had approved about 6bn for the federal government out of the 29 96bn loan leaving a balance of 22 8bn the finance minister ms ahmed told the senate committee on local and foreign loans that the federal government and some state governments were jointly requesting the loans from various lending institutions she said 70 per cent of the loan which is about 17bn would come from the china exim bank while others would be sourced from other lending institutions such as the islamic development bank the minister maintained that the country had no issue with its current debt profile but noted that its dwindling revenue could not fund the various projects that were expected to have meaningful impact on the lives of nigerians she said the funds 22 8bn will be channeled to the funding of infrastructure which will enhance the productivity of our economy other projects are in healthcare and education it also includes projects for the rehabilitation of the north east geopolitical zone which has been ravaged by insurgency others are the mambila hydro power project 4 9bn lagos kano modernization rail project 4 1bn the development finance project loan being provided by a consortium of world bank and african development bank agencies 1 28bn above all the loan will help us to improve our electricity supply reduce poverty create jobs ensure access to finance agricultural productivity guarantee food security achieves high school enrolment provide clean potable water rehabilitate major roads and develop the mining industry on why the country is seeking 70 per cent of the foreign loan from china the minister said it is meant to make funds available to our own development institutions so that they can give out loans because access to finance has been difficult for the smes on the debt profile of the country the minister said the 2016 2018 external borrowing plans are both for the federal government and the states so some states would be responsible for the payment of some of the loans on the sustainability of the nation s debt portfolio the minister said nigeria s current portfolio ceiling as set by the fiscal responsibility act was 25 per cent of total debt to gdp he said the ratio for december 2018 was 19 09 per cent but it reduced to 18 9 per cent by the middle of 2019 the debt service to revenue ratio is however high and it provides us strong justification for us to drive our revenue for 2017 the ratio was 57 per cent and 51 per cent in 2018 the minister said the nation s debt level was low compared to other countries like the usa the united kingdom and canada the chief of staff to the kaduna state governor mohammed abdullahi defended the state s 305m loan request before the panel a representative of the katsina state government yakubu danja said the state planned to source 100m out of 110m from the islamic development bank he said the state would enjoy between 20 to 50 per cent grants and that projects to be executed would cover the entire local government areas of the state he also said that the loan was interest free kogi state government s commissioner for finance budget and planning mr ashiru idris said the 100m that the state was requesting would be used to develop infrastructure to encourage investors and diversify the economy these are all propaganda that lack justification unfortunately nigeria now has a lamedock senate and a senate headed by a stooge of president muhammadu buhari so the senators will okay the request because the senate president ahmed lawan had already stayed that his senate will pass every request from president muhammadu buhari because they are good the chairman of the committee seeking clarification on the loan package is a stooge of the kaduna state governor whilst the finance minister is the sister of the kaduna state governor nothing good can come from the ahmed lawan led senate just before we round up on the frightening development regarding the continuous pursuit for loans by president buhari let us read a little of what oseloka h obaze a seasoned diplomat international civil servant strategic policy advisor wrote in 2016 about buhari s economic policy outlook writing in his book prime witness charge and policy challenges in buhari s nigeria he says ten months into its first year in office the buhari presidency remains economically challenged its espoused economic policies have not manifested as the economy wobbled towards a glaring and deleterious downturn criticisms raged compelling variants of ad hoc policy approaches because most of the policy options were disconnected they presented as policy dissonance if not confusion as fela the legendary musician would say confusion break bone and we have double wahala for dead body and the owner of the dead body nigerians must we allow ourselves to become slaves of china the die is cast emmanuel onwubiko is the head of the human rights writers association of nigeria and www

will turn the call over to your conference host mr mark mchugh senior vice president and cfo sir you may begin mark mchugh senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you and good morning welcome to rayonier s investor teleconference covering fourth quarter earnings our earnings statements and financial supplement were released yesterday afternoon and are available on our website at rayonier com i would like to remind you that in these presentations we include forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws our earnings release

december 1 2019 dave david nunes president and chief executive officer thanks mark and good morning everyone first i ll make some high level comments before turning it back over to mark to review our consolidated financial results then we ll ask doug long our senior vice president of forest resources to comment on our u s and new zealand timber results and following the review of our timber results mark will discuss our real estate results as well as our outlook for 2020 in the fourth quarter we generated adjusted ebitda of 65 million and earnings per share of 0 12 our fourth quarter results were generally in line with our expectations and consistent with the guidance provided on our third quarter earnings call as modestly stronger than expected results in our timber segments offset weaker than expected results in our real estate segment which was driven by the timing of closings overall our team did a great job of navigating very difficult market conditions to deliver a relatively strong fourth quarter with adjusted ebitda exceeding the prior year quarter by approximately 30 for the full year we generated adjusted ebitda of 248 million and earnings per share of 0 46 full year adjusted ebitda declined 27 versus the prior year driven primarily by a much lower contribution from our real estate segment following an extraordinarily strong 2018 in our southern timber segment we achieved full year adjusted ebitda of 120 million which represents an increase of 16 over the prior year notably this result represents a record level of ebitda for our southern timber segment driven primarily by increased volume due to productivity enhancements and acquisitions as well as an all time high contribution from our non timber income business thus while our total consolidated adjusted ebitda decline relative to 2018 it was certainly encouraging to see significant year over year ebitda growth in our southern timber segment which represents the largest component of our asset value in our pacific northwest timber segment we generated full year adjusted ebitda of 17 million this result represents a significant decline from the prior year as log export volumes and log prices declined dramatically following the implementation tariffs by china in late 2018 export market headwinds were further exacerbated during 2019 by the significant increase in european spruce salvage volume flowing into the china market despite a challenging year in the pacific northwest we were pleased to finish on a high note as fourth quarter adjusted ebitda exceeded the prior three quarters combined driven by significantly improved volume and stronger net stumpage realizations in our new zealand timber segment full year adjusted ebitda declined 17 to 76 million the year over year decline in adjusted ebitda was driven primarily by decreases in both export and domestic sawtimber prices as competition from european spruce salvage volume put significant downward pressure on export log prices which in turn led to domestic price declines despite significant export market headwinds particularly in the second half of the year the new zealand timber segment still managed to generate its third highest ebitda result since we began consolidating results of this business in 2013 lastly in our real estate segment we generated full year adjusted ebitda of 60 million which is roughly half the prior year result this year over year decline was driven entirely by a significantly lower number of acres sold in 2019 following an extraordinary level of real estate volume in 2018 including two large transactions in louisiana and new zealand notably our average price per acre of over 4 300 on real estate sales in 2019 was the highest level that we have achieved since 2007 as we have often stated in the past this business is all about premium so despite the lower volume of acres sold in 2019 we feel very good about the nav accretion that we generated through our real estate segment during the year with that let me turn it back over to mark for a more detailed review of our fourth quarter financial results mark mchugh senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks dave let s start on page 5 with our financial highlights sales for the quarter totaled 179 million while operating income was 26 million and net income attributable to rayonier was 16 million or 0 12 per share fourth quarter adjusted ebitda of 65 million was above the prior year quarter primarily due to higher results in our southern timber pacific northwest timber and real estate segments partially offset by a lower contribution from our new zealand timber segment on the bottom of page 5 we provide an overview of our capital resources and liquidity at year end as well as a comparison to the prior year our cash available for distribution or cad for the year was 149 million compared to 240 million in the prior year period primarily due to lower adjusted ebitda and higher capital expenditures a reconciliation of cad to cash provided by operating activities and other gaap measures is provided on page 8 of the financial supplement we closed the year with 69 million of cash and roughly 1 1 billion of debt debt increased modestly in the fourth quarter as we closed on acquisitions totaling 60 million during the period our net debt of 988 million represented 19 of our enterprise value based on our closing stock price at year end i ll now turn the call over to doug to provide a more detailed review of our timber results doug long senior vice president of forest resources thanks mark good morning let s start on page 9 with our southern timber segment adjusted ebitda in the fourth quarter of 28 million was 6 million and 7 million favorable compared to the prior quarter and the prior year quarter respectively fourth quarter harvest volume of approximately 1 6 million tons was 23 and 19 higher compared to the prior quarter and the prior year quarter respectively although full year harvest volumes ended up modestly below our initial guidance for the year overall production was 350 000 tons higher than the prior year we expect to recapture some of the volume deferred in 2019 and 2020 which is reflected in our segment guidance the average pine pulpwood stumpage price of 14 82 per ton was 5 unfavorable compared to the prior quarter and flat compared to the prior year quarter the reduction in price compared to the prior quarter was due to an increase in sales volume in our weakest pulpwood market where we tend to see increased selectivity in the fourth quarter the average pine sawtimber stumpage price of 23 25 per ton was flat compared to the prior quarter and 3 unfavorable compared to the prior year quarter the decline in price compared to the prior year quarter was driven primarily by geographic mix our non timber income team ended the year with another strong quarter delivering revenue of 8 million which was flat compared to the prior quarter and 51 higher than the prior year quarter full year non timber revenue of 35 million was 34 higher than the prior year and reflects a record contribution from our non timber income business overall our southern timber segment delivered full year adjusted ebitda of 120 million which was 16 higher than the prior year on the back of a 6 increase in volume a slight increase in our weighted average net stumpage prices and an additional 9 million of non timber revenue now moving to pacific northwest timber segment on page 10 adjusted ebitda of 9 million was 6 million and 7 million favorable compared to the prior quarter and the prior year quarter respectively fourth quarter harvest volume of 417 000 tons was 60 and 72 higher compared to the prior quarter and the prior year quarter respectively full year harvest volume of 1 2 million tons was in line with our previous guidance as we took advantage of improved demand and favorable stumpage opportunities in the fourth quarter the average delivered sawtimber price of 78 51 per ton was flat compared to the prior quarter and 3 unfavorable compared to the prior year quarter prices remain flat in the course of the year as a result of the continued tariffs on log exports in china and competition from european salvage timber however due to favorable pricing on stumpage sales in the fourth quarter coupled with lower average cut and haul rates we actually realized a 12 increase in average net stumpage prices versus the prior year quarter the average delivered pulpwood price of 39 24 was 4 favorable compared to the prior quarter but 17 unfavorable compared to the prior year quarter we continue to see excess pulpwood and chips play on the market due to reduced exports although we believe that the decline in demand for export chips and the gilman sawmill residual chips has generally stabilized the favorable variance in pulpwood prices compared to the prior quarter was due to geographic mix overall our pacific northwest timber segment delivered full year adjusted ebitda of 17 million which was 24 million or 59 unfavorable compared to the prior year volume was down 7 year over year but the biggest factor contributing to decline was lower log prices as average delivered sawtimber prices were down 19 driven by the u s china trade dispute as well as competition from european salvage timber page 11 shows results in key operating metrics for our new zealand timber segment adjusted ebitda in the fourth quarter 16 million was 2 million and 3 million unfavorable compared to the prior year quarter and the prior year quarter respectively fourth quarter harvest volume of 688 000 tons was 9 lower than the prior quarter and 5 higher than the prior year quarter fourth quarter volumes generally tend to be lower than third quarter volumes through the year end holiday schedule the increase over the prior year quarter was due to export vessel timing full year volume of 2 17 tons was in line with our previous guidance and was 2 higher than the prior year the fourth quarter average delivered export sawtimber price of 102 69 per ton was 8 favorable compared to the prior quarter and 11 unfavorable compared to the prior year quarter price improvement over the prior quarter was due to increased demand as radiata pine was able to gain market share relative to other species the decline versus the prior year quarter was driven by increased competition from european spruce salvage volume which has been a primary driver of the export market volatility over the past year the average domestic sawtimber price of 69 13 per ton in u s dollar terms was 8 and 13 unfavorable compared to the prior quarter and prior year quarter respectively partially due to the fall in the new zealand u s exchange rate but also due to the impact of declining export prices note that domestic pricing tends to lag behind export pricing as log supply is diverted back into the domestic markets when export prices become uncompetitive excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates domestic pricing in the dollar terms was 5 and 9 unfavorable compared to the prior quarter and the prior year quarter respectively the average domestic pulpwood price of 34 91 per ton was 9 and 3 unfavorable compared to the prior year quarter and the prior year quarter respectively as lower export prices have contributed to additional pulp log supply in the domestic market overall our new zealand timber segment delivered full year adjusted ebitda of 76 million which was 17 lower than the prior year volume was up 2 but export and domestic sawtimber pricing were down 10 and 7 respectively which drove year over year decline in our trading segment we generated adjusted ebitda of negative 300 000 which is 300 000 and 600 000 unfavorable compared to the prior quarter and the prior year quarter respectively for the full year our trading segment adjusted ebitda was breakeven which was 1 million unfavorable compared to the prior year i ll now hand it back over to mark to cover our real estate results and our outlook for the year mark mark mchugh senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks doug as highlighted on page 12 fourth quarter real estate segment sales totaled 22 million on roughly 6 900 acres sold at an average price of 3 200 per acre adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter was 18 million sales in the improved development category consisted of a 21 acre parcel in our belfast commerce park for roughly 900 000 or 42 000 per acre as a reminder the belfast commerce park is part of our richmond hill mixed use development project south of savannah georgia a new interchange on interstate 95 within the project footprint is under construction and scheduled for completion by year end which has generated an increased level of interest and activity in this area momentum at wildlight our other mixed use development project north of jacksonville florida also continues to be strong most of the major infrastructure is now in place and our next phase of 122 residential lots is scheduled to be substantially completed by the end of q1 in the unimproved development category we closed on a roughly 400 acreage 400 acre transaction in nassau county florida for 4 million or 10 000 per acre this caps off a year in which our unimproved development category had a stronger ever results with sales of 20 million and roughly 1 200 acres sold for 16 000 per acre in the rural category sales totaled 7 million on roughly 1 500 acres sold at an average price of 4 400 per acre rural sales consisted of 19 transactions across our southern footprint lastly sales in the nonstrategic and timberlands category totaled 11 million consisting of 5 000 acres at an average price of 2 100 per acre now moving on to our guidance for the year page 14 shows our financial guidance by segment for 2020 and schedule g of our earnings release provides a reconciliation of our adjusted ebitda guidance to net income attributable to rayonier and eps please note that our full year 2020 guidance does not include the impact of our anticipated acquisition of pope resources we expect to close this transaction around midyear at which point we plan to update our full year guidance to incorporate the anticipated contribution from pope for the balance of the year i d also like to note that some of the current analyst estimates for rayonier include an assumed contribution from pope in 2020 which is not consistent with how we presented our guidance herein for full year 2020 excluding the pope resources acquisition we expect total adjusted ebitda of 245 million to 270 million net income attributable to rayonier of 47 million to 57 million and eps of 0 36 to 0 44 we expect that our total timber segments adjusted ebitda will be modestly lower versus 2019 with anticipated gains in our pacific northwest timber segment more than offset by a lower expected contribution from our new zealand timber segment in our southern timber segment we expect to achieve full year harvest volumes of 6 3 million to 6 5 million tons while we expect that overall pricing will be slightly below 2019 average pricing due to geographic mix we further expect a lower contribution from our non timber income business following a record year in 2019 overall we expect that our southern timber segment will contribute 2020 adjusted ebitda of 115 million to 120 million in our pacific northwest timber segment we expect to achieve full year harvest volumes of 1 4 million to 1 5 million tons we further expect relatively stable pricing as markets have adjusted to lower log export volumes resulting from china tariffs and competition from european salvage volume overall we expect 2020 adjusted ebitda in the pacific northwest timber segment of 21 million to 25 million in our new zealand timber segment we expect harvest volumes of 2 6 million to 2 7 million tons and lower average export and domestic pricing due to challenging export market conditions resulting from competition from european salvage volume as well as the near term impacts of the coronavirus outbreak we further expect the 2020 results will be impacted by increased shipping costs due to the implementation of low sulfur fuel requirements overall we expect 2020 adjusted ebitda in the new zealand timber segment of 53 million to 59 million across all of our timber segments china log exports remain a key driver of the overall supply demand balance in 2019 we experienced significant export headwinds in the u s driven by tariffs on log exports out of both the south and pacific northwest this situation was further exacerbated by the significant increase in both log and lumber supply from storm and beetle damaged timber in europe which quickly captured significant market share in china putting pressure on export log prices out of new zealand as well more recently the coronavirus outbreak has significantly curtailed manufacturing and construction activity in the region overall we remain confident in the long term potential of the china export market and we are cautiously optimistic that the u s china phase i trade deal will lead to a gradual improvement in market conditions however we are anticipating near term challenges as the market digests european salvage volume and as the coronavirus outbreak limits log consumption in our real estate segment we continue to focus on unlocking the long term value of our hbu development and rural property portfolio and we currently have a strong pipeline of identified opportunities in 2020 we expect that our real estate segment will contribute adjusted ebitda of 80 million to 90 million although we expect the real estate activity will be heavily weighted the second half of the year and that the first quarter in particular will be relatively light as we ve communicated in the past results in this segment tend to be lumpy from period to period as they are significantly impacted by the timing of larger transactions details on other elements of our financial guidance including capex dd a noncash basis of land sold interest expense taxes and minority interests are provided on page 14 of the financial supplement and schedule g of the earnings release i ll now turn the call back to dave for closing comments david nunes president and chief executive officer thanks mark as i look back on 2019 i m proud of the accomplishments of our people in working together to deliver solid operational performance for the year and as importantly remaining focused on executing against our strategic priorities and achieving our mission of generating industry leading returns and building long term value per share when times are good and timber prices are trending upward it s much easier to generate strong financial results but when market conditions are challenging as they were in 2019 it takes much more dedication coordination and operational flexibility to manage near term performance while also maximizing long term value this past year our team worked harder smarter and in a more coordinated fashion to generate the results that we achieved for the year while at the same time deferring nearly 300 000 tons of planned harvest volume to help build long term value we enjoyed record adjusted ebitda in our southern timber segment bolstered by our strongest performance to date in non timber income while we faced considerable market headwinds in our new zealand and pacific northwest timber segments our teams were nimble in capturing opportunities and laying the groundwork for improved performance in the future further while our real estate segment results were considerably lower than the record results we achieved in 2018 we remain focused on selling properties where we can achieve meaningful premiums to timberland hold values and continue to enjoy the strongest hbu values relative to our peers at rayonier we live by the adage of never being satisfied with our portfolio and bring a relentless focus on improving our portfolio either through addition or subtraction we have a bias toward acquiring high quality timberlands which we believe provides for greater long term optionality in both good and challenging market conditions to this end we were excited to announce on january 15 that we had entered into a definitive merger agreement with pope resources under which rayonier will acquire all of the outstanding limited partnership units of pope resources for consideration consisting of a mix of equity and cash we are also offering pope resources unitholders the option of electing to receive partnership units in rayonier operating partnership lp which would allow them to defer capital gains tax from their sale of their units we take pride in being the first timber reit to employ this upreit structure and feel it has great potential to be used in other timberland transactions in the future the addition of these high quality pacific northwest timberlands will bring our ownership in the region to 504 000 acres increase our pacific northwest sustainable yield by 32 and increase our proportion of douglas fir merchantable timber inventory from 60 to 68 with a higher proportion of ground based logging we will also enjoy improved cash flow per ton and greater operational flexibility as part of this transaction we will also grow and diversify our portfolio of high value hbu properties and real estate development projects in addition pope resources owns an attractive third party private equity timber fund business with 141 000 acres under management and total assets under management of 545 million based on the most recent appraisals we look forward to blending our two organizations together following closing and believe that we can leverage the strengths of both organizations to create a stronger platform in the pacific northwest we expect that the transaction over the next five years will increase annual adjusted ebitda and cash available for distribution by approximately 38 million and 25 million respectively including estimated annual cost synergies of approximately 5 million we are currently working through regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions and are on track to close in mid 2020 staying on the theme of improving our portfolio we executed on a number of smaller bolt on transactions in 2019 across all three of our timber segments adding approximately 68 000 acres valued at 142 million overall it was one of the busiest years we ve had from a portfolio management perspective as we look to 2020 we will continue to pursue opportunities that either upgrade our portfolio through acquisitions or to redeploy land sale proceeds into other capital allocation opportunities that will enhance our long term value per share we also remain firmly committed to enhancing our disclosure and providing best in class transparency to our investors with respect to both our own portfolio and the broader timberland sector for example we are the only company among our peers that discloses our long term sustainable yield by region we also expect to continue to host investor tours and teaching sessions similar to what was done this past september where we exposed investors to other members of our team showcased portions of our southern timberland portfolio and provided greater insight into current market conditions and rayonier s differentiated strategies to create value in summary we re pleased with not only our financial results in 2019 amid a challenging market backdrop but also the continued focus on our employees on building the long term value of our company we continue to actively seek out ways to improve both our operations and our portfolio as we have stated in the past our capital allocation strategy and operational philosophy are both intended to be nimble flexible and opportunistic we are looking forward to continuing to put these principles to work toward building long term value for our unitholders and this concludes the prepared remarks and we ll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions questions answers operator the first question is coming from collin mings raymond james your line is open collin mings raymond james analyst thank you good morning dave mark and doug i want to start on the export markets first on the coronavirus you called out a couple of times in the press release and obviously recognizing the situation is very fluid can you just maybe expand on your comments there have you seen any slowdown yet attributable to that how do you anticipate that outbreak impacting demand as well as the flow of logs into china doug long senior vice president of forest resources sure collin this is doug i ll take that to begin with yes as you mentioned the situation is very fluid so personally have had changed plane flights yesterday regarding the situation so it s something that we re keeping abreast of as best we can on a daily basis and what i will say is that we ve built in our best estimate in the guidance and to what we ve thought about how it s going to impact us for the year and as you re probably aware we see extension of the chinese lunar year by to two weeks depending on the region so that s obviously going to decrease the demand for logs in those areas and probably something that s just as important is that during that lunar year the labor tends to go back home to other regions of china and so they re now in some cases under travel restrictions and can t make it back to the mills and the ports so we re definitely seeing something shaping up that could last one to two months we re not sure but something that s out there that can shape up where we re going to have decreased demand because people can t get back to the mills to work and also slowdowns at the ports because there s not opportunities to get those labors into the ports to unloading trucks so we ve been thinking about this a lot and as we think about it it s going to have an impact on how we think about our harvesting going forward and what we do and our sales process is at new zealand so some of the immediate risks we see is that log buying sales are going to be slower this year obviously with people not being able to get to the ports and due to that we re looking at basically stepping back some of our export program and minimizing the wine that we send to china over the next few months so we re looking at pulling back our harvesting where we can under our contracts and considering taking back 10 to 20 of our volume that we re sending to the market in an attempt to slow down the impacts that are going to be building up there as well as look to maximize our volume into other markets about two thirds of our export from new zealand historically goes to china another one third goes to korea taiwan india and some other countries and we re looking at those opportunities to move that volume additional volume into those markets during this time so it s very much kind of a wait and see as we go but we ve developed good plans we feel good about and working with our contractors and shipping contractors in our trading segment we re going to limit our purchases to a very select kind of core suppliers and we re going to be pricing on a weekly basis so we re looking at how we step that back to so just a very cautious approach to it as we look forward to seeing hopefully a resolution get out of the winter and things improve and we do believe though that there s going to be a buildup in volume in that market so we re working toward how we react to that and i think we have a good plan there when we think about the end of january we re looking at inventory volumes around 3 7 million to 4 million cubic meters on the ports but we think there s a potential for another one million or more of sprucing containers that will be backing up in this process so it s definitely as you mentioned a fluid situation and one that we re trying to scale back and i m not trying to exacerbate at this point in time and move that around to different markets as we can collin mings raymond james analyst that s helpful color and i just want to continue on the export markets here or maybe talking more specifically as far as the impact of the salvage wood from europe both again for i guess doug and mark and i again acknowledge this is likely a work in progress but can you maybe just update us on some of the initiatives you ve previously highlighted that were under way to maybe understand the impact of the spruce beetle epidemic and maybe how long that could impact the market just kind of what s your latest thoughts on the overhang that s created doug long senior vice president of forest resources sure collin i ll take that one again yes so as you mentioned we talked about we have a strategic objective for this year to put some boots on the ground in europe to try to understand better what s going on to date obviously early in the year we haven t done that yet but we have done some research looking at different information we get from the different departments of forestry industries of agriculture and what i would say is what we know now is that 2017 the damage was roughly 27 million cubic meters and by 2018 it had grown to 80 million cubic meters so a pretty significant increase of that about 35 million was windthrow by 2019 it stepped up to 118 million cubic meters across the area impact in europe but the good news is of that only eight million was windthrow so why is that good news it appears that the windthrow helps fuel the beetle spread and so we ve seen an estimated 77 reduction between 18 and 19 in windthrow damage from 35 million meters to eight million cubic meters so based on some of the information we ve gotten from the czech republic and austria they believe that the epidemic could be peaking in 2020 2021 and we ve seen very aggressive harvesting by the germans who are most impacted to the point where in 2018 they were cutting about 50 of damaged wood by 2019 85 of harvest was damaged wood so they ve really stepped up in 2019 and then moved on to that logging and getting that moved out so it s definitely something that s out there we re monitoring again we don t have the boots on the ground yet that s to come in the next couple of months as we look forward into this but we re hopeful that maybe the worst is behind us it s still hard to tell but there s some positive signs out there but we have seen a significant amount of spruce coming into the markets to your point and kind of the impacts on things and on a year over year basis spruce lumber or spruce log sorry coming into china in 2018 made up about 2 of china s market share by 2019 it was 14 so it s a pretty significant increase that we ve seen in a short period of time in one year and on a q4 basis it was actually 26 of the market share only behind new zealand at 36 of market share so it is amazingly increased it s amazing feat that they ve been able to get the logistics in place to move that much volume primarily by containers from europe to china we have seen some intel still to be verified that basically the q4 volumes may have reached pretty much a capacity that the supply chain can handle and that s one of the things we ll be studying as we go forward the next couple of months also to understand logistically has this supply chain come to a point where it is at full capacity or not so that s the main information i have right now and what we ve done to date david nunes president and chief executive officer collin this is dave one thing to add to that to keep in mind is this is very different from the mountain pine beetle epidemic in bc in the context that this spruce volume has a much much shorter shelf life we ve heard estimates anywhere from six months to three years and so this really speaks to the higher proportion of damaged wood that they re cutting they re trying to cut it as fast as they can while it still has value another nuance that is important to understand is that this wood has limited substitution capabilities so for example it does not peel real well and so that s an area where our new zealand market is somewhat protected and that a fairly large chunk of the radiata pine goes into plywood markets and so that s a market that is generally unaffected by the spruce volume but the spruce volume absolutely affects the general construction lumber that we compete against both in the pacific northwest as well as the u s south doug long senior vice president of forest resources yes that s right i d say new zealand benefits from the plywood furniture finger jointed board s molding type markets that the european spruce doesn t play well in in the u s south we ve seen single pine going well in the treated market for landscape and underground uses type of thing and european spruce doesn t do well for that so there s some potential opportunities there but obviously there s just a lot of volume there on the construction lumber side collin mings raymond james analyst good ok and if i were to try and again maybe tie up all of the commentary there together as it relates to the pacific northwest new zealand and just overall the export markets can we maybe switch that to the harvest plan for the year particularly again in the pacific northwest pretty substantial jump there expected and actually the upper end of the range would actually appear to be above your sustainable yield in the regions maybe can you just elaborate on your decision to increase harvest specifically in the pacific northwest given some of these headwinds and along those lines maybe just expand i know it was referenced in the prepared remarks about some of the stumpage opportunities in the pacific northwest i know it looks like this is the first quarter in about a year that you done anything other than delivered log sales in the regions maybe just talk a little bit more on the harvest plan in the pacific northwest given some of these headwinds doug long senior vice president of forest resources sure well as you can see delivered sawtimber pricing was remarkably flat for the year as the market adjusted to the reduced exports and based on the british columbia channel announcements and some other announcements in the united states we are anticipating some improvements but our market intel suggested that it would take upto six months to draw on the warehouse stocks at these mills and start to tighten the lumber supply chain therefore these reasons we chose the deferred volume from q4 of last year and run in a really measured pace through most of this year as we moved into q4 we began to see single digit price improvements across all the grades but export logs and we believed this was a signal that the impact of the bc curtailments was being realized in pacific markets so we chose to test that stumpage market again and really had quite pleasing success so on a quarter over quarter basis we realized a 15 increase between q3 and q4 and our net stumpage per ton attributable better prices as well as lower logging costs so we believe that the market has with that stable pricing for the four quarters of last year has reached kind of a stable point with respect to the lack of exports and we believe that we start to see some improvements in lumber demand in that area particularly related to the bc curtailments david nunes president and chief executive officer collin if i could add just a couple of points to that i think it s important to note that it was a very intentional move on our part to tap on the brakes during the year generally you have limited levers that you can pull but certainly timing within a year is one of them and so we saw that inventory taking a long time to kind of go through the system for the bc mills that were curtailed and that s why you saw in the first three quarters or excuse me in the q2 and q3 we harvested about 21 22 of our annual volume and really pushed that into q4 where we captured 34 of the annual volume and that was very intentional and i think it gets back to one of the things i was discussing earlier on the importance of being nimble and trying to time the markets based on the market intelligence that we have the other thing i would note to your question regarding 2020 is recognize that we have deferred some volume and so some of that higher volume that you re seeing is a representation of that deferred volume being captured in 2020 collin mings raymond james analyst ok and one last one and i ll turn it over but just sticking with this theme dave maybe can you expand on the optimism that you kind of highlighted in the press release related to phase 1 of the trail and then again recognizing it s an evolving situation any early read on if logs in the pacific northwest could benefit from this decision by china to cut some tariffs next week mark mchugh senior vice president and chief financial officer collin it s mark i ll take that and then i ll let doug add some color i mean look as we re going into the year coming off a year in which we experienced some really significant export market headwinds our expectation is that they can only get better with the phase i trade agreement it s unclear exactly what s in that agreement still i think everybody is still trying to sort through what it really means for their respective industries we re still trying to sort through what it means for logs but it s certainly better than what we had last year and i think we even had an announcement today about some china tariffs being rolled off again unclear if that impacts our industry but our expectation again like we said we re cautiously optimistic that as we move forward we will see some benefits of the phase i trade agreement and i guess our general expectation is that it can only get better from this point kind of relative to where we were coming from doug long senior vice president of forest resources yes i would just add to that a little bit i agree completely with mark one of the things we saw in this phase i deal was that there was acceptance in the rules for food and our culture trade that provides set of standards by china they accept u s quality controls for a number of agricultural products and we really see that as a positive sign one of the reasons we chose to curtail our operations from export that we mentioned a couple of calls ago was we re really seeing a lot of significant non tariff trade barriers opportunities where we re having to fumigate containers of logs up to three times and so those costs that cost is exceeding the value of the logs are being transferred so that was the primary driver it wasn t that we could operate with the tariff we understood what that meant but what we couldn t do is just in the blank check every time we send a lot of logs to china with this acceptance in the phase i trade deal that quality controls that china is going to accept u s quality controls around agriculture that s a big win to us we believe so we re hoping that will reduce the non tarrif barriers that just really caused us to pull back and just it was something you just couldn t control so we re hopeful to see that obviously with the chinese lunar new year and the coronavirus it s going to be a little while to understand if how that plays out and what happens there but that s something we re hopeful for to mark s point another important point is in the deal china has agreed to buy additional 200 billion in business services in 2020 and 2021 and within the category of manufactured goods which is actually where wood has been included they ll call us for an additional 33 billion in pursuit 20 and 45 billion in 2021 so we see that as potentially good upside too the delta between the 2017 and 2019 pulp is down about 30 purchases from china were about 1 billion and wooden logs is down about 49 or 1 6 billion so there s definitely some opportunity to pull back and be part of that increase in those agreed purchases again to mark s point we know how that s going to work we just know these are the upsides we have to work with and the reduction in non tariff barriers are things that give us some hope collin mings raymond james analyst very helpful thank you operator the next question is coming from paul quinn rbc capital markets your line is open paul quinn rbc capital markets analyst thanks very much morning guys just a question you mentioned sustainable harvest levels and just following up collin s question on the increase in the pacific northwest if you could just review what those sustainable harvest levels are for the south pacific northwest and new zealand right now david nunes president and chief executive officer yes sure paul we disclosed them in our 10 k so i believe the u s south is 5 9 to 6 3 per our last disclosure the pacific northwest is 1 3 million tons and new zealand is 2 4 to 2 6 i recognize that s last year s disclosure we have had some portfolio activity during the course of the year new zealand in particular we ve been evaluating our sustainable yield there with respect to some of the acquisitions that we ve made but that s currently our latest disclosure we ll of course be updating that when we release our 10 k in a couple of weeks paul quinn rbc capital markets analyst ok that s helpful and then just on log pricing what you re seeing in the u s south i mean this seems to be flat for almost ever i m just wondering if you re seeing any kind of regional pickup barring some kind of improvement in the phase i trade deal david nunes president and chief executive officer and i m sorry paul before i answer that i think i said 1 3 million tons in the northwest i should have said it s 1 4 million tons is our sustainable yield there doug long senior vice president of forest resources sure i ll take the question on the pricing in the south so as we ve been discussing for the past few years due to age classes for harvest has been a process of shifting more to gulf states and that s a temporary period but will happen for a few years on a q4 year over year basis this geographic shift represents a 21 volume reduction from our atlantic coastal region with the highest net stumpage prices and a corresponding 46 volume increase in our alabama and mississippi region with lower net stumpages and if you just look at terramark south prices you can see that there s a several dollars spread between sawtimber and timsaw prices between these two regions so this volume trend continues into 2020 which is the reason for our slightly down pricing outlook so it really is a lot to do at geographic mix when you think about why pricing was flat we ve seen opportunities that have trended up in certain areas and held flat in other areas but we really have a significant shift in volume between the two a lot of hard shifts has shifted to that region with lower net stumpage the actual acres are more productive in that region so on a total volume basis when you look at kind of q4 year over year the adjusted ebitda per acre is actually up even when you net out the non timber income stronger non timber income performance i m kind of got to refrain from speaking to submarket trends as many of our competitors and customers listen to these calls and we ve had some operational backlash that level specificity tough word for me to say so needless to say as we ve talked about some more specific markets there s other folks who are listening to these calls and made it tougher in some opportunities for us so we re going to shy away from that paul quinn rbc capital markets analyst ok so that shift to the gulf region when is that expected to ease back to more of the balance that we saw a number of years ago is that in the next two to five years doug long senior vice president of forest resources yes yes it is it s in the next two to five years that s in that time range i don t have the exact year but that s the time range just works for them paul quinn rbc capital markets analyst ok great and then last question i had was just on noncash costs and why that doubled in the guidance going forward here doug long senior vice president of forest resources we recognized as we re getting into more of the improved development sales those have a much higher basis component attached to them and so as we re looking at 2020 in particular we do have a higher level of improved development sales baked into our estimates for the year paul quinn rbc capital markets analyst thanks operator the next question is coming from anthony pettinari of citi your line is open randy toth citi analyst good morning guys this is actually randy toth sitting in for anthony can you just talk about your expectations for new zealand and southern pricing in 2020 it looks like just using your guidance that you expect ebitda per ton to fall 5 in the south and closer to 25 new zealand what is baked into those assumptions thank you david nunes president and chief executive officer yes i mean without getting into specifics on pricing and i think we ve given our general expectation is that the prices are going to be down on a year over year basis and that s partly a function of new zealand our second half in new zealand was considerably worse than the first half recognize there was a meaningful price decline midyear and so to a large extent i d say we re rolling forward kind of our current expectation of pricing relative to kind of where we sit today or where we ve been for the last few months but on a year over year basis because the last half of the year represents weaker pricing than the first half of the year on a year over year basis we re anticipating the prices are going to be down modestly randy toth citi analyst ok that s helpful and then just maybe switch gears as we approach the spring selling season can you just comment broadly to the extent that you can on inventories through the supply chain log decks and lumber at the dealers any color there would be helpful david nunes president and chief executive officer yes it s very very variable i guess due to wet weather across different parts of the country i don t really have a specific location i can say is up or down we have seen restricted supply in the areas where it has been wet so parts of coastal for coastal georgia and even parts of over in the southwest texas things like that but it has been very wet in the northwest also washington had a wet year in that area so we have seen some contraction but no specific market intel that things are outside of normal randy toth citi analyst ok thank you operator the next question is coming from mark wilde bmo capital markets your line is open mark wilde bmo capital markets analyst hi dave i wanted to just kind of come back and kind of close the circle on these harvest volumes in 2020 because i think there is some concern out there this morning that you re pushing up above kind of sustained yield it sounds like in the northwest what you re really doing is kind of offsetting kind of below sustained yield last year maybe you could confirm that and then put a little color on what you re doing in the south because you re also above the field there mark mchugh senior vice president and chief financial officer yes mark this is mark i ll take that yes i mean look i think across our segments the south and the pacific northwest the pickup in 2020 is largely a function of deferral that we ve taken in both 2018 and 2019 and again i think you can t run the risk of kind of deferring indefinitely and then finding yourself with a lot of mature timber and with a market that can t really sustain that supply and so i think look we re trying to be measured in terms of how we go to market how we time sales when we pull back when we ramp up recognize that after two years of harvesting kind of below expectations in both of those regions we are anticipating getting some of that back next year mark wilde bmo capital markets analyst ok and then i just wanted to pivot to new zealand for a minute can you first of all give us a sense of where kind of export log prices are out of new zealand right now versus what you put up in the fourth quarter mark mchugh senior vice president and chief financial officer yes again i d rather not comment on kind of the intraperiod pricing again like doug said i mean we tend to have customers and competitors listening on this call and so kind of getting granular about kind of where we see export pricing today or where we see it being next month is something that we generally don t like to do mark wilde bmo capital markets analyst ok and another question about new zealand it s always been a more volatile market with bigger swings in cash flows and valuation i m just curious would you be inclined to invest more in new zealand if we see a significant downturn there over the next year or two mark mchugh senior vice president and chief financial officer mark i think we re always looking for opportunities to buy through the cycle and i think look this is a very long term asset class and you have to take a long term view on trend line pricing because if you re always buying when markets are up you can find yourself overpaying and if conversely if you re never willing to buy when markets are down you can find yourself missing those opportunities and so i think in new zealand in particular i think we ve timed some of our moves there quite well if you recall back in 2015 when we increased our stake there we bought it in an implied value of 15 40 per acre we increased our stake there and implied value of 15 40 per acre and our last appraisal in new zealand was over 3 000 per acre and so you re right it has historically been a much more volatile market from a price standpoint and also from a cost standpoint you recognize that when you have a lot higher cost to market particularly with that export business that top line volatility that 10 swing in pricing has a much more pronounced effect on your bottom line than it does in say the south where if you re kind of measuring price moves off of stumpage revenue that stumpage revenue is 80 plus percent ebitda margin in terms of the pass through and so it is a more volatile market and invariably we re having to take a longer term view of pricing the other point i d make with new zealand in particular i mean we ve obviously kind of experienced a rocket ship in terms of the earnings growth there over the course of the prior three years and if you look at the result that we achieved in 2018 dave made a comment it is the third highest i m sorry 2019 it is the third highest result that we ve achieved since we started consolidating the business in 2013 and so we re coming off some extraordinarily strong markets in new zealand i certainly don t think that the entire sector segment has been revalued commensurate with 90 plus million of ebitda for example that we did in 2018 it s a lower multiple business it s a business where people are underwriting it through the cycle and so this type of price volatility while it s not helpful so we re kind of trying to manage earnings targets and whatnot it s something that you obviously have to live with in that region of the world david nunes president and chief executive officer mark this is dave what i d add to that just like we ve talked about the importance of utilizing bolt on transactions in the u s we ve done the same in new zealand we bought two small properties this year billing just under 7 000 acres we spent 36 million on those we re very happy with them we tend to be pretty deliberate in looking at the bolt ons in new zealand that can help us in sort of a regional age class fit and so that s typically is something that we are keen to and there are a number of opportunities down there but i d also say that we approach it in a pretty disciplined manner and as we saw the run up in prices on the log side over the last few years we ve frankly been a little less competitive on some of the transactions down there but we re in it for the long term and we re going to continue to look for things that make sense and we ll just have to see whether we get any of that type of pullback that you re referring to from a valuation standpoint and the impact it has on transaction markets mark wilde bmo capital markets analyst ok and then the last one for me dave just on pulp as best you can comment on this i mean just i m curious in general terms about how much hbu potential you think there is kind of with those land holdings around future sound you probably don t want to be too specific till you close the deal but it does strike me i mean you bought a lot of land with proximity to a pretty large and pretty fast growing metro market david nunes president and chief executive officer yes i think the thing i would comment on that with mark is that recognize that washington state has a very strict growth management act that precludes you from doing a lot of land conversion pope has a benefit of having a lot of land that is in smaller say 20 acre zoning areas i also give them a lot of credit for monetizing some of that through the creative use of conservation easements where they have sold underlying development rights on a lot of their land holdings which does two things it brings in cash flow from the sale of those development rights but then it also constricts supply of remaining lands that can be used for those purposes so it certainly is an attractive portfolio in that perspective but keep in mind the geography that you re dealing with and the restrictions on those underlying limits i think where we re probably more excited is just in the sense that with the fast ferry legislation that passed a few years ago you now have much more access to the seattle job market with passenger only ferries in particular going from kingston into downtown seattle and so that has improved the absorption rate on a lot of their hbu portfolio in the north kitsap part of the market and we think it will benefit the projects that pope has in both kingston and port campbell and so we see that more akin to our wildlight and richmond hill south of savannah those types of projects and so we re excited to have those come into the fold we think that we have the right skill set to both understand them and fold them into the business we do here in the south mark wilde bmo capital markets analyst yes i ve been up to both of those both very interesting situations i ll turn it over thanks dave operator the next question is coming from john babcock bank of america your line is open john babcock bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning first question i guess just as it kind of pertains to this spruce beetle i was wondering if you could comment on recognizing that exports from the south to china are pretty minimal at this point but how does the southern yellow pine compared to some of the other products that are making their way into china so like where would its niche be relative to radiata where would its niche be relative to spruce and this all assumes of course that you ultimately would even see some southern yellow pine return back to the chinese market over time doug long senior vice president of forest resources yes i ll take that one so one of the primary uses that we ve seen the niche market even in these kind of tariff markets is for pressure trading so for your like i mentioned for kind of your decking or for things that are going in the ground say post things like that so its definitely a niche southern yellow pine it s well known globally as being really really good material for absorbing the treatment chemicals and so that s one of the markets we ve seen strong obviously like river tides things like that where it is accepting treating so the salvage kill spruce and just spruce in general is not near as well regarded so that s an area that southern yellow pine has advantage over many of the other species in the world john babcock bank of america merrill lynch analyst and so is there much room for demand for that in china assuming this whole salvage timber issue lasts for an extended period doug long senior vice president of forest resources prior to the tariffs we were growing that market significantly so i would say yes and it was well received but once the tariffs went in place it got much harder we re still doing a minimum amount of volume kind of keeping the supply chain open off our atlantic coast and a lot of that we re doing now goes into that market so yes i think there s opportunity for growth if we can move past tariffs and other things david nunes president and chief executive officer john another thing to keep in mind is the southern volume flowing into china goes by container versus the break bulk that you see out of the northwest and in new zealand and so it really boils down to the efficiencies of the port and in effect the cost of that container shipping and so as we saw the tariffs be put into place it constricted the number of ports that could still compete in terms of having competitive cost structure and so that s a big impact so to the extent that the phase i deal opens that up and loosens that a little bit it will likely open up reopen up the number of ports that can competitively compete in that market john babcock bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok thank you and then second question i guess just quickly back to new zealand how much did you pay for the 7 000 acres that you acquired there david nunes president and chief executive officer 36 million so just a little over 5 000 an acre mark mchugh senior vice president and chief financial officer john recognize that the per acre values in new zealand can be all over the map it s all exclusively plantation timberland so it s heavily influenced by the age class of a specific property david nunes president and chief executive officer and yes one of those properties in particular john had a lot of merchantable timber on it so that s why you see that average for the two so high john babcock bank of america merrill lynch analyst that s helpful and then just last question just how are you assessing further opportunities to kind of grow non timber income from here recognizing it it sounds like non timber income will be down a little bit in 2020 doug long senior vice president of forest resources yes that s a great question so we have a team and they re constantly looking at those opportunities what we can do with respect to other forest products how we can capitalize on helping people kind of be carbon neutral so we ve got a lot of initiatives going on out there a lot of them are kind of in their infancy but any point in time the team is always tasked with identifying new opportunities and finding ones that are scalable so that they can go out across a lot of acres not going to get too specific about those once again because kind of until they ve been achieved you don t want to talk about and also don t want to give ideas to my competitors operator next question is coming from mark weintraub seaport your line is open mark weintraub seaport global securities analyst thank you so it looks like 2020 is going to be a relatively decent year for u s housing by most forecasts in the direction of what would historically have been considered normalized yet we re still struggling on the pricing side recognizing there s differences by submarkets but still pricing for sawtimber is pretty depressed any thoughts on what it s going to take to get that step change that we ve been waiting and hoping for for a while david nunes president and chief executive officer i mean mark keep in mind and we spent some time in our teach in in september and you can look at the materials on our web page about that but recognize that you had a fairly large build in inventory between now and the prior cycle but also that that s very differential and i think that has acted as a governor of at least step change pricing that you re referencing and that we continue to believe that you re going to have differential price elasticity across the south based on relative growth drain ratios that in some cases are under one and in some cases are well above two times and so it really is going to be a function of what part of the south you re in and that s something that we spend a lot of time looking at our own portfolio on and thinking about from a price recovery standpoint mark weintraub seaport global securities analyst thank you and how important or not so is the asia component to this equation david nunes president and chief executive officer i think i would attribute it to similar to the northwest and that all else being equal optionality is your friend and if you ve got additional markets you re going to benefit and we have a fairly high proportion of our u s south portfolio that is proximate to ports and so to the extent you have strong asian markets you re going to have more optionality to ship that product but recognize today at least in the short term we re dealing with the coronavirus and elevated inventories in china from the european spruce and to a lesser extent the australian fire salvage wood and so short term we don t see nearly the opportunities that we would think are going to be there longer term but we think the u s south as we discussed earlier from a port competitiveness standpoint the u s south or portions of it stack up very nicely and can bring in wood at a very competitive price relative to other global suppliers into that market mark mchugh senior vice president and chief financial officer and mark recognize that in the south at least i mean that market was essentially nonexistent a few years back and so the fact that it pulled back significantly last year i think we re kind of looking more as a lost opportunity as opposed to something that s going to necessarily have a depressant effect on the market and likewise if and when it comes back we think that that s a real opportunity to put some upward pressure on prices there and i think that export market is also helpful in the sense that to the extent you re getting that log out of the u s or out of that local region it s not being processed by local sawmill it s not also contributing to the chip supply in the region and so taking that fiber out of the market i think is positive for both sawtimber and pulpwood prices doug long senior vice president of forest resources yes i would just add to that kind of on scalability type thing q2 of 2018 which was the tariffs were announced in southern yellow pine in june of 2018 but that second quarter south was doing about 677 000 cubic meters of exports to china and without those tariffs it was going to increase significantly on top of that our own company we re moving from one ports to two ports to three ports to four port type things and we saw a lot of competitors doing the same thing so i think there was a lot of opportunity to scale up but obviously the tariffs came in in q4 kind of our estimate was about 230 000 cubic meters so we saw a significant 65 decrease so the fact that people can still operate is good but that 677 million was by no means the peak that was a ramping up period and like i said i know myself as well as many other brokers and other folks we re in the process of building up scale at that point in time and unfortunately those tariffs came in right when the market was starting to take off for southern yellow pine mark weintraub seaport global securities analyst and then very quickly on the pacific north i guess i m a little surprised that given the improving domestic housing situation and the perspective that asia probably didn t get worse that and that is a more tensioned market than the u s south that you weren t anticipating that there might be some more price improvement in those markets than what you seem to be forecasting for 2020 any color there mark mchugh senior vice president and chief financial officer well i think part of it is that we re trying to take a pretty measured view recognize that we kind of got burned last year by by taking what we said was a middle of the fairway approach where we had seen a big decline in prices in q3 and q4 of 2018 and within anticipating that there will be some near term resolution of the u s china trade situation that we would see a bounce back in prices that didn t materialize and so we ended up having to cut our guidance pretty significantly midyear for the pacific northwest and so we re now kind of sitting at four quarters or so of relatively stable pricing i think the fact that we re able to place volume now at prices that we think are reasonable is much an advantage in terms of how we re thinking about the market relative to where we were last year where we thought ok if we try to push this volume out to the market it s actually going to have a depressant effect on price and so we do feel as though the market is improving but look i generally hold the view that the best indicator of tomorrow s price is probably today s price and so taking a really bullish view on kind of how things are going to develop during the course of the year i think could just be setting us to have to kind of revise that expectation going forward and so look we clearly think that if we do see some real momentum from the phase i trade agreement that there s upside to these numbers but to kind of bake that in as we sit here today following four quarters of relatively flattish pricing i think is something we opted not to do david nunes president and chief executive officer yes and mark you have to also just recognize that while that european spruce volume is present in that market it s going to make it much harder to meaningfully bring pacific northwest volume into that market and that therein lies a lot of that historic tensioning that the northwest is enjoyed by virtue of that market so that s just another reason for some of our caution mark weintraub seaport global securities analyst thank you for the color operator our last question is coming from collin mings raymond james your line is open collin mings raymond james analyst thanks just a few follow ups from me as far as real estate development investments mark recognizing this will likely change once the pope transaction closes but just how should we think about your spending in 2020 as compared to last year s 7 million mark mchugh senior vice president and chief financial officer yes i generally think it would have been relatively flat on a year over year basis but recognize that we had guided initially to 8 million to 11 million in 2019 and we only ended up doing 7 million and so next year is clearly going to be higher than that probably more in the range of 12 million to 15 million i d say because there s some carryover from 2019 that didn t occur and that s going to be both in the belfast commerce area richmond hill and wildlight david nunes president and chief executive officer yes but collin the biggest jump in that year over year is really that growth in that richmond hill project which really had a fairly small component of capital this year you may recall there s a new interstate exchange being constructed as we speak and that s opening up a lot more interest in that project and so we re moving forward with some of the investments to help position ourselves for sales once that is completed later this year mark mchugh senior vice president and chief financial officer we ll of course have specific guidance on that in the 10 k but generally just for planning purposes i think it s going to be in that range that i talked about collin mings raymond james analyst ok and then i want to go quickly back to john s question just on non timber income in particular it looks like new zealand there was a sizable increase in non timber sales during 4q and again recognize that you don t want to be too specific but can you maybe just talk about the sustainability of that specifically in new zealand or was that just an unusual uptick there or should we think about that as kind of a go forward run rate mark mchugh senior vice president and chief financial officer no i definitely think 2019 was probably modestly elevated level in new zealand you recognize that our non timber income business across our three key regions is quite a bit different and then even quite a bit different within a region for example the south we had a record year in 2019 a lot of that was driven by pipeline easement income which those tend to be kind of more one off opportunities but then you also have your core kind of recreational leases that tend to be sustainable that s recurring year over year income in the pacific northwest it tends to be cedar salvage revenue which is somewhat recurring but again you can only get on and do that at certain times in new zealand is primarily carbon credit sales and there is a legacy bank so to speak of carbon credits that we have there but it s not infinite and the bank that we have i would say is not generally growing and so that will ultimately taper off over time sorry collin i was just going to mention one thing on the carbon market in new zealand is late december the government announced some key changes to their carbon trading and actually raise the kind of the fixed price option 35 for 2020 emissions and so ultimately we saw prices jump from say 24 range to 29 50 on that announcement and so back down around 27 50 so we have seen a pretty increase in carbon trading basically in just the last month and expect that that will kind of go up as time goes on as people approach kind of surrenders typing so there s some upside and the per unit pricing with respect to carbon as things move forward for us david nunes president and chief executive officer and just collin for clarification in new zealand with this carbon scheme you basically are granted credits during a rotation and then you have to give back some credits when you harvest and you end up keeping a small net that you can trade and that s outside of the volume that mark talked about which were more legacy credits that we can sell that s an ongoing source potential source of non timber income collin mings raymond james analyst got it ok very helpful there and then just one last one for me recognizing in the prepared remarks david you did touch on kind of aggregate acquisition activity for 2019 and then obviously the pope transaction kind of on tap here for 2020 but can you maybe just expand a little bit more on the acquisitions specifically completed during the fourth quarter it does look like a fairly sizable level of investment activity in the u s south david nunes president and chief executive officer sure collin for the full year we had 18 transactions 14 of those were negotiated and four were bid in q4 we had three transactions one which was just under 24 000 acres was in northeast florida we had another transaction that was in east texas for just under 7 000 acres and then we had a small transaction of about 600 acres in washington state and so we re happy with all three of those overall we spent 60 million across those covering approximately 31 000 acres across the three collin mings raymond james analyst thank you operator i will now turn it back to mr mchugh

with meryl kornfield the prognosis it s all out war in washington over the trump administration s pursuit of medicaid block grants house democrats passed a resolution yesterday with no support from republicans disapproving of the administration s new block grant rules which would allow states to significantly reshape how they run their medicaid programs rep marc veasey d tx the resolution s sponsor medicaid is one of the most important tools we have to help people struggling with opioid addiction but the trump administration is trying to cut benefits for millions of americans in midst of an epidemic protectourcare rep marc veasey repveasey february 6 2020 meanwhile seema verma administrator of the centers for medicare and medicaid services was in full on defense mode insisting in a washington post op ed that block grants don t amount to spending cuts for the health insurance program that covers 1 in 5 americans unfortunately it hasn t taken long even by washington s standards for talking points with a dubious relationship to reality to start circulating among defenders of the status quo verma wrote no the trump administration is not cutting medicaid administrator seema verma seemacms february 6 2020 remember hao is an optional demonstration for states it is not a mandatory change states will have to meet the minimum benefit requirements cannot cap or limit adult enrollment while receiving enhanced funding administrator seema verma seemacms february 6 2020 block grants are the latest chapter in an unfolding fight between the trump administration and democrats over the future of medicaid last week verma and health and human services secretary alex azar announced a program called healthy adult opportunity in which states can agree to receive a lump sum payment to finance care for adults who become eligible for medicaid when the 2010 health care law expanded it advertisement as with many health policy debates of the day the rhetoric around this issue is heated and emotional republicans have long complained that the safety net program is overly burdensome to state budgets and doesn t contain enough incentives for people to better their own lives verma says the block grants will give states more control over their own spending and allow them to more nimbly respond to the needs of their enrollees rep paul mitchell r mich apparently ripped up the house resolution per c span s jeremy art did speaker pelosi start at trend here s reppaulmitchell ripping tearing shredding a resolution on the house floor pic twitter com wd5humlpds jeremy art cspanjeremy february 6 2020 but democrats fear that setting up too many barriers and rules around the program will make it too hard for those who need it to enroll they ve been attacking the block grant rules accusing verma of giving states leeway to limit benefits and setting them up for future financial disaster by limiting the flow of federal dollars advertisement rep eddie bernice johnson d tex the law is clear president trump does not have legal authority to block grant medicaid this latest attack on the aca will only result in lower quality of care for fewer people protectourcare rep eddie bernice johnson repebj february 6 2020 annie shoup communications director for the democrat aligned group protect our care so seemacms is saying they aren t trying to cut funding to medicaid with their block grants they are but this op ed is really rich considering they re trying to wipe out medicaid expansion through the courts annie shoup shoupshouts february 6 2020 the truth of how all this would work is shockingly more nuanced than either side is charging here are a few things to keep in mind states would have to request permission because cms is doing this through what s known as a waiver process states would have to apply for block grants the same way they ve always applied for waivers to modify how they run medicaid or the obamacare marketplaces if every state participated nearly 30 million adults would be affected that includes 13 million adults newly covered under the affordable care act s medicaid expansion 10 million adults covered through other state options and nearly 5 million low income adults in states that didn t expand medicaid according to this brief by the kaiser family foundation advertisement but many states particularly those run by democrats won t pursue block grants the most likely states to jump at the opportunity would be the 10 or so that have also pursued work requirements and no states could make children pregnant women with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level parents that fit certain income thresholds and those with disabilities subject to the new requirements or funding restrictions under a block grant approach if states agree to block grants they could limit covered benefits compared to current law they could scrap services including non emergency medical transportation and certain screenings for 19 and 20 year olds but they would still have to cover 10 benefits considered essential under the aca states could also create lists of drugs that are covered by medicaid plans meaning they could exclude some drugs advertisement under current rules medicaid is required to cover all drugs approved by the food and drug administration but with a block grant states could duck those rules for every condition except medications that treat hiv opioid use and mental illness they could decide to cover just one drug for each clinical category states could also require most enrollees to pay higher cost sharing for medications and doctors visits the cost sharing could exceed the nominal amounts currently allowed although no more than 5 percent of enrollees income researchers at the kaiser family foundation summarized the block grants this way while states would be given greater flexibility compared to current law they would also face fiscal risks in accepting capped federal funding the breadth of the new flexibility could also result in limits on coverage and access to care for current enrollees they wrote ahh oof and ouch yesterday trump echoed what he declared at his state of the union speech two days previously his administration was to thank for decreased drug prices advertisement secretary azar is here and i want to thank him for this but we had for the first time in 51 years where drug prices actually came down last year first time in 51 years trump declared to a room of reporters taking a victory lap after he was acquitted of impeachment charges trump s claims which the health 202

by raúl ilargi meijer takeuchi seiho bear in snow 1940 as i said earlier today i picked up a whole slew of articles on the coronavirus through the day yesterday collected some more today and then decided not to put them in my daily debt rattle news aggregator today because it would have been too much i wasn t trying to focus on number of deaths or cases interest in that is overblown by now what i look for is news about the consequences of the coronavirus epidemic see most people look at the numbers think that they are lower than they could be and lower than in armageddon predictions so we ll all be alright and i m not saying that we won t be never have i m saying the numbers are no longer the main story the story has changed into the effects of the virus on domestic and international policies and ultimately especially on global trade and travel and those effects have only just started just like i said 2 days ago in the big lockdown initially the effects the fallout from the epidemic will appear minor companies will be able to switch things a little and do their thing but at some point that changes as i saw somebody say earlier if even just 1 of your car parts are from china and you can t get them anymore you re not going to be building a car the vast majority of carmakers use 30 chinese parts or more and then you also have many thousands of cancelled flights and cruises and what has a much bigger impact shipping of goods to but of course mostly from china chinese ports are already filing up with items like fruits but that s nothing yet if you put half your country on lockdown who s going to service incoming and outgoing ships the lunar new year is done this monday but we know chinese trains are down 75 of their passengers and plane travel is off by over 50 xi jinping allegedly told trump yesterday that we are fully confident and capable of fighting the epidemic the long term trend of china s economic development will not change but how much of that is wishful thinking how do you restart an economy that has 400 million people under lockdown and that sees all westerners leave xi must be getting anxious and nervous by now and renditioning people is not going to do the trick ideally he would convince the rest of the world that the virus is contained and no longer dangerous no doubt the lowering rates of change in new cases is step one in trying to do that xi would have had it easier if china hadn t first attempted to wipe the disease under the carpet for 1 2 months but that would be against longstanding party lines as i wrote in the party and the virus step one is always complete denial not a word and now he doesn t just have western governments to deal with anymore there s also the people both at home and abroad just wait until the first death is recorded in the us britain france or somewhere near the west will tend strongly towards a lockdown too politicians will cry it s too expensive but that won t be people s priority fear will be so three essays so far on the topic 2019 ncov the party and the virus and the big lockdown and here goes with lockdown fallout this is like a quarter of the population 80 million in us terms do the math for your own country 20 million french 25 million germans wow let s see that one 400 million people are on lockdown in china as guangzhou joins quarantine guangzhou the capital of china s southwestern guangdong province and the country s fifth largest city with nearly 15 million residents has just joined the ranks of cities imposing a mandatory lockdown on all citizens effectively trapping residents inside their homes with only limited permission to venture into the outside world to buy essential supplies the decision means 3 provinces 60 cities and 400 million people are now facing china s most strict level of lockdown as beijing struggles to contain the coronavirus outbreak as the virus has already spread to more than 2 dozen countries that s more than 400 million people forcibly locked inside their homes for 638 deaths just think about that if there was ever a reason to believe that beijing is lying about the numbers and not just because tencent accidentally leaked the real data this is it it s been said by others but i ll say it too the way china is reporting almost an identical number of new coronavirus cases each day approximately 3000 must be a reflection of its diagnosis capacity rather than the true caseload which is likely much worse mark b spiegel markbspiegel february 7 2020 read more saw this yesterday and thought that s

new york times city investigators have also been ordered to go to each home and check the temperature of every resident as well as conduct interviews with infected patients close contacts set up a 24 hour duty system during these wartime conditions there must be no deserters or they will be nailed to the pillar of historical shame forever said sun chunlan a vice premier in charge of leading the ccp s response to the outbreak the city s authorities have raced to meet these instructions by setting up makeshift mass quarantine shelters this week but concerns are growing about whether the centers which will house thousands of people in large spaces will be able to provide even basic care to patients and protect against the risk of further infection nyt read more no wedding parties locked in your home just like those cruise passengers are in their cabins the idea of switching off elevators so people don t go out is brilliant china imposes tougher lockdown measures beijing has

watch director kenneth roth said china had suppressed reports in the early days of the outbreak and clamped down on criticism of its handling of the crisis there s no place for secrecy in fighting an epidemic he said although he praised beijing for quickly sharing the dna sequence of the virus he attacked the lockdowns policy quarantines of this sort typically don t work quarantines the kind that public health officials advocate are much more targeted they re aimed at people who have been identified as having the virus he said mr roth said there were huge gaps in getting people fed housed and

australia is in the midst of one of its worst fire seasons on record with bushfires burning since september and claiming nearly 30 lives killing more than a billion animals and razing forests and farmland the size of bulgaria or 3 times belgium my homecountry almost 16 million acres of bushland equivalent to half the size of england has now been destroyed with one billion animals feared to have perished many species have now been driven closer to extinction and the devastated koala population could soon be listed as endangered and this is just the beginning or just as sir david attenborough said the moment of crisis has come one important consequence of climate change are climate refugees the un assumes 200 million displaced persons by 2050 if we don t tackle advancing climate change the international organization for migration assumes even 1 billion by 2050 the international federation of the red cross estimates there are as many as 50 million climate refugees yet no international legal framework exists for them legal debate a climate refugee does not legally exist it s a relatively new phenomenon climate refugees are often difficult to identify as a result these people do not enjoy the same rights as other conventional refugees the 1951 refugee convention is clear about who gets refugee status a refugee is someone who has been forced to flee his or her country because of persecution war or violence a refugee has a well founded fear of persecution for reasons of race religion nationality political opinion or membership in a particular social group most likely they cannot return home or are afraid to do so war and ethnic tribal and religious violence are leading causes of refugees fleeing their countries people who are forced to leave their homes due to climate change are still not included it s time to change that we need to start talking about climate refugees desperate times call for desperate measures climate change affects the weakest in 2006 the stern review an influential report on the effects of climate change on the world economy warned that one of the greatest consequences of climate change would be mass migration hundreds of millions perhaps billions of people would have to move said nicholas stern the economist behind the report in an interview with the guardian many conflicts today pose an immense risk in areas such as west africa the nile basin and central asia these risks will not disappear the reasons are the following climate change we know climate change will have an enormous impact on how we live how we move what we ll eat and so on according to nasa see video it will hit hardest in the north pole greenland northern canada and russia everything depends largely on whether we will be able to limit the temperature rise to a reasonable 1 5 degrees celsius compared to pre industrial times the higher the temperature rise the higher the risks large parts of north africa and asia will have to deal with scorching heat and drought agriculture and food production will suffer the world population is expected to grow to almost 10 billion by 2050 with 3 4 billion more mouths to feed and the growing desire of the middle class for meat and dairy in developing countries global demand for food could increase by between 59 and 98 percent this means that agriculture around the world needs to step up production and increase yields it seems that warmer sea surface temperatures tend to generate longer and more intense cyclones these will intensify and not spare often fragile infrastructure water scarcity will become a reality in different parts of the world and floods will become an even more frequent sight in our daily news these prospects combined with rising sea levels soil degradation salinification and subsidence erosion or serial depletion of fishing grounds will have massive effects on how people organize their lives the danger is that these developments are slow and therefore less visible this will cause food scarcity social inequality or worse civil wars and conflict millions will get uprooted population density world population has reached 7 5 billion where do we live europe is one of the most densely populated areas in the world as shown on the map below i live in a very densely populated area of brussels belgium but we are a rich polluting region we ll manage the population density in asia and in particular central and south east asia is particularly high to very high as are the coastal areas of the united states parts of africa countries such as nigeria benin togo and ghana are pretty crowded map 1 junuxx at en wikipedia via wikimedia commons poverty now if you take a look at countries where most people live in extreme poverty you ll see that most of these countries are located just above and below the equator almost every country in africa india parts of asia and latin america the world population is becoming richer check hans rosling convincingly arguments in factfulness and that s a good thing but that does not alter the fact that many still live in extreme poverty where we do not have an immediate structural solution countries by percent of population living below 1 25 per day in 2011 in dollars based on world bank 2018 api which ranges from 1995 to 2017 peter lonjers cc by sa 4 0 solutions so a changing climate will undoubtedly impact the situation in the southern hemisphere densely populated areas suffering from climate catastrophe in combination with extreme poverty will bear conflicts it ain t rocket science the european union s collective ecological footprint is the world s third highest behind the united states and china that s huge we are responsible for what is happening today and what does fortress europe do they tend to build higher walls they are delaying strong long term climate measures because elections are deemed more important on top of that we are dealing with right wing populist politicians who use the fate of refugees for their political agenda and populist discourse shameful so the judicial debate on climate refugees being a complex problem is an understatement there is no conclusive solution in the short run yet my country belgium and europe can take action to achieve a more sustainable solution in the long term first we need to pursue bold climate efforts to achieve the common goals of the paris climate agreement the paris agreement not mentioning the judicial status of climate refugees constitutes a missed opportunity we need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in 2050 to zero zero zero zero in addition we must find a way to reduce our current ecological footprint the problem is that our current economic system does not allow it secondly work on socially just alternatives circular economy be gone disposable culture only renewable energy sources be gone fossil fuels and a more keynesian government policy be gone liberalization or privatization can create perspectives the case for the green new deal here is a story i wrote on the gnd it s a good thing that europe with the new president of the european commission von der leyden gets it a bit but it s not enough urgency is mounting even if the commission could realize its current plans for a gnd it would still be only the first step of many that will be needed to tackle europe s twin crises of austerity and climate and environmental breakdown and if you combine this with the gratuitous pursuit of profit the sole focus on economic growth and the canonization of the market it s not very encouraging photo by ben white on unsplash last but not least international solidarity will become more and more necessary and important many refugees often flee to neighboring countries which are often just as hard in trouble more development aid is needed otherwise we will see dangerous conflictual situations with massive global implications and this is something we need to prevent at all costs
why my kids have a right to be pissed off i never thought very much about the future until 1980 when my wife and i decided to end our carefree years afternoon naps spontaneous dinners on the town long sunday mornings in bed with newspapers and classical mu sic and have a baby in fact we had two two highly energetic testosterone plagued boys now i can t stop thinking about what kind of world they ll inherit it seems likely to be more peaceful than the cold war we inherited but also more polluted as far as the economy goes they have every right to be pissed off yes america produced 17 million new jobs but in three ways we squandered the future during the 1980s first we spent more than we earned second the gap between the rich and the poor wid ened considerably third we disinvested in our ability to produce new wealth in effect we squandered our future it all started when ronald reagan bought into voodoo economics as george bush so eloquently described the ruminations of supply side economists and expected that a huge tax cut in 1981 would bring more revenue into the trea sury his estimates were off by about a trillion and a half dollars meanwhile most americans felt no richer than before but spent as if they were the so called economic recovery or expansion that commenced in 1983 was the first in a half century in which the average wages of working americans declined when compared to inflation yet credit card and other consumer install ment purchases went up from 300 bil lion total indebtedness in 1980 to more than 800 billion now not to be outdone corporate america went on its own spending spree gob bling up shares of stock at an astounding price takeovers leveraged buyouts and other wall street innovations removed more than 800 billion of equity from corporate balance sheets and pushed up debt 130 per cent during the decade to 1 9 trillion as a result about a third of the cash flow of corporate america is now dedicated to interest payments where has all the money we borrowed come from what we couldn t borrow from ourselves we ve borrowed from for eigners increasingly the japanese to whom we now owe about 600 billion this comes to about 25 in monthly in terest paid by every man woman and child in the united states you may not be aware that you re paying it but you are as a fraction of the cost of the prod ucts you buy and a portion of the taxes you pay we can expect to go on paying this and more as our foreign debts mount unless of course we choose to pay for eigners in different ways say rental payments on the places where we live or work or a portion of the profits on the work we do in fact that s precisely the choice being made when we sell foreign ers our real estate and our companies blaming foreigners for buying up america is like blaming the pawnbroker when he agrees to buy our family heirlooms there are other choices we could make of course we could simply spend less but this isn t a very attractive alter native for most americans whose family budgets are already stretched to the limit it would be more palatable if the wealthy among us bore a higher share of the bur den but here we come up against the second legacy of the 1980s the growing gap between rich and poor we now have the lowest tax rate on high incomes of any industrialized na tion if george bush has his way and contrives a reduction in capital gains tax es the effective rate will be even lower and since so much of the social security trust fund is now being used for budget deficit reduction and because most poor er working americans pay more in social security payroll taxes than they do in income taxes we also have in effect among the highest tax rates on low in comes of any modern nation add to this all the local and state sales taxes neces sary to finance social programs that the federal government has abandoned and you come up with a tax system that s extraordinarily regressive thanks to ronald reagan george bush and their friends the 1980s were a wonderful time to be rich in america the top fifth of income earners increased their inflation adjusted earnings by about 18 per cent the average incomes of wall street investment bankers and financiers alone increased a full 21 per cent during the decade the octobers of 1987 and 1989 notwithstanding the resulting conspicuous consumption is evi dent all around us luxury cars which composed 4 per cent of the car market in 1980 now account for 8 per cent of new cars sold spending on pleasure boats and travel more than doubled in the 1980s meanwhile the 1980s were a lousy time to be poor in america the bottom fifth of income earners became about 10 per cent poorer during the decade this was not only because of the regressive tendencies of the federal tax code and the cutbacks in afdc medicaid and other social programs it was also because unskilled workers in the united states in creasingly found themselves in competi tion for jobs with unskilled workers around the world who were willing to labor for a fraction of prevailing ameri can wages there is something vaguely charming about the old fashioned idea of a truly progressive income tax which would put a major damper on the spending of wealthier americans particularly now that total spending has to be restrained in 1936 in the depths of the depression franklin delano roosevelt proposed an income tax that would have claimed most of the incomes of the richest americans above a certain amount in fact fdr said that no american should earn more than 25 000 the equivalent of 200 000 today if there was ever a time to revive the quaint idea of a progressive tax it s now the other alternative is for us to be come far more productive productive enough to live in the manner to which we have become accustomed while at the same time improve the lives of the least fortunate among us and accomplish both without going into debt to foreigners how do we do this by investing in our future this brings us to the third economic legacy of the 1980s during the decade we disinvested in our future american investment in new business plants and equipment fell to a smaller share of na tional income than in any previous sus tained period since world war ii of equal if not more importance was the failure to invest in roads bridges air ports harbors research and education consider infrastructure productivity rises by about one third of 1 per cent for every per cent increase in the net stock of public capital relative to the level of pri vate sector input of capital and labor in the 1960s when american productivity was surging forward we directed almost 4 per cent of america s gross national product to building and maintaining transportation and disposal systems but in the 1980s we invested less than 3 per cent new construction alone dropped to 1 3 per cent of gnp meanwhile publicly supported nonmilitary research and de velopment dropped from about 8 per cent of gnp in the 1970s to 4 per cent in the 1980s what about education the conven tional belief is that we ve spent much more and george bush calls himself the education president but here too dis investment has been the rule in the 1960s and 1970s total spending per stu dent in primary and secondary schools grew at a brisk 4 7 per cent a year adjusted for inflation which was more than a full point above the rate of increase in gnp and even higher than the rate of increase in business investment in plant and equipment but this decade per pupil dollars grew at a rate of just 2 7 per cent in real terms behind the rate of private capital investment today the av erage american teacher receives a salary that when adjusted for inflation is just about what he or she got in 1971 and because public schools are now financed primarily from local property taxes these average figures hide some huge inequi ties schools in poor rural towns and in ner cities get the crumbs meanwhile the federal government has cut way back on guaranteed student loans for college even though college costs have surged by 26 per cent in the 1980s and family in comes haven t public help for job training is also way down dropping during the 1980s by more than half from 13 2 billion to 5 6 billion and fewer than 20 per cent of the poor kids eligible for taking part in head start a preschool program highly corre lated with later successes in school and jobs are getting into the program we just can t afford it says mr bush clearly we need to rebuild our capaci ties to be productive in the future going into debt in order to invest in our future is far less troubling than going into debt in order to consume in the 19th century america was much more indebted to for eigners as a per cent of gnp in those days to britain rather than to japan but we invested what we borrowed in canals railways schools and factories these investments made us so much more productive that we found it easy to repay the debt the cold war in case you hadn t no ticed is going into deep thaw in coming months there will be much discussion of what to do with the peace dividend the savings to be gained estimated up to 150 billion a year from cancelling huge weapons systems and closing military bases some will argue for reducing the federal budget deficit but the foregoing argument would suggest a different tack the peace dividend should be invested in our economic future so we can recreate a prosperous and a just society historians will look back on the 1980s with wonder how was it that america managed to produce and invest so little and consume so much how did we let our priorities get so out of line and the gap between rich and poor grow so wide historians will come up with many theo ries including the buoyant thoughtless ness of the man we chose to lead the nation through most of these years and the good natured silliness of his second in command but presidents can t be blamed for everything and it won t only be historians who do the asking you and i will have to take some of the rap and we ll have to answer to our kids my two boys will demand explanations the economic legacy of the 1980s debt inequality and disinvestment isn t irreversible but reversing it will take some work hence your task and mine next pop plural how 80s music bent the color line by carol cooper

rayonier com i would like to remind you that in these presentations we include forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws our earnings release

december 1 2019 dave david nunes president and chief executive officer thanks mark and good morning everyone first i ll make some high level comments before turning it back over to mark to review our consolidated financial results then we ll ask doug long our senior vice president of forest resources to comment on our u s and new zealand timber results and following the review of our timber results mark will discuss our real estate results as well as our outlook for 2020 in the fourth quarter we generated adjusted ebitda of 65 million and earnings per share of 0 12 our fourth quarter results were generally in line with our expectations and consistent with the guidance provided on our third quarter earnings call as modestly stronger than expected results in our timber segments offset weaker than expected results in our real estate segment which was driven by the timing of closings overall our team did a great job of navigating very difficult market conditions to deliver a relatively strong fourth quarter with adjusted ebitda exceeding the prior year quarter by approximately 30 for the full year we generated adjusted ebitda of 248 million and earnings per share of 0 46 full year adjusted ebitda declined 27 versus the prior year driven primarily by a much lower contribution from our real estate segment following an extraordinarily strong 2018 in our southern timber segment we achieved full year adjusted ebitda of 120 million which represents an increase of 16 over the prior year notably this result represents a record level of ebitda for our southern timber segment driven primarily by increased volume due to productivity enhancements and acquisitions as well as an all time high contribution from our non timber income business thus while our total consolidated adjusted ebitda decline relative to 2018 it was certainly encouraging to see significant year over year ebitda growth in our southern timber segment which represents the largest component of our asset value in our pacific northwest timber segment we generated full year adjusted ebitda of 17 million this result represents a significant decline from the prior year as log export volumes and log prices declined dramatically following the implementation tariffs by china in late 2018 export market headwinds were further exacerbated during 2019 by the significant increase in european spruce salvage volume flowing into the china market despite a challenging year in the pacific northwest we were pleased to finish on a high note as fourth quarter adjusted ebitda exceeded the prior three quarters combined driven by significantly improved volume and stronger net stumpage realizations in our new zealand timber segment full year adjusted ebitda declined 17 to 76 million the year over year decline in adjusted ebitda was driven primarily by decreases in both export and domestic sawtimber prices as competition from european spruce salvage volume put significant downward pressure on export log prices which in turn led to domestic price declines despite significant export market headwinds particularly in the second half of the year the new zealand timber segment still managed to generate its third highest ebitda result since we began consolidating results of this business in 2013 lastly in our real estate segment we generated full year adjusted ebitda of 60 million which is roughly half the prior year result this year over year decline was driven entirely by a significantly lower number of acres sold in 2019 following an extraordinary level of real estate volume in 2018 including two large transactions in louisiana and new zealand notably our average price per acre of over 4 300 on real estate sales in 2019 was the highest level that we have achieved since 2007 as we have often stated in the past this business is all about premium so despite the lower volume of acres sold in 2019 we feel very good about the nav accretion that we generated through our real estate segment during the year with that let me turn it back over to mark for a more detailed review of our fourth quarter financial results mark mchugh senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks dave let s start on page 5 with our financial highlights sales for the quarter totaled 179 million while operating income was 26 million and net income attributable to rayonier was 16 million or 0 12 per share fourth quarter adjusted ebitda of 65 million was above the prior year quarter primarily due to higher results in our southern timber pacific northwest timber and real estate segments partially offset by a lower contribution from our new zealand timber segment on the bottom of page 5 we provide an overview of our capital resources and liquidity at year end as well as a comparison to the prior year our cash available for distribution or cad for the year was 149 million compared to 240 million in the prior year period primarily due to lower adjusted ebitda and higher capital expenditures a reconciliation of cad to cash provided by operating activities and other gaap measures is provided on page 8 of the financial supplement we closed the year with 69 million of cash and roughly 1 1 billion of debt debt increased modestly in the fourth quarter as we closed on acquisitions totaling 60 million during the period our net debt of 988 million represented 19 of our enterprise value based on our closing stock price at year end i ll now turn the call over to doug to provide a more detailed review of our timber results doug long senior vice president of forest resources thanks mark good morning let s start on page 9 with our southern timber segment adjusted ebitda in the fourth quarter of 28 million was 6 million and 7 million favorable compared to the prior quarter and the prior year quarter respectively fourth quarter harvest volume of approximately 1 6 million tons was 23 and 19 higher compared to the prior quarter and the prior year quarter respectively although full year harvest volumes ended up modestly below our initial guidance for the year overall production was 350 000 tons higher than the prior year we expect to recapture some of the volume deferred in 2019 and 2020 which is reflected in our segment guidance the average pine pulpwood stumpage price of 14 82 per ton was 5 unfavorable compared to the prior quarter and flat compared to the prior year quarter the reduction in price compared to the prior quarter was due to an increase in sales volume in our weakest pulpwood market where we tend to see increased selectivity in the fourth quarter the average pine sawtimber stumpage price of 23 25 per ton was flat compared to the prior quarter and 3 unfavorable compared to the prior year quarter the decline in price compared to the prior year quarter was driven primarily by geographic mix our non timber income team ended the year with another strong quarter delivering revenue of 8 million which was flat compared to the prior quarter and 51 higher than the prior year quarter full year non timber revenue of 35 million was 34 higher than the prior year and reflects a record contribution from our non timber income business overall our southern timber segment delivered full year adjusted ebitda of 120 million which was 16 higher than the prior year on the back of a 6 increase in volume a slight increase in our weighted average net stumpage prices and an additional 9 million of non timber revenue now moving to pacific northwest timber segment on page 10 adjusted ebitda of 9 million was 6 million and 7 million favorable compared to the prior quarter and the prior year quarter respectively fourth quarter harvest volume of 417 000 tons was 60 and 72 higher compared to the prior quarter and the prior year quarter respectively full year harvest volume of 1 2 million tons was in line with our previous guidance as we took advantage of improved demand and favorable stumpage opportunities in the fourth quarter the average delivered sawtimber price of 78 51 per ton was flat compared to the prior quarter and 3 unfavorable compared to the prior year quarter prices remain flat in the course of the year as a result of the continued tariffs on log exports in china and competition from european salvage timber however due to favorable pricing on stumpage sales in the fourth quarter coupled with lower average cut and haul rates we actually realized a 12 increase in average net stumpage prices versus the prior year quarter the average delivered pulpwood price of 39 24 was 4 favorable compared to the prior quarter but 17 unfavorable compared to the prior year quarter we continue to see excess pulpwood and chips play on the market due to reduced exports although we believe that the decline in demand for export chips and the gilman sawmill residual chips has generally stabilized the favorable variance in pulpwood prices compared to the prior quarter was due to geographic mix overall our pacific northwest timber segment delivered full year adjusted ebitda of 17 million which was 24 million or 59 unfavorable compared to the prior year volume was down 7 year over year but the biggest factor contributing to decline was lower log prices as average delivered sawtimber prices were down 19 driven by the u s china trade dispute as well as competition from european salvage timber page 11 shows results in key operating metrics for our new zealand timber segment adjusted ebitda in the fourth quarter 16 million was 2 million and 3 million unfavorable compared to the prior year quarter and the prior year quarter respectively fourth quarter harvest volume of 688 000 tons was 9 lower than the prior quarter and 5 higher than the prior year quarter fourth quarter volumes generally tend to be lower than third quarter volumes through the year end holiday schedule the increase over the prior year quarter was due to export vessel timing full year volume of 2 17 tons was in line with our previous guidance and was 2 higher than the prior year the fourth quarter average delivered export sawtimber price of 102 69 per ton was 8 favorable compared to the prior quarter and 11 unfavorable compared to the prior year quarter price improvement over the prior quarter was due to increased demand as radiata pine was able to gain market share relative to other species the decline versus the prior year quarter was driven by increased competition from european spruce salvage volume which has been a primary driver of the export market volatility over the past year the average domestic sawtimber price of 69 13 per ton in u s dollar terms was 8 and 13 unfavorable compared to the prior quarter and prior year quarter respectively partially due to the fall in the new zealand u s exchange rate but also due to the impact of declining export prices note that domestic pricing tends to lag behind export pricing as log supply is diverted back into the domestic markets when export prices become uncompetitive excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates domestic pricing in the dollar terms was 5 and 9 unfavorable compared to the prior quarter and the prior year quarter respectively the average domestic pulpwood price of 34 91 per ton was 9 and 3 unfavorable compared to the prior year quarter and the prior year quarter respectively as lower export prices have contributed to additional pulp log supply in the domestic market overall our new zealand timber segment delivered full year adjusted ebitda of 76 million which was 17 lower than the prior year volume was up 2 but export and domestic sawtimber pricing were down 10 and 7 respectively which drove year over year decline in our trading segment we generated adjusted ebitda of negative 300 000 which is 300 000 and 600 000 unfavorable compared to the prior quarter and the prior year quarter respectively for the full year our trading segment adjusted ebitda was breakeven which was 1 million unfavorable compared to the prior year i ll now hand it back over to mark to cover our real estate results and our outlook for the year mark mark mchugh senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks doug as highlighted on page 12 fourth quarter real estate segment sales totaled 22 million on roughly 6 900 acres sold at an average price of 3 200 per acre adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter was 18 million sales in the improved development category consisted of a 21 acre parcel in our belfast commerce park for roughly 900 000 or 42 000 per acre as a reminder the belfast commerce park is part of our richmond hill mixed use development project south of savannah georgia a new interchange on interstate 95 within the project footprint is under construction and scheduled for completion by year end which has generated an increased level of interest and activity in this area momentum at wildlight our other mixed use development project north of jacksonville florida also continues to be strong most of the major infrastructure is now in place and our next phase of 122 residential lots is scheduled to be substantially completed by the end of q1 in the unimproved development category we closed on a roughly 400 acreage 400 acre transaction in nassau county florida for 4 million or 10 000 per acre this caps off a year in which our unimproved development category had a stronger ever results with sales of 20 million and roughly 1 200 acres sold for 16 000 per acre in the rural category sales totaled 7 million on roughly 1 500 acres sold at an average price of 4 400 per acre rural sales consisted of 19 transactions across our southern footprint lastly sales in the nonstrategic and timberlands category totaled 11 million consisting of 5 000 acres at an average price of 2 100 per acre now moving on to our guidance for the year page 14 shows our financial guidance by segment for 2020 and schedule g of our earnings release provides a reconciliation of our adjusted ebitda guidance to net income attributable to rayonier and eps please note that our full year 2020 guidance does not include the impact of our anticipated acquisition of pope resources we expect to close this transaction around midyear at which point we plan to update our full year guidance to incorporate the anticipated contribution from pope for the balance of the year i d also like to note that some of the current analyst estimates for rayonier include an assumed contribution from pope in 2020 which is not consistent with how we presented our guidance herein for full year 2020 excluding the pope resources acquisition we expect total adjusted ebitda of 245 million to 270 million net income attributable to rayonier of 47 million to 57 million and eps of 0 36 to 0 44 we expect that our total timber segments adjusted ebitda will be modestly lower versus 2019 with anticipated gains in our pacific northwest timber segment more than offset by a lower expected contribution from our new zealand timber segment in our southern timber segment we expect to achieve full year harvest volumes of 6 3 million to 6 5 million tons while we expect that overall pricing will be slightly below 2019 average pricing due to geographic mix we further expect a lower contribution from our non timber income business following a record year in 2019 overall we expect that our southern timber segment will contribute 2020 adjusted ebitda of 115 million to 120 million in our pacific northwest timber segment we expect to achieve full year harvest volumes of 1 4 million to 1 5 million tons we further expect relatively stable pricing as markets have adjusted to lower log export volumes resulting from china tariffs and competition from european salvage volume overall we expect 2020 adjusted ebitda in the pacific northwest timber segment of 21 million to 25 million in our new zealand timber segment we expect harvest volumes of 2 6 million to 2 7 million tons and lower average export and domestic pricing due to challenging export market conditions resulting from competition from european salvage volume as well as the near term impacts of the coronavirus outbreak we further expect the 2020 results will be impacted by increased shipping costs due to the implementation of low sulfur fuel requirements overall we expect 2020 adjusted ebitda in the new zealand timber segment of 53 million to 59 million across all of our timber segments china log exports remain a key driver of the overall supply demand balance in 2019 we experienced significant export headwinds in the u s driven by tariffs on log exports out of both the south and pacific northwest this situation was further exacerbated by the significant increase in both log and lumber supply from storm and beetle damaged timber in europe which quickly captured significant market share in china putting pressure on export log prices out of new zealand as well more recently the coronavirus outbreak has significantly curtailed manufacturing and construction activity in the region overall we remain confident in the long term potential of the china export market and we are cautiously optimistic that the u s china phase i trade deal will lead to a gradual improvement in market conditions however we are anticipating near term challenges as the market digests european salvage volume and as the coronavirus outbreak limits log consumption in our real estate segment we continue to focus on unlocking the long term value of our hbu development and rural property portfolio and we currently have a strong pipeline of identified opportunities in 2020 we expect that our real estate segment will contribute adjusted ebitda of 80 million to 90 million although we expect the real estate activity will be heavily weighted the second half of the year and that the first quarter in particular will be relatively light as we ve communicated in the past results in this segment tend to be lumpy from period to period as they are significantly impacted by the timing of larger transactions details on other elements of our financial guidance including capex dd a noncash basis of land sold interest expense taxes and minority interests are provided on page 14 of the financial supplement and schedule g of the earnings release i ll now turn the call back to dave for closing comments david nunes president and chief executive officer thanks mark as i look back on 2019 i m proud of the accomplishments of our people in working together to deliver solid operational performance for the year and as importantly remaining focused on executing against our strategic priorities and achieving our mission of generating industry leading returns and building long term value per share when times are good and timber prices are trending upward it s much easier to generate strong financial results but when market conditions are challenging as they were in 2019 it takes much more dedication coordination and operational flexibility to manage near term performance while also maximizing long term value this past year our team worked harder smarter and in a more coordinated fashion to generate the results that we achieved for the year while at the same time deferring nearly 300 000 tons of planned harvest volume to help build long term value we enjoyed record adjusted ebitda in our southern timber segment bolstered by our strongest performance to date in non timber income while we faced considerable market headwinds in our new zealand and pacific northwest timber segments our teams were nimble in capturing opportunities and laying the groundwork for improved performance in the future further while our real estate segment results were considerably lower than the record results we achieved in 2018 we remain focused on selling properties where we can achieve meaningful premiums to timberland hold values and continue to enjoy the strongest hbu values relative to our peers at rayonier we live by the adage of never being satisfied with our portfolio and bring a relentless focus on improving our portfolio either through addition or subtraction we have a bias toward acquiring high quality timberlands which we believe provides for greater long term optionality in both good and challenging market conditions to this end we were excited to announce on january 15 that we had entered into a definitive merger agreement with pope resources under which rayonier will acquire all of the outstanding limited partnership units of pope resources for consideration consisting of a mix of equity and cash we are also offering pope resources unitholders the option of electing to receive partnership units in rayonier operating partnership lp which would allow them to defer capital gains tax from their sale of their units we take pride in being the first timber reit to employ this upreit structure and feel it has great potential to be used in other timberland transactions in the future the addition of these high quality pacific northwest timberlands will bring our ownership in the region to 504 000 acres increase our pacific northwest sustainable yield by 32 and increase our proportion of douglas fir merchantable timber inventory from 60 to 68 with a higher proportion of ground based logging we will also enjoy improved cash flow per ton and greater operational flexibility as part of this transaction we will also grow and diversify our portfolio of high value hbu properties and real estate development projects in addition pope resources owns an attractive third party private equity timber fund business with 141 000 acres under management and total assets under management of 545 million based on the most recent appraisals we look forward to blending our two organizations together following closing and believe that we can leverage the strengths of both organizations to create a stronger platform in the pacific northwest we expect that the transaction over the next five years will increase annual adjusted ebitda and cash available for distribution by approximately 38 million and 25 million respectively including estimated annual cost synergies of approximately 5 million we are currently working through regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions and are on track to close in mid 2020 staying on the theme of improving our portfolio we executed on a number of smaller bolt on transactions in 2019 across all three of our timber segments adding approximately 68 000 acres valued at 142 million overall it was one of the busiest years we ve had from a portfolio management perspective as we look to 2020 we will continue to pursue opportunities that either upgrade our portfolio through acquisitions or to redeploy land sale proceeds into other capital allocation opportunities that will enhance our long term value per share we also remain firmly committed to enhancing our disclosure and providing best in class transparency to our investors with respect to both our own portfolio and the broader timberland sector for example we are the only company among our peers that discloses our long term sustainable yield by region we also expect to continue to host investor tours and teaching sessions similar to what was done this past september where we exposed investors to other members of our team showcased portions of our southern timberland portfolio and provided greater insight into current market conditions and rayonier s differentiated strategies to create value in summary we re pleased with not only our financial results in 2019 amid a challenging market backdrop but also the continued focus on our employees on building the long term value of our company we continue to actively seek out ways to improve both our operations and our portfolio as we have stated in the past our capital allocation strategy and operational philosophy are both intended to be nimble flexible and opportunistic we are looking forward to continuing to put these principles to work toward building long term value for our unitholders and this concludes the prepared remarks and we ll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions questions answers operator the first question is coming from collin mings raymond james your line is open collin mings raymond james analyst thank you good morning dave mark and doug i want to start on the export markets first on the coronavirus you called out a couple of times in the press release and obviously recognizing the situation is very fluid can you just maybe expand on your comments there have you seen any slowdown yet attributable to that how do you anticipate that outbreak impacting demand as well as the flow of logs into china doug long senior vice president of forest resources sure collin this is doug i ll take that to begin with yes as you mentioned the situation is very fluid so personally have had changed plane flights yesterday regarding the situation so it s something that we re keeping abreast of as best we can on a daily basis and what i will say is that we ve built in our best estimate in the guidance and to what we ve thought about how it s going to impact us for the year and as you re probably aware we see extension of the chinese lunar year by to two weeks depending on the region so that s obviously going to decrease the demand for logs in those areas and probably something that s just as important is that during that lunar year the labor tends to go back home to other regions of china and so they re now in some cases under travel restrictions and can t make it back to the mills and the ports so we re definitely seeing something shaping up that could last one to two months we re not sure but something that s out there that can shape up where we re going to have decreased demand because people can t get back to the mills to work and also slowdowns at the ports because there s not opportunities to get those labors into the ports to unloading trucks so we ve been thinking about this a lot and as we think about it it s going to have an impact on how we think about our harvesting going forward and what we do and our sales process is at new zealand so some of the immediate risks we see is that log buying sales are going to be slower this year obviously with people not being able to get to the ports and due to that we re looking at basically stepping back some of our export program and minimizing the wine that we send to china over the next few months so we re looking at pulling back our harvesting where we can under our contracts and considering taking back 10 to 20 of our volume that we re sending to the market in an attempt to slow down the impacts that are going to be building up there as well as look to maximize our volume into other markets about two thirds of our export from new zealand historically goes to china another one third goes to korea taiwan india and some other countries and we re looking at those opportunities to move that volume additional volume into those markets during this time so it s very much kind of a wait and see as we go but we ve developed good plans we feel good about and working with our contractors and shipping contractors in our trading segment we re going to limit our purchases to a very select kind of core suppliers and we re going to be pricing on a weekly basis so we re looking at how we step that back to so just a very cautious approach to it as we look forward to seeing hopefully a resolution get out of the winter and things improve and we do believe though that there s going to be a buildup in volume in that market so we re working toward how we react to that and i think we have a good plan there when we think about the end of january we re looking at inventory volumes around 3 7 million to 4 million cubic meters on the ports but we think there s a potential for another one million or more of sprucing containers that will be backing up in this process so it s definitely as you mentioned a fluid situation and one that we re trying to scale back and i m not trying to exacerbate at this point in time and move that around to different markets as we can collin mings raymond james analyst that s helpful color and i just want to continue on the export markets here or maybe talking more specifically as far as the impact of the salvage wood from europe both again for i guess doug and mark and i again acknowledge this is likely a work in progress but can you maybe just update us on some of the initiatives you ve previously highlighted that were under way to maybe understand the impact of the spruce beetle epidemic and maybe how long that could impact the market just kind of what s your latest thoughts on the overhang that s created doug long senior vice president of forest resources sure collin i ll take that one again yes so as you mentioned we talked about we have a strategic objective for this year to put some boots on the ground in europe to try to understand better what s going on to date obviously early in the year we haven t done that yet but we have done some research looking at different information we get from the different departments of forestry industries of agriculture and what i would say is what we know now is that 2017 the damage was roughly 27 million cubic meters and by 2018 it had grown to 80 million cubic meters so a pretty significant increase of that about 35 million was windthrow by 2019 it stepped up to 118 million cubic meters across the area impact in europe but the good news is of that only eight million was windthrow so why is that good news it appears that the windthrow helps fuel the beetle spread and so we ve seen an estimated 77 reduction between 18 and 19 in windthrow damage from 35 million meters to eight million cubic meters so based on some of the information we ve gotten from the czech republic and austria they believe that the epidemic could be peaking in 2020 2021 and we ve seen very aggressive harvesting by the germans who are most impacted to the point where in 2018 they were cutting about 50 of damaged wood by 2019 85 of harvest was damaged wood so they ve really stepped up in 2019 and then moved on to that logging and getting that moved out so it s definitely something that s out there we re monitoring again we don t have the boots on the ground yet that s to come in the next couple of months as we look forward into this but we re hopeful that maybe the worst is behind us it s still hard to tell but there s some positive signs out there but we have seen a significant amount of spruce coming into the markets to your point and kind of the impacts on things and on a year over year basis spruce lumber or spruce log sorry coming into china in 2018 made up about 2 of china s market share by 2019 it was 14 so it s a pretty significant increase that we ve seen in a short period of time in one year and on a q4 basis it was actually 26 of the market share only behind new zealand at 36 of market share so it is amazingly increased it s amazing feat that they ve been able to get the logistics in place to move that much volume primarily by containers from europe to china we have seen some intel still to be verified that basically the q4 volumes may have reached pretty much a capacity that the supply chain can handle and that s one of the things we ll be studying as we go forward the next couple of months also to understand logistically has this supply chain come to a point where it is at full capacity or not so that s the main information i have right now and what we ve done to date david nunes president and chief executive officer collin this is dave one thing to add to that to keep in mind is this is very different from the mountain pine beetle epidemic in bc in the context that this spruce volume has a much much shorter shelf life we ve heard estimates anywhere from six months to three years and so this really speaks to the higher proportion of damaged wood that they re cutting they re trying to cut it as fast as they can while it still has value another nuance that is important to understand is that this wood has limited substitution capabilities so for example it does not peel real well and so that s an area where our new zealand market is somewhat protected and that a fairly large chunk of the radiata pine goes into plywood markets and so that s a market that is generally unaffected by the spruce volume but the spruce volume absolutely affects the general construction lumber that we compete against both in the pacific northwest as well as the u s south doug long senior vice president of forest resources yes that s right i d say new zealand benefits from the plywood furniture finger jointed board s molding type markets that the european spruce doesn t play well in in the u s south we ve seen single pine going well in the treated market for landscape and underground uses type of thing and european spruce doesn t do well for that so there s some potential opportunities there but obviously there s just a lot of volume there on the construction lumber side collin mings raymond james analyst good ok and if i were to try and again maybe tie up all of the commentary there together as it relates to the pacific northwest new zealand and just overall the export markets can we maybe switch that to the harvest plan for the year particularly again in the pacific northwest pretty substantial jump there expected and actually the upper end of the range would actually appear to be above your sustainable yield in the regions maybe can you just elaborate on your decision to increase harvest specifically in the pacific northwest given some of these headwinds and along those lines maybe just expand i know it was referenced in the prepared remarks about some of the stumpage opportunities in the pacific northwest i know it looks like this is the first quarter in about a year that you done anything other than delivered log sales in the regions maybe just talk a little bit more on the harvest plan in the pacific northwest given some of these headwinds doug long senior vice president of forest resources sure well as you can see delivered sawtimber pricing was remarkably flat for the year as the market adjusted to the reduced exports and based on the british columbia channel announcements and some other announcements in the united states we are anticipating some improvements but our market intel suggested that it would take upto six months to draw on the warehouse stocks at these mills and start to tighten the lumber supply chain therefore these reasons we chose the deferred volume from q4 of last year and run in a really measured pace through most of this year as we moved into q4 we began to see single digit price improvements across all the grades but export logs and we believed this was a signal that the impact of the bc curtailments was being realized in pacific markets so we chose to test that stumpage market again and really had quite pleasing success so on a quarter over quarter basis we realized a 15 increase between q3 and q4 and our net stumpage per ton attributable better prices as well as lower logging costs so we believe that the market has with that stable pricing for the four quarters of last year has reached kind of a stable point with respect to the lack of exports and we believe that we start to see some improvements in lumber demand in that area particularly related to the bc curtailments david nunes president and chief executive officer collin if i could add just a couple of points to that i think it s important to note that it was a very intentional move on our part to tap on the brakes during the year generally you have limited levers that you can pull but certainly timing within a year is one of them and so we saw that inventory taking a long time to kind of go through the system for the bc mills that were curtailed and that s why you saw in the first three quarters or excuse me in the q2 and q3 we harvested about 21 22 of our annual volume and really pushed that into q4 where we captured 34 of the annual volume and that was very intentional and i think it gets back to one of the things i was discussing earlier on the importance of being nimble and trying to time the markets based on the market intelligence that we have the other thing i would note to your question regarding 2020 is recognize that we have deferred some volume and so some of that higher volume that you re seeing is a representation of that deferred volume being captured in 2020 collin mings raymond james analyst ok and one last one and i ll turn it over but just sticking with this theme dave maybe can you expand on the optimism that you kind of highlighted in the press release related to phase 1 of the trail and then again recognizing it s an evolving situation any early read on if logs in the pacific northwest could benefit from this decision by china to cut some tariffs next week mark mchugh senior vice president and chief financial officer collin it s mark i ll take that and then i ll let doug add some color i mean look as we re going into the year coming off a year in which we experienced some really significant export market headwinds our expectation is that they can only get better with the phase i trade agreement it s unclear exactly what s in that agreement still i think everybody is still trying to sort through what it really means for their respective industries we re still trying to sort through what it means for logs but it s certainly better than what we had last year and i think we even had an announcement today about some china tariffs being rolled off again unclear if that impacts our industry but our expectation again like we said we re cautiously optimistic that as we move forward we will see some benefits of the phase i trade agreement and i guess our general expectation is that it can only get better from this point kind of relative to where we were coming from doug long senior vice president of forest resources yes i would just add to that a little bit i agree completely with mark one of the things we saw in this phase i deal was that there was acceptance in the rules for food and our culture trade that provides set of standards by china they accept u s quality controls for a number of agricultural products and we really see that as a positive sign one of the reasons we chose to curtail our operations from export that we mentioned a couple of calls ago was we re really seeing a lot of significant non tariff trade barriers opportunities where we re having to fumigate containers of logs up to three times and so those costs that cost is exceeding the value of the logs are being transferred so that was the primary driver it wasn t that we could operate with the tariff we understood what that meant but what we couldn t do is just in the blank check every time we send a lot of logs to china with this acceptance in the phase i trade deal that quality controls that china is going to accept u s quality controls around agriculture that s a big win to us we believe so we re hoping that will reduce the non tarrif barriers that just really caused us to pull back and just it was something you just couldn t control so we re hopeful to see that obviously with the chinese lunar new year and the coronavirus it s going to be a little while to understand if how that plays out and what happens there but that s something we re hopeful for to mark s point another important point is in the deal china has agreed to buy additional 200 billion in business services in 2020 and 2021 and within the category of manufactured goods which is actually where wood has been included they ll call us for an additional 33 billion in pursuit 20 and 45 billion in 2021 so we see that as potentially good upside too the delta between the 2017 and 2019 pulp is down about 30 purchases from china were about 1 billion and wooden logs is down about 49 or 1 6 billion so there s definitely some opportunity to pull back and be part of that increase in those agreed purchases again to mark s point we know how that s going to work we just know these are the upsides we have to work with and the reduction in non tariff barriers are things that give us some hope collin mings raymond james analyst very helpful thank you operator the next question is coming from paul quinn rbc capital markets your line is open paul quinn rbc capital markets analyst thanks very much morning guys just a question you mentioned sustainable harvest levels and just following up collin s question on the increase in the pacific northwest if you could just review what those sustainable harvest levels are for the south pacific northwest and new zealand right now david nunes president and chief executive officer yes sure paul we disclosed them in our 10 k so i believe the u s south is 5 9 to 6 3 per our last disclosure the pacific northwest is 1 3 million tons and new zealand is 2 4 to 2 6 i recognize that s last year s disclosure we have had some portfolio activity during the course of the year new zealand in particular we ve been evaluating our sustainable yield there with respect to some of the acquisitions that we ve made but that s currently our latest disclosure we ll of course be updating that when we release our 10 k in a couple of weeks paul quinn rbc capital markets analyst ok that s helpful and then just on log pricing what you re seeing in the u s south i mean this seems to be flat for almost ever i m just wondering if you re seeing any kind of regional pickup barring some kind of improvement in the phase i trade deal david nunes president and chief executive officer and i m sorry paul before i answer that i think i said 1 3 million tons in the northwest i should have said it s 1 4 million tons is our sustainable yield there doug long senior vice president of forest resources sure i ll take the question on the pricing in the south so as we ve been discussing for the past few years due to age classes for harvest has been a process of shifting more to gulf states and that s a temporary period but will happen for a few years on a q4 year over year basis this geographic shift represents a 21 volume reduction from our atlantic coastal region with the highest net stumpage prices and a corresponding 46 volume increase in our alabama and mississippi region with lower net stumpages and if you just look at terramark south prices you can see that there s a several dollars spread between sawtimber and timsaw prices between these two regions so this volume trend continues into 2020 which is the reason for our slightly down pricing outlook so it really is a lot to do at geographic mix when you think about why pricing was flat we ve seen opportunities that have trended up in certain areas and held flat in other areas but we really have a significant shift in volume between the two a lot of hard shifts has shifted to that region with lower net stumpage the actual acres are more productive in that region so on a total volume basis when you look at kind of q4 year over year the adjusted ebitda per acre is actually up even when you net out the non timber income stronger non timber income performance i m kind of got to refrain from speaking to submarket trends as many of our competitors and customers listen to these calls and we ve had some operational backlash that level specificity tough word for me to say so needless to say as we ve talked about some more specific markets there s other folks who are listening to these calls and made it tougher in some opportunities for us so we re going to shy away from that paul quinn rbc capital markets analyst ok so that shift to the gulf region when is that expected to ease back to more of the balance that we saw a number of years ago is that in the next two to five years doug long senior vice president of forest resources yes yes it is it s in the next two to five years that s in that time range i don t have the exact year but that s the time range just works for them paul quinn rbc capital markets analyst ok great and then last question i had was just on noncash costs and why that doubled in the guidance going forward here doug long senior vice president of forest resources we recognized as we re getting into more of the improved development sales those have a much higher basis component attached to them and so as we re looking at 2020 in particular we do have a higher level of improved development sales baked into our estimates for the year paul quinn rbc capital markets analyst thanks operator the next question is coming from anthony pettinari of citi your line is open randy toth citi analyst good morning guys this is actually randy toth sitting in for anthony can you just talk about your expectations for new zealand and southern pricing in 2020 it looks like just using your guidance that you expect ebitda per ton to fall 5 in the south and closer to 25 new zealand what is baked into those assumptions thank you david nunes president and chief executive officer yes i mean without getting into specifics on pricing and i think we ve given our general expectation is that the prices are going to be down on a year over year basis and that s partly a function of new zealand our second half in new zealand was considerably worse than the first half recognize there was a meaningful price decline midyear and so to a large extent i d say we re rolling forward kind of our current expectation of pricing relative to kind of where we sit today or where we ve been for the last few months but on a year over year basis because the last half of the year represents weaker pricing than the first half of the year on a year over year basis we re anticipating the prices are going to be down modestly randy toth citi analyst ok that s helpful and then just maybe switch gears as we approach the spring selling season can you just comment broadly to the extent that you can on inventories through the supply chain log decks and lumber at the dealers any color there would be helpful david nunes president and chief executive officer yes it s very very variable i guess due to wet weather across different parts of the country i don t really have a specific location i can say is up or down we have seen restricted supply in the areas where it has been wet so parts of coastal for coastal georgia and even parts of over in the southwest texas things like that but it has been very wet in the northwest also washington had a wet year in that area so we have seen some contraction but no specific market intel that things are outside of normal randy toth citi analyst ok thank you operator the next question is coming from mark wilde bmo capital markets your line is open mark wilde bmo capital markets analyst hi dave i wanted to just kind of come back and kind of close the circle on these harvest volumes in 2020 because i think there is some concern out there this morning that you re pushing up above kind of sustained yield it sounds like in the northwest what you re really doing is kind of offsetting kind of below sustained yield last year maybe you could confirm that and then put a little color on what you re doing in the south because you re also above the field there mark mchugh senior vice president and chief financial officer yes mark this is mark i ll take that yes i mean look i think across our segments the south and the pacific northwest the pickup in 2020 is largely a function of deferral that we ve taken in both 2018 and 2019 and again i think you can t run the risk of kind of deferring indefinitely and then finding yourself with a lot of mature timber and with a market that can t really sustain that supply and so i think look we re trying to be measured in terms of how we go to market how we time sales when we pull back when we ramp up recognize that after two years of harvesting kind of below expectations in both of those regions we are anticipating getting some of that back next year mark wilde bmo capital markets analyst ok and then i just wanted to pivot to new zealand for a minute can you first of all give us a sense of where kind of export log prices are out of new zealand right now versus what you put up in the fourth quarter mark mchugh senior vice president and chief financial officer yes again i d rather not comment on kind of the intraperiod pricing again like doug said i mean we tend to have customers and competitors listening on this call and so kind of getting granular about kind of where we see export pricing today or where we see it being next month is something that we generally don t like to do mark wilde bmo capital markets analyst ok and another question about new zealand it s always been a more volatile market with bigger swings in cash flows and valuation i m just curious would you be inclined to invest more in new zealand if we see a significant downturn there over the next year or two mark mchugh senior vice president and chief financial officer mark i think we re always looking for opportunities to buy through the cycle and i think look this is a very long term asset class and you have to take a long term view on trend line pricing because if you re always buying when markets are up you can find yourself overpaying and if conversely if you re never willing to buy when markets are down you can find yourself missing those opportunities and so i think in new zealand in particular i think we ve timed some of our moves there quite well if you recall back in 2015 when we increased our stake there we bought it in an implied value of 15 40 per acre we increased our stake there and implied value of 15 40 per acre and our last appraisal in new zealand was over 3 000 per acre and so you re right it has historically been a much more volatile market from a price standpoint and also from a cost standpoint you recognize that when you have a lot higher cost to market particularly with that export business that top line volatility that 10 swing in pricing has a much more pronounced effect on your bottom line than it does in say the south where if you re kind of measuring price moves off of stumpage revenue that stumpage revenue is 80 plus percent ebitda margin in terms of the pass through and so it is a more volatile market and invariably we re having to take a longer term view of pricing the other point i d make with new zealand in particular i mean we ve obviously kind of experienced a rocket ship in terms of the earnings growth there over the course of the prior three years and if you look at the result that we achieved in 2018 dave made a comment it is the third highest i m sorry 2019 it is the third highest result that we ve achieved since we started consolidating the business in 2013 and so we re coming off some extraordinarily strong markets in new zealand i certainly don t think that the entire sector segment has been revalued commensurate with 90 plus million of ebitda for example that we did in 2018 it s a lower multiple business it s a business where people are underwriting it through the cycle and so this type of price volatility while it s not helpful so we re kind of trying to manage earnings targets and whatnot it s something that you obviously have to live with in that region of the world david nunes president and chief executive officer mark this is dave what i d add to that just like we ve talked about the importance of utilizing bolt on transactions in the u s we ve done the same in new zealand we bought two small properties this year billing just under 7 000 acres we spent 36 million on those we re very happy with them we tend to be pretty deliberate in looking at the bolt ons in new zealand that can help us in sort of a regional age class fit and so that s typically is something that we are keen to and there are a number of opportunities down there but i d also say that we approach it in a pretty disciplined manner and as we saw the run up in prices on the log side over the last few years we ve frankly been a little less competitive on some of the transactions down there but we re in it for the long term and we re going to continue to look for things that make sense and we ll just have to see whether we get any of that type of pullback that you re referring to from a valuation standpoint and the impact it has on transaction markets mark wilde bmo capital markets analyst ok and then the last one for me dave just on pulp as best you can comment on this i mean just i m curious in general terms about how much hbu potential you think there is kind of with those land holdings around future sound you probably don t want to be too specific till you close the deal but it does strike me i mean you bought a lot of land with proximity to a pretty large and pretty fast growing metro market david nunes president and chief executive officer yes i think the thing i would comment on that with mark is that recognize that washington state has a very strict growth management act that precludes you from doing a lot of land conversion pope has a benefit of having a lot of land that is in smaller say 20 acre zoning areas i also give them a lot of credit for monetizing some of that through the creative use of conservation easements where they have sold underlying development rights on a lot of their land holdings which does two things it brings in cash flow from the sale of those development rights but then it also constricts supply of remaining lands that can be used for those purposes so it certainly is an attractive portfolio in that perspective but keep in mind the geography that you re dealing with and the restrictions on those underlying limits i think where we re probably more excited is just in the sense that with the fast ferry legislation that passed a few years ago you now have much more access to the seattle job market with passenger only ferries in particular going from kingston into downtown seattle and so that has improved the absorption rate on a lot of their hbu portfolio in the north kitsap part of the market and we think it will benefit the projects that pope has in both kingston and port campbell and so we see that more akin to our wildlight and richmond hill south of savannah those types of projects and so we re excited to have those come into the fold we think that we have the right skill set to both understand them and fold them into the business we do here in the south mark wilde bmo capital markets analyst yes i ve been up to both of those both very interesting situations i ll turn it over thanks dave operator the next question is coming from john babcock bank of america your line is open john babcock bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning first question i guess just as it kind of pertains to this spruce beetle i was wondering if you could comment on recognizing that exports from the south to china are pretty minimal at this point but how does the southern yellow pine compared to some of the other products that are making their way into china so like where would its niche be relative to radiata where would its niche be relative to spruce and this all assumes of course that you ultimately would even see some southern yellow pine return back to the chinese market over time doug long senior vice president of forest resources yes i ll take that one so one of the primary uses that we ve seen the niche market even in these kind of tariff markets is for pressure trading so for your like i mentioned for kind of your decking or for things that are going in the ground say post things like that so its definitely a niche southern yellow pine it s well known globally as being really really good material for absorbing the treatment chemicals and so that s one of the markets we ve seen strong obviously like river tides things like that where it is accepting treating so the salvage kill spruce and just spruce in general is not near as well regarded so that s an area that southern yellow pine has advantage over many of the other species in the world john babcock bank of america merrill lynch analyst and so is there much room for demand for that in china assuming this whole salvage timber issue lasts for an extended period doug long senior vice president of forest resources prior to the tariffs we were growing that market significantly so i would say yes and it was well received but once the tariffs went in place it got much harder we re still doing a minimum amount of volume kind of keeping the supply chain open off our atlantic coast and a lot of that we re doing now goes into that market so yes i think there s opportunity for growth if we can move past tariffs and other things david nunes president and chief executive officer john another thing to keep in mind is the southern volume flowing into china goes by container versus the break bulk that you see out of the northwest and in new zealand and so it really boils down to the efficiencies of the port and in effect the cost of that container shipping and so as we saw the tariffs be put into place it constricted the number of ports that could still compete in terms of having competitive cost structure and so that s a big impact so to the extent that the phase i deal opens that up and loosens that a little bit it will likely open up reopen up the number of ports that can competitively compete in that market john babcock bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok thank you and then second question i guess just quickly back to new zealand how much did you pay for the 7 000 acres that you acquired there david nunes president and chief executive officer 36 million so just a little over 5 000 an acre mark mchugh senior vice president and chief financial officer john recognize that the per acre values in new zealand can be all over the map it s all exclusively plantation timberland so it s heavily influenced by the age class of a specific property david nunes president and chief executive officer and yes one of those properties in particular john had a lot of merchantable timber on it so that s why you see that average for the two so high john babcock bank of america merrill lynch analyst that s helpful and then just last question just how are you assessing further opportunities to kind of grow non timber income from here recognizing it it sounds like non timber income will be down a little bit in 2020 doug long senior vice president of forest resources yes that s a great question so we have a team and they re constantly looking at those opportunities what we can do with respect to other forest products how we can capitalize on helping people kind of be carbon neutral so we ve got a lot of initiatives going on out there a lot of them are kind of in their infancy but any point in time the team is always tasked with identifying new opportunities and finding ones that are scalable so that they can go out across a lot of acres not going to get too specific about those once again because kind of until they ve been achieved you don t want to talk about and also don t want to give ideas to my competitors operator next question is coming from mark weintraub seaport your line is open mark weintraub seaport global securities analyst thank you so it looks like 2020 is going to be a relatively decent year for u s housing by most forecasts in the direction of what would historically have been considered normalized yet we re still struggling on the pricing side recognizing there s differences by submarkets but still pricing for sawtimber is pretty depressed any thoughts on what it s going to take to get that step change that we ve been waiting and hoping for for a while david nunes president and chief executive officer i mean mark keep in mind and we spent some time in our teach in in september and you can look at the materials on our web page about that but recognize that you had a fairly large build in inventory between now and the prior cycle but also that that s very differential and i think that has acted as a governor of at least step change pricing that you re referencing and that we continue to believe that you re going to have differential price elasticity across the south based on relative growth drain ratios that in some cases are under one and in some cases are well above two times and so it really is going to be a function of what part of the south you re in and that s something that we spend a lot of time looking at our own portfolio on and thinking about from a price recovery standpoint mark weintraub seaport global securities analyst thank you and how important or not so is the asia component to this equation david nunes president and chief executive officer i think i would attribute it to similar to the northwest and that all else being equal optionality is your friend and if you ve got additional markets you re going to benefit and we have a fairly high proportion of our u s south portfolio that is proximate to ports and so to the extent you have strong asian markets you re going to have more optionality to ship that product but recognize today at least in the short term we re dealing with the coronavirus and elevated inventories in china from the european spruce and to a lesser extent the australian fire salvage wood and so short term we don t see nearly the opportunities that we would think are going to be there longer term but we think the u s south as we discussed earlier from a port competitiveness standpoint the u s south or portions of it stack up very nicely and can bring in wood at a very competitive price relative to other global suppliers into that market mark mchugh senior vice president and chief financial officer and mark recognize that in the south at least i mean that market was essentially nonexistent a few years back and so the fact that it pulled back significantly last year i think we re kind of looking more as a lost opportunity as opposed to something that s going to necessarily have a depressant effect on the market and likewise if and when it comes back we think that that s a real opportunity to put some upward pressure on prices there and i think that export market is also helpful in the sense that to the extent you re getting that log out of the u s or out of that local region it s not being processed by local sawmill it s not also contributing to the chip supply in the region and so taking that fiber out of the market i think is positive for both sawtimber and pulpwood prices doug long senior vice president of forest resources yes i would just add to that kind of on scalability type thing q2 of 2018 which was the tariffs were announced in southern yellow pine in june of 2018 but that second quarter south was doing about 677 000 cubic meters of exports to china and without those tariffs it was going to increase significantly on top of that our own company we re moving from one ports to two ports to three ports to four port type things and we saw a lot of competitors doing the same thing so i think there was a lot of opportunity to scale up but obviously the tariffs came in in q4 kind of our estimate was about 230 000 cubic meters so we saw a significant 65 decrease so the fact that people can still operate is good but that 677 million was by no means the peak that was a ramping up period and like i said i know myself as well as many other brokers and other folks we re in the process of building up scale at that point in time and unfortunately those tariffs came in right when the market was starting to take off for southern yellow pine mark weintraub seaport global securities analyst and then very quickly on the pacific north i guess i m a little surprised that given the improving domestic housing situation and the perspective that asia probably didn t get worse that and that is a more tensioned market than the u s south that you weren t anticipating that there might be some more price improvement in those markets than what you seem to be forecasting for 2020 any color there mark mchugh senior vice president and chief financial officer well i think part of it is that we re trying to take a pretty measured view recognize that we kind of got burned last year by by taking what we said was a middle of the fairway approach where we had seen a big decline in prices in q3 and q4 of 2018 and within anticipating that there will be some near term resolution of the u s china trade situation that we would see a bounce back in prices that didn t materialize and so we ended up having to cut our guidance pretty significantly midyear for the pacific northwest and so we re now kind of sitting at four quarters or so of relatively stable pricing i think the fact that we re able to place volume now at prices that we think are reasonable is much an advantage in terms of how we re thinking about the market relative to where we were last year where we thought ok if we try to push this volume out to the market it s actually going to have a depressant effect on price and so we do feel as though the market is improving but look i generally hold the view that the best indicator of tomorrow s price is probably today s price and so taking a really bullish view on kind of how things are going to develop during the course of the year i think could just be setting us to have to kind of revise that expectation going forward and so look we clearly think that if we do see some real momentum from the phase i trade agreement that there s upside to these numbers but to kind of bake that in as we sit here today following four quarters of relatively flattish pricing i think is something we opted not to do david nunes president and chief executive officer yes and mark you have to also just recognize that while that european spruce volume is present in that market it s going to make it much harder to meaningfully bring pacific northwest volume into that market and that therein lies a lot of that historic tensioning that the northwest is enjoyed by virtue of that market so that s just another reason for some of our caution mark weintraub seaport global securities analyst thank you for the color operator our last question is coming from collin mings raymond james your line is open collin mings raymond james analyst thanks just a few follow ups from me as far as real estate development investments mark recognizing this will likely change once the pope transaction closes but just how should we think about your spending in 2020 as compared to last year s 7 million mark mchugh senior vice president and chief financial officer yes i generally think it would have been relatively flat on a year over year basis but recognize that we had guided initially to 8 million to 11 million in 2019 and we only ended up doing 7 million and so next year is clearly going to be higher than that probably more in the range of 12 million to 15 million i d say because there s some carryover from 2019 that didn t occur and that s going to be both in the belfast commerce area richmond hill and wildlight david nunes president and chief executive officer yes but collin the biggest jump in that year over year is really that growth in that richmond hill project which really had a fairly small component of capital this year you may recall there s a new interstate exchange being constructed as we speak and that s opening up a lot more interest in that project and so we re moving forward with some of the investments to help position ourselves for sales once that is completed later this year mark mchugh senior vice president and chief financial officer we ll of course have specific guidance on that in the 10 k but generally just for planning purposes i think it s going to be in that range that i talked about collin mings raymond james analyst ok and then i want to go quickly back to john s question just on non timber income in particular it looks like new zealand there was a sizable increase in non timber sales during 4q and again recognize that you don t want to be too specific but can you maybe just talk about the sustainability of that specifically in new zealand or was that just an unusual uptick there or should we think about that as kind of a go forward run rate mark mchugh senior vice president and chief financial officer no i definitely think 2019 was probably modestly elevated level in new zealand you recognize that our non timber income business across our three key regions is quite a bit different and then even quite a bit different within a region for example the south we had a record year in 2019 a lot of that was driven by pipeline easement income which those tend to be kind of more one off opportunities but then you also have your core kind of recreational leases that tend to be sustainable that s recurring year over year income in the pacific northwest it tends to be cedar salvage revenue which is somewhat recurring but again you can only get on and do that at certain times in new zealand is primarily carbon credit sales and there is a legacy bank so to speak of carbon credits that we have there but it s not infinite and the bank that we have i would say is not generally growing and so that will ultimately taper off over time sorry collin i was just going to mention one thing on the carbon market in new zealand is late december the government announced some key changes to their carbon trading and actually raise the kind of the fixed price option 35 for 2020 emissions and so ultimately we saw prices jump from say 24 range to 29 50 on that announcement and so back down around 27 50 so we have seen a pretty increase in carbon trading basically in just the last month and expect that that will kind of go up as time goes on as people approach kind of surrenders typing so there s some upside and the per unit pricing with respect to carbon as things move forward for us david nunes president and chief executive officer and just collin for clarification in new zealand with this carbon scheme you basically are granted credits during a rotation and then you have to give back some credits when you harvest and you end up keeping a small net that you can trade and that s outside of the volume that mark talked about which were more legacy credits that we can sell that s an ongoing source potential source of non timber income collin mings raymond james analyst got it ok very helpful there and then just one last one for me recognizing in the prepared remarks david you did touch on kind of aggregate acquisition activity for 2019 and then obviously the pope transaction kind of on tap here for 2020 but can you maybe just expand a little bit more on the acquisitions specifically completed during the fourth quarter it does look like a fairly sizable level of investment activity in the u s south david nunes president and chief executive officer sure collin for the full year we had 18 transactions 14 of those were negotiated and four were bid in q4 we had three transactions one which was just under 24 000 acres was in northeast florida we had another transaction that was in east texas for just under 7 000 acres and then we had a small transaction of about 600 acres in washington state and so we re happy with all three of those overall we spent 60 million across those covering approximately 31 000 acres across the three collin mings raymond james analyst thank you operator i will now turn it back to mr mchugh

tuesday and wednesday is repo a band of democrats from the senate banking committee where powell heads on wednesday has already sent him a list of questions about last autumn s upheaval in the repurchase agreement market where banks go to secure funding to meet their reserve requirements the episode when a cash squeeze drove overnight repo interest rates to 10 forced the fed back into the active bond buying business for the first time in some five years and it scooped up more than 300 billion of t bills since the fed has also become the lender of first resort in the repo market pumping tens of billions of dollars each day into money markets to ensure liquidity and avoid another squeeze policy makers believe the repo riot was triggered by having allowed bank reserve levels to fall too low in the roughly two years it had been letting the stash of bonds on its balance sheet dwindle reserves are on the upswing again but just where the sweet spot in reserve levels lies is the big

cash flow results mainly from a lower investment in non cash working capital and higher cash provided by operating activities cae usually sees a higher level of investment in non cash working capital accounts during the first half of the fiscal year and it expects to see a significant portion of these investments reverse in the second half income taxes this quarter were 18 4 million representing an effective tax rate of 16 compared to 15 for the third quarter last year the tax rate was higher due to the impacts of tax audits in canada last year partially offset by a change in the mix of income from various jurisdictions net finance expense this quarter was 36 7 million 17 4 million higher than the third quarter of fiscal 2019 mainly from higher interest on long term debt due to the

are cautioned that any of the disclosed risks could have a material adverse effect on our forward looking statements we caution that the disclosed list of risk factors is not exhaustive and other factors could also adversely affect our results non gaap and other financial measures this press release includes non gaap and other financial measures non gaap measures are useful supplemental information but may not have a standardized meaning according to gaap these measures should not be confused with or used as an alternative for performance measures calculated according to gaap they should also not be used to compare with similar measures from other companies management believes that providing certain non gaap measures provides users with a better understanding of our results and trends and provides additional information on our financial and operating performance 1 segment operating income soi is a non gaap measure and is the sum of our key indicators of each segment s financial performance segment operating income gives us an indication of the profitability of each segment because it does not include the impact of any items not specifically related to the segment s performance we calculate total segment operating income by taking the operating profit and excluding restructuring costs of major programs that do not arise from significant strategic transactions 2 segment operating income before specific items further excludes restructuring costs integration costs acquisition costs and other gains and losses arising from significant strategic transactions we track it because we believe it provides a better indication of our operating performance and makes it easier to compare across reporting periods 3 free cash flow is a non gaap measure that shows us how much cash we have available to invest in growth opportunities repay debt and meet ongoing financial obligations we use it as an indicator of our financial strength and liquidity we calculate it by taking the net cash generated by our continuing operating activities subtracting maintenance capital expenditures investment in other assets not related to growth and dividends paid and adding proceeds from the disposal of property plant and equipment dividends received from equity accounted investees and proceeds net of payments from equity accounted investees 4 order intake and backlog order intake is a non gaap measure that represents the expected value of orders we have received for the civil aviation training solutions segment we consider an item part of our order intake when we have a legally binding commercial agreement with a client that includes enough detail about each party s obligations to form the basis for a contract additionally expected future revenues from customers under short term and long term training contracts are included when these customers commit to pay us training fees or when we reasonably expect the revenue to be generated for the defence and security segment we consider an item part of our order intake when we have a legally binding commercial agreement with a client that includes enough detail about each party s obligations to form the basis for a contract defence and security contracts are usually executed over a long term period but some of them must be renewed each year for this segment we only include a contract item in order intake when the customer has authorized the contract item and has received funding for it for the healthcare segment order intake is typically converted into revenue within one year therefore we assume that order intake is equal to revenue the book to sales ratio is the total orders divided by total revenue in a given period total backlog is a non gaap measure that represents expected future revenues and includes obligated backlog joint venture backlog and unfunded backlog and options obligated backlog represents the value of our order intake not yet executed and is calculated by adding the order intake of the current period to the balance of the obligated backlog at the end of the previous fiscal year subtracting the revenue recognized in the current period and adding or subtracting backlog adjustments if the amount of an order already recognized in a previous fiscal year is modified the backlog is revised through adjustments joint venture backlog is obligated backlog that represents the expected value of our share of orders that our joint ventures have received but have not yet executed joint venture backlog is determined on the same basis as obligated backlog described above unfunded backlog represents firm defence and security orders we have received but have not yet executed and for which funding authorization has not yet been obtained options are included in backlog when there is a high probability of being exercised but indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contracts are excluded when an option is exercised it is considered order intake in that period and it is removed from unfunded backlog and options 5 net income before specific items is a non gaap measure we use as an alternate view of our operating results we calculate it by taking our net income attributable to equity holders of the company from continuing operations and excluding restructuring costs integration costs acquisition costs and other gains and losses arising from significant strategic transactions as well as significant one time tax items we track it because we believe it provides a better indication of our operating performance and makes it easier to compare across reporting periods 6 earnings per share eps before specific items is a non gaap measure calculated by excluding restructuring costs integration costs acquisition costs and other gains and losses arising from significant strategic transactions as well as significant one time tax items from the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the company the effect per share is obtained by dividing these restructuring costs integration costs acquisition costs and other gains net of tax as well as one time tax items by the average number of diluted shares we track it because we believe it provides a better indication of our operating performance on a per share basis and makes it easier to compare across reporting periods 7 a full flight simulator ffs is a full size replica of a specific make model and series of an aircraft cockpit including a motion system in our count of ffss deployed in the network we generally only include ffss that are of the highest fidelity and do not include any fixed based training devices or other lower level devices as these are typically used in addition to ffss in the same approved training programs 8 utilization rate is one of the operating measures we use to assess the performance of our civil simulator training network while utilization rate does not perfectly correlate to revenue recognized we track it together with other measures because we believe it is an indicator of our operating performance we calculate it by taking the number of training hours sold on our simulators during the period divided by the practical training capacity available for the same period 9 simulator equivalent unit seu is an operating measure we use to show the total average number of ffss available to generate earnings during the period 10 maintenance capital expenditure is a non gaap measure we use to calculate the investment needed to sustain the current level of economic activity growth capital expenditure is a non gaap measure we use to calculate the investment needed to increase the current level of economic activity 11 net debt is a non gaap measure we use to monitor how much debt we have after taking into account cash and cash equivalents we use it as an indicator of our overall financial position and calculate it by taking our total long term debt including the current portion of long term debt and subtracting cash and cash equivalents 12 net debt to capital is calculated as net debt divided by the sum of total equity plus net debt 13 return on capital employed roce is a non gaap measure we use to evaluate the profitability of our invested capital we calculate this ratio over a rolling four quarter period by taking net income attributable to equity holders of the company excluding net finance expense after tax divided by the average capital employed for non gaap and other financial measures monitored by cae please refer to cae s md a filed with the canadian securities

statistics canada reported that the canadian economy added 34 500 new jobs last month all in full time employment the unemployment rate fell to 5 5 per cent from 5 6 per cent in december economists

needed more time before deciding whether to back an opec committee s recommendation to deepen current production cuts the day range on brent so far is us 54 81 to us 55 40 west texas intermediate had a range of us 50 78 to us 51 48 both benchmarks are heading toward their fifth straight weekly loss as concerns about the impact of the coronavirus continue to hang over the market brent crude is down about 5 per cent on the week prices initially drew some early support from comments from russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said that moscow supported co operation with other producers however energy minister alexander novak said on friday that russia needed a few days to analyse the market and would clarify its position on deeper cuts next week a technical opec panel said this week that it would recommend that the group and its allies cut production by another 600 000 barrels a day to support the market that would come on top of the current cuts of 500 000 barrels a day which kicked in at the start of this year we ve seen this all before and at this time there is little reason for the market to suspect russia will break from the usual pattern of flip flopping until the last minute but ultimately agreeing to cut axitrader strategist stephen innes said mr innes also said current market reaction also reflects the fact that the 600 000 barrel cut being proposed is above the low end of the range mentioned in recent press reports but also well below the upper end which had indicated that a cut of as much as 1 million barrels a day was possible price action is enough to tell you the market is disappointed he said gold prices steadied as world equity markets pulled back spot gold was little changed at us 1 566 33 per ounce spot gold is down more than 1 per cent on the week u s gold futures were unchanged at us 1 569 30 per ounce the focus is on whether we are going to get a strong enough economic shock from the virus that would get central banks to cut rates further ilya spivak a senior currency strategist at dailyfx told reuters there is an underlying anxiety and clearly markets are very sensitive which is why gold doesn t want to fall because there is anticipation that no central bank is going to be raising rates in this environment for a long time currencies the canadian dollar bounced off early lows after statscan reported better than expected job creation in this country last month the day range on the loonie so far is 75 12 us cents to 75 28 us cents shortly after the release of the jobs numbers the loonie shifted from the lower end of the range to close to the top end statscan said the canadian economy added 34 500 new jobs last month all in full time work economists had been expecting a more modest increase the jobless rate also slid to 5 5 per cent

bancshares website at www civb com again welcome to civista bancshares fourth quarter and full year 2019earnings call i would like to begin by discussing our results which were issued this morning at the conclusion of my remarks we will take any questions you may have i m very pleased to announce that this morning we reported record earnings for 2019 our full year results resulted in record net income of 33 2 million or 2 01 per diluted share our fourth quarter results were also very good with net income of 7 7 million or 0 47 per diluted share i would like to take a moment to discuss some of our accomplishments in 2019 we increased our loan portfolio 9 4 or 147 million for the year ending with 1 7 billion in loans in addition to those loans that were added to the portfolio we also sold 125 8 million of loans in the secondary market while the loan side of the house was very busy with new production we were also very successful in the deposit area our deposits increased 98 9 million or 6 3 at the end of october we opened a full service branch in beachwood ohio which is on the east side of cleveland we have had a loan production office in the area for a few years that has been very successful generating loans this full service office will allow us to serve all of the needs of our current customers in the cleveland area as well as prospective customers also in october we announced that we would begin the process of redeeming our convertible preferred stock the convertible preferred stock was in the money in fact nearly tripling in value so virtually all of our holders converted their preferred stock to common stock speaking of capital management during 2019 we had a stock repurchase plan of up 472 000 shares of stock we repurchased 188 200 shares at a weighted average price of 20 77 that repurchase plan expired in december and our board approved a new repurchase plan of up to 672 000 shares for 2020 getting back to our financial results our full year diluted earnings per share increased 0 16 compared to our adjusted 2018 results which is an 8 6 increase our fourth quarter results compared to adjusted 2018 earnings showed a slight decline in the fourth quarter of 2019 our diluted earnings per share was 0 47 which is a decline of 3 8 but that is primarily due to a december 2018 accrual adjustment we made to our wealth management income our return on average assets was 1 37 for the quarter and 1 5 year to date while our return on average equity was 9 44 for the quarter and 10 64 year to date the increase in our core earnings continues to be driven by our strong net interest income in what has been an interesting interest rate environment net interest income increased 477 000 for the fourth quarter and 19 million for the year interest income increased 814 000 for the fourth quarter and 24 4 million for the year our average earning assets increased 162 2 million for the fourth quarter and 429 7 million for the year the volatility in the interest rate environment tipped the scale on our average yields for the fourth quarter our average yield decreased 3 6 while for the year our average yield increased 5 5 our interest expense increased 337 000 for the fourth quarter and 5 4 million for the year these increases were due to both increased balances and a higher cost of funding during the first half of 2019 funding costs rose to catch up with the increases the fed put in place during 2018 deposit costs have not decreased as quickly as the fed moved in the last half of 2019 net interest income grew by 3 9 for the linked quarter and 28 7 year over year our net interest margin remained strong at 4 18 for the quarter and 4 31 for the year compared to to 4 38 and 4 21 in 2018 included in our 2019 margin are 14 basis points of accretion in the fourth quarter and 15 basis points of accretion for the year compared to 22 basis points and 6 basis points for the same periods in 2018 all of the comparisons that i made to 2018 include the adjusted earnings for both the fourth quarter and year to date periods the non gaap tables on our earnings release have the full details of our adjusted earnings we were successful in increasing our non interest income in 2019 during the quarter non interest income increased 762 000 or 15 7 in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2018 and increased 3 9 million or 21 for the year primarily due to our acquisition of ucb during the third quarter of 2018 for both periods we have seen an uptick in service charges and interchange fees from the addition of ucb gain on sale of loans increased 620 000 for the quarter and 1 1 million for the year on strong mortgage activity during the quarter civista originated and sold 45 2 million of mortgage loans compared to 21 4 million in 2018 year to date our mortgage loans sold totaled 125 8 million compared to 79 5 million in 2018 the decline in wealth management fees during the quarter is attributable to a 245 000 accrual adjustment made during the fourth quarter of 2018 we continue to view wealth management as an opportunity to grow non interest income and look forward to expanding these services into our new markets controlling non interest expense continues to be a priority after adjusting for 782 000 of acquisition expenses incurred during the fourth quarter of 2018 and 12 7 million incurred during the entirety of 201 non interest expense increased 9 7 million for the quarter and 24 1 year over year a similar adjustment is necessary to draw a meaningful comparison of compensation expense which included 172 000 and 5 2 million of acquisition related expense adjusted compensation expense increased 601 000 for the quarter and 7 1 million for the year this was attributable to an increase in ftes and normal pay raises our fte count increased by 75 to 445 compared to 2018 and it was primarily attributable to the ucb acquisition the increase in net occupancy and equipment again is primarily due to the addition of eight branches and a loan production office in the ucb transaction and the opening of our new beachwood ohio branch conversely the decrease in data processing expense was primarily due to conversion related expenses of 260 000 for the quarter and 5 5 million for the year related to the ucb transaction in 2018 professional services also decreased due to 139 000 and 1 6 million of expenses associated with the ucb transaction included in the fourth quarter and year to date during 2018 our efficiency ratio was 61 4 for the year compared to our adjusted efficiency ratio of 62 9 in 2018 given our business model of operating as a community bank in rural communities and as a more boutique commercial bank in urban markets we think of ourselves as a low 60s efficiency ratio we continue to be pleased with loan production across our footprint our loan portfolio grew 147 million or 9 4 for the year and 14 5 annualized for the quarter while the majority of the growth came in both owner and non owner occupied commercial real estate we had strong growth in virtually every category and across our footprint we anticipate growing our loan portfolio at a mid single digit rate for 2020 on the funding side our deposits increased 98 9 million or 6 3 during the year with 90 7 million of that growth coming in core deposit accounts we are particularly pleased that 73 5 million of this growth was in business and municipal operating accounts we added two treasury bankers to our staff early in 2019 and are beginning to see lift in deposit growth from new and existing business customers across our footprint on the wholesale funding side fhlb advances increased 32 9 million to 226 5 million at year end i m sure many of you are wondering what impact cecl will have on our bank we were fortunate to meet the guidelines for the delayed implementation of cecl and will not be required to adopt it until 2023 while our asset quality remained strong the growth in our loan portfolio led us to record an 885 000 provision during the fourth quarter and 1 million for the year our asset quality metrics continue to be solid our non performing loans were 9 1 million representing 0 39 of total assets at year end compared to 9 9 million in 2018 the ratio of our allowance for loan losses to loans was 0 86 at december 31 2019 compared to 0 88 at december 31 2018 our coverage of non performing loans increased to 161 95 at december 31 2019 from 137 87 at the end of 2018 as we look back on 2019 it was another very busy and extremely successful year for civista in a challenging interest rate environment we managed to organically grow our loan portfolio by 9 4 we were also able to fund a large portion of that loan growth with core deposit funding which grew at 6 3 and we were able to do that while maintaining our margin at 4 31 we are pleased with a record year fueled by solid core earnings we are confident our disciplined approach to managing civista and our long term focus on driving shareholder value will continue yielding positive results looking forward into 2020 while the lending environment remains competitive we are confident that our continued focus on relationships will allow civista to grow both loans and deposits without relaxing our standards thank you for your attention this afternoon and now we will be happy to address any questions you may have questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session today s first question comes from michael perito of kbw please go ahead michael perito keefe bruyette woods inc analyst hey good afternoon everybody happy new year dennis g shaffer president and chief executive officer hey mike michael perito keefe bruyette woods inc analyst thanks for taking my questions i wanted to start on the loan growth outlook the mid single digit outlook does seem a little conservative based on kind of the acceleration over the course of the year at loan growth and i m curious if that s a function of the kind of a set up with the funding of the balance sheet now with the loan to deposit ratio stepping up toward 100 right at 100 or so over the course of the year and now you guys are in the position where you want to fund kind of loans dollar for dollar with deposit growth going forward and that kind of limits you a little bit onto the net growth you can show or are there other factors that kind of leads you to maintaining that mid single digit guidance for next year after the strong end to 2019 charles a parcher senior vice president yeah mike i would say we were in that mid to single digit range from a projection perspective we re kind of a little aware where the economy is exactly going to go here in 2020 it being an election year i d say that mid i would call it mid to high single digits assumption is probably the right assumption for us we did come into the year with a pretty healthy pipeline we came into the year with a nice construction portfolio that is available to be drawn so we feel good about where we re at we re just a little apprehensive about where the economy is going to go in the back half of the year dennis g shaffer president and chief executive officer and we can continue mike i think to be selective in the loans that we will make sure we re getting the pricing and in the structure of the loans so i think that s why given what chuck said and being a little bit selective is why we ve targeted kind of that mid single digit loan growth michael perito keefe bruyette woods inc analyst okay that s helpful thank you guys and on the deposit side can you talk a little bit more about the cost of some of the growth that you guys are seeing and how you expect that to trend into 2020 here do you think there s room for funding costs to move down if you re growing at a mid single digit pace or do you think it might be move a little slower downward as you guys are growing the overall portfolio based on kind of the market pricing dynamics that you see today richard j dutton senior vice president mike this is rich i mean our funding costs have always been among the lowest in the peer group and there is not a whole lot room for them to come down it has come down i think one basis point linked quarter that s where the compression of our margin comes from i mean again i think with the treasury folks that we hired early in the year there s an ability to attract business deposits that s where our deposit growth for the most part is going to come from michael perito keefe bruyette woods inc analyst okay richard j dutton senior vice president i think again we re seeing some pretty good momentum as it builds toward the end of the year charles a parcher senior vice president and we continue to try to build out that treasury platform mike i mean it s our goal to continue to try to bring in as many low cost flattish core deposits as we possibly can dennis g shaffer president and chief executive officer yeah we had tremendous success in 2019 i think we have that momentum that s going to carry over into 2020 i mean that is is of huge emphasis for us because we think we can continue to garner a little bit more of that relationship from some of those commercial clients michael perito keefe bruyette woods inc analyst helpful thank you and then one more just on capital i m wondered dennis just the conservatism on the economic outlook does that carry into your m a appetite as well as we think about your capital plans for this year and i guess that s where we would start out there s a couple of follow ups but does that impact your your willingness i guess to pursue m a given the conservative economic kind of thoughts you guys are having for the back half of 2020 dennis g shaffer president and chief executive officer no no i actually think the interest rate environment is going to put a little bit of pressure on these net interest margins for some of these smaller banks so if anything i think that environment is going to hopefully fuel some activity there there has not been a ton in ohio other than the first defiance and home savings deal so i think that the outlook for the economy and with the interest rate environment it s going to going to help that per se so i think being pretty well levered up we want to try to find a bank that has ideally would have a lower loan to deposit ratio than us so that we can continue to put those funds to work michael perito keefe bruyette woods inc analyst okay and actually i am going to pivot a little back to my loan growth question good job you reminded me of a question i wanted to ask is there room what kind of assumptions are you guys making if any around the first defiance united community merger i know it s just closed and conversion hasn t happened yet so there might still be some time for a bunch of moving pieces to play out and i know both franchises weren t very overlapped but do you think in the kind of the northern half of the state there ll be opportunities from any disruption or how are you guys doing that and is that factored in at all kind of to your loan growth budgeting for 2020 charles a parcher senior vice president we really haven t factored michael this is chuck we really haven t factored really any of that disruption into our loan growth assumptions we haven t seen a lot of it yet quite frankly i guess i m looking at it more so from a fact a perspective i think that ll probably be a little bit more competitive than a little bit less competitive just because it didn t have a little bit more sheer size i don t know yet if there is we haven t seen any yet as far as any employee is being let go that would be somebody that we would like to target in addition to bringing and help to generate loans from their portfolio that hasn t taken place yet but we ll probably know more at our next call next quarter michael perito keefe bruyette woods inc analyst okay well thank you guys for taking my questions as always i appreciate it dennis g shaffer president and chief executive officer you bet richard j dutton senior vice president thanks mike operator and our next question today comes from nick cucharale of piper sandler please go ahead your line is open mr cucharale nick cucharale piper sandler analyst i m sorry about that good afternoon gentlemen dennis g shaffer president and chief executive officer hi nick nick cucharale piper sandler analyst with the tax business coming into focus in the first quarter can you help us think through your expectations is it similar to prior years dennis g shaffer president and chief executive officer yeah although i will tell you that it s going to be a little less i think in the last past several years i think that the total revenue that we earned on that was 2 7 million this year we expect it to be 2 4 million with about 1 9 million that happened in the first quarter but it is not materially different and i think in terms of the funds flowing through that will be pretty similar but it is going to be a little bit less than what we ve had the last two or three years nick cucharale piper sandler analyst okay that s great and did you happen to extend your agreement to future years or is that dennis g shaffer president and chief executive officer we did happen to do that i think we ve always and we did that in december charles a parcher senior vice president we had a new year we ended the year nick cucharale piper sandler analyst okay that s great and then just building on the loan growth outlook here as far as the segments are concerned are you expecting similar trends with commercial real estate leading the way or is the focus is on greater diversification in 2020 charles a parcher senior vice president mike it s chuck i think we ll keep it hopefully at the same kind of of trajectory with commercial real estate our goal is to help augment or i guess keep that at the same growth pace but maybe to grow our c i a little bit quicker as far as from a trajectory perspective we did hire a new first to run retail and i would like to see us through a little bit more consumer lending peer into 2020 as compared to what we ve done in the past but i would tell you i would as for modelling i would say it s commercial real estate which still lead the way as far as from a full line perspective nick cucharale piper sandler analyst that s great color thanks for taking my question dennis g shaffer president and chief executive officer thanks nick operator and our next question today comes from kevin swanson of the hovde group please go ahead kevin swanson hovde group analyst hi guys dennis g shaffer president and chief executive officer hi kevin how are you kevin swanson hovde group analyst how are you dennis g shaffer president and chief executive officer good kevin swanson hovde group analyst hey most of my questions are answered i appreciate the color but maybe just thinking about the expense base obviously it was up a little bit but not although it s surprising given the strong production in mortgaging loans but how do we kind of think about the expenses going forward i guess in kind of conjunction with the mid single digit loan growth outlook for 2020 thanks dennis g shaffer president and chief executive officer thanks kevin rich you want to tackle it richard j dutton senior vice president yeah i mean i think that you re right on in terms of growth in the commission expense because of the increased loan demand i think what we re looking at in the first quarter for next year is again we ve got the increase in the payroll taxes that s like a piece of it i mean that first quarter wise bigger and then health insurance and i don t know if you ve been on the calls before but we always kind of we re self insured and so we take an expense what the underwriters tell us that we are to what we should expect but i would tell you that more years than not as the year progresses we end up got to reducing that expenses we see the actual expense coming through so to say it s front end loaded it s probably not the wrong way to look at it i think we re looking at a run rate and run rate is not the right term but for the first quarter i think and i got the number here in front of me and i can t find it why don t we say that was going to be timed for fourth quarter let me flip on page i ve got 17 6 million is what we ve got for non interest expense for the first quarter charles a parcher senior vice president yes 17 6 million kevin swanson hovde group analyst and then maybe just one follow up on the tax business was there something specific that drove that kind of the difference between 19 and the expectation for 20 i guess now we re a couple of weeks past the hub testing just curious if there is anything you re seeing in the market dennis g shaffer president and chief executive officer no there is nothing that we re seeing in the market it s just i think again our partner tpg who is owned by green dot they ve got their own bank and it was just kind of a load shift i think part of one of the bigger producers they shift a little bit more of that business to them and we got a little bit more of the kind of smaller party originators that was kind of a load shift i suppose it s the best way to look at it kevin swanson hovde group analyst okay great thanks i appreciate it operator and our next question today comes from scott beury of boenning and scattergood please go ahead scott beury boenning and scattergood analyst hey good afternoon guys dennis g shaffer president and chief executive officer hi scott good afternoon scott beury boenning and scattergood analyst i just wanted to kind of touch on a few things first off on the loan yield kind of looking at where new loans are coming on and i obviously can respect that this is dependent on mix and product type but looking at the yield on the portfolio today and where new yields are coming on do you have any thoughts on kind of the directional trend line that you expect for the overall loan yields in the portfolio i think stripping out the accretion my math is that you were down about 15 basis points or so this quarter charles a parcher senior vice president that s correct and loan yields have definitely fallen back in the fourth quarter and they stablized as we ve started new originations in 2020 but we still feel that there is going to be some downward pressure looking forward i don t know that i ve got a great number for you today scott but we re definitely probably off a few clicks from where we were last year richard j dutton senior vice president yeah the fourth quarter would have had the full impact of the three interest rate reductions so even though some of them happened mid year and some of them later in that third quarter the fourth quarter had the full impact which i think impacted at 15 basis points that you saw so that s but the loans are definitely going on at a lower rates than what we were putting them on the first quarter of 2019 scott beury boenning and scattergood analyst so maybe would it be fair to say that we could expect maybe not quite the same reduction that you experienced this quarter with the flat interest rate environment but maybe some directional through the year based on the new originations richard j dutton senior vice president yeah we think that s pretty accurate right dennis g shaffer president and chief executive officer and we think that will be not as great in the first quarter i think as it might be later in the year because we ve got all the tax program income coming in the first quarter or the majority of it coming in that first quarter from a margin perspective right scott beury boenning and scattergood analyst excellent that s very helpful and then few other questions first off on the tax rate i know you have some lumpiness usually kind of through the year but the tax rate was a bit low for me in the fourth quarter is kind of a 14 to 15 range a good rate to use for 2020 dennis g shaffer president and chief executive officer 14 or 15 tax i would say 15 if i were you scott beury boenning and scattergood analyst okay thank you and then lastly from a little bit of a broader perspective i know that you re still actively exploring m a opportunities just wanted to kind of follow up on that and looking at the earnings power of the company right now your capital ratios just kind of wanted to get a sense of any thoughts you might have on the buyback and particularly any thoughts you might have on the decision to not be more active with that in the fourth quarter dennis g shaffer president and chief executive officer yeah i think given that we re growing our capital and we re earning and growing our capital the way we are we did increase the authorization of the buyback going in here to the first quarter and without an m a transaction imminent i think that we would probably be a little bit more aggressive with the buybacks we think that s a good way to deploy some of our capital scott beury boenning and scattergood analyst excellent that was helpful all right well that answers all my questions and thanks for taking the time guys dennis g shaffer president and chief executive officer thank you scott richard j dutton senior vice president thanks scott operator and this concludes our question and answer session i d like to turn the conference back over to mr shaffer for any final remarks dennis g shaffer president and chief executive officer yeah

asian markets mostly fell friday after a week long rally as investors take profits and assess developments in china s deadly coronavirus crisis strong us data chinese financial support and a broadly healthy earnings season have provided a much needed boost to equities after last week s sell off while there is a sense that the economic impact of the outbreak globally could be limited china s decision thursday to halve tariffs on 75 billion of us goods as part of their trade detente has also cheered the mood observers say the virus which has killed more than 600 people and infected 31 000 will batter chinese growth in the first quarter but it could rebound later in the year as it did after sars if the pattern of the sars impacts are a guide there is the potential for the chinese economy to rebound with an above potential growth rate once the outbreak subsides said t rowe price analyst chris kushlis in 2003 china s growth rate climbed to 15 5 percent in the third quarter as pent up demand saw consumption rebound as the sars outbreak waned a similar rebound following the coronavirus could help keep the longer term track of the chinese economy on a relatively even keel heading into the weekend dealers were taking a step back after the week s strong gains across the world which has seen all three main indexes on wall street chalk up record highs hong kong which has climbed around 4 5 percent this week dipped 0 7 percent while tokyo dipped 0 2 percent singapore and taipei both fell more than one percent while seoul slipped 0 7 percent sydney shed 0 4 percent and mumbai eased 0 5 percent manila and bangkok also fell however shanghai added 0 3 percent to extend a rebound to four straight days as it recovers from a near eight percent drop suffered monday when it reopened after the lunar new year break the gains have been greatly helped by central bank cash injections into the financial market while there is speculation that government agencies are also buying up shares to prevent a rout stephen innes of axicorp said that while the virus outbreak seems to be stabilising in the epicentre of china s hubei province the disruption to china s economy will likely continue in the short term this may give cause for pause or at minimum investors coming up for air after recent gains traders are also keeping tabs on the release later in the day of key us jobs data which will provide a fresh snapshot of the world s top economy the dial back on equity markets was reflected on foreign exchanges where high yielding riskier currencies such as the south korean won and indonesian rupiah were down against the dollar still oil extended gains on hopes that opec and other key producers will unveil a huge output cut to offset a virus fuelled plunge in demand for the commodity from key consumer china with millions of people in china in lockdown travel severely restricted and factories staying closed the country s energy use is expected to have been severely hit those fears have hammered crude prices which this week hit more than one year lows but hopes that the crisis will abate and speculation producers will slow the flow have provided support still gains on the oil market are being capped by worries that russia will not agree to saudi arabia s suggested cut in output by 600 000 barrels a day shanghai composite up 0 3 percent at 2 875 96 close hong kong hang seng down 0 7 percent at 27 306 72 tokyo nikkei 225 down 0 2 percent at 23 827 98 close euro dollar down at 1 0980 from 1 0987 at 2145 gmt pound dollar up at 1 2944 from 1 2924 euro pound down at 84 81 pence from 84 95 pence dollar yen down at 109 96 yen from 109 97 yen brent crude up 0 7 percent at 55 31 per barrel west texas intermediate up 0 5 percent at 51 21 new york dow up 0 3 percent at 29 379 77 close london ftse 100 up 0 3 percent at 7 504 79 close copyright afp all rights reserved
us and china ready to seal a phase one deal jfd brokers follow 9 min read jan 15 2020 listen share equities pulled back while safe havens gained after us treasury sec mnuchin said that tariffs on chinese imports will stay in place until the second phase of the deal today the two nations are expected to sign the first part but bearing in mind that this is largely priced in we believe that attention will fall on the text as well as to any clues on how they intend to move forward among the g10 currencies the franc was the main gainer getting also boosted by the us s decision to add switzerland to its currency manipulators watchlist equities retreat as us plans to keep tariffs in place after phase one deal the dollar traded lower or unchanged against the other g10 currencies on tuesday and during the asian morning wednesday it underperformed against chf gbp jpy and slightly against nok while it was found virtually unchanged against eur aud and cad the greenback gained only against nzd and sek the strengthening of the safe havens chf and jpy suggests that risk appetite was hurt at some point yesterday while the majority of major eu indices traded slightly in the green in the us both the s p 500 and nasdaq slid 0 15 and 0 24 after hitting new all time highs the djia also hit a new record and slid but managed to maintain gains of 0 11 sentiment was dented somewhat more during the asian morning today with both japan s nikkei 225 and china s shanghai composite sliding 0 45 and 0 54 respectively it seems that investors adopted a more cautious stance ahead of the signing of a phase one traded deal between the us and china which is expected later today with comments by us treasury secretary steven mnuchin late in the us session encouraging some more profit taking in the equity world the treasury secretary said that the us will maintain tariffs on chinese imports until the second phase of the deal judging by the latest rally in stock markets we believe that the signing of the first phase is largely priced in thus signatures and handshakes may support somewhat sentiment but not much investors may pay more attention to the content of the deal as well as on any signals with regards to how the world s two largest economies will move forward us president trump has recently said that he will travel to beijing for talks over the second phase of the deal and anything suggesting that this may be the case could work in favor of risk assets however we remain reluctant to call for a long lasting recovery as the road towards a final accord may not be paved with rose petals and mnuchin s remarks enhance to our view now the big disappointment today would be not signing the interim deal something that is not a totally unlikely scenario in our view given that in the past we saw things falling apart in the last minute remember that back in may it was reported that the two sides were very close to reaching common ground but the expected deal was scrapped after china deleted from the draft some of its commitments s p 500 technical outlook the s p 500 corrected lower yesterday after the cash index hit a new all time high near the 3296 mark overall the index is still trading well above its short term tentative upside support line drawn from the low of december 3 rd that said given yesterday s slide we might see a follow through of the same move which could lead the price a bit lower to test one of its key support areas but let s not forget that overall the broader direction is to the upside and thus we will remain somewhat bullish for now if the price suddenly falls below the 3260 hurdle this could open the door for that deeper correction mentioned above which might lead the s p 500 to the 3260 zone marked by the low of january 10 th if that area does the same trick and hold the index from moving lower this may attract the bulls back into the field and the price could get lifted to the 3275 hurdle again a break of which may open the way to the 3286 barrier marked by the today s high on the cash index if the buying is still strong this could help the index to overcome that barrier and target the all time high which is at around 3296 level alternatively if the previously discussed 3260 support area fails to withstand the bear pressure its break may lead the index to an even larger correction to the 3252 hurdle which is an intraday swing low of january 8 th for us to get comfortable with further declines we would like to see a price drop below that hurdle which may attract even more sellers and help them push the s p 500 even lower we will then aim for the 3237 obstacle a break of which might set the stage for a test of the 3222 level marked by an intraday swing low of january 8 th not far from there the index could test the aforementioned upside line which may provide additional support chf the main g10 gainer as us adds switzerland to manipulators watchlist back to the currencies apart from the subdued risk appetite the swiss franc may have received support from the us s decision to add switzerland to its watchlist of currency manipulators the reasoning is that the snb sells the franc in order to offset safe haven flows from trade disputes or other geopolitical risks however the snb denied that its interventions were intended to give its nation a trading advantage rather to safeguard inflation and its export dependent economy from an overvalued currency chf sight deposits at local banks which is a gauge of snb interventions have declined recently suggesting that the bank has been keeping its hands off the intervening button and the us s decision may discourage swiss officials further from stepping into the fx market this could prompt traders to increase their franc exposures and test how high they can drive it before the snb eventually decides to act usd chf technical outlook usd chf is still trading below its short term downside resistance line taken from the high of december 6 th but recently the pair got held by its key support area between the 0 9646 and 0 9665 levels in order to examine further declines we need to see a rate drop below the lower end of that support area hence why we will take a cautiously bearish approach for now if eventually we do see that break below the 0 9646 zone which is the lowest point of december this would confirm a forthcoming lower low and the pair could drift further down possibly aiming for the 0 9623 hurdle that hurdle marks the low of september 26 thof 2018 and it could initially provide a bit of support which may allow the rate to rebound slightly that said if usd chf struggles to get back above the 0 9665 barrier this may lead to another round of selling which could bring the rate back to the 0 9623 obstacle if this fails to withhold its break could open the door for a move to the 0 9580 level marked by the low of september 24 th 2018 for us to consider the upside ideally we would like to see a break of the previously mentioned downside line and the rate rising above the 0 9736 barrier which is the high of january 13 th this move might bring more buyers back to the table who could help the pair to move to the 0 9762 obstacle a break of which might clear the path to the 0 9795 level marked by the low of december 25 th as for the rest of today s events during the european trading we get sweden s cpis for december both the cpi and cpif rates are expected to have remained unchanged at 1 7 yoy and 1 8 yoy respectively but as usually we prefer to pay more attention to the core cpif rate which excludes energy in november that rate ticked up to 1 8 yoy from 1 7 at its december gathering the riksbank hiked rates to 0 noting that since the prior meeting developments have been broadly in line with its expectations and that the rate is expected to remain untouched in the coming years however they added that if the economic outlook and inflation prospects were to change monetary policy may need to be adjusted if indeed inflation rates stay unchanged as expected this would confirm officials view that rates are likely to stay stable for the foreseeable future from germany we get the annual gdp for 2019 which is expected to have slowed to 0 60 from 1 60 in 2018 while from the eurozone as a whole we have the industrial production for november which is forecast to have rebounded 0 4 mom from 0 5 driving the yoy rate up to 1 1 from 2 2 the bloc s trade balance is also coming out with the surplus expected to have declined to eur 17 0bn from 28 0bn the uk cpis for december are also coming out with both the headline and core rates expected to have remained unchanged at 1 5 yoy and 1 7 yoy respectively below the boe s target of 2 combined with monday s soft data inflation below the boe s objective may prompt policymakers to bring their hands closer to the cut button from the us we get the ppis for december the headline rate is forecast to have risen to 1 3 yoy from 1 1 while the core one is anticipated to have held steady at 1 3 yoy the new york empire state manufacturing index for january is also coming out and is expected to have risen somewhat to 3 55 from 3 50 the beige book is due to be released as well with regards to the energy market the eia report on crude oil inventories for last week is coming out expectations are for a 0 474mn barrels slide after a 1 164mn barrels increase the week before that said bearing in mind that yesterday the api report showed a 1 100mn increase we would consider the risks to the eia report as tilted to the upside we also have three

when today friday february 7 2020 where cnbc s squawk on the street live from washington d c the following is the unofficial transcript of a first on cnbc interview with vice president mike pence and cnbc s wilfred frost on cnbc s squawk on the street m f 9am 11am today friday february 7th the following is a link to video of the interview on cnbc com all references must be sourced to cnbc sara eisen let s get over to what looks like a foggy looking washington d c our wilfred frost is at the white house along with the vice president wilfred take it away wilfred frost sara good morning to you thank you very much and our thanks in particular to the vice president for having us here today it s a pleasure to be here vice president mike pence welcome to the white house wilf wilfred frost well what a week it s been great timing to be here when you consider the the mayhem of iowa for the democrats the success of the state of the union the impeachment acquittal and today s yet again strong jobs number that we re going to dive into in more detail what s the mood like here in the white house vice president mike pence well look this has been a great week for america it s been a great week for president donald trump thanks to the president s leadership we re in the middle of a booming american economy we ve rebuilt our military we appointed a record number of judges to our federal courts of appeals we are respected in the world again the senate acquitted the president of the united states and now a job report that reflects not only 225 000 jobs but people coming into the workforce the labor participation rate tells the story the american people see that thanks to the president s leadership cutting taxes rolling back regulation unleashing american energy but also securing historic trade deals the usmca phase one with china this economy is working for working americans and we ve seen more than three and a half million people come into the workforce and that s reflected in that report today so it s a great week for america and it s a great tribute to the leadership and the vision of president donald trump wilfred frost and jobs and unemployment is that top of the list for you mr vice president most important vice president mike pence well i think for this president it s always about the safety and security of the american people first that s why in the last month you saw the president take decisive action to respond to violence one american life was lost at the hands of iranian backed militias this president ordered airstrikes on five militia air bases in iraq first time in 10 years and then when we had the opportunity to take out the most dangerous terrorists in the world qassem soleimani this president acted without hesitation and even after the missile strike by iran their response no american casualties iran is standing down and the news reports today that we took out another terrorist leader in yemen so it s always first about national security and the safety of the american people the president s strong action on the coronavirus to protect the health the american people but right after that here in these hallways wilf you re absolutely right it s about jobs jobs jobs and after eight years of the last administration that thought we can tax and borrow and bail our way back to a growing economy this president put common sense american principles into work he used what he in davos called the american model the free market model of less taxes less regulation more affordable energy and fair trade and the american economy is booming wilfred frost the economy certainly the numbers are very strong and the unemployment numbers in particular very impressive i wonder whether you feel though a little bit of the gloss of that impressiveness needs to be removed because of the deficit the size of the deficit and the direction that it s heading vice president mike pence well we saw in the last administration a doubling of the national debt but we also saw an american economy that wasn t growing by more than 2 it was the slowest economic recovery since the great depression and the president came into office and he said first and foremost we have to restore growth that s how we will deal with the long term fiscal challenges facing our country and deficits and debt are right in line but it s first about getting this economy moving again and we really do believe the trajectory of this economy we re going to end the next year in the 3 range which is what president trump said back on the campaign trail in 2016 and day after day advancing the policies that he promised the american people against unprecedented resistance and obstruction by the democrats on capitol hill it has been delivering and why this economy is working for every american especially wilf for working americans you know as i travel around the country i go to meetings large and small and i have hardworking americans coming up to me every day and just saying tell the president we appreciate what he s doing it s making a difference in our community people are going back to work and this really is a blue collar boom wilfred frost deficit as a percentage of gdp though has ticked up each year this first term would you like to see it as a focus for the second term if you will want to change the direction of that vice president mike pence well i think the president has been very clear and we ve sharpened our pencils on our budgets and we ll continue to do that and in a second term we ll continue to address those issues but president trump really believes that the real long term solution to the fiscal challenges in washington d c is making sure that the budget of every american is growing and you know real income after tax income for working families has actually increased by 5 000 a year in the last three years so the president s going to stay focused on a growing american economy and once we get this economy rolling we re going to continue to hold congress to account and we re going to work real hard not just to get president donald trump four more years in the white house but we re going to make sure that we have a republican senate and a republican house to keep america growing and to deal with those long term fiscal challenges wilfred frost let s talk about the stock market mr vice president record highs of the clothes again yesterday and clearly another example of the strong economy this morning is there a belief here in the white house that the two are very closely linked vice president mike pence well we within the stock market is just a reflection of consumer confidence and the confidence of the of investors around america you know the market actually was up over 1000 points over the last several days and i think that that s all a reflection of the fact that everything president trump said in the state of the union address is being reflected all across the country businesses large and small are feeling it and we re seeing growth in this economy and and i think you have to you have to give the president s strong stand on trade a lot of credit for that as well he drove a hard bargain we renegotiated our trading relationship with canada and mexico the usmca is now signed into law we think it s going to create hundreds of thousands of jobs and we think very soon it s also going to be reflected in this economy the phase one deal with china and negotiations go on to deal with some of the larger structural issues we think is also going to greatly benefit not just agriculture but it s going to benefit businesses as we ve begun to deal with some of those structural issues intellectual property forced technology transfers the president spoke to president xi last night and those discussions are ongoing even as china deals with the heartbreaking crisis of coronavirus wilfred frost how have you felt that china has dealt with that coronavirus and have you been a little more reserved perhaps on criticism of the initial sharing of information because of the warmer relationship off the back of phase one vice president mike pence well we think that china has demonstrated an unprecedented level of transparency and not just with the united states but with the world community and in their discussion last night the president and president xi discussed increased cooperation they discussed the role of the world health organization i mean the loss of life the coronavirus that is impacting people of china and fortunately a small number of people in the united states to date is heartbreaking but we stand ready to work with china to provide them any and all support the president made that clear last night to president xi wilfred frost 11 americans among the 61 diagnosed on the cruise ship off the coast of japan that that aside are you confident that the threat of this virus as it relates to americans here has peaked and is now declining vice president mike pence well out of an abundance of caution the president took unprecedented steps to end airline travel and limit access from china to the united states and we were encouraged by the results were encouraged by the numbers but we met late yesterday with leaders from the cdc we got the latest briefing our team is going to continue to lean into that we think that the threat here in the united states remains fairly low because of president trump s decisive action again putting the health and safety of the american people first but last night president trump also made it clear that the united states of america is ready willing and able to deploy resources with the world health organization to help china address this crisis wilfred frost let s pivot back to the trade deal with china mr vice president you and the president had been very critical in the passing of u s companies that have outsourced their production to china too readily or sought to make sales there in a tradeoff for access or information does the phase one trade deal now mean that us companies can go all out again to seek profits in china vice president mike pence well the phase one trade deal gave some tariff relief but it was only the tariffs that have been imposed since last fall i mean the vast majority of our tariffs remain in place with and that s because we have serious and long term issues that still need to be addressed the president s made that very very clear with president xi and with all of our negotiators we think that it s a work in progress but look the president said early in this administration we arrived half of our international trade deficit was with china it was extraordinary but i remember in early meetings the president the president sat down with chinese officials liu he the first time that he was in the oval office and spoke to the president and he said look the era of economic surrender is over i don t i don t want to talk about what happened in the past the president s been openly critical of the policies of past administrations in both parties but we re beginning to see china s step up be willing to take steps in fact the announcement yesterday of 75 billion in tariff relief wasn t even a part of the phase one trade deal we think it gives evidence that that china is beginning to step forward take the actions necessary but we re going to continue to stand firm the american people can be confident the president is going to continue to put american workers american jobs first we re going to stand strong on china and we re going to continue to insist that china adopt not only the more open market for u s goods but also that they adopt the kind of structural reforms that have threatened intellectual property resulted in intellectual property theft forced technology transfer those changes have to happen for us to truly have fair and reciprocal relationship with china in the long term wilfred frost how disappointed were you mr vice president that the british decided to grant access to huawei to that 5g network vice president mike pence well i think the president s been very clear secretary of state pompeo reiterated it this week the united states is very disappointed that the united kingdom has decided to go forward with huawei for a portion of their information wilfred frost one report suggested the president was apoplectic with fury is the gist of that accurate vice president mike pence well i never never comment on the president s private conversations with me or for others but we were profoundly disappointed because look at when i went at the president s direction in september i met with prime minister johnson i told him the moment the uk is out of brexit we were willing to begin to negotiate a free trade arrangement with the uk and now the uk is out of brexit our teams have begun that process to work but we just don t believe that that utilizing the assets the technology of huawei is consistent with the security or privacy interest of the uk of the united states and it remains a real issue between our two countries wilfred frost is it a deal breaker on a trade deal vice president mike pence well we ll see we ll see if it is but we ll continue to make it very very clear the president has a strong relationship with prime minister johnson and we are anxious to build our economic ties but we have made it clear to the prime minister johnson and to officials in the uk that we that as we expand opportunities to build out 5g across this country the fcc just announced a new arrangement that we think is going to catalyze the expansion of 5g technology we want to see we want to see our companies meet the needs in the united states and uk and among all of our allies without the compromise of privacy and the compromise of security that necessarily comes with huawei and control by the chinese communist party wilfred frost on that note the attorney general said yesterday the u s should invest in companies like ericsson and nokia to help them catch up with huawei in terms of 5g technology is that is that a realistic option in the short term vice president mike pence we have great respect for attorney general barr but we believe the best way forward is what ajit pai announced just over the last several days the fcc has a plan for dealing with the spectrum that we think is going to make 5g much more rapidly available all across the country and that s the plan the president has endorsed and will be carrying forward we can we can expand 5g especially expand 5g to rural areas of this country by using the power of the free market and american companies and the united states and our allies around the world can meet those needs ourselves wilfred frost one quick final question on the events of this week mr vice president which i wanted to focus on was on senator romney decided to vote against the president he said he felt it was his duty to do so and he said quote he had an inescapable conviction that my oath before god demanded it clearly you disagreed with his vote can you forgive his motivation vice president mike pence well look i don t question his faith i just question his judgment we couldn t be more grateful for all the members of the house and the senate who not only stood by president trump and stood by the presidency stood by the constitution and rejected this partisan impeachment saw it for what it was look at the facts and acquitted the president of the united states this week in the united states senate you saw the president yesterday thanking those individual members and we will stay focused on the gratitude that this president this administration feels for all those who saw through this partisan impeachment the sham investigation sorry for what it was but the remarkable thing when you think about the progress that the president celebrated in the state of the union address 225 000 jobs in the january report that came out today this president did all of that over the last three years in the midst of unprecedented obstruction resistance continuous investigations recriminations but as i said just an hour after the acquittal was voted in the senate the good news is it s over america and the president is right back to work today just as he s been every day of this administration working for a stronger more prosperous america wilfred frost well mr vice president congratulations on another strong jobs number and thank you very much for having me today for more

as markets enjoy a bit of bounce back from the panic selling triggered by the outbreak of the deadly coronavirus traders may struggle to keep the momentum going over the next seven days as things quieten down a little on the data front industrial production numbers out of the eurozone the united states and the united kingdom will be the main release though the focus will be on fourth quarter gdp estimates for the uk and on the latest retail sales figures in the us the reserve bank of new zealand will be the only central bank to hold a policy meeting but is unlikely to excite as it will probably keep rates on hold one eye on spread of coronavirus china s central bank may have managed to stabilize the markets by injecting billions of dollars into the financial system but investors will still be keeping a close watch on how successful authorities are in curbing the spread of the coronavirus the longer it takes to bring the situation under control the longer many businesses will remain shut hence the bigger the disruption to the domestic economy and to global supply chains although the government has pledged to provide more support to help the sectors most hit by the endemic the relief rally may dwindle once a clearer picture starts to emerge of the full damage of the virus on the economy with the virus outbreak attracting all the attention chinese consumer and producer price data for january due on monday are unlikely to draw much interest rbnz meets but no change in policy expected with a pickup in both gdp growth and inflation at the end of 2019 the rbnz has little reason to ease policy over the next few months having cut the official cash rate by 75 basis points in the past year however given new headwinds such as the coronavirus and australian bushfires that are likely to slow growth in china and australia both close trading partners of new zealand the rbnz may adopt a more cautious tone should investors detect a tinge more dovish language than anticipated in the central bank s announcement and quarterly monetary policy statement on wednesday the new zealand dollar could come under the firing line the kiwi steadied somewhat this week having been on the slide since the start of the year but its inability to rebound along with risk assets suggests traders don t think the rbnz is done cutting rates just yet euro unable to catch a break recent data out of the eurozone has been mostly positive and point to a soft rebound in economic activity at the turn of the year however the euro hasn t been able to capitalize on the improving economic picture and is stuck near four month lows versus the dollar next week s releases will probably provide a further indication that the worse may be over the region though this may not be enough to put a floor under the single currency the eurozone sentix index for february will kick off the week on monday followed by december industrial production figures on wednesday on friday the second estimate of fourth quarter gdp growth is due along with quarterly employment numbers no revision is expected to the flash gdp reading of 0 1 quarterly growth uk growth likely stagnated in q4 tuesday will be a busy day for uk indicators with a flurry of releases that will include the first estimate of gdp growth in the final three months of 2019 as well as industrial output and trade figures for december with growth recovering strongly in january following the decisive election outcome in december the reports may be viewed as out of date and therefore not stir much of a response in the pound the bank of england has already put more weight on the latest pmis which jumped sharply in january dissuading policymakers from cutting interest rates at their policy meeting last week still the data should reveal the full scale of the economic paralysis brought on by the political turmoil in the run up to the december 12 vote as well as any signs of a late turnaround in output worse than expected numbers could slightly push up the odds of a boe rate cut in the coming months though much of the focus for the uk economy will now be on hard data for january can us inflation and retail sales extend the dollar s bullish run there s been no shortage of upbeat data coming out of the us lately with both the ism manufacturing and non manufacturing pmis beating forecasts and wall street continuing its ascent into record territory next week s reports are not expected to spoil this rosy backdrop ensuring that the us dollar remains king of the fx market first up are the jolts job openings on tuesday and the consumer price index cpi will follow on thursday cpi inflation has been diverging from pce inflation the fed s preferred inflation metric in recent months and the headline rate is forecast to have edged up further in january to 2 4 year on year however the core rate is expected to have moderated slightly to 2 2 y y while a positive surprise wouldn t necessarily mean policymakers would turn more wary about a build up in inflationary pressures it would nevertheless underline the relative robustness of the us economy compared to its peers and maintain upside pressure on the greenback even more important will be the january retail sales figures on friday which are seen as a reliable barometer of consumer spending retail sales are forecast to have increased by 0 3 month on month in january the same pace as in the prior month a miss in the retail sales numbers would pose a major downside risk for the dollar given the recent strong gains as it would raise concerns about the health of the us consumer amid a weak global economic environment other data to watch on friday are industrial production for january and the university of michigan s preliminary consumer sentiment reading for february apart from the data an appearance by federal reserve chief jerome powell in congress may act as another focal point for the dollar powell is tentatively scheduled to testify in his semi annual congressional hearing on tuesday and wednesday and investors will be curious to see how he balances his outlook with rising risks from the coronavirus to consider on the one hand and a pickup in domestic growth on the other
us may grow moderately despite investment slump published fri 7 feb 2020 6 13 pm last updated fri 7 feb 2020 8 17 pm us job growth accelerated in january with unseasonably mild temperatures boosting hiring in weather sensitive sectors indicating the economy will probably continue to grow moderately despite a deepening slump in business investment the labour department s closely watched monthly employment report on friday however showed the economy created 514 000 fewer jobs between april 2018 and march 2019 than originally estimated the biggest downgrade to payrolls over a 12 month period since 2009 suggests job growth could significantly slow down this year strong job creation and firming wage growth in january provided reassurance that the record long economic expansion still has room to run said lydia boussour a senior us economist at oxford economics in new york but this latest health report also points to a maturing labour market benchmark revisions indicate this labour market isn t as youthful as it has pretended to be over the last two years nonfarm payrolls increased by 225 000 jobs last month with employment at construction sites increasing by the most in a year amid milder than normal temperatures the government s survey of establishments showed there were also strong gains in hiring in the transportation and warehousing industry economists polled by reuters had forecast payrolls would rise by 160 000 jobs in january data for november and december was revised to show 7 000 more jobs created than previously reported job growth in january exceeded the monthly average of 175 000 in 2019 but employment gains are expected to slow in february as the coronavirus which has killed hundreds in china and infected thousands globally disrupts supply chains especially for technology companies such as apple the annual benchmark revisions to payrolls could attract attention amid concerns the labour department s bureau of labor statistics which compiles the employment data may not be fully capturing the impact on payrolls of president donald trump s 19 month trade war with china which has contributed to the longest downturn in business investment since 2009 the downward revision in the level of employment suggests the government s birth death model which it uses to calculate the net number of jobs from new business and closings is faulty economists say payrolls have tended to be overstated when the trend in growth is weakening they say the downward revisions could impact financial markets assessments of the labor market job gains in february 2019 were slashed down to 1 000 from the originally estimated 56 000 the slowdown in job growth is blamed on worker shortages and ebbing demand for labour even though employment growth has slowed the pace remains well above the 100 000 jobs per month needed to keep up with growth in the working age population us stock index futures pared losses after the release of the data while the us dollar gained against the yen and euro prices of us treasuries were trading higher unemployment rate rises the government also introduced updated population estimates to its smaller household survey data including employment and labor force participation the unemployment rate is calculated from the household survey the new population controls meant that the january unemployment rate and other measures derived from the household survey will not be directly comparable to december data the government however provided adjusted data which showed the unemployment rate rising one tenth of a percentage point to 3 6 per cent in january a broader measure of unemployment which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part time because they cannot find full time employment increased to 6 9 per cent from 6 7 per cent in december which was the lowest since the series started in 1994 the labor force participation rate or the proportion of working age americans who have a job or are looking for one rose two tenths of a percentage point to 63 4 per cent last month the highest since june 2013 the tightening labor market is steadily driving up wages average hourly earnings increased seven cents or 0 2 per cent last month after gaining 0 1 per cent in december that lifted the annual increase in wages to 3 1 per cent in january from 3 0 per cent in december the average workweek was 34 3 hours for a third straight month in january federal reserve chair jerome powell said last month the united states low labor force participation relative to those of other advanced economies represents more labor supply and it may be holding down wages still wage growth is probably enough to support a decent pace of consumer spending and keep the economy chugging along the economy grew 2 3 per cent in 2019 the slowest performance in three years after logging 2 9 per cent growth in 2018 growth this year is seen around 2 per cent just above the 1 8 per cent that economists say is the speed at which the economy can grow over a long period without igniting inflation the construction industry added 44 000 jobs in january the largest since january 2019 after payrolls increased by 11 000 in december employment in the transportation and warehousing industry accelerated by 28 000 driven by gains in the hiring of couriers and messengers payrolls in the leisure and hospitality sector increased by 36 000 jobs healthcare and social assistance employment rose by 47 200 jobs there were also increases in hiring in the professional and business services and wholesale trade industries but manufacturing employment declined by 12 000 jobs after falling by 5 000 in december the industry has been the hardest hit by the us china trade war though washington and beijing signed a phase 1 trade deal last month us tariffs on 360 billion of chinese imports about two thirds of the total remained in place manufacturing is also being squeezed by boeing s suspension last month of production of its troubled 737 max jetliner boeing s biggest supplier spirit aerosystems holdings inc said last month it planned to lay off more than 20 per cent of the workforce at its facility in wichita kansas because of the 737 max production suspension the mining and logging industry added no jobs last month while retail payrolls dropped 8 300 further job losses are likely as macy s announced layoffs and closures this week government payrolls rose by 19 000 jobs in january with some hiring for the 2020 decennial census reuters

the fashion house said the outbreak of coronavirus in china is having a negative effect on demand for its luxury goods burberry said 24 of its 64 stores on the chinese mainland are closed with the remaining stores experiencing a significant decline in customer visits despite the spending patterns of chinese customers across europe not being affected burberry said it expects the situation to worsen due to widening travel restrictions the company noted that the benefit of actions taken to mitigate the negative impact will be limited due to the proximity to the end of its financial year in march analysts at the share centre said while burberry was relatively unscathed from the period of protests and political unrest in hong kong it s apparent there is no escaping the impact of the coronavirus as parts of the country are virtually shut down it was always going to be the case that a luxury goods company with so much exposure to the far east would feel the impact and investors should appreciate burberry s openness on the matter while no financial impact assessment has been released by management investors should brace themselves for a material hit to full year profits

and founder thanks john and good afternoon everyone thank you for joining us today for our first earnings call as a public company we are excited to share our fiscal second quarter results as well as an overview of our business i would like to start by thanking our customers strategic partners long term and new shareholders for supporting our mission and i want to extend a special thank you to all bill com employees who work hard delivering value for customers every day our success is dependent on their passion and dedication since this is our first quarter as a public company and many of you may be new to our story i will spend a few minutes introducing bill com then i will provide an overview of our fiscal second quarter results discuss a few highlights for the quarter and finally i ll turn the call over to john to cover our financial results in greater detail he ll also be providing you with our fiscal third quarter and full year outlook before opening the call for q a as a fourth generation entrepreneur i have a deep appreciation for the challenges associated with running a small business i vividly remember the pain of managing the back office of paycycle the first company i founded i was drowning in paper handling bills and invoices digging through filing cabinets to locate contracts and looking for answers by leaving sticky notes all over the place i realized that i was managing the back office no differently than my grandfather had 60 years earlier i hadn t started my own business to spend my time chasing people and paper this was the early 2000s and i saw that the web was going to change everything i sensed that the web could solve the mess i and many other small and midsized businesses smbs were experiencing that s why i started bill com to clean up the back office mess and give back valuable time to smbs so they can focus on what matters most to them customers use our cloud platform to generate and process invoices streamline approvals send and receive payments sync to their accounting system and manage their cash bill com weaves software and payments together and the result is a more efficient and reliable financial operation we have built sophisticated integrations with popular accounting software solutions financial institutions and payment processors enabling our customers to connect these mission critical services seamlessly as a result we become central to an smb s accounts payable and accounts receivable operation as evidenced by our customers electronically exchanging more than 8 000 messages per day approving more than 2 4 million bills per month and storing almost 45 million documents per year as of june 30 2019 today tens of thousands of customers trust our platform to manage their financial workflows and process their payments which totaled billions of dollars annually and our platform extends well beyond our customers in fact as of the end of our last fiscal year we had over 1 8 million network members members consist of our customers as well as their suppliers and clients that collaborate on our platform in exchange electronic payments hence our mission we make it simple to connect and do business now that i provided a short overview of who we are i d like to spend a few minutes talking about our opportunity smbs represent a significant and critical component of the u s economy smbs are businesses with fewer than 500 total employees as defined by the small business administration in 2018 there were approximately 30 million smbs in the united states which provided employment for over 47 of all u s workers this group was responsible for a third of goods traded by value while 24 million of these smbs are sole providers we focus on serving the over 6 million firms with employees smbs large enough to have employees tend to have a greater need for more advanced accounts payable and accounts receivable processes importantly these smbs remain largely underserved by current software solutions according to idc in 2019 small and midsized businesses are planning to spend approximately 65 billion on software in the u s alone we believe that we are well positioned to capture some of that spend we estimate the annual addressable market for services we offer today to be 9 billion domestically and 30 billion globally we derived these estimates by multiplying our average fiscal 2019 revenue per customer of 1 500 by each of the 6 million domestic employer firms and the 20 million small and medium size businesses worldwide in addition to the software opportunity our platform enables us to pursue a large and growing payments opportunity according to the 2018 mastercard report north american companies make approximately 25 trillion of business to business payments annually and according to deloitte the u s market for smb payments is expected to exceed 9 trillion in 2020 and finally over 90 of smb still rely on paper checks according to a survey by the smb technology adoption index as more smbs move to digital payments we believe bill com is well positioned to capitalize on this evolution smb span all industries and geographies we ve developed a powerful go to market strategy that enables us to reach them wherever they are in a cost effective manner our direct to smb strategy leverages digital customer acquisition tools and is supported by an efficient inside sales team we build awareness through industry trade shows and word of mouth in 2019 customer survey half of new customer responses indicated they first became aware of us because they used our platform at a prior company or heard about us through a colleague in addition new smbs are continually being introduced to our platform s value proposition as they pay and get paid we also reach prospective customers through partners that smbs trust the most accounting firms financial institutions and accounting software companies let s start with accounting firms since our inception we have focused on helping accounting firms better manage and support their clients our accountant specific tools help firms generate revenue within their consulting practice establish a competitive advantage and better retain their smb clients with our platform the same accounting firm staff can serve more clients more strategically and serve them more profitably we partner with more than 70 of the top 100 accounting firms in the u s and enable an additional 4 000 firms across the country to deliver more value to their customers every day second we partner with financial institutions we are integrated with several of the largest financial institutions in the u s including bank of america j p morgan chase and american express by working with bill com our financial institution partners can provide their customers with many of the benefits realized by our directly acquired customers these partners embed our platform typically on a white label basis into their online banking solutions finally smbs trust their accounting software providers bill com partners with the leading accounting software providers for smbs including quickbooks and quickbooks online from intuit oracle netsuite sage intacct and xero our partnership with intuit is unique because it includes not only our two way sync functionality but also a fully embedded experience inside of quickbooks online which was recently enhanced to include cross border payments in summary we are pleased with the breadth and diversity of our distribution channel strategy no partner is overrepresented within our business and in fact in fy 19 no single partner constituted over 2 5 of total revenue with that background on the business i would like to briefly cover our fiscal second quarter financial results we delivered another quarter of solid performance ending with approximately 86 000 customers core revenue which we define as subscription plus transaction revenue grew by 61 in the quarter versus the same period in the prior year the total revenue in the quarter grew by 50 year over year to 39 1 million we also delivered non gaap gross margins of 78 in the quarter we generated a non gaap operating loss of 4 5 million reflecting the investments we are making to build out our platform and in our go to market distribution channels john will discuss our financial results for the quarter in greater detail in a few minutes but first i d like to give you a sense of the types of customers we serve one of my favorite examples is niche a modern lighting company founded by jeremy pyles when i talked to jeremy about why he uses bill com he summarized by saying i d like to pay people on time i d like to treat my vendors fairly this requires knowing answers to questions like what bills are due are they approved who ordered this stuff did i know about this did we even receive it you may have heard what bill com did for jeremy from our previous presentations our platform added a level of process and control that was missing he was able to offload routine tasks while still being confident that no one could make payments without him giving final approval bill com gave him the ability to delegate with confidence solving the biggest challenge a small business owner has relinquishing control over the back office details so that he could focus on the reason he started his business to design and make unique and beautiful glass light fixtures jeremy s experience was exactly the same as mine at paycycle everything was great in the front office but the back office needed reinvention niche is just one example of how our platform changes the way an smb operates we are committed to continually improving our customers experience on our platform as an example during the quarter we extended each of our cross border offering we now support payments to over 130 countries in over 100 currencies with bill com customers benefit from using the same workflow and system of record for both domestic and international payments including syncing with leading accounting software here is what one of our customers jurie victor director of finance and accounting at spikeball said about the impact of our new cross border service on his organization in 2018 we paid 1 800 bills to bill com a 63 increase over the previous year without bill com we would have had to hire at least one more full time accounts payable person to print out all of those invoices and manually cut checks bill com also enables us to pay international suppliers given the number of bills we pay as well as the currency amount it took a lot of administrative time for the complex tax required when paying through banks with bill com it s a one click solution it s a lifesaver a second example of the expansion of our platform that i d like to showcase is how we continue to leverage our ai capabilities to improve the customer experience in addition to automatically reading incoming bills to pull out critical invoice information and eliminate manual data entry we are now able to detect international bank account details and currency denominations automatically we use this information within the ap workflow to speed the processing of the bill and make an electronic payment in the vendor s preferred local currency this enables us to make the processing and payment of an international invoice as easy as a domestic one i d now like to focus on recapping our growth strategy we see five major opportunities to drive continued growth first we will focus on acquiring new customers we believe there is an opportunity to further invest in sales and marketing activities to drive awareness and adoption of our platform by new customers our expanding ecosystem of strategic partners and accounting firms also provides us with a strong pipeline of smb sign ups second we will seek to increase adoption by existing customers as we become more integral to smb s back office we increased the number of our customers employees who become regular users over time we also typically increase the number of payments processed per customer as well as adoption of new products third we will continue to focus on growing the number of network members as customers connect with their suppliers and clients through our platform our network member expands as companies are added to our network we leverage our data algorithms to present more targeted network recommendations to our customers with a single click our customers can then accept these recommendations and instantly do business with these network members this creates an organic flywheel effect that improves the reach and visibility of our platform and powers our customer acquisition efforts fourth we will expand our platform capabilities we continue to invest in r d to enhance the breadth and depth of our platform as an example to better serve larger smbs those with policies that require a more formal procurement process prior to a purchase we have enabled purchase order support that seamlessly syncs with the customers accounting software in addition we continue to improve our ai engine which enables us to help our customers manage end to end financial workflows better predict cash flow needs and deliver better network recommendations fifth we plan to expand internationally i ve already mentioned our cross border payment service expansion looking ahead over the longer term we will seek to further extend our network and engage with customers worldwide according to mastercard s business payments 2022 white paper global business to business noncash payments are expected to increase at a compound average growth rate of 6 5 through 2020 reaching 122 4 billion transactions this is a significant opportunity that we believe bill com s platform is well suited to serve this is the beginning of our life as a public company and we believe the opportunity ahead grows every day we are still in the early stages of enabling smbs to automate their financial operations and we look forward to continuing our mission to make it simple to connect and do business now i ll turn the call over to john to discuss our financials in more detail john john rettig chief financial officer thanks rené today i will provide a brief overview of our fiscal second quarter 2020 financial results and discuss guidance for our fiscal third quarter and full year fiscal 2020 as a quick reminder today s discussion includes non gaap financial measures please refer to the tables in our earnings release for a reconciliation from non gaap to the most directly comparable gaap financial measure before i discuss quarterly financials let me remind you of our financial model and drivers we drive revenue from three areas subscription fees transaction fees and float subscription and transaction fees are what we call core revenue the majority of our core revenue is derived from subscriptions which are based on a fixed monthly or annual rate per user with pricing based primarily on the features and functionality a user needs access to transaction revenue is comprised of transaction fees that are charged on a fixed or variable rate per transaction basis most of our transaction revenue comes from repeat payments where customers are paying or being paid by the same suppliers or clients as in the preceding three months this really illustrates the stickiness of our platform both subscriptions and transactions are highly recurring providing us with strong visibility into revenue and we believe core revenue is the best indicator of our revenue performance as a company our third revenue stream is float which appears in our income statement as interest on funds held for customers float is an attractive high margin revenue stream derived from the payment volume on our platform when we process payment transactions the funds flow through our bank accounts float is earned from interest bearing deposit accounts certificates of deposit money market funds commercial paper and u s treasury securities we earned interest from the time customers initiate transactions on our platform until they clear our bank accounts and are received by the payee we are authorized to process payments through our bank accounts because we are a licensed money transmitter in all u s states that require licenses by leveraging our bank accounts we can utilize treasury management services such as positive pay to protect our customers from fraud our sophisticated payment capabilities and well established regulatory compliance programs are a major part of our differentiation from other software companies float revenue fluctuates depending upon the amount and duration of customer funds held as well as our yield on customer funds invested which is in turn influenced by market interest rates and our investment strategies with that backdrop let me turn to our second quarter key metrics we ended the quarter with 85 900 customers representing year over year growth of 20 our customers leverage our platform to connect with our 1 8 million network members as rené mentioned earlier we view this network as a valuable asset to target prospects for paid services in the future during the quarter we processed 24 8 billion in total payment volume on our platform an increase of 41 over q2 of the prior year and over 6 2 million payment transactions representing an increase of 29 year over year in terms of additional metrics that we disclosed in our s 1 such as net dollar based retention rate and customer churn we plan on updating you with these metrics on an annual cadence at the end of each fiscal year we delivered strong financial results in q2 with solid year over year growth in total and core revenue as well as strong non gaap gross margins total revenue for q2 was 39 1 million representing growth of 50 from q2 19 our total revenue growth was driven mainly by the strength of our core revenue which accelerated in q2 to 33 million or 61 year over year growth the strength in core revenue was driven by increases in the number of customers we serve and growth in revenue per customer to break down our core revenue subscription revenue increased to 19 9 million up from 14 4 million in q2 of last year representing an increase of 39 year over year this growth was driven by the increase in customers and the average subscription revenue per customer transaction revenue increased to 13 1 million up from 6 million in q2 of last year an increase of 114 year over year driven by increased adoption of new product offerings and increase in the number of transactions processed from our growing customer base and the mix of transactions shifting to variable price products the acceleration in transaction revenue growth in q1 and q2 of this fiscal year was bolstered by the launch of our new variable price transaction offerings namely cross border and virtual card payments which we rolled out in the prior year as we pass the anniversary of the early launch days of these new solutions we expect more challenging comparisons ahead and lower growth rates going forward moving on to float revenue we delivered 6 1 million in float revenue in q2 compared to 5 6 million in the second quarter of last year growth of 10 year over year float revenue growth was a result of the increase in customer funds in transit while payment transactions were clearing but was partially offset by the cumulative 75 basis points reduction in the fed funds rate since june 2019 that lowered our yield from the year ago quarter our non gaap gross margin for the quarter was 78 an increase of 220 basis points over q2 19 s non gaap gross margin of 75 8 the increase was driven primarily by the adoption of new product offerings and growth in float revenue on a year over year basis over the long term we expect non gaap gross margins to be in the 75 to 78 range subject to the prevailing interest rate environment in the near term we anticipate gross margins toward the upper end of our range turning to operating expenses r d expense was 12 million for the quarter or 31 of revenue up from 25 in q2 of last year the increase was due primarily to the hiring of additional engineering and product management talent r d is an important investment area as we extend the capabilities of our platform to leverage the growth opportunities that rené covered and we believe these investments will create a longer runway of growth and competitive differentiation sales and marketing expenses were 11 7 million or 30 of revenue in q2 an increase from 28 of revenue in the prior year s quarter given our large tam and efficient customer acquisition economics you can expect us to continue to invest in sales and marketing initiatives to support fiscal 2020 and beyond to drive continued market momentum g a expenses were 11 3 million or 29 of revenue up from 23 in q2 of fiscal 2019 our g a as a percentage of revenue is higher than some of our saas software peers because we incur expenses related to risk management and the regulatory requirements associated with our proprietary payment capabilities including cost to maintain money transmitter licenses as i mentioned earlier we believe that these investments differentiate bill com and create a competitive advantage for us during q2 we also incurred additional expenses related to our preparation to operate as a public company and some of these expenses will be ongoing we expect to achieve operating leverage in the g a as we scale the company over the long term our q2 non gaap operating loss was 4 5 million as we continue to make investments in our platform and go to market capabilities our non gaap net loss was 3 6 million or a loss of 0 06 per share based on 62 8 million basic weighted shares outstanding because we had a net loss on a gaap basis our diluted share count was the same as the basic share count for both gaap and non gaap eps calculations moving on to the balance sheet ending cash cash equivalents and short term investments were 383 million up from 157 6 million at the end of september 2019 reflecting the capital raised on our initial public offering in december which netted 225 5 million as of december 31 2019 we had approximately 1 5 billion in client funds on our balance sheet which was up slightly from the end of q1 due in part to total payment volume of 24 8 billion in the quarter we ended the quarter with 568 employees up from 544 on september 30 2019 now let s move to our fiscal third quarter and full fiscal year 2020 outlook for the third quarter of 2020 total revenue is expected to be in the range of 38 million to 38 7 million comprised of core revenue in the range of 33 2 million to 33 7 million and float revenue in the range of 4 8 million to 5 million we plan to increase our spending on go to market initiatives and r d investments including expanding the capabilities of our ai engine developing new payment products and building out the platform to support larger customers in addition we expect our g a spending to reflect the ongoing overhead associated with being a public company on the bottom line we expect to report a non gaap net loss in the range of 7 4 million to 6 7 million and a non gaap eps loss of 0 10 to 0 09 on a per share basis based on a share count of approximately 72 1 million basic weighted average shares for q3 for the full fiscal year 2020 total revenue is expected to be in the range of 150 3 million to 151 7 million core revenue is expected to be in the range of 129 million to 130 million and float revenue is expected to be in the range of 21 3 million to 21 7 million based in part on an assumption that the average fed funds rate will decline by 25 basis points in march 2020 we expect a non gaap net loss for fiscal 2020 in the range of 21 7 million to 20 3 million or on a per share basis a loss of 0 32 to 0 30 assuming basic weighted averages shares outstanding of 66 9 million for the full fiscal year we expect stock based compensation expense of approximately 5 million and 5 5 million in q3 and q4 of fiscal 2020 respectively moving on to our capital expenditure plans we filed an 8 k in early january after entering into an 11 year lease agreement at the end of december for a new headquarters in the bay area this brand new building will give us much needed expansion space to accommodate our new hires our preliminary estimate is that the net spend will be approximately 20 million for the facility build out over the next four quarters we also expect to spend an additional 2 million per quarter on other capital needs primarily related to our technology infrastructure to support our continued business expansion this equates to a total capex spend of 28 million over the next four quarters as it relates to timing we expect to spend roughly 7 million in q3 13 million in q4 and the balance in the first half of fiscal 2021 to close out on the guidance topic i d like to reiterate our financial management philosophy we are committed to building a profitable business over the long term but for the foreseeable future we will continue to prioritize revenue growth acquiring customers and platform enhancements over improving operating margins because we believe this gives us the most sustainable growth and competitive advantages as a business we will obviously monitor our performance closely and adjust our priorities as necessary if circumstances change now rené and i will open the call for your questions operator questions answers operator your first question comes from chris merwin from goldman sachs chris merwin goldman sachs analyst all right well thanks for taking my question and congrats to both on a phenomenal first quarter out of the gate in terms of my question i just wanted to ask you about the acceleration that you saw in core revenue in the quarter you ve got subscription revenue contributing to that as well as transaction revenue and i guess in particular on the transaction piece i m just wondering if you could comment about any uptake in adoption for some of those newer higher monetizing payment types like virtual card and cross border and how much of a driver those were in the acceleration we saw rene lacerte chairman chief executive officer and founder so thank you chris for the question and congratulations i appreciate that i think the success in the quarter really goes back to the overall platform that we built the platform is meant to serve obviously smbs of all sizes as well as to provide new services for them so we did see good adoption with international payments the addition of having more countries and currencies available helped us continue to drive adoption within our customer base we did see good adoption with the virtual card program that we re doing and we re just in the early days i mean the virtual card program has not even hit its first anniversary the international payment program is about 15 months old so we re really in the early days of understanding how to drive the adoption within our customer base but it really goes back to the stickiness of our platform the quality of the service that we provide being that one stop shop for our customers to manage all their financial operations and that s what drives everything home for us chris merwin goldman sachs analyst that s great and maybe just a follow up on tpv growth it looks like that was also really strong in the quarter in the low 40s and that was consistent with the growth we saw in the prior quarter it looks like the growth of customer funds held on balance sheet decelerated a little bit relative to that very strong tpv growth so can you just talk about the dynamic there are you seeing any same mix shift away from check again to those higher monetizing products and is that a dynamic that we should expect to persist going forward just in terms of the divergence and growth of those metrics john rettig chief financial officer yeah this is john good question chris we continue to see progress growing tpv in part because of our success in enabling customers to seamlessly transition from paper to electronic payments and we see that the more electronic payments that a customer does in our platform versus the legacy check payments the higher share of wallet we get from those customers and the more tpv growth that we see so we re continuing to make progress there in terms of the number of transactions on our platform we re up to about 59 electronic payments from 55 a year ago so that s continued progress we see pretty steady growth there in terms of the customer funds balance on our balance sheet we ve increased only slightly from the prior quarter and we believe that s mainly due to seasonality when we look at our internal numbers our average daily balances we actually had double digit growth but when you look at ending balances that appear on our balance sheet it s really subject to the business day year end activity with customers by trying to get payments completed and cleared and not really a reflection of any other underlying trend in the business chris merwin goldman sachs analyst great ok thanks very much and congrats again operator your next question comes from brad sills from bofa securities brad sills bank of america merrill lynch analyst great hey guys thanks for taking my question and congratulations on a nice quarter i wanted to ask about the extension of the platform you mentioned i think getting into more procurement type functionality can you remind us kind of where the payables functionality leaves off and where you re beginning now with some of this new functionality extending the ai platform into procurement rene lacerte chairman chief executive officer and founder great thank you brad for the question always good to hear your voice so the platform from the beginning when i first came up with the kind of the vision of what i wanted to do was to be able to help businesses manage that back office and so that back office includes a lot of paper includes document management includes workflow it includes collaboration internally and externally and building that platform enabled us to reach lots of smbs across the country that s the 86 000 approximately that we have what we found in the last couple of years is that a lot of those smbs happen to be good size companies midmarket companies and we define midmarket as 10 million to 100 million in revenue and so what we ve started doing is just because we like to listen to our customers and they re really important for us we ve been listening to their request for how to actually improve their experience and so one of the things they ve asked for is support on the purchase order opportunity so they have all the workflow to manage the payables side but when you re a larger company you re going to have a purchase order process and so we re just enabling them to be able to track those pos inside of bill com just like they track the payable and all the collaboration and the workflow they do across their teams so for us the extension is it s an important one but it s really not that much of a shift of what we ve been doing we listen to what our customers need every day and we add that functionality as we can brad sills bank of america merrill lynch analyst that s great and then obviously a nice quarter it sounds like in some of the variable priced offerings you mentioned cross border any commentary on virtual card and then my follow up question is on the investments you re talking about in payments what does the road map look like i guess to the extent you can share on some of the things you re investing in for your payments offering rene lacerte chairman chief executive officer and founder so the platform enables us to because we do the software component we kind of take the entire process that a business has we become this one stop shop kind of like jerry talked about in his quote about hey like we make it one click one click capability to manage those payments and so on the international payments there s opportunities for us to continue to make customers aware of our functionality now and to help them do that even easier like we did with the recent ai capabilities of reading the currency and international bank information off the invoice so on the virtual card our focus has been to first help that transition like john said earlier help that transition from paper to electronic we know that when customers have the ability to make electronic payments to happen faster they get recognized by their suppliers faster and so our focus in the initial launch and the initial year has been to focus on the check payments and converting those and so we are in early days we feel good about the progress we ve made there and we think there s lots of opportunity to continue to increase that conversion from paper to electronic and virtual card will be a significant part of that for us brad sills bank of america merrill lynch analyst that s great thanks so much rené rene lacerte chairman chief executive officer and founder thank you operator your next question comes from samad samana from jefferies samad samana jefferies analyst congrats on a great start to your track record as a public company john maybe first for you subscription revenue accelerated very nicely and it looked like both customer growth was strong and arpu i m curious just maybe on the customer side how the composition looked between the traditional audience you have and maybe larger and smaller customers and just how the quality of the customer at this quarter looked and then i have a follow up rene lacerte chairman chief executive officer and founder yes thanks samad we see really progress in customer growth and activity on our platform from customers across all segments as we ve talked about previously we see a lot of demand from larger customers rené mentioned out a minute ago we ve started to enhance our platform to serve some of the larger customers and their unique needs as well as we have a great track record with small customers and making it really simple for them to make the transition from paper to digital so we didn t see any new trends there historically the way our model works is that a customer starts with us and then over time they add more users as we further penetrate their organization and we get a larger share of their transactions and share of wallet that expansion within the organization happens organically it s something that customers do on a self service basis it s not driven by incremental sales and marketing expense that we have and what that leads to is increased subscription revenue growth from existing customers obviously in addition to new customers who are bringing new users on the platform samad samana jefferies analyst that s helpful and then maybe just as a follow up rené when i think about the financial institution partners i know that s a key part of the strategy any updates on maybe progress with some of the newer relationships and some of the expansions that you ve had there recently rene lacerte chairman chief executive officer and founder thank you samad yes i think going back to our multifaceted distribution approach of serving customers where we find them and that s important and integral for the massive market that s in front of us so the financial institution partners that we have j p morgan chase bank of america american express these are all critical these are white label solutions these are financial institutions that spend billions of dollars on r d and they ve chosen our platform to help their business customers move from the paper world to the digital world so the progress we see is that we continue to have lots of great conversations with our existing partners about doing more together and we continue to get plenty of opportunities to partner with more institutions so our focus is really on how do we extend the reach of our platform how do we make sure we do that so that customers get the benefit and having partners that are aligned strategically it s something that s important for us and that s how we focus on building out the network that we have with financial institution partners operator your next question comes from josh beck from keybanc josh beck keybanc capital markets analyst thanks for having me on the call really appreciate it i wanted just to ask at a high level were there some other areas of positive surprise versus your plan certainly you had some really good momentum it sounds like with the quality of customers that you re bringing on and certainly some new transactional products anything else just to call out high level there was area of positive surprise versus your plan rene lacerte chairman chief executive officer and founder well josh good to hear your voice entrepreneurs are optimists so there s lots of positive things so what i would say is that across the business i mean you see the results it really goes back to building a platform that s making it simple to connect and do business and so areas of non qualitative surprise as well we started managing our customers off of our old platform to a new integrated i would say user experience over the last year and so we continue to get good feedback on that we continue to make progress on getting that base migrated over and what that enables is more future progress and success in the future right so the example here is that the ability for us to and i did talk about this during the call that we have now separated out the engineering effort on the front end from the back end so what that means is we can iterate the user experience much faster as we get our customers on this platform so when we think about the cross border payments when we think about virtual cards when we think about other products that will launch in the future having that ability to kind of have access that s independent of the back end is really critical and so the answer i would give you is the positive surprise that i m happy with is that that s going well and i m happy with where we re at josh beck keybanc capital markets analyst ok very helpful and i know it s early i know it only been a couple of months since you ve gone public but are you feeling any change or noticing any change in branding awareness when you think about some of your channels i know you also did a rebranding campaign planned and worked out i know it s early but any early signals that you re getting there on awareness and marketing efficiency where that could go rene lacerte chairman chief executive officer and founder one of the reasons that we wanted to take the step to being public was to increase the overall awareness of the pain that we re solving for customers and of course bill com s solution as part of that and so like you said it is early days in helping that awareness increase but we did see an uptick in visits to the website during december and we ve seen increased interest not just from existing partners saying hey how can we do more together but from potentially from new partners that now understand the financial strength of our business and the strength of the balance sheet the strength of the p l that they can get more comfortable thinking about how they can invest behind us and our platform to do more with their customers when it comes to the paper to digital transition so we are seeing early signs of that it s hard to quantify but we feel good about it and are glad obviously that we took that step to be public josh beck keybanc capital markets analyst great thank you operator your next question comes from bhavan suri from william blair bhavan suri william blair analyst thanks can you hear me ok rene lacerte chairman chief executive officer and founder we can thank you bhavan bhavan suri william blair analyst congratulations i wanted to touch a little bit and i have one question i think bob napoli may be behind me with another question but i just want to touch briefly on this move to sort of slightly larger customers i m not trying to get a sense sort of where you define that line because there s a couple of things that happened one is obviously a different set of competitors a more complex set of requirements but then more importantly how much of the partners i guess it s a two part question so how is that progressing and where do you find that line and then how are the partners playing a role because obviously as you become larger customers the accounting firms become so much more critical to those guys as sort of a strategic asset i d love to understand how you re thinking about leveraging that to drive growth in sort of a larger customer base larger set of size of customers larger rene lacerte chairman chief executive officer and founder yes so i think my background and dna carried a good number of years working out into it where i got a chance to just focus on building the simplest solution that would be a horizontal approach to solving the customer pain point and so at bill com we ve done that we ve built a solution a platform that was horizontal that could serve all segments of the economy if you will without focusing on for example the enterprise and then that s really the only focus we don t have because everybody else kind of gets into many of the same processes they have documents they need managed to they have workflow they need to do they have all sorts of payments they need to manage and so that line that you re asking about is not something that is easy for us to be able to define because our customers are of all sizes and have been even if you look at our partnerships our partnerships have some partners that are focused on the smallest of businesses and some partners that are focused on the largest of businesses so if you think about our accounting software synchronization we have partnerships with netsuite and intacct that are larger companies public companies often and then we have partnerships with intuit and xero which tend to be a little bit smaller and so we don t really define that line we focus it on the pain points that they have and if we think that we can automate those pain points then we think they re a good customer target for us so the 90 of businesses still use paper as a primary form of their payment processing and that s true even in the larger companies and so when we go to market we really just focus on solving the pain points that those customers have and don t define the line we say this is what we have and let them come to us and so far that s working really well for us bhavan suri william blair analyst got it that s very helpful thank you rene lacerte chairman chief executive officer and founder thank you operator your next question comes from scott berg from needham scott berg needham and company analyst hi rené and john congrats on a good quarter great start after the ipo i guess two for me first of all rené i wanted to check about some of your customer acquisitions obviously very strong trends there but you have a nice viral nature to the model as you add on different partners in that ecosystem but as you look at your customer acquisitions or the net new customers in the quarter is there a discernible change on how many customers come from your traditional kind of more digital selling methods versus ones that might come through just being part of the network and another function rene lacerte chairman chief executive officer and founder so one of the powerful things about the platform it s kind of a steady growth business that has lots of opportunity to keep adding so we had no discernible change we continue to get stronger in each of the channels that we have so that s our focus and one of the things that i think is important and when you think about the power if you will of our distribution strategy is that we are helping customers understand that there s a better way with paper and the more partners we have talking about there being a better way than writing a check whether it s a bank or an accounting software partner or somebody else in the future the more we have of that that also helps our direct model it helps everything because everybody is now more aware that there is a better solution so i would say that s also probably some of the stuff that we feel makes our viral strategy a stronger one than others scott berg needham and company analyst great and then a follow up for you john your gross margins in the quarter were very strong at 78 non gaap gross margins but that s in the face of obviously a weaker fed funds interest rate on the book for customer revenues what s kind of pulling the margins up as those revenues from float comes down is it purely the gross margin on subscription or is there just a proportionate pull maybe from some of the transactions whether it s card payments or cross borders etc that s giving you the nice uplift john rettig chief financial officer yes thanks scott so as you saw with the results we had strong subscription revenue growth which is sort of the anchor of the foundation to our revenue model and like other saas companies we have very high margins on subscription revenues and the other thing that happened in the quarter is notwithstanding the decline on a year over year basis and our yield on float it actually came in ahead of our expectations that helped margins and then finally with transaction revenue growth that we delivered 114 year over year driven really by the activity of our customers the number of transactions increasing 29 year over year and then the revenue per transaction growing significantly really from the adoption of some of our new products rené mentioned it s still early in the rollout we re not fully penetrated in our base yet but we re seeing early signs of that and generally speaking just directionally the newer products that are priced on a variable basis tend to have a higher margin than the fixed price products that we sort of built the business with over the last 10 years or so around check and ach so it s really just the progress that we re making in driving adoption and in particular with electronic payments that s been the short term boost to gross margins scott berg needham and company analyst got it super helpful thanks for taking my questions operator your next question comes from bob napoli from william blair bob napoli william blair and company analyst thank you good afternoon and congratulations again rené and john rené following along with you all these years it s great to see the success you guys are having just a question to follow up on an earlier question if you would you talked rené about it being early days on cross border and virtual cards what is the penetration rate on virtual cards or cross border and what do you believe it can be and one of the questions on the roadshow frequently was that small businesses don t do that much cross border which i think is not correct and so if you could just talk about the penetration rate and the size of the opportunity what you think those penetration rates could be rene lacerte chairman chief executive officer and founder ok great thanks bob and thanks for all the support over the years and all the conversations so when we look at cross border payments and virtual card payments the way we decided to get into the market was to kind of look at the potential and what we saw was that for both we thought there was billions of dollars of tpv within our existing base and so our focus is on how do we get that tpv on to those programs whether it s virtual card or cross border and so we are in the early days but nothing has changed our assumption to tell us that it s not the billions of dollars that we felt was out there bob napoli william blair and company analyst ok all right a little bit that go there then your r d obviously is up quite a bit over the prior year almost 100 and you ve talked about new products international and so can you maybe give a little more color on where those r d dollars are going i know you ve mentioned international besides cross border i think actually moving international to sign up international customers i wonder if that s on the docket and then it seems like you have a very large opportunity in providing working capital a working capital product probably with your partners like american express or j p morgan so just some thoughts on the r d spend the move to international and then potentially a working capital product rene lacerte chairman chief executive officer and founder yes so the r d spend is increasing because the opportunity that we see to reach more customers get stronger every day right so how we reach those customers and as you think about the cross and the casm methodology as you get into the early majority and late majority your solution has to be simpler it has to have simplicity at its core and while i think our solution two years ago was simple there was an opportunity for us to invest in that user experience to really simplify how they experience everything that we do for them and so this transition that i referenced of taking customers onto our new platform that s a significant part of the r d investment and what that means some examples of things that we ve added into that new platform is we ve added the ability to read the invoices right so we have an ai team now that is helping us understand how to digest all this paper the 45 million documents a year that we referenced in the s 1 for fy 19 how do you take that data that s unstructured and then apply it to a business so they can manage their payables and receivables more efficiently and so we launched either about a year ago we continue to make enhancements on that platform so that customers don t have to do that data entry in addition to the ai component of customer experiences also the ai component on a risk perspective right so on a run rate basis we managed 100 billion a year now so having a platform that that scale requires us to invest behind that scale and to get in front of where we re going and so these are things that aren t necessarily facing to the customer but they re really really critical for us to invest in ahead of time so the international and virtual card programs are ones where we re able to monetize that investment that we re doing on the platform but all these others our customers are getting the benefit of that and that gives us the ability to make the platform more valuable for our customers so we feel really good about the investment and i ll continue to invest behind that strategy when i see the opportunity in front of us bob napoli william blair and company analyst thank you appreciate it rene lacerte chairman chief executive officer and founder we have time for one more question operator your last question comes from richard davis from canaccord luke morison canaccord genuity analyst hey guys this is luke on for richard so in the private markets today we have interesting up and comers such as brex soho scalefactor and then you have more tenured guys like sage intacct who is of course partner of yours just taking a broader perspective on this landscape could you remind us how you think about and view the partner and competitor ecosystem evolving over the next few years rene lacerte chairman chief executive officer and founder sure thank you luke for the question and when we look at the market and you think about the complexity of what it is that we ve built over the last 13 years it s significant right so we have the ability to manage all the documents the ability to manage all of the workload the ability to manage all of the payments whether they re international payments or check payments or ach payments or virtual card payments we have the ability to integrate all of that with multiple different accounting systems and then we do that on a white label basis for customers that need it and then we do that for accountants under the basis where they re able to have their brand exposed as well that depth of the platform is just something that we don t see other people building and designing from the beginning around so when we see other competitors they tend to be taking components of what we do and focus on that and so we have a belief in our strategy of this broad platform is the only way that we re going to be able to fulfill or anyone can fulfill the mission of making it simple to connect and do business and so that remains our focus and that won t change and so that s probably all i can have to say on that type of question luke morison canaccord genuity analyst that s great thank you very much rene lacerte chairman chief executive officer and founder thank you operator and that was our last question i will turn the call back over to the presenters rene lacerte chairman chief executive officer and founder thanks again everyone for joining the call today we believe in our mission and are very excited about the opportunity ahead of us and thank you for your participation

was the second highest in our history with net sales of 1 33 billion a 23 1 increase the growth in the quarter was a result of a 13 increase in our domestic business and a 31 2 increase in our

concerned by the health crisis in china and the well being of those affected including our employees partners and vendors we remain optimistic about the strength of skechers in china and committed to our long term growth strategy in the country john will address how we have incorporated our current understanding of the situation into our guidance now turning to our domestic business in detail in the fourth quarter our domestic sales increased 13 driven by a 16 3 increase in our direct to consumer business with comparable same store sales increasing 10 3 for the quarter our domestic wholesale growth of 10 4 was the result of a 12 9 increase in pairs shipped for the quarter along with a modest increase in average price per pair of about 1 with a broad distribution strategy and vast product offering we are a valuable resource for both our domestic account base and consumers who are seeking comfort style innovation and quality in their footwear at quarter end we had 497 company owned skechers retail stores in the united states in the fourth quarter we opened nine stores across seven states we also remodeled one store and expanded two locations to date in the first quarter seven company owned stores have opened in the united states three have closed we are currently planning for another 75 to 85 new stores predominantly in our warehouse format to open before the end of the year our men s women s and kids domestic business improved in the fourth quarter specifically the biggest increases came from our sport and work lines for men and women our bobs from skechers collection women s gowalk and our men s casual and performance line as well as our kids business returning to growth in the quarter to keep skechers top of mind over the holidays and into 2020 we supported our domestic business with several marketing campaigns from print outdoor digital and broadcast this included television commercials for our kids footwear as well as spots for our new max cushioning and arch fit collection based on our domestic direct to consumer january sales comping up low double digit and strong backlogs within our domestic wholesale channel we believe our domestic business will continue to show positive growth in the first quarter now looking in detail our international business which represented 59 3 of our total sales in the quarter sales increased 31 2 or 32 3 on a constant currency basis reflecting growth in our subsidiary joint venture and distributor businesses and across each region for the fourth quarter the biggest drivers in terms of dollar increases were china india the united kingdom uae and mexico which transitioned to a joint venture in 2019 the only subsidiary or joint venture markets that didn t grow were chile and hong kong both of which faced unusual political unrest during the quarter specifically the sales growth was the result of a 32 8 increase in our wholesale business and a 24 7 in our direct to consumer business with an 8 8 increase in comparable store sales at quarter end there were 3 050 international retail stores a net increase of 231 in the fourth quarter of those stores 2 747 are owned and operated by

in indonesia seven in malaysia and five in both mexico and romania 40 stores closed in the quarter in 2020 we anticipate between 550 and 650 skechers third party stores to open to support our global business expansion we utilized television outdoor digital and print campaigns to drive consumers to stores where skechers are available this included underground campaigns in the u k and france perimeter boards at sporting events in canada and central eastern europe kiosks across turkey massive billboards in spain and chile fashion weeks in the uae and greece events that engaged consumers in india and mexico and windows in key avenues and malls across europe and asia our international business remains the primary growth driver for the skechers brand this was reflected in the exceptional performance of our distribution centers in europe japan india and latin america each of which efficiently handled double digit increase in pairs shipped in 2019 while simultaneously preparing for the future growth of our business through our infrastructure project our backlogs are up across our international segment and we are seeing the benefit from the conversion of india to a subsidiary and mexico to a joint venture now i ll turn the call over to john to review our financials and discuss our outlook john vandemore chief financial office thank you david first i would like to add my sentiments about the crisis in china right now we are most concerned with the welfare of our employees partners and vendors these are people we work with closely day in and day out and we want them to know that skechers will be there for them during this critical time as david said the skechers brand is strong in china and we firmly believe this situation although challenging will prove transitory our record fourth quarter sales totaled 1 33 billion an increase of 249 9 million or 23 1 and reflects the strength of our brand product portfolio and worldwide execution capabilities on a constant currency basis sales increased 257 million or 23 8 as david mentioned earlier we grew in all segments in every region and in nearly every country the growth continued despite enduring headwinds from foreign exchange rate and the impact of incremental domestic tariff international wholesale sales increased 32 8 including a 36 increase from our wholly owned subsidiaries a 31 4 increase in our joint ventures and a 32 4 increase in our distributor business direct to consumer sales increased 19 4 the result of a 16 3 increase domestically and a 24 7 increase internationally domestic direct to consumer sales growth was driven by a 10 3 increase in comparable store sales and the net addition of 27 new stores international direct to consumer sales growth was driven by an 8 8 increase in comparable store sales and the net addition of 20 new stores domestic wholesale sales grew 10 4 or 28 million with a double digit increase in our men s division and mid single digit increases in both women s and kids we continue to see encouraging signals for the skechers business among our domestic wholesale customers into the first half of 2020 gross profit was 637 7 million up 122 1 million compared to the prior year gross margin increased by 20 basis points to 47 9 primarily due to the strength in our direct to consumer businesses joint ventures and distributors partially offset by lower subsidiary and domestic wholesale gross margin the latter due to increased domestic duties total operating expenses increased by 111 5 million or 25 5 to 548 3 million in the quarter as a percentage of sales operating expenses increased by 80 basis points to 41 2 compared to 40 4 in the prior year largely driven by increased advertising and marketing spending where we chose to strategically invest in the momentum of our global business in order to support both current and future growth selling expenses increased by 26 8 million to 88 7 million due to higher advertising expenses in both the domestic and international markets the increase supported both our growth in the quarter as well as opportunities to build on brand and product awareness worldwide as reflected in our backlog and strong comparable store performance general administrative expenses increased by 84 7 million to 459 7 million but remained essentially flat as a percentage of sales the dollar increases reflect both higher than expected sales volumes which increased variable costs like distribution and warehousing and additional expenses to handle the accelerated arrival of list 4b products which were exposed at the time to incremental tariff the increase also included 28 2 million to support the growth of our joint venture businesses primarily in china and mexico and 32 7 million associated with our direct to consumer business and a net increase of 47 new company owned stores including 21 that opened in the quarter we also incurred start up costs related to the new automation in our distribution center in belgium and operational planning for our new distribution center in china earnings from operations increased 12 4 to 94 million versus the prior year and our operating margin was 7 1 compared with 7 7 from the prior year net income increased 25 7 to 59 5 million or 0 39 per diluted share on 154 6 million diluted shares outstanding compared to net income of 47 4 million or 0 31 per diluted share on 155 million diluted shares outstanding in the prior year period our effective income tax rate for the quarter decreased to 14 from 15 5 in the prior year we expect our effective tax rate for 2020 to be between 16 and 18 and now turning to our balance sheet at december 31 2019 we had over 1 billion in cash cash equivalents and investments which was a decrease of 34 5 million or 3 2 from december 31 2018 recall that earlier this year we invested over 180 million to purchase the minority interest of our former joint venture in india and to form a new joint venture in mexico our cash in investments represented approximately 6 72 per diluted share outstanding at december 31 2019 trade accounts receivable at quarter end were 699 2 million an increase of 141 6 million from december 31 2018 driven by higher sales particularly in our international wholesale business total inventory was approximately 1 1 billion an increase of 23 9 or 206 6 million from december 31 2018 the increase was primarily in our international markets where we believe our inventory levels leave us well positioned to support our growth expectations total debt including both current and long term portion was 121 2 million compared to 97 million at december 31 2018 the increase primarily reflects borrowings associated with the construction of our first distribution center in china during the quarter we also replaced our existing 250 million asset backed credit facility that was due to expire in june of 2020 with a new 500 million senior unsecured credit facility to provide additional liquidity support to the continued growth of our business working capital decreased 45 5 million to approximately 1 58 billion versus 1 62 billion at december 31 2018 partially attributable to the inclusion of current operating lease liabilities totaling 191 1 million arising from the adoption of the new lease accounting standard for fiscal year 2019 capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were 66 million of which 11 8 million was related to the construction of our distribution center in china 17 1 million related to direct to consumer stores and e commerce investments worldwide and 9 8 million related to our distribution capabilities around the globe as well as general corporate investments for the full year 2019 our total capital expenditures were 240 7 million we expect our capital expenditures for 2020 to be in the range of 325 million to 350 million which includes completing the construction of our china distribution center the expansion of our u s distribution facility opening 115 to 125 new company owned skechers stores and 20 to 30 store remodels expansion and relocation the expansion of our corporate headquarters and technology investments primarily in our direct to consumer business now turning to guidance first let me reiterate that there is much we do not know about the current situation in china as a result assessing the impact to our business is difficult what we know is that a meaningful number of skechers stores in china both company owned and franchise have been temporarily closed and those that remain open are seeing significantly below average traffic and comparable store sales pattern incorporated into the following guidance is our best estimate of the influence of these factors on the first quarter of 2020 but if the severity of the situation in china worsens and impacts our businesses outside of china and or our global supply chain this guidance may change we currently expect first quarter 2020 sales to be in the range of 1 4 billion to 1 425 billion and net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of 0 70 to 0 75 this guidance incorporates the view based upon current trends backlogs and other indicators that all three of our segments will continue to grow in the first quarter and the impact from the crisis in china aligns with our expectations and now i ll turn the call over to david for closing remarks david weinberg chief operating officer thank you john as mentioned we believe our business product distribution marketing and infrastructure is extremely strong in 2019 we surpassed the milestone of 5 billion in annual sales grew our international business to 57 9 of our total sales at year end and achieved double digit growth in our domestic and international businesses in the fourth quarter we now have more than 3 500 skechers stores around the world and a strong e commerce business that we believe will improve greatly with upgrades we are completing in the first half of 2020 we believe this momentum will continue in 2020 given our strong backlog and the strength of our direct to consumer channel which had low double digit comps for january we will continue to assess the potential impact of the health crisis on our business in asia as well as elsewhere and provide support to our teams in china and with that i d like to now turn the call over to the operator to begin the question and answer portion of the conference call questions and answers operator thank you our first question comes from the line of jay sole with ubs please proceed with your question jay sole ubs analyst great thank you so much the 9 9 comp was one of the strongest numbers in what was a very strong top line in the quarter can you talk about e commerce growth within the retail business and david you just mentioned some upgrades you re making can you give us an idea of where you think that business can go from here david weinberg chief operating officer well i don t think there s a limit to where that business can grow it s still relatively small although growing very very significantly we don t even measure that anymore in single digits or double digits well into the double and for some months even triple digits however it s still only now it is about low double digits of our complete direct to consumer sales so there s plenty of room to it to go we have invested a lot of money that we ve over the past couple of years and are replatforming and getting things ready for a new major launch including our elite program on top of that we re going to use that as a prototype to take around the world we don t have direct to consumer online e commerce in every subsidiary in the world but we plan on this in the next year to be online and direct to consumer in every country in the world so when you put it all together it can be very very significant but we shouldn t take away from the fact that even in this difficult time while brick and mortar is comping up significantly as well which shows what we have to offer as a destination and to a direct to consumer and when we put them all together in the coming years in our version of the omnichannel we think it s going to be with the great product we have be even that much better jay sole ubs analyst got it and then if i can just ask about the guidance obviously china is such a big topic and the coronavirus for every company can you maybe sort of split out what impact that you re incorporating from that situation into the sales guidance that you ve given this afternoon john vandemore chief financial office well we don t want to get overly precise because what we re waiting is probability of a lot of different outcomes but what i would reiterate from the guidance is we still expect every segment to grow we are planning china down for this quarter we ve taken a fairly severe look at february and parts of march how that unfolds really is to be determined but it s really the strength of all of our other business segments that aren t being directly impacted by the situation right now which is powering that guidance so i d tell you i think we ve taken an appropriately conservative view about china will impact our first quarter results i think we ll learn more as the situation unfolds but every other segment every other piece of the business our expectation is that we ll continue to contribute at roughly similar levels to what we ve seen which is very strong performance as david highlighted jay sole ubs analyst okay and then maybe one more from me if i could you mentioned that india was one of the strongest growers in terms of dollars within the international business it seems like the india is still probably a pretty small piece of the overall business so can you give us an idea what percentage type of growth rates you re seeing in india and what the prospects are for us during that end market john vandemore chief financial office well i ll start with the prospects because we think the prospects for skechers in india are extraordinarily bright especially over the long term it s an incredible market where we ve seen incredible traction for the brand it continuously ranked in the market as one of the most recognized and loved brands by consumers i would tell you this quarter the rate was fantastic it was over 50 growth for the full year the rate was also near that level it s starting to become a very meaningful contributor to the overall economics of our international subsidiary business so it s a significant driver and we have very high expectations for the continued growth of the market even in what are somewhat difficult times right now from a consumer discretionary spend environment and we ve seen the brand thus far power through that which is extraordinarily encouraging jay sole ubs analyst okay guys thanks so much operator our next question comes from the line of chris svezia with wedbush securities please proceed with your question chris svezia wedbush securities analyst good afternoon guys congratulations i guess first one clarification on china are you anticipating it gets worse or stays the same and any thoughts about supply chain i know what the inventories look like currently but just where you stand right now as you think about first half product deliveries david weinberg chief operating officer so january for china was very good right up until about the 23rd when we saw the travel restrictions go into place so performance through the early part of january was actually very encouraging while we are seeing depressed traffic and comp store trends at the moment in our physical stores and in our franchise stores e commerce continues to do well what we ve assumed as a result of this quarter is that february is very difficult partly because of the travel restrictions partly because of the unknowns of how consumer discretionary spend patterns are going to revitalize and when we ve taken a similar view of march though not as a fear assuming at this moment that this situation begins to dissipate but we ve also attempted to incorporate enough leeway that will give us latitude in the guidance we have and as far as the supply chain is concerned it s obviously an issue but it s not a short term issue for us in fulfilling what we have available outside of china we took a lot of stuff early around the world for various reasons we have capacity and raw materials in those factories that are working and have already gone to work outside of china obviously have somewhat of a decreased demand for the parts of our supply chain that have to supply china since sales will be down so while we re watching it closely and there s certainly a significant potential somewhere down the road we don t think there can be a severe impact for q1 so we have time to monitor and see what happens as we go through the year chris svezia wedbush securities analyst okay thank you on switching gears u s wholesale for a moment just 10 growth q4 q1 you got a much david weinberg chief operating officer what you mean just chris svezia wedbush securities analyst gosh here we go you hit double digits congratulations by the way anyway just q1 just you have an easier compare it seems like there s some momentum here how do we think about q1 u s wholesale and if any color you want to give with some of the other segments dtc comp or anything along those lines pertains to the revenue guidance john vandemore chief financial office well i m going to hold back from saying i told you so on domestic wholesale although i will note that we are actually very happy with the resurgence we ve seen in domestic wholesale it s gotten stronger every quarter the product is clearly resonating i would tell you at the moment we view next quarter is likely to be around where we were this quarter we see great backlog traffic we see good order flow good shipping trends so we are very optimistic that we will see a similar performance or potentially even better relative to q1 again the only asterisk i d put on that is assessing the global impact of what s happening in china to the extent that has a knock on effect elsewhere in the world but right now we re seeing good trends in first and even indications in the second quarter although we re not as fully booked there yet and i would tell you that that general guide outside of international wholesale which obviously is going to be impacted by china is somewhat of the room that we re using this quarter because we re seeing similar trends david mentioned that january comparable store sales are up low double digits which is fantastic so we re looking for somewhat similar patterns of growth plus or minus a bit in each of the segments and outside of china the international wholesale business continues to do resoundingly well the backlogs there are phenomenal so again what you re going to see in the quarter ahead we believe is strength across the portfolio offsetting the challenge that exists in china which again we re planning down for the quarter at the moment but it s really the strength of the brand everywhere else that s going to carry us through this quarter which again i think it s just a testament to the resonance of the product right now chris svezia wedbush securities analyst okay sounds good and one final thing something near and dear to your heart john but just on sg a i know you took an opportunity here to invest on the selling line in q4 is it still the general thought that sg a or everyone will look at sg a grows in line with revenues as we move forward or is it still opportunistic based on investments you want to make or how should we look at that john vandemore chief financial office well i m so glad you asked chris thank you so generally speaking that remains our target let me take a moment to point out a few things this year that are going to be different as we mentioned with the onset of the opening of our distribution center in china there will be costs throughout the year that we incur start up costs this will most likely be concentrated over the first three quarters for the full year we expect them to approximate about usd15 million to usd20 million so that will have a natural deleveraging effect because they are onetime type costs i will just also point out we are finalizing the purchase accounting of our investment in mexico there s likely to be quite frankly a full a few cents on the full year related to the purchase accounting it s really just accounting adjustments but when we have that finalized which should be at the end of the first quarter we ll give you some guidance there so i do want to point those two out because they are anomalies outside of that though i would continue to point toward revenue growth as our upper bound probably again the global caveat there being china we ve again we ve incorporated some latitude throughout our p l it may be that we need to spend some money in china to reignite operations it wouldn t surprise me if there s a quarter or two where we need to deleverage in china specifically but quite frankly until we get better informed about how that is going to unfold it would be difficult to really project with specificity when or how much that s going to be so carving out those unique items that s still the guidance i would point you to is sg a growing in line it s at the high end with revenue obviously with us targeting to do better i would also emphasize that this quarter was definitely an opportunistic quarter we ve had great strength in the brand we saw an opportunity to put that into sales and marketing related expenses g a itself was actually in line so i would think of those largely as investments for the future of the brand david weinberg chief operating officer and chris i would add in there as well that as we mentioned fourth quarter is usually our smallest of the year this year it wasn t and it showed a reacceleration in many places around the world that includes europe and usually when we have an acceleration in the fourth quarter from a small quarter like that it shows insignificant growth in the following year so when we talk about opportunistic we have to see what that growth pattern is because it can be significant and i would tell you along with having such a strong fourth quarter our booking trends for all the subsidiaries in the first quarter were extremely good and significantly higher than last year which leads us to an acceleration certainly coming into this year and had china seen any significant growth we would have even seen some outside growth in q1 that we still think is available throughout the year so we ll be getting ready for that kind of growth as well chris svezia wedbush securities analyst understood thank you and all the best appreciate it operator our next question comes from the line of john kernan with cowen company please proceed with your question john kernan cowen and company analyst hey good afternoon david john congrats on a very strong fourth quarter and a good start to this year john you and david were both pretty enthusiastic about europe when we met with you at fannie clearly the fourth quarter numbers in international wholesale are extremely robust i m just wondering what your thoughts are on europe for 2020 what regions you re most excited about and maybe if some of the strength you re seeing in europe can help to really offset some of the onetime type challenges in china this year john vandemore chief financial office yes john that i mean that pretty much describes it to be honest with you we were excited about what we saw in europe both in developing and developed markets europe as a region grew significantly it actually grew above the average for international wholesale in the quarter so we ve seen really good continuing trend in that market as david mentioned the backlogs are fantastic right now for both the first quarter and we re seeing very encouraging early indications on second quarter i think the product is resonating and it s across our stores it s across our wholesale accounts it is in our e commerce channels where we have them in the international markets and it s going to be those markets and others again that pull the business through the headwind that s going to be our results in china in q1 as we anticipate them at the moment so that market continues to be very robust for us from a growth standpoint and we couldn t be quite frankly more optimistic about the long term potential of the brand there and quite frankly in south america in the other parts of asia that aren t currently facing the challenge we mentioned that with every region every segment and nearly every country and that s right on in fact in many instances the only instances i can think of where we had a subsidiary or joint venture partner that didn t grow in a country it was largely because of some sort of extraordinary political strife so the business and the product is resonating in a lot of different markets all at once which again i think is a testament to the design and the marketing behind it john kernan cowen and company analyst all right got it i wanted to shift gears maybe just to the company owned comps obviously impressive both in domestic and international can you just talk to the drivers of this is there an asp story to this is it just traffic are you converting more with some of the omnichannel initiatives you put in place and obviously the strength has continued into january i think you said comps are running up low doubles i wonder if you could give us a little bit more color on the overall drivers of this comp david weinberg chief operating officer yes well what we said was up low double digits domestically it s up as well around the world the drivers for us are always about product and what we develop and the brand acceptance as we go around certainly in a competitive environment so i think what you see as you go through is it s a little bit of everything we have many categories many of them resonate we advertise them well we get traffic through the stores it s not so much traffic because i don t know that traffic per se is different for us than anybody else in especially in those places we share but we do have better conversion we have customers that come in knowing what they re looking for which leads to a better conversion and they re always there to purchase so it is a little bit of everything a little bit of pricing and asp but nothing significant it is all about acceptance and conversion and the product we have to offer john kernan cowen and company analyst excellent okay thank you operator our next question comes from the line of gabby carbone with deutsche bank please proceed with your question gabby carbone deutsche bank analyst hi good afternoon thanks for taking our question i wanted to ask about category performance i was wondering if you can dig a little bit deeper and discuss what categories and styles are driving such strong growth and then i was wondering if you could speak to kind of the kids business i mean what s kind of aiding that categories return back to growth john vandemore chief financial office yes again i hate to sound like a broken record we saw a lot of very broad strength across the divisions as we refer to them i think most encouraging this quarter is as we mentioned all genders grew women s grew men s grew fantastically kids returned to growth it s been battling some difficult comparisons from our lighted product as well as i would describe kind of a general malaise in kids across all brands and seeing that come back to light this quarter was fantastic i think it s probably the broad appeal of the general casual look and feel at the moment that is aiding a lot of different divisions but obviously bringing gowalk in a big way has helped us our street product has done very well our work product which is definitely a completely different category than most has grown exceedingly well david mentioned the awards we ve won in our performance category that s helping the performance category as well so to be honest with you it s a lot of different divisions performing very well i think it s again like the casual atmosphere but also the fact that we have comfort features that many don t we price comfort unlike anyone else and bringing products to market like arch fit in combination with our other products like relaxed and i mean it s the whole thing that customers are looking for right now david weinberg chief operating officer i think this year actually this performance anyway follows what we ve been saying all along we no longer are in search of while we re in search of but no longer need a hero shoe or a hero division or a hero territory to carry it when you look at the amount of growth in the double digit in all the categories so that s a lot of product in all those geographies it really is spread out and it has to do with a broad offering and brand identity and brand awareness and brand acceptance john vandemore chief financial office yes i left out the bobs group too and they would be offended if i did they ve done phenomenally well this year too so i want to make sure i call it the bobs team gabby carbone deutsche bank analyst got it thanks and then just a follow up on gross margin you obviously did a nice job managing that this quarter i believe in the past you ve said there could be some tariff pressure still in the first quarter so just an update on how that situation is going john vandemore chief financial office yes we definitely saw the impacts or the beginning impacts of the tariffs this quarter and let me just point out in our release this quarter we have actually included the segment level gross margin breakdowns for you all so that you can have them before the 10 q in that you ll see the domestic wholesale margins certainly took a bit of a hit because of the tariffs what we have said all along though is while we have mitigation and strategies to address the tariff increases we didn t feel the need to recoup that all in the domestic wholesale segment and so we took a little bit of a hit there but you saw our margins accrete elsewhere to offset that and that drove kind of the overall margin accretion for this quarter i should also let you know that the pricing that we had talked about taking earlier was something that we deferred until the first part of 2020 so that wasn t even actually in the mix to help offset some of that cost the only the pricing that we are able to see flow through within our own retail that was more on brand strength so we expect there to be a continuing impact in the first quarter at least the way the tariff reductions were put into place everything that had arrived prior to the signing of the first phase agreement still bore the higher tariff costs so we ll still need to work through some of that higher tariff inventory over the first quarter maybe a little bit into the second quarter so we expect a little bit of that pressure coming into q1 david weinberg chief operating officer and in fact i was just in concert with that so i know somebody will ask we do expect there to be some gross margin pressures in the first quarter because of that fact as well as what we anticipate in china is probably being an impact on some asps for already delivered product gabby carbone deutsche bank analyst great thank you so much about the color david weinberg chief operating officer thank you operator our next question comes from the line of omar saad with evercore isi please pick up the question omar saad evercore isi analyst thanks for taking my question great quarter guys thanks for all the information i wanted to ask my first question on pricing at aurs do you have any sense of what your trends are at retail it feels like the brand has a lot of pricing power right now whether it s kind of mixing the customer up from good better best or just like for like pricing maybe give us your thoughts on that and then i have one follow up john vandemore chief financial office yes pricing was a growth driver in the quarter for us at retail again i would attribute that largely to the strength of the brand it pulling through in the pricing line we didn t enact any price changes any major price changes in the wholesale segment this quarter if you recall when we were contemplating our action path forward in response to the tariffs we mentioned pricing but we also consciously deferred that action until the early part of 2020 we didn t want to reset any pricing that was already for booked orders so you didn t see as much of that in the domestic wholesale you did see kind of a leveling off on the pricing i think it was up about 1 so actually in the domestic wholesale we got volume and a little bit of price as well but again i think your inclination is correct it is the strength of the brand and the quality of the product that we re bringing forward that is driving that price relationship omar saad evercore isi analyst got you okay and then my one follow up can i thinking about the e commerce your commentary around e commerce and the digital initiatives and the investments you re making if i think like a few years ago you guys were still a little bit skeptical not sure about how the profitability would work in that segment maybe you could share with us how some of your views on that channel as a business model how they ve evolved and given how much you re kind of gearing your investment toward that channel now john vandemore chief financial office well as david mentioned it s certainly a source of pretty significant investment both in people and in technology this year you will see the next evolution of that investment we will replatform our site in the u s and then we will take that out across the globe we re also likely to be relaunching at least in a beta phase our loyalty program which obviously has some significant technology investment behind it we re also going to completely revamp our pos system for our existing store base so that it will have greater functionality and interoperability with our online account so i very much agree with david s earlier statement it s very early stage for us in the e commerce business the economics are still very attractive to us they look very good to us relative to our overall retail performance something obviously we watch carefully but we think the runway for both e commerce as a stand alone element of our offering but also in concert with the stores which is where as david mentioned the omni channel solution for skechers will come we think that has great upside opportunity david weinberg chief operating officer around the world john vandemore chief financial office yes omar saad evercore isi analyst understood that thanks good luck operator our next question comes from the line of sam poser with susquehanna financial group please pick up his question sam poser susquehanna financial group analyst good afternoon thanks for taking taking my questions can you you ve talked in the past about how big your china sales were in the prior year so how big were the china sales last year david weinberg chief operating officer so i don t want to get overly precise and i would just ask keep in mind china was also dealing with a pretty significant headwind from forex last year it was in we saw a reasonable increase from the prior year so within that kind of mid 800 million range sam poser susquehanna financial group analyst and that s i mean could we assume that q1 is approx you re up again approximately 200 million then give or take and when you re and when you re knocking it and when you re planning it down you might be planning there might be 100 million or it s a can you give us some idea of what that dollar amount is that is within there so we because you re going to get some of that back next year it should spring so we should can you give us some idea what the number is i mean other companies have been fairly specific about it within your number i know it may change but you ve given us this revenue guidance and you know what the number was that you took out of china so it would be greatly helpful david weinberg chief operating officer yes but remember you re dealing with a whole quarter sam and your 200 million 100 million 150 million they were actually up in january so the quarter can t be as catastrophic unless it goes really down significantly so we ve taken a significant haircut by month but we still keep sam poser susquehanna financial group analyst so right of course right of course okay what percent of your production is now in china what percent of overall production in china david weinberg chief operating officer it hasn t changed significantly from the last time it s about half maybe a little less than half but remember a big piece in that production is china for china which doesn t have as much pressure sam poser susquehanna financial group analyst because the sales are not there so they don t need to make stuff and what percent of your let s say first half product is either on the water or sitting in warehouses right now as far as you can see david weinberg chief operating officer well there s a couple of things that are going on so we have taken a significant piece i don t know that we ll talk about the first half because the first half also goes through june and we still have capacity there and that obviously nothing from june is on the water to date although they may have raw materials and things like that as i said before we are set pretty much for first quarter with the production that s available with what we took early with what s on the water and even some things that we pushed our some of our factories to make before chinese new year that they didn t have a chance to ship that they will now be shipping as soon as they get in for the quarter i don t think there s a significant amount that s at risk for first quarter april is not a big month for us so we re waiting to see what happens we certainly would need more production as we get all the way out to june but it s kind of early to go through that whole scenario again sam poser susquehanna financial group analyst and then they ve talked about the factories at least last i heard they were open and maybe opening next monday but i mean what are you hearing about when these chinese factories right now are potentially going to reopen david weinberg chief operating officer yes we don t hear anything more than what s official for you we have most of them are planning to go back to work monday we re not sure what the retention piece is or how long it will take them to get started there are some regions that will open the following week so it s a mix and match around the country so we do anticipate that it will take them time to get started like i said i don t know what that means right this minute until we see the retention of workers and what s available as they come out sam poser susquehanna financial group analyst okay and then lastly just back to the gross margin given the strength of your dtc business and both in store and e commerce despite the fact that it s fairly up from a gross margin perspective i mean that is additive especially with the number of stores you re planning on opening this year i would think that that is from a mix of where you re getting your sales the bigger that gets the better that is for gross margin david weinberg chief operating officer well that s true but that s always as a percentage so we have so many moving pieces and when you concentrate on one you tend to get lost in its number fx still has more impact depending on what it is and how this plays out in china and how the foreign exchanges around the world move against the dollar as much as a direct to consumer europe has some we have some pricing so there are a number of pieces and a number of things you have to throw into the pot and on an average basis china is higher than the united states so the fact that we re giving up some and the aggregate is there although depending on how expenses are and we ve tried to be very careful with that in the guidance there could be impact certainly of short term but not necessarily that flow through to bottom line depending on currencies etc sam poser susquehanna financial group analyst all right thank you very much continued success operator our next question comes from the line of kimberly greenberger with morgan stanley please proceed with your question kimberly greenberger morgan stanley analyst oh great thank you so much i just wanted to clarify if i could starting with sam s question did you say that on the gross margin line fx can in some cases fully offset the benefits of d2c on the gross margin so fx has been a downward pressure point on gross margin b2c has been a good new story on gross margin but often times one can offset the other john vandemore chief financial office yes i mean what you saw this quarter is there were kind of two simultaneous positive impacts one was just general mix which lifted gross margin and that comes from more dtc and then there was also improvement within dtc of the margin but there was also an offsetting impact from fx we continue to experience fx headwinds in the quarter so they almost offset not totally and that s why you saw a little bit of accretion like to david s point we certainly have seen situations in the past year where that fx impact has been even more severe and has washed away some of the benefits that you get from improved mix overall again the long term strategy though is to continue to advance in our direct to consumer and international businesses both of which are accretive to our overall gross margin kimberly greenberger morgan stanley analyst great okay that clarification is super helpful and then just looking out to 2020 based on current exchange rates do you have a view of what you think the fx impact on gross margin will be if any and then i just wanted to ask about china if i m not sure what the mix between e commerce and brick and mortar revenue is in china but if you have an estimate as to what portion of lost store sales you think could be replaced by enhanced e commerce sales i d certainly be interested in hearing that john vandemore chief financial office on the gross margin question relative to fx we know what we know based on where we sit today it looks like at the moment there may be some modest pressure from gross on gross margin from fx in the first quarter we think it will probably and if this is already baked into the guidance it probably dampens our growth by about 100 basis points in the quarter so there ll be some flow through of that in the gross margin that being said the nature of foreign exchange rates as they are fairly dynamic so we ll have to wait till the end of the quarter to be certain on that relative to china i just it d be very hard for us to guess at this point how the situation unfolds what i would tell you is about 1 3 of the revenue overall is e commerce driven that changes by quarter though there s obviously some rather significant selling events in june and then in the fourth quarter with singles day and now 12 12 so what we re seeing right now is continued strength in e commerce but i don t know if that will endure what we ve attempted to do is assume that we have a fairly steady performance in e commerce and then obviously the significant challenge comes through the owned retail stores and our franchise business but this is a fast evolving situation so it s difficult to be fairly precise on that at this point kimberly greenberger morgan stanley analyst understood thank you that was helpful john vandemore chief financial office sure operator our next question comes from the line of susan anderson with b riley fbr please proceed with the question susan anderson b riley fbr analyst oh good evening nice job on the quarter i guess a couple of follow up questions when you look at the tariff situation i think you said that the pricing didn t necessarily flow through this quarter so should we expect the gross margin pressure to be a little bit less in first quarter and then also as we kind of go into the back half or when those tariffs get rolled back will you continue to keep the pricing higher david weinberg chief operating officer well so i think the actual cost impact is going to be a little bit higher in the next quarter simply because we re going to continue to roll through that fully tariff product we don t get the benefit yet of rolling through and absorbing the product that was exempt or reduced the reduced 4b or 4a rate so we expect at the moment at least that we ll continue to see pressure throughout the first quarter the combination of reallocation of resources our vendor pricing strategies and then the pricing we put in place should begin to offset that but the timing of that is uncertain and will have to play out over the first two quarters it s really that plus the potential drag from fx and how we plan the situation in china at the moment that gives us some caution on the gross margin line and that s something we re going to watch carefully obviously in the quarter susan anderson b riley fbr analyst got it okay great and then i guess just a follow up on the kids business nice to see that return to growth i think you talked about maybe some better marketing but i guess also is there any are there new products that i guess is driving the growth or is it more cycling the easy compares or how should we think about that david weinberg chief operating officer it s always new product so we re never really stagnant with that i think what you see is what we ve talked about over the last few quarters when john has mentioned that we were up against tougher comps and it was some product in there that not necessarily comes along with our line features and now we re back to a more normal setting and in the environment in the u s and now we re starting to grow again within what s our core business group rather than looking for these outside one time wonders susan anderson b riley fbr analyst great okay and then lastly the pressure in hong kong i guess how should we think about that for this year are you starting to see that ease at all or should we expect continued pressure there as we go throughout this year david weinberg chief operating officer well a year is long time so we don t know that but there s obviously continued pressure because of tourism and some of those watched being closed but it s not a significantly large market for us and it s certainly not as impacted as china just yet so the effect on an overall basis while probably significant for hong kong it s not significant to the overall susan anderson b riley fbr analyst got it okay great that s helpful thanks so much good luck next quarter operator our next question comes from the line of jim duffy with stifel please proceed with your question jim duffy stifel analyst thanks good afternoon for a moment i want to focus on green pasture opportunities in china just setting the coronavirus aside if we can can you guys comment on the reception that you re seeing to the brand as you expanded tier three plus cities as you learn more are there any differences in these cities that makes growth here more challenging john vandemore chief financial office well i mean again we mentioned both david and i that our long term view on china hasn t changed we view this as a temporary situation and that is informed by both the success that we saw coming out of q4 q4 in china was a very solid growth quarter the business did well on single s day did well on 12 12 so we re still seeing the brand resonate and grow with consumers part of our strategy over the next few years will certainly be incorporating more tier three four and five cities into the mix the reception we ve seen so far has been extremely strong i think this is probably at worse the temporary setback and we ll continue to grow the brand that way it s a little bit difficult to say today how the timing of some of those entries is going to play out i would also point out that obviously one of the more significant drivers in the country has been e commerce which isn t as bounded by the location of the consumer that s obviously the big benefit of the solution and that continues to be a very resonant platform for us with chinese consumers who are if not the world s leading most digitally savvy i don t know who is because they ve really embraced both mobile commerce and online commerce jim duffy stifel analyst that s great that s a good segue to my next question i wanted to ask where you guys feel you are in terms of leveraging tmall as it relates to growth in china and specifically growth in these new regions and i m curious does the new distribution center simplify logistics to support e commerce growth john vandemore chief financial office so tmall is a fantastic partner for skechers it has been for a very long time if you look at our tmall rankings by category they are very strong especially for an international brand we value those highly and we continue to work very closely with tmall to advance the brand both on the important selling days of the year like singles day but also around those the year in terms of the distribution center i think that s probably more a benefit from a skechers perspective for both operational efficiency and quite frankly ensuring that long term we have the availability and the reliance on systems that we know across the globe work very very well for us it doesn t really change how we interface with key platforms because the interface today is largely through third parties so i think net net it s probably long term a benefit to skechers i think if anything because of the reliability factor it will enhance our ability to interface with tmall and others but it s not really going to be a major change in that relationship from kind of a strategic standpoint jim duffy stifel analyst very good thank you john vandemore chief financial office thank you operator we have time for one last question our last question comes from the line of tom nikic with wells fargo please proceed with your question tom nikic wells fargo analyst hey john hey david thanks for squeezing me in here john david just wanted to ask it seems like based on your guidance you are really accelerating the pace of u s store openings this year i think you said 75 to 85 stores in the u s which is a pretty significant increase from what you ve done in recent years i realize you re comping pretty strongly domestically but i m just kind of wondering what drove that decision to sort of step on the gas pedal as far as physical store opening go and if there s anything i don t know from an expense standpoint or deleverage standpoint we should think about in terms of the accelerated store opening john vandemore chief financial office i mean the first and foremost we are cautious about how and where we open stores we don t keep unprofitable stores by and large so we re opening profitable stores the stores we re opening right now are our big box format so they re a family solution that offers the whole range of the product we are seeing very advantageous rates in some very attractive locations where we believe there s an opportunity to grow the business we re obviously cautious about cannibalizing any presence in market but even with 800 stores as a company we feel there s a lot of opportunity across the globe to continue to grow out our store count we also think as david mentioned earlier and i think it s important it s a compliment to the online capability right our ability to deliver an omnichannel solution needs a physical presence as well as an online presence and a mobile presence so it s really a complementary delivery system and presence for consumers and whether it s online predominantly and in the supplement on the retail footprint or vice versa so as part of the strategy most importantly to get closer to consumers and again i just probably would just state the obvious obviously we don t feel like we re fully penetrated in the united states we feel like there s significant room to run and again with the advantageous rates we re seeing lease rates these will be profitable locations david weinberg chief operating officer it s good to keep in mind also that we re not chasing what seems to be a deteriorating marketplace here in the united states we re going to smaller cities we re not conflicted with other of our own stores some of them are the first ones in the city or the first ones in that neighborhood and it will like john says go together with our online presence to be able to see them and because there are larger multi stores that are outside of malls and current economics work very well and are not required to you don t require the same sort of turnover as you do in some of the malls we ve been in so when you put the economics together with the isolation in some of these territories it s worked very very well for us tom nikic wells fargo analyst thanks guys operator i d like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks unidentified speaker
