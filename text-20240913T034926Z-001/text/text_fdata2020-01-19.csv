the kiwi dollar has traded within a 0 6600 to 0 6660 band over this last week against the usd and has been unable to scale the heights of 0 6750 reached in illiquid holiday market conditions over the first few days of january there has been no domestic economic news of any note to influence the exchange rate significantly up or down apart from a marginal improvement in business confidence in the nzier quarterly survey results the manufacturing pmi index fell in the december month to 49 3 from 51 4 in november the result was less than prior market expectations so was a negative factor on the kiwi dollar pulling it back from 0 6650 to 0 6615 on friday 17 january the local economic performance remains mildly positive with retail construction and housing improvements countering off against a decidedly flatter trajectory for tourism and manufacturing currently the one disappointing and concerning development in the nz economy as a new year commences is that confidence spending and investment levels in the dominant agricultural sector are poor despite record high prices for livestock and produce in normal times of super high export commodity prices our farmers would be buoyant and upbeat typically there would be a major economic impulse coming out of the rural regions with plenty of cash sloshing around sadly today many farmers are grumpy and disillusioned as they face multiple bureaucratic interventions on how they farm their land and run their businesses the current government and other agencies are forcing unknown costs and compliance regimes on farmers from water to methane to health safety to pointless resource consents the environmental climate change lobby is enforcing impositions on our major industry that if continued will lower economic growth and living standards in new zealand the mainstream media centred in the cities generally has a poor understanding of the significance of these farming issues however the sector still powers the economy spending and investment levels in the dairy sector are also muted despite the milk solid pay out returning to near record high levels bank lenders are requiring debt reductions ahead of re investment in productive capacity the horticulture industry however goes from strength to strength with kiwifruit and apple exports continuing to increase unfortunately rural new zealand has diminishing political clout due to population changes to challenge several current government policy initiatives that appear to be anti farming rbnz to remain on hold for all of 2020 the next piece of data in the local nz economic jigsaw is the inflation outcome for the december quarter on friday 24 january consensus forecasts are for a 0 40 quarterly increase which will lift the annual inflation rate from 1 50 to 1 80 hardly a trend that justifies any consideration from the rbnz of further interest rate cuts or money market forward pricing of such a result above 0 40 will be positive for the kiwi dollar we will hear next from the rbnz on 12 february with their monetary policy statement a feature of their updated economic prognosis should be the material reduction in global economic risks with a truce in the china us trade war and brexit finally happening no doubt they will find some other economic headwinds elsewhere to be overly cautious about however in reality there is no economic trend or forecast to be negative about currently the flip flopping of the rbnz from overtly dovish to not dovish on the economic outlook has caused a good deal of the volatility in the nzd usd exchange rate over the last 24 months it is past time that they display some consistency in their outlook as our actual economic growth performance has been much more consistent in the 2 to 3 area than the central bank s changeable viewpoint i do not expect the rbnz s decisions this year with monetary policy to impact nz dollar movements at all as they are on hold with interest rate changes and will stay that way all through 2020 aud under valuation over due for recognition the australian dollar has not matched the kiwi dollar s impressive 6 recovery upwards against the usd over recent months the aud exchange rate against the usd has only appreciated 2 7 from a low of 0 6700 in early october to 0 6880 today currency speculators in the aud have not unwound short sold positions as much as the kiwi dollar speculators did in late december despite the terrible bushfires causing some minor uncertainties for the australian economy at the moment their outlook is also positive with global trade and industrial production expected to improve now the trade war and brexit risks have reduced on many counts the australian dollar is considered undervalued today as investment funds moved out of the aud 12 to 24 months ago and have not yet returned it only seems a matter of time before the undervalued position of the aud is more fully recognised and funds rotating out of safe haven currencies like the yen and usd will buy the aussie the australian economy is heavily dependent upon china the chinese government has made policy changes to get the phase 1 trade deal done with the americans and they have also loosened monetary policy of late to keep the growth engine going the chinese are also continuing as expected to strengthen the yuan currency value now at 6 86 to the usd over the first half of 2019 the vast majority of australian bank and global investment bank economist forecasts were for the australian housing market to plummet the economy to go into recession and the rba to slash interest rates to zero they were all wrong none of those things happened the australian dollar is over due for a re rating upwards against the usd the kiwi dollar s out performance of the aud against the usd has driven the nzd aud cross rate up from 0 9230 in november to a high of 0 9700 on 8th january over the last five years the bottom of the nzd aud trading range has progressively lifted upwards from 0 9000 to 0 9100 to 0 9200 the local aud exporters who have maintained a discipline of increasing hedging percentages in the 0 9200 0 9300 area have again been well rewarded over coming

victor fedeli ontario s minister for economic development job creation and trade suggests that the province could become the gateway for indian auto inc home to the top five global oems over 700 suppliers and 500 tool and mould makers ontario might just be the prescription that india auto inc needs victor fedeli ontario s minister for economic development job creation and trade suggests that the province could become the gateway for indian auto inc to take advantage of nafta how does your experience as a successful entrepreneur help you in your current role as the minister of economic development job creation and trade we have made ontario open for business jobs and trade that is done by looking at all the areas in ontario that were obstructing businesses from growth we have been doing this since the past 16 months since our government is in office we are reducing the cost of doing business by 5 billion canadian dollars rs 26 990 crore through reduction of taxes accelerated cost allowance businesses can write off their new equipment in a year reduce their insurance premium all of the things that a government can control we have reduced those costs as a result business communities have hired 256 000 employees in the past 16 months to put that in perspective ontario s total population is 14 million the other area that we have focused on is reducing red tape that has been obstructing growth by next year the policy will help reduce cost to business by almost 400 million canadian dollars rs 2 160 crore the global auto industry has seen a consistent slowdown ontario recently announced a stimulus worth 10 million canadian dollars how does this kind of stimulus help the industry automotive is an important segment and we are the no 2 jurisdiction in all of north america just behind michigan ontario is the only province in canada which manufactures automobiles we manufacture just under two million vehicles while michigan produces just over two million vehicles which gives an idea of the scale we have a new programme called driving prosperity to feature the automotive sector when put together there are more than 1 000 tool and die makers and parts manufacturers in ontario this package offers support to those organisations and we have had huge success the centre for intelligent antenna and radio systems ciars is an established research facility in canada and works on innovation in all aspects of electromagnetic communication and sensing science and engineering this year toyota motor announced a 1 4 billion canadian dollar rs 7 557 crore investment in its facility in ontario the carmaker also announced that the new line of the lexus nx will be manufactured in ontario and for the third year in a row they won the jd power award platinum award making them the no 1 auto plant in the world that tells the rest of the world that we know how to make cars and are leaders in advanced manufacturing in ontario one of the focus areas for your visit is to further grow trade between india and ontario how do you view the make in india initiative it works both ways we see the two way trade between ontario and india quite frankly to be very small for me this offers a great opportunity the two way trade between japan and ontario is estimated to be around 13 billion canadian dollars rs 70 122 crore in comparison the trade between india and ontario is just 3 2 billion canadian dollars rs 17 260 crore that tells us that there is a great opportunity to increase the dollar volume canadian 2 8 billion dollars rs 15 103 crore is from india to ontario and only 400 million canadian dollars rs 2 158 crore is from ontario to india so we see a huge opportunity to grow ontario is also the no 2 it cluster in all of north america just behind silicon valley there are more than 22 000 it companies with more than 300 000 employees which again is big potential why is this important because when you marry the two auto and it you have got one province having expertise in both we have seen ford in the connected and autonomous vehicle sector general motors opening a facility in the autonomous vehicle sector and also uber recently inaugurating a facility in toronto the first outside of the usa this is propelling ontario to be a centre which would be of interest to indian companies in november 2019 gurgaon headquartered vvdn technologies announced it will open a facility in ontario with 250 300 engineers in november 2017 eesl and energypro had partnered with battery storage solutions provider leclanche with an initial investment of 12 million rs 75 crore for the utility scale canadian energy storage project what is its current status i cannot speak on the specifics of this project but i can tell you ontario is a mineral rich province we have three different areas which are exciting for battery technologies we have cobalt which is of importance in battery manufacturing and it happens to be in the eponymous town of cobalt in ontario lithium material is present in the far western north area of ontario and graphene in northern ontario all three states are looking to open up their mines for servicing battery production this utility scale project was designed to assist in balancing ontario s electricity system grid by providing grid ancillary services such as reactive power voltage support and frequency regulation the project completed the first 2 phases in 2018 representing 4 mw or 14 mwh of battery capacity after completion of the project the storage capacity will increase to 30 mw or 20 mwh on november 28 2018 in mumbai camm inked an mou with tagma clockwise tara scheurwater senior trade commissioner in western india for ontario annie dube consul general canada dr terrie romano counsellor economic affairs ontario rakesh naidu coo windsor essex economic development corporation d k sharma president tools and gauge manufacturers association of india tagma and jonathon azzopardi president canadian association of moldmakers camm india can benefit from learnings that ontario is gaining from this project and apply to its own evolving electricity system ontario is using several energy storage projects to study how energy storage facilities can be used to increase the efficiency of the system and utilise intermittent resources when they are needed in addition ontario is using energy storage to balance the electricity system s supply and demand on a second by second basis is that ev battery an area of focus to attract investment from india i have met with the owners of all mining companies dealing in cobalt lithium and graphene and all of them are looking for partners i am very eager to return home and talk about the opportunities with indian investors given the geo political situation in the usa and ongoing trade wars how do you think indian companies will benefit from investing in ontario there is an excellent opportunity under the new nafta north american free trade agreement a treaty between united states canada and mexico pact for indian companies to establish themselves in ontario as the gateway to north america there is 35 billion canadian dollars rs 190 365 crore in trade that companies of indian origin can establish in ontario and take advantage of the free trade between canada usa and mexico within the automotive sector we know the localisation is going to change and will increase from 62 5 percent to 75 percent for components we see this as a great opportunity for indian companies to enter what is the trade value between ontario and india has it grown in the past two years what share does the automotive industry account for in the bilateral trade in 2018 two way trade between ontario and india was valued at over 3 2 billion canadian dollars rs 17 299 crore making it ontario s 19th largest export partner in the world two way trade between canada and india has grown at a rate of 10 per cent over the last six years and that number continues to strengthen in 2018 automotive exports to india totalled 3 8 million and imports from india totalled 470 557 million rs 2 540 crore with two way automotive trade valued at 474 357 million rs 2 562 crore can you detail the indian automakers who are looking to or have already established manufacturing operations in ontario there are currently over 50 indian companies with investments in ontario and we are working hard to increase that number for example in 2017 indian automotive component maker hi tech gears acquired guelph based teutech industries a component manufacturer with facilities in ontario and pennsylvania the investment partnership goes both ways for example markham based parts supplier novo plastics has a sales engineering and development office in gurgaon india we believe that the growing strategic partnerships between ontario and india will lead to further opportunities for bilateral trade and investment what incentives is the canadian government offering india auto inc to set up manufacturing in the country as the only province or state in north america with five oems ontario has the right environment for automotive investment and expansion the automotive parts manufacturers association s connected vehicle technology demonstrator is an ontario built lexus rx350 fitted with integrated connectivity components from 13 canadian sources by selecting ontario companies are choosing a stable and competitive business landscape and can have confidence in the province s long term political and economic outlook the ontario government is also committed to working closely with the canadian federal government on building infrastructure and promoting economic development ontario has some of the most competitive corporate tax rates lower than the g7 average the money companies save by doing business in the province allows them to further invest in innovation and growth and create jobs along the way ontario also offers an environment full of top tier talent both from home and abroad 68 percent of ontario adults possess a post secondary education a rate higher than any oecd country and our universities and colleges provide a stream of high quality graduates in fact the university of toronto ranks among the top 20 global universities and university of waterloo graduates are the second most frequently hired by silicon valley companies global expansion is an important part of a company s lifecycle and india is a great place for our automotive companies to invest with the indian robotics and ict sectors on the rise ontario can take advantage of a growing thriving ecosystem while also using its expertise and know how to support the development of these sectors can you let us know the details of the partnership between camm and acma inked in 2018 the ontario government is thrilled about the partnership between camm and acma this is great news for both of our automotive sectors camm will be part of a larger ontario automotive delegation that will be showcasing canadian capabilities at the india auto expo 2020 in new delhi ontario companies and industry associations are excited by the prospect of partnership opportunities with their peers in the indian automotive sector during the interaction you mentioned that there is 35 billion canadian rs 190 365 crore in trade that companies of indian origins can establish in ontario and take advantage of the free trade between canada usa and mexico canada and by extension ontario is known as a trading market canada currently has free trade agreements with over 40 countries and is the only member of the g7 to have free trade agreements with all other g7 nations the north american free trade agreement between canada the united states and mexico has been in place for 25 years and represents the largest free trade region in the world by gdp companies that choose to expand and invest in ontario have access to this invaluable partnership the province is

over 300 regional airports in communities right across the province this interview was first published in the december 15 2019 anniversary issue of autocar professional
the us dominated the news stream at the start of 2020 the spasm in the us iran confrontation has quickly subsided the much heralded us china phase 1 trade deal has been signed the us has completed the ratification process of the us mexico canada free trade agreement the early signs from the economic entrails suggest the world s largest economy continue to enjoy a record long even if not robust expansion the focus shifts elsewhere in the week ahead for which the us sees a relatively light calendar of economic reports in a holiday shortened week then again the recent employment trade inflation and retail sales data offer valuable insight the course is set and the fed seems inclined to look beyond the near term economic fluctuations ensuring that the meeting at the end of the month is as close to a non event as an fomc meeting and a powell press conference can be there are four central bank meetings to note and none are likely to do anything so the words are more important than the actions the bank of japan begins with governor kuroda holding at the conclusion of the two day meeting on january 21 under the yield curve control initiative it puts the deposit minus 10 bp and targets the 10 year yield at zero 20 bp global tensions have eased and the yen has weakened to the lower end of where it has been in the past six months prime minister abe s fiscal support 122 bln and preparation for the olympics may also help the boj s efforts to support the economy the boj will provide updated forecasts in october it anticipated growth of 0 7 in fy20 and 1 0 in fy21 core inflation which excludes the price of fresh food was forecast to rise by 1 1 in fy20 and 1 5 in fy21 the forecast seems optimistic the bloomberg economists survey found median forecasts for 2020 growth at 0 5 and 0 7 in 2021 japan has not reported core cpi above 1 since april 2015 the tax increase will the optics but the boj and investors know better that said deflation has been halted and japan like many other countries is experiencing low inflation core cpi has been above zero since the end of 2016 policymakers and economists understood the tax increase would push economic activity in q3 from q4 the actions the government took were meant to ensure a quick rebound data from november suggests capex bounced back strongly and consumption slower while the easing of us china trade tensions helps lift uncertainty quantitative targets may give american companies an edge all else being equal the bank of canada s decision is the next day january 22 it is in a holding pattern the real sector data has disappointed even though employment in december recovered from the unexpected weakness in november firm inflation readings may be deterring the bank of canada from easing and the government is promising fiscal support the fact that the federal reserve is understood to be on hold also gives bank of canada officials some time though last year s three cuts by the us did not induce a move by canada shortly before the outcome of the meeting is announced canada will report december cpi figures the month over month pace declined in three of the four months through november by a cumulative 0 3 percentage points in the same period in 2018 the cumulative decline in the four months through november was twice as much the base effect seems behind the year over year rise of all the canadian measures above 2 also most economists expect the current run of soft data is not a prelude to a more severe slowdown about three quarters of the economists in a recent reuters survey expect the bank of canada to remain on hold into 2021 however officials are more optimistic than private sector economists the former see growth accelerating from about 1 7 to a little more than 2 0 in 2020 private economists according to the bloomberg survey see the growth slipping to 1 6 which would be the slowest pace in four years it may be helpful to review the status of the three drivers of the canadian dollar first commodities and oil have rallied into the end of last year but have eased at the start of 2020 the price of oil wti is off about 3 3 while the crb index fell by almost 2 second the canadian dollar typically appears to do better when there are strong risk appetites for which the s p 500 is a rough proxy investors are willing to take on risk with the s p 500 and its equivalent in europe dow jones stoxx 600 is also setting new record highs the msci emerging markets index has rallied for seven consecutive weeks the longest positive run since late 2017 and early 2018 the third driver of the us canada exchange rate is the interest rate differential canada s two year yield moved above the us last october but it dipped back below in the first part of november it has consistently remained above the us since early december the us offered almost 90 bp more than canada on 10 year notes in late q1 19 it offers about 25 bp now and has been consolidating for the last couple of months meanwhile speculative positioning in the futures market is biased toward a stronger canadian dollar the net long non commercial speculative position has seen a big jump since late last year and stood near 26 5k contracts in the most recent report that covered through january 7 the bulls have been driving it they added about 20k contracts notional value cad100k per over the past three reporting weeks to a gross long position of 68 8k contracts the most since mid november the bears have barely changed their gross exposure of around 42 4k short contracts norway s norges bank and the european central bank meet on january 23 norway is not in a hurry to do anything its deposit rate bottomed at 50 bp in 2016 and remained there until late 2018 when it began a series of four hikes through last september officials seem comfortable with the 1 5 deposit rate which is just above the december headline cpi print of 1 4 the underlying rate which excludes energy and adjusts for taxes stands at 1 8 the lowest since october 2018 the mainland economy grew by about 2 5 last year and is expected to slip below 2 according to the median forecast in the bloomberg survey but the government is projecting steady activity norway s central bank insulates the economy from the impact of the country s oil sales by funding its sovereign wealth fund this month it is selling an average of nok500 mln a day last year it averaged almost nok600 mln a month and in 2018 the monthly average was nok645 mln down from the 2017 average of nok845 mln a month the ecb meeting is not so much about policy as that seems set for the coming months instead the focus is on the strategic review that is being launched most discussions are on how the price stability objective can be clarified currently the target is expressed as close to but below 2 surveys suggest there is a high expectation for a symmetrical inflation target where equal weight would be given to too high as well as too low inflation and more importantly a period of undershooting could lead to greater willingness to accept an overshoot the ecb risks putting the cart before the horse in candid moments officials acknowledge that they do not fully understand why inflation is so low and so many different countries one must squint ones eyes and tilt the screen just so to see the relationship between labor market conditions and general price pressures it is not completely clear why negative interest rates have not spurred much of an increase in the general price level how can a strategic review be conducted without a great understanding of different macro relationships it is like the st louis fed president bullard argued several years ago under a certain paradigm the relationships are understood but the paradigm has shifted and new relationships have emerged there is a sense that things are not working optimally now and the central banks the fed too is conducting a strategic review without understanding why will seek to remedy the situation it reminds one of the story about the experiment where food is randomly put on the right side or the left side and after a bit the mouse stops going to one side at all and takes a 50 failure rate a person faced with the same challenge tries to outguess the random movement and ends up doing worse than the mouse it also begs the question does it matter imagine that at the conclusion of the strategic review the ecb announces that going forward it will target an average rate of inflation of two percent or that its inflation target is symmetrical will this make it more or less likely that the central bank will achieve its target maybe neither it is unlikely to disrupt markets i e change the market s course as it contains very little operational information while possible it seems unlikely that the ecb would give up seeking price stability directly through inflation targeting and shift to a nominal gdp target or unemployment this is to say that the strategic view is unlikely to produce a paradigmatic shift in fairness observers may be too focused on the inflation target ecb president lagarde will likely sketch out the broad parameters of the review it is bound to include a review of tools as well as communication decisions here may have far reaching implications while many press accounts make it seem as if negative interest rates have fallen out of a favor for example but lagarde provided a spirited defense at her first ecb meeting and or course the snb and boj defend it the central bank s balance sheet eurosystem is within its mandate as are the targeted long term refinancing operations loans but some evaluation of the relative merits is worth considering a review of the communications can also produce some important changes unlike other central banks the ecb s meeting record does not give room or recognize dissents too often it seems the losers of an issue have little place within the official communications to make their opinion known and take their case to the press at first decisions were made unanimously but as the institution grew and issues being more complex voting was introduced but rarely used according to reports a more formal process and one that makes room for and respects dissents seem a reasonable expectation
more than 300 people were injured on saturday during clashes between protesters and police in beirut as lebanon struggles to find a way out of its worst economic crisis in decades the protests first began last october after the government attempted to tax whatsapp users to generate funds for damage caused by wildfires some which protesters argued could have been avoided if the government had better prepared for the blazes already exhausted by water and electricity shortages and the rapid devaluation of the lebanese pound people took to the streets demanding the resignation of then lebanese prime minister saad hariri hariri resigned on october 29 but there have been major delays in forming a new cabinet hassan diab a university professor who is slated to become the next prime minister was expected to give an update on the formation of a new cabinet sunday but left a meeting with lebanese president michel aoun without doing so even before the absence of sunday s cabinet

will meet this requirement but protesters have signaled they do not trust him and that they do not want him as prime minister frustrated with this political impasse and a dismal economic outlook thousands of protesters gathered on saturday afternoon under the slogan we will not pay the price in reference to the country s crushing 87 billion debt according to the associated press clashes began when rioters threw stones and firecrackers at police dispatched near the parliament the authorities responded with water cannons and tear gas it was one of the most violent days since the protests

pic twitter com tjawucsywj luna safwan لونا صفوان lunasafwan january 19 2020 lebanon s economic crisis is exacerbating its political troubles although the protests in lebanon first began in october the frustrations that led to them have been increasing for years many have long been frustrated with what is seen as the corruption of elite politicians who took control of the country after the lebanese civil war ended in 1990 and it doesn t help the country s leaders have been ineffective at mending the worst economic crisis lebanon has faced in decades economic growth fell to 0 percent this year according to reuters and the country carries a debt of about 85 billion its current gdp is 55 billion meanwhile the unemployment rate for those under 35 has soared to 37 percent the value of the lebanese pound has fallen as prices increased a monetary situation worsened by a dearth of us dollars for the last 20 years lebanon has interchangeably used us dollars and the lebanon pound thanks to a central bank policy that set the exchanged rate at about 1 500 pounds to the dollar according to the new york times in theory using both currencies should pose no problems but to sustain the system lebanon has to continuously bring in new dollars something it did in the past largely by wooing investors the system began showing strain as local banks were required to honor high interest rates they had promised these investors and it was further taxed by difficulty in finding new investors who weren t frightened by regional turmoil without these foreign investors to funnel in more dollars into the market banks have been struggling to provide money to their everyday customers in response banks have been regulating the amount of money people can withdraw or transfer without access to their money even when they have money in their accounts people are struggling to pay basic necessities such as rent and so people have taken to the streets to protest i have seen a woman begging literally begging the bank employee and going on the floor and kissing it asking for her money khaled taki a 68 year old consultant from lebanon told france 24 they have your money and they will give it to you when they want to just like a father giving his son a weekly allowance he added coupled with the political turmoil the economic crisis threatens to have long lasting effects the world bank announced poverty rates could increase by 20 percent meaning half the country would be living in poverty if solutions to the political and economic impasses are not found according to al jazeera
thengadi s really bad arguments for swadeshi thengadi s book third way is available to download at all other works of thengadi are also available quite a prolific writer pity almost no one outside the rss has ever heard of him now that rss is ruling india it is crucial to understand these people i ve annotated this ridiculous chapter there is too much garbage here i ve just made a few comments since it is all so bad chapter 17 swadeshi the practical manifestation of patriotism in 1993 swadeshi has become a queer term a common man on the street is fairly familiar with its connotation but for uncommon men this is an unknown commodity for sophisticated air conditioned elite of the metropolitan cities the concept is strange an oddity in the midst of modernism for kept economists of the regime this is a red rag and for the ruling politicians a bull in their china shop so the abuses like obscurantism anachronism etc are being used to condemn the idea irreconcilable with the luxurious fashions what is most important is not the future of the country but the immediate comforts of the westernised urban elite these uncommon citizens are not in contact with the earth they are in their own ivory towers cut off from the national realities and alienated from their co countrymen fortunately the number of such persons is extremely limited not even one per cent of the total population of this poor country it is wrong to presume that swadeshi concerns itself only with the goods or services that is more an incidental aspect essentially it concerns the spirit determined to achieve national self reliance preservation of national sovereignty and independence and international co operation on equal footing swadeshi spirit inspired the britishers to restrain their head of the state from purchasing a luxurious german mercedez benz car for her personal use when asked by an indian correspondent as to why he was using a pant torn and stitched because of the weak texture of the vietnamese cloth ho chi minh smilingly replied my country can afford only this much when the u s forced japan to give market access to its californian oranges japanese customers did not purchase a single californian orange and thus rendered the american arm twisting a ridiculous affair when the governments of china and korea prevented the entry of michael jackson in their countries on the ground that his performance amounted to cultural invasion they only demonstrated their swadeshi spirit incidentally this gesture also indicated that swadeshi was not merely an economic affair confined to material goods but a broad based ideology embracing all departments of national life needless to multiply such incidents the point is that all these patriots from different countries drew their inspiration from the swadeshi spirit swadeshi is the outward practical manifestation of patriotism patriotism is not considered as isolationism particularly in our tradition which stands for integral humanism according to which on the level of human consciousness internationalism is the further flowering of the spirit of nationalism nevertheless it is noteworthy that presenting patriotism as isolationism is the usual practice of imperialist powers for example when after the end of the second world war it became obvious that under the pressure of the international situation the imperialists would be forced to grant independence to their colonies they started operation salvage to preserve as much of their vested interests in the colonies as possible under the changed circumstances in bharat some executive councillors of the viceroy became their tools misrepresenting the move for full fledged independence as isolationism sir c p ramaswami aiyar propagated that in the new era of internationalism our motto should be not independence but interdependence dr manmohan singh s plea for liberalisation and globalisation is the modern version of ramaswami s interdependence patriots are not against internationalism their plea for national self reliance is not incompatible with international co operation provided that the latter is on equal footing with due regard to the national self respect of every country their difference of opinion with the advocates of globalisation is on a different and more basic point proponents of swadeshi are not prepared to endorse the view that the western paradigm is the universal model of progress and development worthy of being followed by all the peoples of the world while they recognise the fact of cultural intercourse they insist that every people have each their own distinct culture and the model of progress and development for each country should be consistent with its own cultural ethos westernisation is not modernisation modernisation should be in keeping with the spirit of national culture they oppose the move for steam rolling all the various cultures and national identities in the world in favour of the west introduction of modern technology and economic system is the inauguration of an entirely new civilisation inconsistent with the nature of all non western cultures this is the basic point of difference nevertheless americanised indians are condemning swadeshi jagaran manch on the plea that swadeshi is the antithesis of the sacred and universally accepted principle of free trade which is being recognised and followed by all the countries it has become imperative therefore to examine thoroughly the free trade principle and its position in the field of the current international trade liberalisation free trade though preached earlier by adam smith himself the principle of free trade acquired unchallenged legitimacy after the publication of ricardo s principles of political economy in 1817 the intellectual foundations of comparative advantage theory became unshakable essentially the principle declared that unhindered play of market forces was the best way of obtaining an optimum trading pattern based on the ricardian model of comparative advantage and the hecksher ohlin theorem the theory claimed that free trade enables each country to specialise in its production and to make optimal use of its scarce resources from the early 19th century until the late 1970s international trade theory was dominated by the concept of comparative advantage which implies that countries trade to take advantage of their differences economies were assumed to be characterised by constant returns to scale and perfect competition difference lay in tastes technology or factor endowment within the framework of the theory there might have been differences in emphasis for example the ricardian model emphasises technological differences as the cause of trade while the hecksher ohlin samuelson model emphasises differences in factor endowments but still until 1970s the validity of the comparative advantage theory was accepted in countries like the us the uk and the netherlands it was accepted as a doctrine in forming state trade policies though countries such as france italy and the federal republic of germany did not accept the free trade theory as an official trade policy doctrine the gatt became the embodiment of the free trade theory it has been rightly said that gatt has as its building blocks the philosophy of free trade nevertheless since the late 1950s doubts began to arise about the full validity of the free trade theory can comparative advantage theory explain fully the modern developments in the international trade since 1970 the scepticism about the free trade theory has progressively intensified the theory of comparative advantage was based upon the assumption of perfectly competitive markets and constant returns but as krugman points out it was however realised that international markets are not perfectly competitive and that they are imperfectly competitive increasing returns held the key to the operation of these markets the advantages of which can be appropriated only by the dominant firms in the market the advantages once appropriated become the basis for further gains in the market experts like winfried ruigrok felt that by free trade theory international capital flows such as foreign direct investment fdi could not be accounted for the production process as such was not analysed at all technological development was assumed to be transparent and available to all neither the economics of scale nor the rapid increase of fdi could be explained by free trade theory the efficient allocation of scarce resources has never been the sole consideration in this matter ruigrok poses a question why do governments sometimes choose not to comply with the free trade norms the answer to this question reveals according to him a fundamental flaw in the postulates of the free trade doctrine contrary to its fundamental premise the efficient allocation of scarce resources has never been and will never be the sole consideration in the choice of state policies state policies are based on a mixture of political social economic and military considerations national security and preservation of the internal order have been and will remain more important concerns than maximising efficiency again a case for strategic intervention to provide advantages for the domestic firms by adopting policies that would discriminate against the foreign firms appeared to be gaining greater support brander suggested subsidies to strengthen the position of a domestic firm engaged in competition for the world market with a foreign rival spencer also put forth a similar suggestion for subsidies there was a growing feeling that import restrictions and export subsidies may in certain circumstances be in the national interest the case of japan granting 700 per cent subsidy to its rice farmers and imposing 700 per cent duty on import of foreign rice illustrates this point sometimes governments act not necessarily in the national interest but under the pressure of domestic pressure groups during the latter half of the 1980s the adherents of free trade acknowledged that their basic argument was challenged seriously government intervention could lead to profit shifting from one country to another under such circumstances countries following the traditional rules of free trade would inevitably transfer wealth to their trading partners the term competitive advantage became preferable to comparative advantage in 1980s japan s successful export drive to the ec and us has proved how competitive advantage could be created during the 1970s and 1980s experts increasingly believed free trade model to be sacrosanct but paul krugman says free trade is an idea that has irretrievably lost its innocence during this period the traditional models of international trade have been supplemented and sometimes even supplanted by a new breed of models that emphasises economies of scale increasing returns and imperfect competition the dynamic scale economies are associated with investment knowledge and r d today the general trend is to believe that comparative advantage is an incomplete model of trade and also to believe simultaneously that free trade is nevertheless the right policy krugman informs us that this is the position taken by most of the new trade theorists themselves so free trade is not passe but it is not what it once was the case for free trade is currently more in doubt than at any time since the 1817 publication of ricardo s principles of political economy in the uruguay round of negotiations unqualified support for the free trade framework has been espoused and simultaneously increase in protectionism and threat of intervention in the markets of partner countries to seek enlarged access to exports have been adopted by united states in formulating its trade strategy in spite of all the propaganda in favour of free trade concept ruigrok informs us that the pattern of global trade looks as follows approximately 25 takes place inside global companies intra company trade approximately 25 is bilateral trade by preferential agreements approximately 25 is barter trade approximately 25 can be considered free trade governed by gatt rules the author has quoted this from fast forecasting and assessment in science and technology while advocating the principle of free trade the us has been following the policy of protectionism regarding textiles right from 1956 when the president was given the authority under the agriculture act to negotiate agreements for limiting imports into the united states of textiles or textile products in the 1980s the us administration employed non tariff barriers to insulate the us automobile industry from the competitive threat that as in the case of textile industry was posed by japanese imports as james dunn points out post war international trade in automobiles has always been a mixture of liberalising and protecting elements japan is in many cases a one way trader not importing any of the product categories it exploits the same is the case with the japanese foreign investment imbalance as on 31 march 1990 japanese direct investment abroad amounted to seventeen times the value of fdi in japan japanese competitiveness and huge trade and investment imbalances have contributed according to experts to the ec and us conflicts with japan in industrial products toyotism of japanese industry has given it a great advantage over fordism of the us and ec industries to cite a single example in the 1960s and 1970s the ec s ship building industry could not stand a threat from japanese ship building companies aggressive marketing strategies with the present growth of japan s foreign direct investments in the ec and the us the industries of the latter are demanding more trade barriers and greater protection though recently japanese economy also is showing signs of decay it is interesting to note that criticism of free trade doctrine has been gaining ground as the ec and the us have been meeting with increasingly fierce competition in a number of industries many of the earlier champions of the doctrine are today its critics the opportunism is not a new phenomenon when german goods were dominating british markets britain was the worst critic of free trade principle after industrial revolution the equation changed and britain became the best champion of free trade doctrine the current american concept of fairness in trade reminds biswajit dhar of gladstone s remark made more than a century ago under a similar situation it fairness in trade bears suspicious likeness to our old friend protection the decline in the economic strength of the united states started in the 1960s the process of the end of its hegemony commenced around 1973 by the 1980s the united states had come to be established as the economic power going rapidly down hill several authors like linder and others have predicted the end of the us hegemony in the international economy during the early period of the next century with every new set back the us has been deviating progressively from the principle of free trade and by this time it has completely abandoned that once sacred doctrine these recent developments and deviations in the us trade strategy have been aptly elaborated by biswajit dhar in his the decline of free trade and us trade policy today at the level of policy the demise of non interventionist mode can be seen clearly in the case of us where trade administration has adopted an activist trade policy particularly during the last two decades while the increased dose of protectionism formed the core of the nature of state intervention in the earlier years seeking increased market access to us products by compelling its partner countries to change their policies and become more open has been the present line of its policy protectionism has now become the sole thrust of the policy initiative in recent years trade legislation in us since 1974 indicates this trend the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of 1988 particularly through its two new provisions namely super 301 and special 301 unfolds fully the intentions of the policy makers the protectionist measures adopted by the us have abrogated the basic principles of non intervention in trade underlying the post war trading system governed by the gatt rules specific and systematic trade barriers have been raised by the us in violation of the gatt rules this has grossly undermined the multi lateral trading system in response to the competitive threats from japan and other newly exporting countries the us curbed imports by using increasing doses of protectionism achieved through imposition of the non tariff barriers and increased exports by forcing open foreign markets using the powers of trade retaliation that were assumed by the us president through the trade acts of 1974 and 1988 the first phase gave protection to domestic producers against imports quota restrictions on exports to the us were imposed the us trade administration frequently imposed voluntary export restraints vers and orderly marketing arrangements omas on several countries the more prominent industries that were provided import protection were steel automobiles textiles machine tools and semiconductors section 301 of the 1974 act was directed at the policies of foreign governments which did not provide free access to us products in their markets in 1985 the insurance industry in korea was targeted for this purpose the action under section 301 of the 1974 act was initiated between 1985 and 1988 when the omnibus trade and competitiveness act was passed section 301 was introduced to deal with cases relating to insufficient protection of intellectual property rights of us origin under super 301 action could be initiated against the entire gamut of trade and trade related policies that the infringing partners were following in retaliation against a sector or an industry specific infringement in other words super 301 provided for cross retaliation between sectors secondly super 301 introduced a time frame for identifiable specific cases of trade distortions and initiating cases against countries which according to the us were obstructing us exports the cases under super 301 were to be initiated in 1989 and 1990 and the retaliatory action against the identified infringing countries was to be carried out within 180 days of establishing that trade distortions were liable for retaliation special 301 covers infringement of intellectual property rights of us origin causing distortions in us exports special 301 was to ensure that us exports could be increased by compelling countries to provide a stronger monopoly to us commercial interests in their markets through an appropriate system of intellectual property protection that the us trade administration deemed fit unlike provisions under section 337 the special 301 provision did not put the onus on the complainant to prove the injury the us international trade commission was simply required to institute inquiry into the complaint and grant protection all within 90 days of the registering of the complaint in may 1989 the ustr identified three countries india japan and brazil and put them on the list of priority countries for action under super 301 and six trade distorting practices the priority practices of these countries were identified india was found to restrict us exports from entering into markets through following two priority practices foreign inventors in the country were required to export a part of the produce and to use locally produced inputs thereby causing trade distortions and us service industries were prevented from competing in the indian market india s market was completely closed to foreign insurance companies a new list of priority practices under super 301 was issued in april 1990 the list had two cases and both involved india the two priority practices of india listed in 1989 were again included in the 1990 list japan and brazil were excluded trade barriers to insurance and investment in india were particularly irritating to the u s in 1989 and 1990 four countries india china thailand and brazil were put on the priority watch list in april 1991 ustr decided to initiate proceedings under the special 301 clause india china and thailand were named as priority countries for action under special 301 the us is insisting upon free trade and the so called liberalisation the us experts have excelled goebbels in the propaganda techniques repeat a lie hundred times and it becomes the truth goebbels said hitler went a step further he said that if a lie is to be circulated you should not give a simple lie but give a big bluff so big that people will not be able because of the magnitude of the given lie to suspect that such a big news may be a lie because of the american propaganda the doctrine of economic liberalisation became popular in the last two decades de regulation and privatisation have acquired respectability and authenticity the imf and the world bank have been striving to sell liberalisation doctrine to the third world countries by imposing on the debtor countries the policy of economic liberalisation as a condition of further credit the gatt and the us are preaching the free trade principle as a sacred gospel truth but the us is itself violating this sacred principle the us is also violating the standards evolved by the international organisation for standardisation the us public procurement policies are not in conformity with the gatt government procurement code buy american restrictions cover a vast area there were thirty one significant cases of special protection which covered four broad sectors manufacturing mining agriculture and fisheries some other services also are being given protection it is subsidising heavily its farm sector while demanding that other countries should withdraw all subsidies to that sector it is following double standards in case of the pharmaceutical sector also these are clearly unprincipled bullying tactics the culprits in this crime are the rulers and the big capitalists of the us not its common masses who are themselves kept in the dark about developments on the economic front these bullying tactics are being employed not only against the southern developing countries but also against european community and north american peoples the recent militant reaction of french farmers and the strong support given to their gesture by farmers of the european countries the agitation of the working people of the us against the north american free trade agreement nafta the effective protest registered by canadian voters against the ruling party that became a signatory to the notorious nafta the demonstration on 2 october by 12 purely american organisations of environmentalists and humanitarians against the modus operandi of cargill all these indicate that the unholy alliance between the rulers and the big capitalists of us is operating not only against the third world countries but also against other developed white countries and even against the less privileged masses of us itself and these culprits are the champions of free trade liberalisation and globalisation a case of satan quoting the bible to sum up in its present form liberalisation of the gatt and the us is a downright fraud liberalisation of dr manmohan singh is sheer gullibility liberalisation of our air conditioned radicals is ignorance or hypocrisy liberalisation is a grave challenge to patriots of all non american countries hence the propriety and urgency of swadeshi for all non american peoples of the world genuine liberalisation and hegemonic globalisation can never go together the hindu concept of globalisation represents genuine globalisation the hindu version of globalisation is fairly well known to all hindus who are not self alienated for them the elaboration of hindu concept may be a superfluous repetition of whatever they know already for the benefit of the de hinduised hindus a brief restatement of the same may however be helpful here pandit deendayal upadhyaya who could conceive of the central state authority without stateism envisaged evolution of the world state enriched by the growth and contribution of different national cultures as well as the flowering of the manava dharma enriched by the perfection of all the religions including materialism revered shri guruji believed that the world unity and human welfare could be made real only to the extent mankind realised the ultimate absolute vedantic truth that all is one what he implied was not elimination of all distinctive features of nations and rolling them all into one uniform pattern he visualised various groups of peoples coming together in a spirit of familism realising the innate oneness of mankind while preserving their individual identities and special characteristics the different human groups are marching forward all towards the same goal each in its own way and in keeping with its own characteristic genius the destruction of the special characteristics whether of an individual or of a group will destroy not only the natural beauty of harmony but also its joy of self expression to seek harmony among the various and diverse characteristics has been our special contribution to world thought shri guruji says the world state of our concept will evolve out of a federation of autonomous and self contained nations under a common centre linking them all it is the grand world unifying thought of hindus alone that can supply the abiding basis for human brotherhood that knowledge of the inner spirit will charge the human mind with the sublime urge to toil for the happiness of mankind while opening out full and free scope for every small life speaciality on the face of the earth to its full stature verily this is the one real practical world mission if ever there was one this hindu concept has been elucidated elaborately by rishi aurobindo who envisaged the still further stage of mass spiritualism with this mental background our rishis conceived of the one world state from sea to sea over all land one state this is genuine globalisation in its absence the world cannot go beyond the abortive experiments of the league of nations or the uno without the growth of such hindu i e human consciousness it

onecoin is among the most blatant shocking and fascinating crypto scams of them all and yet it has somehow managed to fly under the radar the opinions expressed in this special editorial report does not necessarily reflect the opinion of bitrates or its staff while bitconnect has left its mark in the meme folklore as the paragon of the unabashed frauds that emerge from that murky period of crypto mooning driven by speculative frenzies exaggerated promises and opportunism there is an even more outrageous ponzi scheme that attempted to take advantage of the success of cryptocurrency surpassing other scams in the surprising and unusual scope of its networks and scale of its operations and yet this massive fraud has been given much less media attention and has been largely allowed to go under the radar the massive fraud in question is onecoin an unoriginal and badly put together scam that s fairly obvious for most people who have any clue about cryptocurrency startups or finance onecoin was organized and promoted by known fraudsters in the wake of the cryptocurrency craze as a private blockchain crypto coin and a bitcoin killer but was running an sql server in the back end basically consisting of little more than an excel spreadsheet and a fugazi web portal displaying provably fake transactions norwegian developer bjorn bjercke who onecoin tried to hire at one point to somehow magically turn their sql server into a blockchain describes the individuals behind it as worse than criminals the ponzi scheme had been running via two offshore companies onecoin ltd in dubai and onelife network ltd in belize founded by self entitled doctor ruja ignatova together with sales con man and serial scammer sebastian greenwood in 2014 us prosecutors have alleged the scheme has brought in 4 billion worldwide from victims in its five year history to put that in perspective madoff s scam the biggest in history is 65 billion much of the money has been siphoned into property deals and to a host of questionable individuals and companies in ruja s native bulgaria and elsewhere including former politicians well connected businessmen and people with links to organized crime including to alleged organized crime figures of the rank of bulgarian cocaine king hristofos amanatidis who was charged in absentia with drug offenses by bulgarian police as mentioned the founders of the scheme originate from and are formally based in the small balkan kleptocracy of bulgaria a rather bleak and depressing post communist trainwreck of a state known for its levels of all permeating corruption and organized crime as well as its status as the poorest most miserable member state of the eu after the collapse of the soviet union most of eastern europe went through the turbulent transition times of the 1990 s when following the institutional collapses and widespread political economic and social crises the line between legal and illegal was soon blurred or altogether wiped out witnessing at times a merging of mafia and state british journalists mischa glenny who also wrote darkmarket cyberthieves cybercops and you in 2011 in which he documents the rise of cybercrime identity theft and credit card fraud in post communist eastern europe describes the rise of global organized crime in that period in his mcmafia a journey through the global criminal underworld which coincidentally begins with the case of bulgaria as the archetypal example of its subject matter arguably bulgaria may be the only such post communist country left which hasn t yet managed to purge itself from these criminal undercurrents which on their part have managed to completely usurp and colonize the state apparatus and government institutions in those 30 years since then all this provides some important background and context since onecoin and ruja ignatova recently re surfaced in bulgarian media with the transferring of ruja s company assets and real estate properties she managed to acquire key and even historically emblematic properties in central sofia the country s capital city to the companies of emil hursev known bulgarian businessman and financier who was the deputy director of the bulgarian national bank during the financial and political crisis and sudden hyperinflation of 1996 1997 a time well remembered in the country s recent history and a turning point in the so called transition period when people s savings along with the massive debts of so called credit millionaires privileged individuals at the time who took large loans from banks without ever intending to pay them back were evaporated overnight in an allegedly and very plausibly orchestrated operation meant to enrich a selected few and help them seize the state s assets and power mechanisms at the expense of the people hursev has since been eagerly servicing the interests of anybody willing to pay for them or for his public opinions and expertise on the country s problems in grappling with getting capitalism right and purging itself from the old socialist mentality and habits ignatov s entry at the federal bureau of prisons ruja ignatova who had already been convicted of 24 counts of fraud in germany back in 2012 conveniently vanished in 2017 having been last seen in bangkok since most of her operations targeted china india and southeast asia and was replaced by her brother konstantin ignatov near the time a quiet us warrant was filed for her arrest the majority of the top leaders of the pyramid scheme around the world have now disappeared or have been arrested konstantin ignatov himself was arrested in march this year charged by the us justice department with wire fraud securities fraud and money laundering and sebastian greenwood was arrested in thailand in 2018 and extradited to the us ignatov s court hearing is scheduled for 26th of april and it s interesting to mention who is to represent him a check at pacer public access to court electronic papers reveals this to be jeffrey lichtman known criminal defense attorney famous for defending john gotti and el chapo ruja ignatova s brother konstantin before his arrest at the los angeles airport a recording of ignatov with another co founder is said to have captured ignatov saying that as you told me the network would not work with intelligent people it is quickly evident that the scheme specifically targets idiots and people who are not intelligent or less educated or knowledgable about either the technology or financial markets in general employing in the process the same familiar cheap tricks and ploys to appeal to people s emotions and lower instincts rather than their informed judgment as investors in their presentations and on social media onecoin mostly just copy pastes often even literally fragments and cliches from elsewhere in the crypto world and compares itself to bitcoin pulling arbitrary or made up numbers and charts explaining how their enterprise will overshadow bitcoin as a second generation crypto coin but never touching upon any hypothetical technicalities goals or roadmaps utility or purpose on 17 and 18 january 2018 bulgarian police finally raided onecoin s office in central sofia bulgaria at the request of the prosecutor s office in bielefeld germany the onecoin logo had been proudly displayed in front of that office for a very long time despite the common knowledge that their operations were shady german police and europol took part in the bust and the investigation also 14 other companies tied to onecoin were investigated and 50 witnesses questioned onecoin s servers and other material evidence were seized but apart from some promotional pens and notebooks barely anything of much use as evidence in court appears to have been found at least by initial reports onecoin s office located in a key building in the center of the bulgarian capital sofia just in front of the city library on the famous slaveykov square over the past couple of months more and more juicy details about onecoin and ruja ignatova s operations have been coming to light in ignatova s native bulgaria herself of romani gypsy origin and having lived in the northern province of pleven until the age of 10 when her family relocated to germany some time in the 2010 s ignatova and her dad ran into trouble when they were convicted of 24 counts of fraud in germany stemming from the 2012 bankruptcy of waltenhofen steelworks where they are said to have stolen over 1 million eur which could have provided the initial capital necessary for such large scale operation across a number of jurisdictions around the globe according to the tech blog questona com ignatova s name is listed in the commercial register of bulgaria as the executive of at least 30 companies and as the sole owner of the capital of at least 5 companies some of the companies ignatova is related with had been a representative of or participated in the board of directors of are part of the csif clever synergies investment fund a private investment company set up in 2005 and run by tsvetelina borislavova former girlfriend and spouse of prime minister boyko borisov whose shady background and involvements with organized crime are not a secret borislavova describes herself as a supporter of the esoteric spiritual approach to money felt through the prism of personal growth because we can not use as an opportunity for personal growth something we have not gained by our own efforts and we do not treat it with care and love tsvetelina borislavova and bulgarian prime minister boyko borisov borisov is well known for his connections to organized crime which helped him rise to power in the 1990s as the bodyguard of the country s last communist dictator his own approach to politics resembles an attempt to copy the same archetypal mannerisms in establishing an authoritarian dictatorship with all institutions under his direct control via people from his own party brazenly called citizens for the european development of bulgaria development here really means opportunities for party members to loot and pocket eu funds and subsidies to break the law and to behave with impunity so long as one is willing to stay predictable and loyal in other words a cabinet and a government held together by corruption nepotism gossip and intrigue where nobody s iq or talent should surpass that of the boss this i d say is a fairly accurate characterization of borisov s style of leadership another curious detail is doctor ruja s tactics for creating the illusion of legitimacy around her in 2015 she was among the speakers at the fourth eu southeast europe summit organized by the prestigious magazine the economist interestingly then president rosen plevneliev who according to many had been hired by borisov to help deliberately sabotage the elections and mobilize his cronies secretaries and minions was also present among the speakers plevneliev is also nowadays acting in the role of advisor for shady icos he can also be found proudly presenting himself on the cover of forbes bulgaria as an early bitcoin pioneer and entrepreneur ex president rosen plevneliev an ico advisor is also a wealthy businessman and a rabid russophobe whose entire political career and platform is based on his persistent rhetoric of demonizing russia and the old regime of which he likes to present himself a poor repressed victim in the name of the new democratic values of euro atlanticism free market capitalism and business opportunity despite the contradiction inherent in leading a mafia driven monopoly over almost all public and private sectors in the country during his tenure plevneliev played the role of the innocent face and entrepreneurial spirit of the honest successful man traumatized by the red totalitarianism of the recent past in the pro western and pro eu posturing of borisov s regime a regime largely composed of individuals from the nomenclature politburo and organs of said recent past formally disguised as a nominal parliamentary republic the event gives the following bio of ruja on the site ruja s biography according to a 2015 event organized by the economist the financial and banking sectors in bulgaria have always been dubious and shady most recently witnessed in the scandal that followed the sudden collapse of corporate commercial bank in 2014 the country s fifth largest bank at the time the case was eventually taken to the united states district court for the city of new york since the country s own judicial system seems powerless and dysfunctional to deal with anything apart from protecting the private interests of oligarchs behind the curtains ruja s professional background which on the surface seems somewhat impressive really tells a different story upon closer inspection while we can t know what her real competencies are if any they certainly aren t in any way related to it cryptography or cryptocurrency a talk of hers from two years ago reminiscent of events organized by bitconnect delivers nothing but repetitive borrowed cliches and big promises for success and wealth the white paper for their ico says nothing about anything technical or gives any even hypothetical details about the workings or purpose of their enterprise and is instead just a short list of promises followed by legal clarifications and disclaimers so it is hard to imagine what kind of speech doctor ruja must have given to an audience of the political and business elites of the country and the region a pdf for the event spread around among investors attempted to dispel any rumors that onecoin was a crudely put together fraud another tactic of hers is focusing on spammy press releases and what appears to be paid advertorials such as the one in forbes magazine bulgaria the case with the economist remains a mystery but in all likelihood it was also paid for with money stolen from gullible investors wanting to get in on the crypto hype in the greed frenzy of the bubble ruja s fake forbes cover as promoted by the onecoin team fake magazine covers are said to be a scammer classic among ruja s co conspirators there s the name of mark scott a us attorney who has dual german citizenship and whose role in the scheme was to form international hedge funds with accounts in the cayman islands a well known haven for things of that nature as a side note eos also operates its finances from the caymans as did tether in order to do that scott had to misrepresent the source of the funds and lie to banks and administrators in exchange for assisting ruja with stashing stolen onecoin investor funds scott was allegedly rewarded with 15 5 million in fees used to buy properties luxury vehicles and luxury watches among other things scott above in pink was indicted in august 2018 on charges relating to his laundering of over 400 million in stolen onecoin investor funds and was released on a 2 5 million bond later that same month the atlantic takes notice the atlantic mentions onecoin in a may 2017 article which was at the beginning of bitcoin s suspicious meteoric rise which was later called into question as having been partially a result of suspected frauds such as the printing of tokens by usdt tether which seemed too directly correlated to bitcoin s market price surges the article entitled the rise of cryptocurrency ponzi schemes diagnoses the source of the problem and yet onecoin attracted hundreds of millions of dollars more than gnosis the company seems to have targeted a global category of aspirational investors who noticed the breathless coverage and booming valuations of cryptocurrencies and blockchain companies but weren t savvy enough to understand the difference between the real thing and a sham left unchecked this growing crypto mania could be hugely destructive to one of the most promising technologies of the 21st century this danger exists in large part because grasping even the basics of blockchain technology remains daunting for non specialists in a nutshell blockchains link together a global swarm of servers that hosts thousands of copies of the system s transaction records server operators constantly monitor one another s records meaning that to steal money or otherwise alter the ledger a hacker would have to compromise many machines across a vast network in one fell swoop the bulgaria factor cryptocurrency took hold in bulgaria due to the affordability of electricity for proof of work mining on the one hand and on the other the capacity of cryptocurrencies for facilitating black market business money laundering and cybercrime at bitcoin s peak in december 2017 bulgarian officials are said to have seized in a single anti corruption operation enough bitcoins to pay off a fifth of the country s national debt at the time the balkans have always been an area prone to black market business and a bridge between asia and europe for the trafficking of illicit goods it s enough to mention the so called balkan route for trafficking heroin and supplying the lucrative european market a history which goes quite far back in history neighboring macedonia has even put opium poppies on their national emblem and coat of arms macedonia s national emblem depicting cut opium poppy heads on both sides bayer s last heroin production facility was located near the macedonian border on bulgarian side in the 1930s bulgaria s banking and financial sector has often been utilized as the transit point for money laundering before siphoning funds to offshore accounts something founder ruja ignatova seems to know a lot about what is perplexing is that given that bulgaria is an eu member state this practice has been left to go on for as long as it has it s not a secret that when a corrupt state catches a fraud of massive proportions it tends more often than not to just take its cut bulgaria seems to be especially corrupt even by eastern european standards conclusion technological innovation is always followed by bubbles and speculative gold rushes which give rise to the proliferation of scams and frauds especially in crypto but the case of onecoin stands out due to its deep connections to the state government as well as to officials in the supposedly regulated financial sectors of the european union it is also often said that after the collapse of the soviet union russian organized crime acquired a new global reach and became much more difficult to tackle and deal with in all likelihood there s a lot more boiling underneath the already ugly surface of the onecoin scam especially given bulgaria s current political environment and to add to all of that onecoin seems to have surfaced again on coinmarketcap
richard nixon was in the white house mao zedong was running china and ted heath was the prime minister of the uk when hand picked members of the global business academic and policymaking elite were first invited to a get together in the swiss resort of davos in 1971 this year marks the 50th davos but there is not exactly a party mood the world economic forum the body that organises the annual talkfest in the snow is committed to improving the state of the world but in key respects things look worse today than they did at the start of the 70s not in every way obviously the percentage of the world s population living in abject poverty has come down sharply largely because of rapid growth in china and india the gap between rich and poor within countries has increased over the past five decades but inequality is not the same as destitution living standards have risen whether measured by incomes per head life expectancy or technical progress there were no smartphones in 1971 and nor was there an inkling that they would be manufactured in the economic superpower that china has become under mao china was essentially a peasant economy and the reforms that led to industrialisation and the migration from the country to the cities were still some way off nobody had the slightest interest in china s growth rate or its trade policy a small group of developed countries led by the us accounted for the lion s share of global gdp and called all the shots that is no longer the case by the early 70s the long period of post second world war growth was coming to an end the bretton woods currency system held together by the link between the us dollar and gold would collapse in 1971 as a result of the inflationary strains on the american economy caused by the cost of the vietnam war and higher domestic spending the mood music does not seem to have changed all that much the 2020 davos takes place amid concern that a crisis is looming it is more than a decade since the end of the financial crisis of 2007 09 but the recovery has been tepid wage growth investment growth and productivity growth have all been poor financial markets look dangerously overvalued view image in fullscreen donald trump is due to visit the world economic forum in davos on 21 january photograph drew angerer getty images so why is the current state of affairs more troubling than it was in 1971 well for a start there seemed a simple if harsh way out of the economic problems associated with the end of bretton woods inflation according to economists such as milton friedman was caused by profligate governments printing too much money to pay for excessive wage settlements and public spending pledges the answer was to reduce budget deficits to rein in the power of organised labour and to give control of interest rates to independent central banks this was broadly the system in place from the mid 1970s to the moment when everything went pear shaped in 2008 at that point there was something of a crash rethink interest rates were slashed central banks pumped money into their economies budget deficits were allowed to balloon yet the strong and sustained recovery that was expected has not happened the main impact of the extraordinary policy stimulus has been seen in asset prices rather than in the real economy in the event of another crisis central banks look to be short of conventional weapons tentatively there are signs that fiscal policy regulating the economy through tax and public spending is making a comeback in britain the chancellor sajid javid says interest rates are going to stay low for years to come making it possible to borrow cheaply for long term infrastructure projects clearly the money could be put to good use the big inescapable difference between the 1971 davos and the one this week is the threat posed by the climate emergency a flick through fritz schumacher s seminal 1973 green text small is beautiful finds no mention of global heating it simply was not a political issue back then now of course it is each year the wef asks a sample of experts and policymakers to list the most likely risks the world will face over the next decade unsurprisingly against a backdrop of droughts hurricanes bushfires melting glaciers and a steady heating of the planet for the first time the top five threats are all environmental sign up to the dailybusinesstoday email or follow guardianbusinesson twitter at businessdesk klaus schwab the founder of davos and the wef s executive chairman has written to all those attending this year s event urging them to commit to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 an indication of how successful that appeal will be should come on tuesday when donald trump drops by what trump should say but won t is as follows the us recognises the existential threat posed by global heating it accepts that multilateral cooperation is needed if the problem is to be tackled before it it is too late as a businessman he is aware that no company could hope to survive if it depleted its own capital in the way that humans are consuming natural resources to that end the white house is working on an ambitious plan for the climate change summit due to be held in glasgow at the end of this year as the world s biggest economy the us will commit to stringent emissions targets commit to renewable energy and bankroll a modern equivalent of the postwar marshall plan to help poor countries make the transition to a low carbon future why because whereas the threat in 1948 was the spread of communism now it is the much greater danger that capitalism will eat itself
by charles c krulak larry hatheway jerry grinstein and alexander friedman davos the world economic forum s annual flagship meeting this year will focus on how to build a more cohesive and sustainable world as always the topic is timely but also a little abstract to help give it more concrete form we have a few proposals to put the prevailing economic model on a better track and focus the discussion first it is time to overhaul the us tax code to reduce structural wealth inequality to that end america should get rid of the carried interest loophole a provision that was originally intended to encourage long term investment has become a massive tax break for financiers working in private equity and at hedge funds although the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act placed some limitations on this finance friendly rule it remains in place by the same token america should do away with the stepped up cost basis loophole which has become a key way by which the rich avoid taxation when bequeathing their wealth to their heirs as such it has enabled the rich to become dynastic undermining america s ostensible commitment to meritocracy second the united states desperately needs to clean up its student loan mess a huge burden on the young by establishing a national trust along the lines of what australia has done in australia a student borrows what she needs to fund her education and the loan is repayable from a predetermined proportion of her subsequent income for a specified number of years students who end up with lower future incomes pay less than they borrowed but this is offset by higher earners and graduates who enter certain forms of public service should be offered debt forgiveness incentives third we need to change corporate reporting to encourage more long term sustainable thinking the first step is to end the obsession with quarterly earnings the pursuit of financial analysts targets every three months warps the way ceos and boards make decisions and undermines long term thinking on a related note share buybacks deserve more critical attention s p 500 companies now routinely use profits or borrowed money to repurchase their shares instead of investing in new factories business lines or other key capital expenditures over the last ten years around 5 trillion has been spent on this method of boosting reported earnings per share and thus the stock price corporate reporting should be changed to explain clearly how much of a share price movement is largely attributable to buybacks and boards and shareholders should adjust executive compensation accordingly moreover corporations worldwide should start reporting sustainability metrics corporate reporting influences corporate behaviour but companies generally are required to report only their financial position based on audited income and balance sheet accounting standards this should be expanded to include broader stakeholder metrics such as customer satisfaction ratings diversity scores carbon footprints charitable giving political donations and the pay gap between senior executives and average rank and file employees boards for stakeholder reporting standards special purpose bodies akin to the financial accounting standards board should be created to oversee newly agreed worldwide conventions for non financial reporting fourth a global agreement to levy a 0 1 per cent tax on financial transactions similar to what is done in hong kong would help to rein in the financial system a transaction tax benefits long term investors over short term speculators adds just enough friction into the financial system to help reduce bubbles and most critically better aligns the cost of managing the system to those who benefit the most from it according to the congressional budget office cbo a 0 1 per cent transaction tax could produce around 1 trillion in much needed extra revenue in the us alone over a decade fifth countries need to raise minimum wages and index them to inflation in the us a federally mandated 15 per hour national minimum wage would help to level the playing field and automatically adjusting it in line with the rising cost of living would help everyone keep up according to the chicago federal reserve bank these steps would also increase aggregate demand in the world s largest economy sixth in all countries an overhaul of national income accounting is in order since it was introduced in the 1940s gross domestic product has assumed unofficial status as the primary measure of national welfare yet when progress is equated with gdp policymaking becomes an exercise in boosting gross national income without regard to the attendant social or environmental costs new metrics are required to measure wellbeing net of cost national income should include the costs of externalities such as environmental degradation or greenhouse gas emissions thus measured net income would more accurately reflect sustainable growth moreover all countries should agree to common standards for incorporating other measures of social progress these could include life expectancy infant mortality the detection prevention and treatment of common diseases ghg emissions per capita biodiversity educational attainment income distribution human trafficking levels and socioeconomic achievement by gender and minority groups the bretton woods institutions could research and develop the new common standards of national welfare that we need and introduce them through their widely followed publications last but by no means least urgent action must be taken to address climate change in a way that shares the costs fairly within countries and between generations mitigation policies must be made appealing carbon taxes are necessary but so are subsidies according to the us joint committee on taxation and the cbo a carbon tax of 25 per tonne with annual inflation adjusted increases of 2 per cent would raise 1 trillion in the us over a decade it makes sense to earmark even more than that amount to help those made worse off by the tax namely today s coal oil and gas producing communities as well as families on low or modest incomes hit by regressive taxation subsidies could take the form of cash payments re training new infrastructure projects and investment in alternative energy industries in coal and oil country importantly the subsidies must be greater than the carbon tax revenues the resulting increase in national debt is rightly the obligation of future generations who will benefit most from the transition to a low carbon economy in short climate policy must have tangible benefits today if it is to be politically acceptable consider this as e commerce reduces demand for physical shopping communities should buy vacant malls and stores again with debt to be paid off by future generations and replace them with carbon capturing green spaces these practical steps in aggregate would go a long way toward helping realise

proving ground a series struggling farmers weigh their support for trump okabena minn the rain came first drenching the fields and delaying planting then 70 mph wind knocked down half their corn chinese tariffs sank the price of soybeans and if that weren t enough demand for corn dropped after washington gave oil refineries a pass on using ethanol for rachel and lance daberkow poor weather compounded by president donald trump s trade and fuel policies has meant cutting costs as income from their 640 acre farm dwindled over the past two years like some other growers around minnesota struggling with an uncertain farm economy their faith in a president who carried rural america four years ago is being tested minnesota jackson co the midwest remakes american politics as the father of two young boys lance daberkow 37 sees trump at least trying to resolve long standing trade problems with china he believes farmers will benefit long term if trump is re elected his wife is warier if you continually are going to take away our opportunities rachel says why would i want to do business with you farm families like the daberkows are critical to trump s election hopes in minnesota which he lost by less than 44 000 votes in 2016 along with wisconsin and michigan traditionally democratic states that trump narrowly won minnesota has joined the broader tapestry of the upper midwest battleground one trump made personal at an october rally in minneapolis when he vowed to take the state polls show that support for trump continues in rural america which generally aligns with his views on gun rights abortion and religion recent progress on trade deals has sparked hopes of change but farmers frustrations have long been mounting as they endure the worst economic conditions since the 1980s farm crisis and as goes farm country so goes small town america many farmers in minnesota say that support for trump remains as strong as ever notwithstanding the brash new yorker s endless run of controversies and the ongoing impeachment proceedings but some also predict a potential softening in that support if the president doesn t conclude an effective full trade deal with china or if a more moderate democratic candidate emerges does that translate into significantly less support the guys who i know were big trump supporters still are and i don t think that s going to change said john zimmerman who raises turkeys corn and soybeans in northfield some of the middle guys who go back and forth like me it depends on who the candidates are but there is an open door there in a state as competitive as minnesota where the twin cities region often provides the winning margin for democrats in statewide races trump can ill afford much erosion in farm country nationally farmers and ranchers made up slightly more than 1 of the country s population in 2017 according to u s department of agriculture data of those 3 4 million food producers the number of undecided middle guys is small but not insignificant on election day the trump campaign made clear at a presentation in december that rural counties with small populations in states like minnesota and wisconsin will be a big part of its re election strategy in 2020 trump s bet on farm country in 2016 president donald trump has made clear that his strategy for winning battleground states like minnesota which he narrowly lost in 2016 includes focusing on rural sparsely populated counties often overlooked by other candidates four years ago rural minnesota showed up strong for trump though largely in precincts that produced few votes he would have to maintain or even increase his strength in greater minnesota to overcome the democrats advantage in the twin cities and other urban parts of the state it doesn t take a lot to swing that vote to another candidate chris pollack a dairy farmer in ripon wis said of his state which unexpectedly went to trump in 2016 by less than one percentage point he said farmers will again be part of the puzzle a few ticks in the farm economy also could be a part of that puzzle while the u s economy overall remains strong a key campaign talking point for trump farmers hardships have reverberated in some small towns in minnesota thirty one minnesota farms filed for bankruptcy in the past year a 10 year high the american farm bureau reported in september on a freezing december morning lance daberkow stopped to deposit checks from grain sales at first national bank in lakefield near the iowa border he lamented the drop in price for a bushel of corn to around 3 50 down from 7 in 2013 soybean prices declined from about 10 40 a bushel before the china trade war started in 2018 to less than 9 as a result daberkow said farmers like him are looking for ways to cut back on big equipment purchases and family expenses to supplement his lost income he works two side jobs off the farm that means just less trips going out for supper and that hurts the local economy he said as he chatted with loan officer jesse ackermann it all kinds of follows through in these small rural communities ackermann replied from farming it goes all the way down to local co ops local businesses banks the ripples have been felt across the state in willmar the aisles of schwanke tractor and combine were quiet on a december morning as manager tom conway described how sales had slumped back when corn prices were high we were selling tools up the wazoo because guys were building up their shops conway said now everybody is holding tight conway and salesman gary ellingson both clad in plaid listened to the radio as house speaker nancy pelosi announced that the democratic led house and the trump administration had reached a deal on the u s mexico canada trade agreement along with the trade war with china the prolonged rewrite of the north american free trade agreement has left many minnesota farmers uneasy ellingson hoped the deal would bode well for negotiations with china if we can settle something with mexico and canada they are going to be a little more willing to deal with us he said but the long term market effects remain unclear trump signed an partial trade agreement wednesday committing china to boost purchases of u s exports by 200 billion over two years including 32 billion more in farm products but critics warn that beijing has a history of making promises it doesn t keep and that a one time deal does not guarantee u s farmers sustained access to china s market some farmers also say the ramifications of the trade war will linger it s going to take years to get it back nate hultgren of raymond said of his lost soybean markets he estimates his family farm took a total loss of up to 12 500 on soybeans because of the trade war with china trump s farm bailout paying out 19 billion so far was intended to offset the impact on farmers of the administration s trade disputes with china mexico canada and other countries since october 2018 nearly 1 5 billion has been paid out to an estimated 54 000 farmers in minnesota farmers widely agree that the subsidies have been a lifeline albeit one they would rather not need we are treading water the way it is at least that is something but i m not looking for something to just get me through the year i m looking for a long term agreement said rachel daberkow 35 at the same time some minnesota farmers have made clear that they don t vote on trade policy alone noah hultgren nate s brother wants less government spending opposes abortion and is wary of policies such as medicare for all or eliminating college debt for a lot of farmers social issues outweigh the losses they ve taken from tariffs he said they ll say maybe he has cost us one dollar a bushel on soybeans but i like his stance on abortion or other conservative stances noah said impeachment also does not seem to be changing many minds among rural trump supporters who tend to see it as a distant partisan exercise noah said he and others are just tired of the partisanship noah 40 and nate 43 help run their family farm west of willmar a sprawling 6 000 acre operation both men supported trump in 2016 and lean republican though they like seventh congressional district rep collin peterson one of the most conservative democrats in congress who voted against impeachment while noah plans to vote for trump nate is on the fence the farm s ceo nate has a finance degree and manages the budget from a modern office with the black and red family logo on the wall he watched the trade war with china shrink their bottom line and he s hesitant to vote for trump unless he reaches a firm trade deal before election day farmers also have been dinged by a regulatory rollback in biofuels trump s environmental protection agency expanded the number of waivers it gives to oil refiners allowing them to use less than the required amount of corn based ethanol to make gasoline about 33 of minnesota s corn crop went to ethanol production according to a 2018 minnesota bio fuels association report on a brisk afternoon in mid november paul freeman paused his slow work tilling frozen ground to talk about trump poor weather conditions meant he had finally finished harvesting at his corn and soybean farm in starbuck south of alexandria just a couple of days before a part owner in ethanol plants freeman said the baloney with the waivers means fat cat oil companies are benefiting off his back exacerbating the pain of a wet cold season freeman said farmers he talks to are divided on whether trump s actions will benefit them long term but personally he is ready to move on the plain old truth is that donald trump is killing the american farmer freeman said trump s character also has pushed some farmers to seek an alternative it means something to me that my kids all think he s a bad person said nate hultgren whose five young children are growing up next door to their cousins and grandparents in the same bucolic setting where he and noah were raised but to chip away at trump support in rural minnesota democrats would likely have to stay in the center lane of american politics something that is not at all certain nate is one of several minnesota farmers including some republicans who said they would potentially vote for minnesota sen amy klobuchar if she won the democratic nomination she has visited their local sugar beet cooperative and nate said he trusts her more than the other candidates but with klobuchar netting in the single digits of national polls he is looking at other options and he is unimpressed agricultural policy seldom comes up in presidential elections but many farmers still feel like trump speaks to them shayne isane who farms near the canadian border in badger minn believes trump has paid more attention to farm country than any president since jimmy carter who was a peanut farmer it probably was middle america that probably got him elected so in a sense he s returned that by paying a lot of attention to rural america isane said that s nice to see you always like to feel that you re not inconsequential isane voted for trump and attended the president s visit to a burnsville business roundtable last april but his enthusiasm has waned lost income from low soybean prices forced him to restructure debt and delay updates to farm technology you just see a lot of impatience and frustration farmers right now are facing a lot of financial and emotional challenges isane said everybody is feeling like neighbors friends and relatives we need a win and we need some good news
beijing china s economic growth cooled to its weakest in nearly 30 years in 2019 amid a bruising trade war with the united states and more stimulus is expected this year as beijing tries to boost sluggish investment and demand but data on jan 17 also showed the world s second largest economy ended the rough year on a somewhat firmer note as a trade truce revived business confidence and earlier growth boosting measures finally appeared to be taking hold as expected china s growth slowed to 6 1 percent last year from 6 6 percent in 2018 data from the national bureau of statistics showed though still strong by global standards and within the government s target range it was the weakest expansion since 1990 this year is crucial for the ruling communist party to fulfill its goal of doubling gross domestic product gdp and incomes in the decade to 2020 and turning china into a moderately prosperous nation analysts reckon that long term target would need growth this year to remain around 6 percent though top officials have warned the economy may face even greater pressure than in 2019 more recent data along with optimism over a phase 1 u s china trade deal signed on wednesday have raised hopes that the economy may be bottoming out fourth quarter gdp rose 6 0 percent from a year earlier steadying from the third quarter though still the weakest in nearly three decades and december industrial output investment and retail sales all rose more than expected after an improved showing in november policy sources have told reuters that beijing plans to set a lower growth target of around 6 percent this year from last year s 6 6 5 percent relying on increased infrastructure spending to ward off a sharper slowdown key targets are due to be announced in march on a quarterly basis the economy grew 1 5 percent in october december also the same pace as the previous three months we expect china s growth rate will come further down to below 6 percent in the coming year said masaaki kanno chief economist at sony financial holdings in tokyo the chinese economy is unlikely to fall abruptly because of government policies but at the same time the trend of a further slowdown of the economy will remain unchanged signs of improvement but will it last december data released along with gdp showed a surprising acceleration in industrial output and a more modest pick up in investment growth while retail sales were solid industrial output grew 6 9 percent from a year earlier the strongest pace in nine months while retail sales rose 8 0 percent fixed asset investment rose 5 4 percent for the full year but growth had plumbed record lows in autumn easing trade tensions have made manufacturers more optimistic about the business outlook analysts said though many of the tit for tat tariffs both sides imposed during the trade war remain in place despite the recent uptick in activity we think it is premature to call the bottom of the current economic cycle julian evans pritchard and martin rasmussen at capital economics said in a note external headwinds should ease further in the coming quarters thanks to the phase one trade deal and a recovery in global growth but we think this will be offset by a renewed slowdown in domestic demand triggering further monetary easing by the people s bank among other key risks this year infrastructure a key part of beijing s stabilization strategy has remained stubbornly weak infrastructure investment grew just 3 8 percent in 2019 decelerating from 4 percent in january november despite sharply higher local government bond issuance and other policy measures this shows that local governments continued to face funding constraints said tommy xie china economist at ocbc bank in singapore some analysts are also worried about signs of cooling in the housing market a key economic driver property investment growth hit a two year low in december even as it grew at a solid 9 9 percent pace in 2019

bureau told a news conference ning noted that per capital gdp in china had surpassed 10 000 for the first time last year but analysts believe more painful reforms are needed to generate additional growth beijing has been relying on a mix of fiscal and monetary steps to weather the current downturn cutting taxes and allowing local governments to sell huge amounts of bonds to fund infrastructure projects banks also have been encouraged to lend more especially to small firms with new yuan loans hitting a record 16 81 trillion yuan 2 44 trillion in 2019 the central bank has cut banks reserve requirement ratios rrr the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves eight times since early 2018 most recently this month china has also seen modest cuts in some lending rates analysts polled by reuters expect further cuts in both rrr and key interest rates this year but chinese leaders have repeatedly pledged they will not embark on massive stimulus like that during the 2008 09 global crisis which quickly juiced growth rates but left a mountain of debt containing financial system risks will remain a high priority for policymakers this year corporate bond defaults hit a new record last year while state linked firms had to step in to rescue several troubled smaller banks even with additional stimulus and assuming the trade truce holds economists polled by reuters expect china s growth will cool this year to 5 9 percent

the u s dominated the news stream at the start of 2020 the spasm in the u s iran confrontation has quickly subsided the much heralded u s china phase 1 trade deal has been signed the u s has completed the ratification process of the u s mexico canada free trade agreement the early signs from the economic entrails suggest the world s largest economy continues to enjoy a record long even if not robust expansion the focus shifts elsewhere in the week ahead for which the u s sees a relatively light calendar of economic reports in a holiday shortened week then again the recent and data offer valuable insight the course is set and the fed seems inclined to look beyond the near term economic fluctuations ensuring that the meeting at the end of the month is as close to a non event as an fomc meeting and a powell press conference can be there are four central bank meetings to note and none are likely to do anything so the words are more important than the actions the begins with governor kuroda holding at the conclusion of the two day meeting on january 21 under the yield curve control initiative it puts the deposit minus 10 bp and targets the yield at zero 20 bp global tensions have

1 1 in fy20 and 1 5 in fy21 the forecast seems optimistic the bloomberg economists survey found median forecasts for 2020 growth at 0 5 and 0 7 in 2021 japan has not reported above 1 since april 2015 the tax increase will the optics but the boj and investors know better that said deflation has been halted and japan like many other countries is experiencing low inflation core cpi has been above zero since the end of 2016 policymakers and economists understood the tax increase would push economic activity in q3 from q4 the actions the government took were meant to ensure a quick rebound data from november suggests capex bounced back strongly and consumption slower while the easing of u s china trade tensions helps lift uncertainty quantitative targets may give american companies an edge all else being equal the bank of canada s is the next day january 22 it is in a holding pattern the real sector data has disappointed even though in december recovered from the unexpected weakness in november firm may be deterring the bank of canada from easing and the government is promising fiscal support the fact that the federal reserve is understood to be on hold also gives bank of canada officials some time though last year s three cuts by the u s did not induce a move by canada shortly before the outcome of the meeting is announced canada will report december cpi figures the month over month pace declined in three of the four months through november by a cumulative 0 3 percentage points in the same period in 2018 the cumulative decline in the four months through november was twice as much the base effect seems behind the year over year rise of all the canadian measures above 2 also most economists expect the current run of soft data is not a prelude to a more severe slowdown about three quarters of the economists in a recent reuters survey expect the bank of canada to remain on hold into 2021 however officials are more optimistic than private sector economists the former see growth accelerating from about 1 7 to a little more than 2 0 in 2020 private economists according to the bloomberg survey see the growth slipping to 1 6 which would be the slowest pace

focus is on the strategic review that is being launched most discussions are on how the price stability objective can be clarified currently the target is expressed as close to but below 2 surveys suggest there is a high expectation for a symmetrical inflation target where equal weight would be given to too high as well as too low inflation and more importantly a period of undershooting could lead to greater willingness to accept an overshoot the ecb risks putting the cart before the horse in candid moments officials acknowledge that they do not fully understand why inflation is so low and so many different countries one must squint one s eyes and tilt the screen just to see the relationship between labor market conditions and general price pressures it is not completely clear why negative interest rates have not spurred much of an increase in the general price level how can a strategic review be conducted without a great understanding of different macro relationships it is like what st louis fed president bullard argued several years ago under a certain paradigm the relationships are understood but the paradigm has shifted and new relationships have emerged there is a sense that things are not working optimally now and the central banks the fed too is conducting a strategic review without understanding why will seek to remedy the situation it reminds one of the story about the experiment where food is randomly put on the right side or the left side and after a bit the mouse stops going to one side at all and takes a 50 failure rate a person faced with the same challenge tries to outguess the random movement and ends up doing worse than the mouse it also begs the question does it matter imagine that at the conclusion of the strategic review the ecb announces that going forward it will target an average rate of inflation of two percent or that its inflation target is symmetrical will this make it more or less likely that the central bank will achieve its target maybe neither it is unlikely to disrupt markets i e change the market s course as it contains very little operational information while possible it seems unlikely that the ecb would give up seeking price stability directly through inflation targeting and shift to a nominal gdp target or unemployment this is to say that the strategic view is unlikely to produce a paradigmatic shift in fairness observers may be too focused on the inflation target ecb president lagarde will likely sketch out the broad parameters of the review it is bound to include a review of tools as well as communication decisions here may have far reaching implications while many press accounts make it seem as if negative interest rates have fallen out of a favor for example but lagarde provided a spirited defense at her first ecb meeting and or course the snb and boj defend it the central bank s balance sheet eurosystem is within its mandate as are the targeted long term refinancing operations loans but some evaluation of the relative merits is worth considering a review of the communications can also produce some important changes unlike other central banks the ecb s meeting record does not give room or recognize dissents too often it seems the losers of an issue have little place within the official communications to make their opinion known and take their case to the press at first decisions were made unanimously but as the institution grew and issues being more complex voting was introduced but rarely used according to reports a more formal process and one that makes room for and respects dissents seem a reasonable expectation
a century ago this month the treaty of versailles went into effect bringing world war i to an end yet the dreams that paved its way were already evaporating among them was u s president woodrow wilson s vision of a world made safe for democracy and his hope that the league of nations would emerge to prevent future conflict as world leaders gather in davos next week at the dawn of the 2020s they confront a similarly decisive historic moment and a comparable set of dashed hopes one can hear the haunting echoes from the 1920s a u s isolationist temptation bitter european disunity and growing nationalism and populism within democracies amid rising authoritarianism as with the end of world war i the cold war s end in 1989 spawned premature declarations of democracy s triumph in his 1992 book the end of history and the last man francis fukuyama suggested that with soviet collapse humanity had reached the end point of mankind s ideological evolution and the universalization of western liberal democracy as the final form of human government what world leaders coming to davos know is that history s course is up for grabs again major power competition is heating up inflamed by a systemic contest between democratic and state capitalism the world is awash with uncertainty about how new technologies and rising environmental threats could remake our world the international order of rules and institutions that the u s and its partners constructed after world war ii is faltering and ill equipped to navigate these challenges in the world economic forum s program notes it writes there are 193 sovereign nations a proliferation of regional centers of power and one increasingly obvious fact of life we re all in this together we need to move from geopolitics and international competition to a default of consummate global collaboration nations are going to have to change but what if far more likely they don t those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it wrote the philosopher george santayana in 1905 the silver lining of world war ii s devastation was that chastened american and european leaders having witnessed the mistakes of versailles did a far better job than their predecessors in shaping the future for example wilson s young assistant secretary of the navy franklin roosevelt had become president and isolationist arguments drowned at pearl harbor get the inflections points newsletter subscribe to frederick kempe s weekly inflection points column which focuses on the global challenges facing the united states and how to best address them name first last email name this field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged the challenge facing today s leaders in davos is they must navigate the world to a better place without personal memories of failed settlements or the world spanning catastrophes that resulted and can again from lack of common cause mussolini s boast in summer of 1932 that the liberal state is doomed to perish has its echoes now in vladimir putin s declaration this year the so called liberal idea has outlived its purpose it took a catastrophic war with millions of dead followed by a half century of ideological competition between liberal democracy and communism to prove mussolini wrong what will it take this time to answer putin and his ilk following the constitutional change he proposed this week to ensure he can stay in power as long as he may want one can only hope that democracies regroup finding a means of peaceful coexistence and competition with china russia and others can they agree to rules and remake institutions in a manner that doesn t surrender fundamental values perhaps the best outcome would be an extended contest over time decided in degrees and not through geopolitical catastrophe for those keeping score at this year s davos here are just three questions among many others worth asking about this epochal drama what is the state of u s chinese relations following this week s trade agreement when president trump speaks in davos on tuesday even as his senate impeachment trial begins he s likely to make much of his phase one trade agreement signed this week however despite this ceasefire the two most decisive countries for the global future will continue to grow apart politically economically and technologically though financial markets have been calmed the more significant story is this decoupling a recent atlantic council delegation in china found that many chinese experts and officials welcome the u s trade war and technology transfer restrictions as they are spurring china toward greater self sufficiency beijing is accelerating its drive for technological autonomy yuan yang wrote in a sweeping financial times analysis yesterday to boost its control over its own supply chain in the face of political risks such as further us embargoes can the united states and europe avoid new trade wars and find common ground regarding iran the good news is that the united states the european union and japan this week proposed new global trade rules for the world trade organization clearly aimed at china that would curb state subsidies that are distorting the world economy the bad news is that the trump administration continues to consider escalating its trade conflict with europe when instead it should be forging a new trade and investment agreement the transatlantic relationship has been at the core of one of the longest periods of relative peace and prosperity over the past seven decades it s time to refocus u s and european efforts at recharging those ties one good place to start might be iran one good outcome from rising u s iranian tensions could be that iran s steps to break out of its nuclear agreement could trigger closer cooperation between washington and its european partners to constrain those activities and seek new talks could the australian fires shock the global community into the sort of common cause that davos promotes welcome to a world in which climate change s economic impact is no longer distant and imperceptible writes greg ip of the wall street journal climate has muscled to the top of business worries and davos regular laurence fink the chairman and ceo of the world s largest asset manager blackrock inc said this week that climate issues would be a key driver in how he invests more than 7 trillion of his clients money yet even as fires burn a patch of australia the size of belgium it s going to be politicians more than business leaders who have the biggest levers for change

export opportunities for american farmers manufacturers and energy producers and his trade pact with canada and mexico approved thursday by the senate could help restore some auto production in the united states yet perhaps more than anything last week s twin breakthroughs on trade provided a breather from two chaotic years of trumpian policymaking involving threats truces and heavy u s tariffs

unresolved most of the toughest and most complicated issues dividing the world s two biggest economies and that progress could unravel over time they also caution that the new north american trade pact though it might spur some job growth will likely make american built cars more expensive and less competitive globally whatever the outcome the president s approach to trade marks a clear break

prevented from forming independent unions trump s top trade negotiator robert lighthizer crafted a replacement trade agreement that is intended most of all to return some factory production to the united states to qualify for usmca s duty free benefits automakers must derive 75 of their production content from within north america up from 62 5 under nafta that means more auto content would have

president donald trump s much discussed phase one trade deal with china sets aside some of the economic uncertainty that has generated market volatility and depressed business investment but trade experts say it falls far short of justifying a globally damaging trade war between the world s two largest economies what s more this resolution could mean higher costs for u s companies and consumers while threatened tariffs on finished consumer goods such as clothes and electronics were avoided the deal also reaffirmed the white house s commitment to tariffs as an enforcement mechanism leaving in place sanctions on 370 billion worth of chinese imports for the foreseeable future this gives american buyers of those goods primarily parts for items made in the u s a greater degree of certainty in their input costs albeit not in the direction they wanted trade analysts said this means companies facing higher input costs would probably begin passing those along to consumers in the form of higher prices if they had not done so already as tariffs become semi permanent chinese producers and u s retailers will have even more reason to pass on price increases said peter petri a professor of international finance at the brandeis international business school overall petri called the deal signed wednesday a valuable agreement saying this is a fragile truce but it s an opportunity for confidence building but he also added several caveats it stopped the downward spiral of retaliations but it is less than what its supporters claim he said some of its provisions are vague and some are unachievable other experts were less impressed i m just underwhelmed said michael o moore professor of economics and international affairs at george washington university i think most people will give a sigh of relief that it s not going to get worse but the real issues remain some said the white house gained nothing by blowing up a nearly completed agreement last spring compared to the may 2019 deal is much thinner and does not entail a long list requirements for china to change its domestic laws and regulations said jacob kirkegaard a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics the trump administration made much of the agricultural purchase concessions in the deal but while the consensus was that the u s agricultural sector will likely be a key beneficiary experts were skeptical that china could or would meet the target of importing an additional 200 billion worth of american goods and services including an additional 80 billion in agricultural purchases over two years above pre trade war levels this requires a 40 percent increase this year and another 40 percent increase in 2021 that seems like a stretch goal said david dollar a senior fellow at the brookings institution it s redistributing income from one group of firms to another one in a very complex way it s not obvious it s a benefit for the u s economy he said with no specific dollar targets per agricultural commodity farmers won t know how many soybeans to plant or pigs to raise making them potentially unable to fulfill much larger orders and petri pointed out that the deal s verbiage gives china wiggle room chinese officials say that they will buy u s goods based on market demand but demand won t grow that fast on its own he said to get such spectacular growth china would have to create massive subsidies for u s goods a huge government intervention that we should not be asking for petri said creating government sanctioned demand at that scale could raise the price of those goods and distort the market some said china also risked running afoul of world trade organization regulations against countries playing favorites with their trading partners in short what was a large and steadily growing market for u s commodity producers in china has now become and will remain highly politicized and hence risky for u s farmers kirkegaard said purchase guarantees weren t deemed the only questionable part of the deal provisions meant to hold china accountable for infractions such as forced technology transfers were anemic according to people who analyzed the text on trade secrets to be honest the language that s in the agreement is pretty loose and generic said harry g broadman managing director at berkeley research group who chairs the firm s emerging markets practice on the face of it i don t see at least on that portion of the agreement a lot that s significantly different from previous types of agreements some of the practices and changes agreed to by beijing were changes that were already in the works or had been previously agreed upon petri said some of these provisions will benefit both american and chinese interests and are in keeping with beijing s longer term economic goals china wants foreign investment and may well roll out new reforms in opening insurance and other financial sectors he said china is trying to create more of an environment in which investment innovation are self reinforcing processes said dean a pinkert senior counsel at the law firm of hughes hubbard reed and a former commissioner of the u s international trade commission pinkert suggested beijing s concessions in these areas were what chinese policymakers wanted anyway i think in the long run it s as much in china s interests to address those structural reform issues as much as it s in the u s s interests he said many criticized the dispute resolution provisions for not including a mechanism for third party arbitration and worried that enforcement ultimately would hinge on the threat to reinstate or ratchet up tariffs while china certainly seeks to mitigate the impact its own economy has sustained as a result of two years worth of trade sanctions the administration s choice to lean into tariffs risks inflicting more damage on the american economy as well the people who are paying the tariffs are u s firms and u s consumers broadman said it s not clear to me what the actual economic impact will be as a dispute resolution measure to threaten china with more tariffs
the agreement is a signal that the situation is unlikely to deteriorate said chaoping zhu of j p morgan asset management in a report corporate confidence keeps improving said zhu that might help to provide strong support to economic growth chinese exporters have been battered by president donald trump s tariff hikes but a bigger blow to the economy came from weakness in consumption households spooked by the trade war and job losses put off big purchases auto sales fell for second year in 2019 tumbling 9 6 growth in retail spending decelerated to 8 over a year earlier down from 8 2 in the first nine months of the year the economy faces downward pressure and instability sources and risk points abroad are increasing the government said in a statement the trade war adds to pressure on chinese leaders who also are struggling to shore up growth and rein in surging food costs following a disease outbreak that slashed supplies of pork the country s staple meat and sent prices soaring the cost of pork spiked 42 5 in 2019 propelling food price inflation to 7 more than double the ruling party s 3 target chinese exports ended 2019 up 0 5 despite the tariff war and weaker global demand manufacturers stepped up efforts to sell to other markets recording double digit gains in exports to france canada and other economies sluggish global growth will continue to challenge the external outlook but we expect the phase one deal with the u s to have a favourable impact on exports and support domestic sentiment and confidence said louis kuijs of oxford economics in a report what happens in china ripples across the globe an economic lull in china reverberates in the many countries from copper producing chile to iron ore producing australia that feed chinese factories with raw materials china s 2019 economic growth came in at the low end of the ruling party s official target of 6 to 6 5 the international monetary fund and private sector forecasters expect this year s growth to decline further to as low as 5 8 that would be barely one third of 2007 s record 14 2 expansion but still would be among the world s strongest the u n s annual economic report released thursday said that china s economic growth slowed to 6 1 in 2019 and projected it will slip further to 6 in 2020 and 5 9 in 2021 nonetheless the world economic situation and prospects 2020 said east asia remains the world s fastest growing region and largest contributor to global growthdespite significant headwinds it said gdp in the region is projected to gradually slow to 6 in 2020 and 5 9 in 2021 the party is trying to steer china to slower more manageable growth but an abrupt downturn in activity and the clash with washington forced the ruling party to step up government spending and take other measures to support growth the central bank has tried to lower borrowing costs and channel credit to entrepreneurs who generate china s new wealth and jobs but beijing has avoided a large scale stimulus that might reignite a rise in debt that already is so high that rating agencies have cut its credit rating for government borrowing factory output rose 5 7 over 2018 down from 6 for the first six months of the year the outlook for 2020 is for continued resilient growth boosted by the phase one trade deal with the u s and the continued positive impact of government stimulus said rajiv biswas of ihs markit in a report joe mcdonald the associated press

the following is a transcript of an interview with gary cohn the former director of the national economic council that aired sunday january 19 2020 on face the nation face the nation moderator margaret brennan we re back with gary cohn he is the former director of the national economic council under president trump he s back in the private sector these days thank you for being here former national economic council director gary cohn thank you for having me margaret brennan so the economy is going to be front and center in this election many economists say we re overdue for a recession do you think we re on the brink of one cohn margaret first of all it s great to be here i know a lot of people have been talking about a recession i do not see a recession on the horizon here the u s economy is strong and continues to be very strong the u s consumer is very strong if you look at what s happened in the last couple of years with tax reform we have put more disposable income in the hands of the u s consumer and the u s consumer is out spending it margaret brennan so then why is the president and his the man currently in the job you once held larry kudlow continuing to criticize the fed chairman cohn i m not worried about interest rates right now i think our interest rate policy is in a good place i think the consumer is in a good place and i think the u s economy is in a good place we actually have interest rates at a level right now where activity is growing i think that you know fourth quarter gdp will come in around two 2 5 percent margaret brennan so you cohn probably 2 5 percent margaret brennan you differ from the president on that quibble about interest rates currently cohn i don t think i differ from the president on the economy being strong margaret brennan right cohn i think we agree completely about the economy being strong margaret brennan but on interest rates cohn yeah i agree that i i think the fed is in a good place on interest rate policy margaret brennan i want to ask you about trade this week the united states and china the two largest economies in the world signed this phase one trade deal there s like 200 billion in promised purchases but there are still like 300 billion dollars worth of goods under tariff so what does this actually accomplish what what do you see it cohn so first of all anytime the united states and china get together and sign an agreement i think we should applaud that i mean the mere fact that we got a 90 plus page agreement signed between between the two countries is very good relative to where we were months ago when everyone thought we were going to continue to feud with china so we ve got some trade agreement in place the chinese are going to buy some more goods from the united states which has to be a good thing but there s also in that agreement there are some provisions that free up trademarks and trade patents and trade secrets which is very very good no this didn t margaret brennan i thought this was about intellectual property cohn this didn t i said margaret brennan and theft and all of those things cohn this didn t address look this margaret brennan yeah cohn did not address the big issue the big issue the president and i agreed upon is that the chinese had been stealing our intellectual property they ve been infringing on our our trademarks they ve been infringing on our copyrights it has not addressed that and we still have to continue to address that margaret brennan do you think that china is going to hold up its end of the deal and actually enact some of the reforms they say they re going to carry out cohn i i think they re going to i think they re going to open up their markets i think the chinese have been close to opening up their markets for the for the industries that were listed in there so i m cautiously optimistic that the chinese are going to start reforming and opening up their markets margaret brennan so you resigned over a difference about tariffs or at least that was a cohn yeah i don t think that s actua accurate but go ahead margaret brennan well then why did you resign cohn well look i i i left the administration for a variety of different reasons and and the president and i had very open conversations about my policy views and his policy views we d accomplished a lot and at the end of the day he was going a different direction on some of the trade negotiations than i would have gone i agreed fundamentally on what the issue was i just didn t agree on how to solve the issue margaret brennan so the steel and aluminum tariffs was what many thought was the impetus for your resignation cohn well i didn t think margaret brennan you re saying it s not cohn i didn t think the steel and aluminum tariffs were helpful to our economy margaret brennan but when it comes to the tariffs that were used to get to the the negotiating table with china on this deal or where ultimately they ended up with the free trade deal the new nafta so to speak usmca can the president say look people may not like my tactics but i got this done was he ultimately right were you wrong cohn they they can say that i don t think we would have gotten to a different outcome i don t think the tariffs helped us get to any different outcome margaret brennan did it hurt the u s cohn i think it has hurt the u s i think it s totally hurt the united states look the u s economy is very strong very solid employment growth is great but we re missing a big component we re missing the capital expenditures from companies in the united states that was a key component to tax reform it was a key component to what we thought would help drive the economy in 2018 2019 2020 and on we put some very stimulative measures into the tax reform margaret brennan lowering the corporate tax rate is what you thought was going to get companies cohn not margaret brennan to spend more cohn not lowering we actually gave them expensing of capex for the first five years they can 100 percent expense their capex but the minute you turn around and put steel and aluminum tariffs on them the minute a company is thinking about spending capital what do you go out and buy you go out and buy steel and aluminum that s how you build factories that s how you build property plant equipment so all of the sudden the advantages that we were trying to give companies to help stimulate the economy to build facilities to go out and hire people to drive wages we took away that advantage by taxing the input that they needed to build margaret brennan you re saying the president got in his own way cohn i m saying the policies collided with each other margaret brennan gary cohn stay with us and we will be right back in a moment commercial break margaret brennan welcome back to face the nation we continue our conversation with former director of the national economic council gary cohn so at this signing ceremony the president did this week with china he said begin videotape president donald trump i made a lot of bankers look very good end videotape margaret brennan the top six u s banks saved about 32 billion dollars because of the tax cuts that you helped craft this is analysis according to to bloomberg news the the hit on the tax law is that it is good for corporations it s good for business it s not good for the little guy why do you think this analysis is wrong the president seems to be saying and applauding that he s helping out big banks cohn well our our tax bill s clearly working which is great we ve made u s businesses competitive again with the rest of the world we lowered the corporate tax rate to 21 percent so we now have a corporate tax rate that is competitive with the rest of the world yes we lowered corporate tax rates and that in itself cost less than a hundred billion dollars a year to do that but it stimulates huge economic growth the businesses in the united states now can thrive which means that they can grow they can go out and hire people which we ve seen we ve seen record unemployment we ve seen record unemployment rates down to 3 5 percent we ve seen wage growth we ve seen 3 percent plus wage growth and most importantly margaret brennan you put this all on the tax law cohn we ve seen a lot of it has to do with tax law it has to we ve seen higher end wage growth at the bottom pay scale than we have at the top so we re seeing the incentives that we created in the tax law by lowering the corporate rate we re seeing that happen and that is happening in the last couple of years margaret brennan there s a whole debate about the contribution to the deficit but i want to put that aside here because i want to focus in on something cohn oh please don t margaret brennan i want to focus in on something though that that is really resonating politically and it is this broader argument that this country somehow is rigged to benefit the wealthy and disadvantage the poor and you ve even had jamie dimon the ceo of jp morgan you ve had hank paulson former treasury secretary former head of goldman sachs i know you know him they ve said that they re all concerned about income inequality growing in this country are you concerned cohn of course i m concerned margaret brennan but you but you don t cohn we re all concerned margaret brennan think in any way that there have been contributions to that through the tax law you helped write cohn i i think there s been contributions for the positive i think if you look at the data you ll see that we have grown wages at the bottom end of the pay cycle scale i m sorry pay scale faster than we ve grown them at the top that s exactly what we re trying to do we re trying to attract more jobs back to the united states put more people to work and that s what we re seeing happening margaret brennan michael bloomberg says about this tax law nearly all the money goes to people like me who don t need it this is a guy who knows wall street who is a billionaire he s saying that the tax law is is only advantaging people like him cohn i d love to know how it s advantaging him i d love to see that because at the end of the day we have lowered rates i ll agree that we ve lowered rates we have broadened the base meaning that we make more of your income taxable that s basic tax policy lower rates broaden base meaning you get rid of more of the loopholes that people have used to deduct from their income what they pay taxes on we got rid of a lot of the loopholes so people are having to pay more taxes they re having to pay tax on more of their income yes they re paying it at a little lower rate margaret brennan are you going to endorse michael bloomberg whose board i believe you sit on cohn i do not i do not margaret brennan as part of one of his bloomberg entities cohn i sit on one of his his emerging market boards i guess it s a board margaret brennan but that doesn t mean you re necessarily going to be voting for him cohn it does not margaret brennan two of the candidates who are also vying for the democratic nomination bernie sanders elizabeth warren constantly come back to this idea of income inequality they have proposed taxes on billionaires taxes on financial transactions elizabeth warren has specifically referred to that people making over 50 million dollars having an additional 2 percent tax what would the impact of those policies be from your perspective cohn look our tax system in the united states is very very progressive we have over 50 percent of the population today of workers do not pay a dollar of federal income tax so if you re going to collect more revenue which i m not against we have to collect more revenue it s going to come from the top half of workers and in fact it s going to come from the top 10 percent of workers that s where that s where you can find the taxable income i think that we will end up doing that we will potentially need to do that but these fangled plans that they re coming up with we don t need to do things like that to collect more income from people we have a basic tax system that works and we can do some basic fundamental things if we need to collect more money the question is do we need to collect more money you know we look at spending and we look at revenue and we don t talk about them in the same sentence we we collect taxes and then we spend and congress never thinks about how much money they have to spend they just go spend and so you wouldn t run your household like that i wouldn t run my household like that i would decide how much revenue i have and then how much i could spend margaret brennan but you re you re a democrat cohn yes i am margaret brennan is there a single democrat that you would consider voting for cohn there there i i ll consider voting for anyone i vote on policy margaret brennan even elizabeth warren whose policy you just tried to gary cohn i would consider voting for anyone i said i didn t say i would i said i d consider voting for them margaret brennan well that s evasive cohn yeah margaret brennan in pulling apart some of her proposals you seem to be reflecting a lot of what wall street says which is that there is deep concern over this focus on the financial community on corporations etc in this environment is this enough that you see some of the people you know on wall street continuing to vote along lines of whatever the president is putting forward even if they don t like some of his behavior vote for him because of what he s doing for cohn that s a margaret brennan banks cohn that s a hypothetical question i don t know what i do know margaret brennan you don t know who you re voting for cohn what i do know is the economy is really strong and the democrats haven t really come up with an idea of how to help the economy get even stronger so it s probably easier to talk about corporate greed and talk about wall street and talk about technology companies because they don t really have an answer for an economy that s growing 2 5 percent with 3 5 percent unemployment and 3 percent wage growth i haven t heard their answer on that except let s tax it to death margaret brennan so as you said you identify as a democrat you did have disagreements with the president on a number of things i was there in trump tower the day of the charlottesville reference fine people on both sides i remember your face that day and you were very public about some of your differences with the president will you vote for him cohn look i m very supportive of the president s economic policy i m very supportive of what he s done on deregulation i haven t heard anyone who s come up with a better policy yet now i just don t vote on the economy i vote on a lot of the social issues as well so you know in many respects i ve got to balance both sides of that equation before i figure out who i m gonna vote for margaret brennan so you re leaving the door open cohn i m leaving the door open but at this point i don t have any intention not to vote for the president margaret brennan you are a frank guy you re usually pretty direct cohn yeah margaret brennan is there anyone around the president who can be direct with him right now is there anyone doing what you said you did when guiding him on some of these economic policies cohn i don t know i ve been gone a year and a half i am sure there are people when talking to the president margaret brennan but when the president can say look i ve gotten these tariffs that have helped me get this free trade deal with north america these tariffs have helped me get this phase 1 deal with china doesn t that encourage the president s approach one that you have said you have differed with him on cohn it may encourage his approach but he he s also got advisors in there that i m sure are telling him differences i know that there are people in there you know secretary mnuchin and i had a lot of conversations where we agreed on tariffs and i m sure the secretary is talking to the president about tariffs and what effect they re having and what effect they re not having margaret brennan lastly i want to ask you about a new book i know you haven t read it it s coming out and there ve been excerpts released that directly reference you which is why i want to give you a chance to respond he s called the president is is in this meeting accused of calling advisers dopes and babies and the like is the the description of the president and his management style matching your experience cohn i don t know what book you re referring to as you said i haven t read it so i i i wouldn t know margaret brennan the management style of berating advisors cohn look the president is what you see on tv is exactly what you get in private with the president the president is the same person behind closed doors as he is out in public which is which is a unique feature you know it s not like he turns it on or turns it off when he walks outside so you ve seen everything the president has that s exactly what you see when you re in a private meeting with him margaret brennan all right gary cohn thank you for your time cohn thank you margaret brennan we ll be right back with our political panel stay with us
8 west african countries rename currency in historic break from france but colonial era debts persist the currency change changes nothing about french colonization in africa on december 21 2019 president alassane ouattara of cote d ivoire and emmanuel macron of france announced a major currency reform in several west african francophone countries in 2020 eight west african countries belonging to the west african economic and monetary union waemu will rename their cfa franc to eco benin burkina faso cote d ivoire guinea bissau mali niger senegal and togo as part of this agreement french officials will no longer be represented on the governing bodies of these african central banks and member states will no longer keep half their foreign reserves in france reported france 24 but the currency reform struck a nerve with many netizens who feel that the change does little to address the harsh legacy of french colonialism in west africa where many nations are still indebted to france originally called the franc of the french colonies of africa the cfa franc currency morphed later into the franc of the african financial community in west africa the financial cooperation in central africa was established in 14 former french colonies upon gaining independence the central african economic and monetary community cemac made up of chad cameroon the central african republic democratic republic of congo equatorial guinea and gabon is not currently part of the agreement though it also uses a version of the cfa franc also pegged to the euro the french franc became the benchmark for the cfa franc after world war ii according to financial analyst frances coppola in 1999 when france took up the currency of the european union the euro was hard pegged to the cfa both versions of the cfa franc are hard pegged to the euro when the cfa franc was first created it was pegged to the french franc at 50 cfa francs to 1 french franc it was devalued in 1994 and then remained at 100 to 1 until france adopted the euro in 1999 at that point the french franc was converted to the euro at 6 55957 to 1 the cfa franc s currency exchange rate thus became 655 957 to 1 euro where it remains pegged to this day a legacy of french colonial debt despite this largely symbolic break from a colonial history with france 14 countries have remained indebted to france since their liberation from them in the 1960s benin burkina faso senegal cote d ivoire mali niger togo cameroon central african republic guinea bissau equatorial guinea chad congo brazaville and gabon through a colonial pact france forced these countries to put 85 percent of their foreign reserve into france central bank under the control of the french minister of finance journalist mawuna koutonin wrote in 2014 koutonin and other critics essentially called this foreign reserves deposit system a colonial era tax others argue that this is an exchange for the guarantee of a more stable currency and unlimited convertibility into any currency according to africa check those who defend this deposit system argue that it has offered financial stability to these nations since independence but critics see this enforced debt as part of a harsh legacy of dependence on france african leaders who refuse are killed or victim of a coup those who obey are supported and rewarded by france with a lavish lifestyle while their people endure extreme poverty and desperation koutonin wrote many recognize that france would not hold the power it does without its dependence on the billions deposited through this system former french leader jacque chirac once stated that without africa france will slide down into the rank of a third power on twitter feminist scholar and writer judicaelle irakoze outlined all the ways in which the 14 former french colonies in west africa have been indebted to france through this foreign reserves deposit system since december 21 over 20 000 netizens have shared irakoze s twitter thread that schools readers on the history of french colonization and the ways in which former colonies are still locked into debt see more since i can t sleep a thread on france and the 14 african countries who still pay tax colonies up to now i know we cannot compare colonizers but france as a state continues to the most racist and white supremacist and thriving on colony taxes feminist in chief judicaelle_ december 21 2019 irakoze details how in 1958 when guinea fought for independence the french who lived in guinea caused mass destruction ahmad sékou touré resisted and became the first president of guinea and attempted to cut ties completely with france between 1965 1975 when burkina faso became independent from france in 1960 thomas sankara attempted to cancel their agreement to hold at least 50 percent of their foreign reserves in france and tried to cut ties but was killed months later subsequent leadership restored the foreign reserves deposit agreement writer rosebell kagumire notes the irony of the currency change announcement on the same day as sankara s birthday see more on this holy day that is thomas sankara s birthday and coloniser announces half withdrawal from the economies of african countries france must end this nonsense a their being a guarantor of new african currency in 2019 is shameful and shows how long we still have to go rosebell kagumire rosebellk december 22 2019 when mali became independent from france in 1961 resistance fighter modibo keita the first president of mali actively tried to sever ties with france he was eventually overthrown and later died as a prisoner for years mali agreed to hold at least 50 percent of their foreign reserves in france and in 1963 togo also agreed to hold at least 50 percent of their foreign reserves in france irakoze sees this as a kind of colonial era tax like koutonin and continued in her twitter thread to explain the various ways in which leaders who resisted france paid with their lives with either assassinations or coups new currency move at odds with regional goals the economic community of west african states ecowas also plans to launch a regional currency called eco by 2020 that is not pegged to the euro the new york times described president alassane ouattara of cote d ivoire s move to peg the new currency to the euro as a hijacking of the eco that will likely disrupt ecowas plans this is because the seven other ecowas countries all have separate currencies with heavy government restrictions on their exchange rates established in 1975 ecowas is made up of benin burkina faso cape verde gambia ghana guinea guinea bissau ivory coast liberia mali niger nigeria senegal sierra leone and togo to float a common currency all 15 ecowas countries must meet the following criteria a deficit of less than 3 percent of gross domestic product inflation of 10 percent or under and debts worth less than 70 percent of gdp but none of these countries have achieved these criteria reports the afp the continuation of colonization in june 2019 chihombori quao former ambassador of the african union au to the united states stated that france takes over 500 billion from francophone african countries based on a pact they forced these countries to sign before they were granted independence she made these remarks in a presentation the pact for the continuation of colonization and is known to have strong views toward french colonization in africa chihombori quao was fired by the au on november 1 2019 for her criticism of france in january this year luigi di maio italian deputy prime minister accused the french of exploiting africa and fueling migration maio said that france had never stopped colonizing tens of african states the bbc reported maio further stated that were it not for africa france would rank 15th among world economies not in the top six the currency name change is symbolic and historic but it does not undo years of french colonization in west african francophone countries editor s note an earlier version of this post referred to the foreign reserves deposit system as a colonial era tax on january 2 2020 we updated the post to clarify what is meant by colonial era tax and also clarify the terms of the foreign reserves deposit system between french and former colonies in west africa
joseph e stiglitz as the world s business elites trek to davos for their annual gathering people should be asking a simple question have they overcome their infatuation with us president donald trump two years ago a few rare corporate leaders were concerned about climate change or upset at trump s misogyny and bigotry most however were celebrating the president s tax cuts for billionaires and corporations and looking forward to his efforts to deregulate the economy that would allow businesses to pollute the air more get more americans hooked on opioids entice more children to eat their diabetes inducing foods and engage in the sort of financial shenanigans that brought on the 2008 crisis today many corporate bosses are still talking about the continued gdp growth and record stock prices but neither gdp nor the dow is a good measure of economic performance neither tells us what s happening to ordinary citizens living standards or anything about sustainability in fact us economic performance over the past four years is exhibit a in the indictment against relying on these indicators to get a good reading on a country s economic health start by looking at the health of its citizens if they are happy and prosperous they will be healthy and live longer among developed countries america sits at the bottom in this regard us life expectancy already relatively low fell in each of the first two years of trump s presidency and in 2017 midlife mortality reached its highest rate since world war ii this is not a surprise because no president has worked harder to make sure that more americans lack health insurance millions have lost their coverage and the uninsured rate has risen in just two years from 10 9 percent to 13 7 percent one reason for declining life expectancy in america is what anne case and nobel laureate economist angus deaton call deaths of despair caused by alcohol drug overdoses and suicide in 2017 the most recent year for which good data is available such deaths stood at almost four times their 1999 level the only time i have seen anything like these declines in health outside of war or epidemics was when i was chief economist of the world bank and found out that mortality and morbidity data confirmed what our economic indicators suggested about the dismal state of the post soviet russian economy trump may be a good president for the top 1 percent and especially for the top 0 1 percent but he has not been good for everyone else if fully implemented the 2017 tax cut will result in tax increases for most households in the second third and fourth income quintiles given tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the ultrarich and corporations it should come as no surprise that there was no significant change in the median us household s disposable income between 2017 and 2018 again the most recent year with good data the lion s share of the increase in gdp is also going to those at the top real median weekly earnings are just 2 6 percent above their level when trump took office and these increases have not offset long periods of wage stagnation for example the median wage of a full time male worker and those with full time jobs are the lucky ones is still more than 3 percent below what it was 40 years ago nor has there been much progress on reducing racial disparities in the third quarter of 2019 median weekly earnings for black men working full time were less than three quarters the level for white men making matters worse the growth that has occurred is not environmentally sustainable and even less so thanks to the trump administration s gutting of regulations that have passed stringent cost benefit analyses the air will be less breathable the water less drinkable and the planet more subject to climate change in fact losses related to climate change have already reached new highs in the us which has suffered more property damage than any other country reaching some 1 5 percent of gdp in 2017 the tax cuts were supposed to spur a new wave of investment instead they triggered an all time record binge of share buybacks some 800 billion in 2018 by some of america s most profitable companies and led to record peacetime deficits almost 1 trillion in fiscal 2019 in a country supposedly near full employment and even with weak investment the us had to borrow massively abroad the most recent data shows foreign borrowing at nearly 500 billion a year with an increase of more than 10 percent in america s net indebtedness position in one year alone likewise trump s trade wars for all their sound and fury have not reduced the us trade deficit which was one quarter higher in 2018 than it was in 2016 the 2018 goods deficit was the largest on record even the deficit in trade with china was up almost a quarter from 2016 the us did get a new north american trade agreement without the investment agreement provisions that the business roundtable wanted without the provisions raising drug prices that the pharmaceutical companies wanted and with better labor and environmental provisions trump a self proclaimed master deal maker lost on almost every front in his negotiations with congressional democrats resulting in a slightly improved trade arrangement and despite trump s vaunted promises to bring manufacturing jobs back to the us the increase in manufacturing employment is still lower than it was under his predecessor barack obama once the post 2008 recovery set in and is still markedly below its precrisis level even the unemployment rate at a 50 year low masks economic fragility the employment rate for working age males and females while rising has increased less than during the obama recovery and is still significantly below that of other developed countries the pace of job creation is also markedly slower than it was under obama again the low employment rate is not a surprise not least because unhealthy people can t work moreover those on disability benefits in prison the us incarceration rate has increased more than sixfold since 1970 with some 2 million people currently behind bars or so discouraged that they are not actively seeking jobs are not counted as unemployed but of course they are not employed nor is it a surprise that a country that doesn t provide affordable child care or guarantee family leave would have lower female employment adjusted for population more than 10 percentage points lower than other developed countries even judging by gdp the trump economy falls short last quarter s growth was just 2 1 percent far less than the 4 percent 5 percent or even 6 percent trump promised to deliver and even less than the 2 4 percent average of obama s second term that is a remarkably poor performance considering the stimulus provided by the 1 trillion deficit and ultralow interest rates this is not an accident or just a matter of bad luck trump s brand is uncertainty volatility and prevarication whereas trust stability and confidence are essential for growth so is equality according to the international monetary fund so trump deserves failing grades not just on essential tasks like upholding democracy and preserving our planet he should not get a pass on the economy either joseph e stiglitz a nobel laureate in economics is a professor at columbia university and chief economist at the roosevelt institute ed

2019 was an exceptional year for stocks at home and abroad with both the aussie and us markets hitting all time highs it was also the 11th year of the current bull market one of the longest on records so it is hard not to approach 2020 without some degree of trepidation more so because the outlook seems to come down to the actions of the erratic and unpredictable president donald trump if the trade war between the two largest economies china and the usa continues or escalates again that has to be bad for stocks and if the us market sinks the aussie market will follow and probably fall further conversely a positive trade outcome will be supportive for the market it may not propel the market that much higher as this is the expected outcome but it will at least remove the biggest negative overhanging it we know that president trump is very attuned to the market and that facing an election in november he will want a strong economy high consumer confidence low interest rates and full employment the absolute last thing he wants is a stockmarket in retreat from a risk reward point of view taking a more defensive orientation due to the unpredictability of the president seems prudent a big drop if he can t pull off an acceptable trade deal probably a smaller rise if he can get it done the odds do however favour a deal so its not time to quit the market also the trend is your friend and despite the tenure of the bull market the direction is still firmly up more confidently we can assume that interest rates are going to stay low very low for some time ultra low interest rates are a function of low economic growth and lack of pricing power by businesses the latter mainly due to disruption by technology and i can t see this changing in 2020 in fact the cheer squad is already calling for rba governor dr phillip lowe to cut the cash rate by a further 0 25 in february some are saying that it will hit 0 25 by june and then the rba will embark on non traditional methods i hope that employment holds firm and that the rba doesn t cut the cash rate because i fear that these cuts will do more harm than good by hitting consumer confidence however i do sense that they will bow to the pressure again this means that expensive defensive stocks such as transurban sydney airport and the a reits are set to become even more expensive as investors chase secure yield the aussie dollar will also remain under downward pressure another trend that is likely to continue in 2020 is that the quality stocks with both top and bottom line growth will get even more expensive with so many of the major companies seemingly growthless there is a paucity of companies of the calibre of csl ramsay rea or seek these stocks are going to stay in very high demand summing this up a strategic level i am not taking money off the table yet but i am also not putting any more money into stocks i am keeping the expensive defensives for my yield portion i am hanging on to quality stocks which have genuine top line growth and will look to increase these weightings if the opportunity arises and stocks with overseas earnings will benefit from the downward pressure on the aussie dollar now let s look at the composition of the portfolio by company size and industry sector large caps or small caps in 2019 both big and small cap stocks have moderately underperformed compared to the overall market as the table below shows the top 20 stocks which make up about 45 of the total market capitalization have returned on a total return basis including dividends 23 4 on a relative basis this is 2 7 worse than the broader market s s p asx 200 total return of 26 1 and is mainly due to the performance of the major banks and insurance companies small caps as evidenced by the small ordinaries index which tracks stocks ranked 101st to 300th by market capitalization also underperformed with a return of 21 7 this index tends to be overweight resource companies and is the second consecutive year of underperformance larger mid caps stocks ranked between 21st and 50th by market capitalization outperformed in 2019 mean reversion that is the tendency for prices and returns to revert to the long run average level of the entire dataset is always something to consider when making assessments on how markets may perform i can t see much in this data to help one way or the other i do however feel that in an environment of lower growth and softer commodity prices small caps may struggle further i think the big banks could do a little better so my inclination is to maintain a bias towards larger cap stocks index returns which sectors the table below lists the 11 industry sectors for the australian sharemarket according to the gics classification methodology it shows the sector weighting as a proportion of the s p asx 200 the return including dividends for 2019 and the returns for calendar 2018 2017 and 2016 sector returns two matters stand out firstly the variability of the returns although all sectors are positive in 2019 the gap between the best performing sector healthcare at 47 4 and worst performing financials at 15 4 is quite material secondly the lack of consistency from year to year so getting the view right on each sector in terms of whether you should be over weight under weight or neutral index weight can have a pretty big impact on portfolio performance what will be the best and worst performing sectors in 2020 here is my take on each sector in descending order of market capitalization a financials index weight the major banks have been laggards and the sector has underperformed for the last four years while mean reversion is a possibility it is hard to see the market wanting to re rate the sector in the short term while earnings are under pressure and with interest rates staying so low and credit growth relatively anaemic opportunities to grow earnings look more likely to come from the cost line rather than the revenue line but capital pressures have abated and fully franked dividend yields in the range of 5 5 to 6 5 will look very attractive to some investors i don t think it is a sector to be short underweight but i can t quite bring myself to going over weight b materials under weight brazilian miner vale resuming full production should act as a cap on iron ore prices this will limit the opportunities for major miners bhp rio and fortescue who have now taken the easy wins on productivity with world economic growth softening and the potential for a stronger us dollar commodity prices look set to remain in a softer cycle while gold and some other precious minerals were big winners in 2019 with the us federal reserve now appearing to be on hold and trade tensions easing i would be surprised if they continue to rally in 2020 non mining material companies such as amcor bluescope or orora have appeal but they will be pressured if growth in the usa slows or a trade deal is not done c health care over weight the best performing sector on the asx in 2019 2018 2017 and over the last 5 years and the last decade not a sector to be short as the tailwinds of an ageing population increasing demand for health services and increasing expenditure by government keep blowing some of the stocks are very expensive but the risk is that they could get even more expensive a risky call but my hunch is to stay overweight d industrials index weight this sector is arguably misnamed because some of the leaders such as toll road operator transurban and sydney airport aren t really industrials in the classic sense qantas is also in this category because of the variety of companies that the sector covers it is largely a stock by stock proposition e real estate index weight with interest rates staying low and demand for east coast office and industrial property strong investor interest in trusts focussed on these sub sectors will be fairly resilient caution around trusts trading at significant premium to nta and shopping centre retail trusts f consumer discretionary over weight largely a stock by stock proposition but one of the better performing sectors in 2019 and one that should benefit from very low interest rates an improving housing market and hopefully an uptick in consumer confidence g consumer staples under weight this sector surprised in 2019 with strong performances by leaders woolworths coles coca cola and a2 milk although a defensive sector it does look very pricey and for the major supermarkets the earnings trajectory is weak moderately under weight h energy index weight over the last couple of years opec has been remarkably successful at managing the production of oil from opec and some non opec nations accordingly the price hasn t been able to break down below us 50 per barrel notwithstanding that the global growth outlook is somewhat subdued i am inclined to play this sector in the expectation that the 50 price level will hold and that the returns for australia

hindsight is 20 20 so they say but some big calls do seem to stand the test of time one of those is the reserve bank s decision to start raising interest rates in may 2002 having cut them only five months previously in his statement explaining that rate cut then rba governor ian macfarlane had expected the global downturn following the dotcom bust to worsen and australia to feel the fallout the dampening impact on other parts of the economy of global events will become increasingly clear during 2002 at a time when the housing upswing will begin to moderate he had predicted but that didn t happen in fact the us economy posted strong growth in early 2002 and the rest of the world was being dragged along with it moreover the moderation in house prices that mr macfarlane forecast didn t eventuate by may 2002 mr macfarlane seemed to be following the famous adage generally attributed to economist john maynard keynes when the facts change i change my mind what do you do sir the strong rises in house prices seen over recent years have also been associated with a rapid expansion in household debt a process that carries longer term risks if households become seriously over extended he wrote then justifying the rapid about face on rates to persist with a strongly expansionary policy setting would risk amplifying inflation pressures and over time could fuel other imbalances such as the current overheating in the housing market potentially jeopardising the economy s continued expansion reserve bank tapped the brakes on housing bubble 1 looking back on that decision in a recent interview with joseph walker for his jolly swagman podcast mr macfarlane said he was very happy with the result i don t know whether we did it but certainly house prices stopped rising certainly that s what we were trying to achieve and it was a gentle landing they didn t collapse he said gentle is something of an understatement on average house prices kept rising for another two years and then remained broadly steady for a few years until the rate cuts and first home buyers boost in the wake of 2008 s global financial crisis stoked them again but for first home buyers the damage had already been done during mr macfarlane s tenure as central bank boss average capital city house prices rose 120 per cent and went from being just above four times annual incomes to nearly seven mr macfarlane argues part of this surge was the inevitable consequence of taming inflation we finally got inflation down and were able to bring interest rates down and when interest rates came down people could afford to service bigger mortgages he explained bigger mortgages of course mean people have more money to spend on houses pushing up prices capital gains tax cut sparked crazy property speculation but that had already happened in the 1990s so what explained the pop in house prices at the turn of the millennium ian macfarlane was reserve bank governor between 1996 and 2006 mick tsikas file photo aap on top of that we had something that was really harmful which was pure speculative activity particularly through negatively geared acquisition of second third fourth fifth properties mr macfarlane continued i m particularly talking about a period around the turn of the century from 2000 particularly 2002 2003 when it was at its peak it was starting to get pretty crazy then and it was starting to get pretty close to a bubble the interview doesn t really dive into it but there s only one major policy shift that could have triggered such a stampede into speculative property investment that is the howard costello government s decision in 1999 to effectively halve capital gains tax cgt overnight albeit probably exacerbated by its goods and services tax which pushed up the cost of building new homes relative to buying existing properties this 50 per cent cgt discount gave higher earners a strong incentive to convert current income from salaries profits and investments into future capital gains that would be much more lightly taxed the obvious way to do this was through borrowing money to buy an investment property deducting the interest bill against your current earnings and if properties prices kept going up pocketing the profits from selling while only paying tax on half of them to give a sense of the change in the property market after the cgt discount the number of taxpayers reporting a rental loss jumped from 631 435 in 1999 2000 to more than a million in 2005 06 while the number of landlords reporting a profit actually fell from 532 472 to less than half a million effectively this meant howard and costello left mr macfarlane s reserve bank to clean up the mess it made of the property market with the only tool the rba has the blunt one of interest rate rises luckily america s rapid recovery from the dotcom bust and china s epic growth in the early 2000s with the australian mining boom that triggered meant the rba could do this and check further property price gains without sinking the broader economy reserve bank generated property bubble 2 the next property price bounce was sparked by dramatic interest rate cuts the cash rate more than halved from 7 25 per cent to 3 per cent in just eight months from september 2008 to april 2009 and the rudd government s first home buyer boost during the global financial crisis but it was fleeting the government grants were temporary and then rba governor glenn stevens stuck with his predecessor s playbook and started hiking rates again by october 2009 as it became clear the worst of the global crisis had passed however as the mining boom turned to bust and desperate for another source of economic growth the reserve bank itself turned to residential construction as saviour with no major changes in government housing policies it s abundantly clear that the property price boom that ran from 2012 to 2017 was largely down to the rba s rate cuts from 4 75 down to 1 5 per cent it wasn t as big as the early 2000s boom nor mr macfarlane said was it so exclusively dominated by speculative investment purchases but he added it definitely did seem bubble like one of the reasons it wasn t as dominated by speculative investors was intervention by the regulators the banking supervisor apra in consultation with the council of financial regulators which includes the rba started putting the brakes on investor lending in late 2014 probably trying to avoid a repeat of the early 2000s craziness nonetheless house prices across australia s capitals jumped by two thirds dominated by increases in sydney and melbourne that prompted apra to limit other forms of risky loans such as interest only mortgages while asic and the banking royal commission focused further scrutiny on lax lending standards by the end of 2017 the boom ran out of finance and out of momentum prices fell around 15 per cent in sydney and 11 per cent in melbourne but were still more than 80 per cent higher than when mr macfarlane left the rba once again it was reserve bank rate cuts this time in conjunction with apra loosening its lending restrictions and the re election of a coalition government promising the continuity of investor tax breaks that turned home prices back upwards while that might spell relief for property owners developers banks and real estate agents mr macfarlane isn t sure it s a good thing for the economy longer term it probably would ve been better to have had a bigger correction although over the short term that would have hurt a bit where to now having now seemingly twice avoided property crashes after bubbles does the former reserve bank head think it will be third time unlucky for australia do i see the risk of a collapse in house prices no i don t he told the jolly swagman podcast i think that those huge long term structural factors are so powerful the desire for people to compete with each other to buy houses or apartments in places where there are good jobs which means big cities people coming from other parts of the world to do it people coming from the country to do it people are already here doing it i think a fundamental shift in the relative price of housing has occurred over the last 30 or 40 years i don t think it s ever going to go back to where it was but does that mean anyone who can should rush out to buy investment properties mr macfarlane thinks not i don t think it can continue to go up as fast as it has over that period he forecast i think we ve reached the limit of the household sector s capacity to service mortgages after leaving the reserve bank s top job mr macfarlane crunched the numbers and believes most property investors would have been better off putting their money elsewhere if you re lucky enough to buy right at the bottom and sell at the top yes you will make money but that s only a minority of people who do that he said the majority i think either make not much more money than they would ve in the bank or in many cases they lose money for the few who do succeed at making money out of rising property values he had this message you re making yourself richer at the expense of your children and like the use of non renewable resources or the pollution of a finite earth that kind of intergenerational theft clearly isn t sustainable
washington ap size matters to president donald trump so much that he exaggerates continually sometimes spectacularly the size of what he does just as his tax cuts are far from the biggest in history the economy isn t the best ever and his election victory in 2016 was no landslide of historic proportions trump s two trade deals don t stand atop the field of presidential endeavors one is a partial settlement of trade grievances with china the other is a refresh of what past presidents created for north america the opening of the senate impeachment trial stirred other fabrications from the president this past week while democratic presidential contenders engaged in their final debate before the first votes of the 2020 campaign in iowa a sampling from a week in political rhetoric trade trump on his trade agreement with china this is the biggest deal there is anywhere in the world by far remarks wednesday at the signing trump on the china deal and his updated north american trade agreement so we ve done two of the biggest trade deals they are the two biggest trade deals in the world ever done remarks at the white house on thursday the facts neither claim is true the china agreement is not nearly as big as the u s mexico canada agreement so it s not the largest ever much less by far the deal with canada and mexico was an update of the long standing north american free trade agreement worked out by presidents george h w bush and bill clinton the north american agreement also is not the largest ever for instance 123 countries signed the uruguay round agreement that liberalized trade and produced the world trade organization in 1994 the organization s initial membership accounted for more than 90 of global economic output the federal reserve bank of boston found and that was before china joined the organization also bigger the trans pacific partnership which would have joined north america with pacific rim countries in freer trade trump took the u s out after the deal was negotiated and before the u s ratified it the european union was formed from a giant deal the china deal leaves tariffs in place on about 360 billion in imports from china and pushes substantial remaining disputes ahead to a second phase of negotiations ___ trump on china deal i did the biggest deal ever done in the history of our country yesterday in terms of trade and probably other things too if you think about it remarks thursday the facts trump is even more wildly off the mark in speculating that his china trade deal eclipses all other international agreements even outside trade the montreal protocol aimed at protecting earth s ozone layer was ratified by every member state of the united nations a variety of other agreements on the rights of children world health standards droughts achieved nearly universal ratification more than 190 countries signed the paris accord on climate change of which more than 180 have ratified it the u s is pulling out of it ___ impeachment trump we demand fairness shouts pelosi and the do nothing democrats yet the dems in the house wouldn t let us have 1 witness no lawyers or even ask questions tweet monday referring to house speaker nancy pelosi d calif the facts not true the house judiciary committee which produced the articles of impeachment invited trump or his legal team to come he declined absent white house representation the hearings proceeded as things in congress routinely do time is split between democratic and republican lawmakers to ask questions and engage in the debate lawyers for democrats and republicans on the committee presented the case for and against the impeachment articles and members questioned witnesses among them an academic called forward by republicans the first round of hearings was by the house intelligence committee and resembled the investigative phase of criminal cases conducted without the participation of the subject of the investigation trump cried foul then at the lack of representation then rejected representation when the next committee offered it his lawyers will participate in the senate s impeachment trial ___ trump you had a fake whistleblower that wrote a report that bore no relationship to what was said everything was false remarks thursday the facts trump s statement is false the whistleblower s account of a phone call between trump and ukraine s leader in july closely resembled what was said judging by the rough transcript released later by the white house itself and by the testimony of officials who listened in on the call witnesses in the impeachment hearings and other sources also verified the whistleblower s description of events before and after the call as trump and his aides pressed ukraine to investigate one of trump s political rivals democrat joe biden the senate impeachment trial will explore whether trump abused his power ___ economy trump in wisconsin the unemployment rate has reached its lowest level in history milwaukee rally tuesday the facts he s citing outdated figures wisconsin did post a record low unemployment rate of 2 8 in april and may but it has since edged up and is now at 3 3 that s slightly lower than the u s average of 3 5 but suggests that the state hit a rough patch in the middle of last year ___ trump more than 300 000 people under obama 300 000 people left the workforce under just three years of my administration 3 5 million people have joined the workforce milwaukee rally the facts trump is wrong about barack obama s record more than 5 million people joined the u s labor force during obama s presidency according to labor department figures these gains reflect the recovery from the great recession as well as population growth more than 4 8 million people have joined the labor force in three years of trump s presidency ___ trump under the trump economy the lowest paid earners are reaping the biggest fastest and largest gains earnings for the bottom 10 are rising faster than earnings for the top 10 proportionally milwaukee rally the facts actually the top 10 of earners saw the biggest raises of any income bracket over the past year their usual weekly earnings jumped 8 or 168 according to the labor department the bottom 10 saw weekly incomes grow 7 or 30 over a broader range the top and bottom 25 weekly earnings also grew at faster rate for the wealthier group ___ trump we ve created 7 million jobs since the election including more than 1 million manufacturing and construction jobs nobody thought that was possible milwaukee rally the facts his numbers are roughly right though they are less impressive than trump claims job gains under trump over the past three years were lower than during the final three years of obama s presidency more than 8 million jobs were added during that period under obama including 1 2 million combined in manufacturing and construction what these figures suggest is that much of the job growth under trump reflects the momentum from a recovery that officially began in the middle of 2009 ___ immigration trump we have loopholes like a visa lottery we put things in the lottery and they come in they become american citizens do you think these countries are giving us their finest oh let s give them our best citizens milwaukee rally the facts this is a perpetual falsehood from the president countries don t nominate their citizens for the program they don t get to select people they d like to get rid of foreigners apply for the visas on their own under the program citizens of countries named by the u s can bid for visas if they have enough education or work experience in desired fields out of that pool of qualified applicants the state department randomly selects a much smaller pool of tentative winners not all winners will have visas approved because they still must compete for a smaller number of slots by getting their applications in quickly those who are ultimately offered visas still need to go through background checks like other immigrants ___ trump mexico s paying for the wall you know that it s all worked out milwaukee rally the facts mexico isn t paying for trump s long promised border wall trump has argued that the updated trade agreement with canada and mexico will pay for the wall because of economic benefits he predicts will come from the deal nothing in the trade agreement would cover or refund the construction cost or require a payment from mexico ___ child care biden on his early days in washington i was making 42 000 a year i commuted every single solitary day to wilmington delaware over 500 miles a day excuse me 250 miles a day because i could not afford child care it was beyond my reach democratic presidential debate tuesday the facts that s a stretch biden s wife and daughter died in a car accident after he won a senate seat in 1972 as a single parent working far out of town biden might have faced steeper child care costs than people who work locally do but his senate salary actually 42 500 was worth more than 256 000 in today s dollars that s more than four times the median household income ___ health care trump i was the person who saved pre existing conditions in your healthcare you have it now tweet monday the facts that s false people with preexisting medical problems have health insurance protections because of obama s health care law which trump is trying to dismantle one of trump s major alternatives to obama s law short term health insurance already in place doesn t have to cover preexisting conditions another alternative is association health plans which are oriented to small businesses and sole proprietors and do cover preexisting conditions meanwhile trump s administration has been pressing in court for full repeal of the obama era law including provisions that protect people with preexisting conditions from health insurance discrimination with obamacare still in place insurers in the individual marketplace must take all applicants regardless of medical history and charge the same standard premiums to healthy people and those who have poor health or past medical problems before obama s law any insurer could deny coverage or charge more to anyone with a preexisting condition who was seeking to buy an individual policy ___ bernie sanders medicare for all will cost substantially less than the status quo democratic debate the facts there s no guarantee of that the nonpartisan congressional budget office said in a report last year that total spending under a single payer system like the vermont senator and democratic presidential candidate favors might be higher or lower than under the current system depending on the key features of the new system those features have to do with the design of the system questions such as payment rates for hospitals and doctors and whether patients are required to pay part of the cost of their care sanders says his plan would require no cost sharing from patients no copays and no deductibles but completely free care could trigger a surge in demand for medical services raising costs other countries that provide coverage for all do use cost sharing to help keep spending in check a research report last year by the nonprofit rand think tank estimated that a medicare for all plan similar to what sanders wants would modestly raise total u s health spending ___ military trump on killing iran gen qassem soleimani the democrats and the fake news are trying to make terrorist soleimani into a wonderful guy tweet monday trump you know what bothers me when i see a nancy pelosi trying to defend this monster from iran when nancy pelosi and the democrats want to defend him i think that s a very bad thing for this country remarks on jan 9 at event on environmental regulations the facts that s a fabrication democrats did not praise or defend the iranian general they criticized the action trump took pelosi called the u s missile strike provocative and disproportionate while branding soleimani a terrible person similarly democratic presidential candidates criticized trump s strategy and the fact he didn t notify or consult congress in advance while making clear they considered soleimani anything but wonderful the iranian was a murderer responsible for the deaths of thousands including hundreds of americans said massachusetts sen elizabeth warren even so republican rep doug collins of georgia asserted democrats were in love with terrorists then retracted the statement and apologized i left parts of my body in iraq fighting terrorists democratic sen tammy duckworth of ilinois a former army pilot who lost both her legs while serving in iraq told cnn after hearing collins initial remarks i don t need to justify myself to anyone ___ trump our military has been totally rebuilt milwaukee rally the facts it hasn t the administration has accelerated a sharp buildup in defense spending but it will take years for freshly ordered tanks planes and other weapons to be built delivered and put to use the air force s minuteman 3 missiles for instance a key part of the u s nuclear force have been operating since the early 1970s and modernization started under the obama administration they are due to be replaced with a new version but not until later this decade ___ biden i was asked to bring 156 000 troops home from that war which i did i led that effort democratic debate the facts biden is roughly right about bringing troops home but he didn t mention that the u s had to send some back obama did designate biden his vice president to take the lead in pulling u s forces out of iraq and coordinating efforts to maintain stability in baghdad his results were mixed biden and obama failed to win agreement from the iraqi government to keep a limited number of u s troops there after december 2011 that was the deadline for a complete u s pullout under a deal negotiated by the bush administration biden was still vice president when obama was compelled to return american troops to iraq in 2014 after the rise of the islamic state group ___ electability trump on the 2016 election there have been some great movements where somebody came along and out of the nowhere won the state of new hampshire won iowa won south carolina down the way won a state someplace but we won 32 states the facts trump won 30 states not 32 it was no landslide he won with about 57 of electoral votes a comfortable margin but no better than average or below average obama and clinton each won bigger victories twice and many other presidents outperformed trump moreover republican trump lost the popular vote to democrat hillary clinton a rare occurrence for a winning candidate trump routinely inflates the number of electoral votes he won too ___ warren the only person on this stage who has beaten an incumbent republican any time in the past 30 years is me democratic debate sanders just to set the record straight i defeated a republican incumbent running for congress warren i said i was the only one who s beaten an incumbent republican in 30 years the facts sanders wins this argument one of the stranger disputes of the night by a matter of months in november 1990 sanders beat republican incumbent peter smith to take vermont s only house seat that was 29 years and two months ago sanders win

new york as the world s business elites trek to davos for their annual gathering people should be asking a simple question have they overcome their infatuation with us president donald trump two years ago a few rare corporate leaders were concerned about climate change or upset at trump s misogyny and bigotry most however were celebrating the president s tax cuts for billionaires and corporations and looking forward to his efforts to deregulate the economy that would allow businesses to pollute the air more get more americans hooked on opioids entice more children to eat their diabetes inducing foods and engage in the sort of financial shenanigans that brought on the 2008 crisis today many corporate bosses are still talking about the continued gdp growth and record stock prices but neither gdp nor the dow is a good measure of economic performance neither tells us what is happening to ordinary citizens living standards or anything about sustainability in fact us economic performance over the past four years is exhibit a in the indictment against relying on these indicators to get a good reading on a country s economic health start by looking at the health of its citizens if they are happy and prosperous they will be healthy and live longer among developed countries america sits at the bottom in this regard us life expectancy already relatively low fell in each of the first two years of trump s presidency and in 2017 midlife mortality reached its highest rate since world war ii this is not a surprise because no president has worked harder to make sure that more americans lack health insurance millions have lost their coverage and the uninsured rate has risen in just two years from 10 9 per cent to 13 7 per cent one reason for declining life expectancy in america is what anne case and nobel laureate economist angus deaton call deaths of despair caused by alcohol drug overdoses and suicide in 2017 the most recent year for which good data are available such deaths stood at almost four times their 1999 level the only time i have seen anything like these declines in health outside of war or epidemics was when i was chief economist of the world bank and found out that mortality and morbidity data confirmed what our economic indicators suggested about the dismal state of the post soviet russian economy trump may be a good president for the top 1 per cent and especially for the top 0 1 per cent but he has not been good for everyone else if fully implemented the 2017 tax cut will result in tax increases for most households in the second third and fourth income quintiles given tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the ultrarich and corporations it should come as no surprise that there was no significant change in the median us household s disposable income between 2017 and 2018 again the most recent year with good data the lion s share of the increase in gdp is also going to those at the top real median weekly earnings are just 2 6 per cent above their level when trump took office and these increases have not offset long periods of wage stagnation for example the median wage of a full time male worker and those with full time jobs are the lucky ones is still more than 3 per cent below what it was 40 years ago nor has there been much progress on reducing racial disparities in the third quarter of 2019 median weekly earnings for black men working full time were less than three quarters the level for white men making matters worse the growth that has occurred is not environmentally sustainable and even less so thanks to the trump administration s gutting of regulations that have passed stringent cost benefit analyses the air will be less breathable the water less drinkable and the planet more subject to climate change in fact losses related to climate change have already reached new highs in the us which has suffered more property damage than any other country reaching some 1 5 per cent of gdp in 2017 the tax cuts were supposed to spur a new wave of investment instead they triggered an all time record binge of share buybacks some 800 billion in 2018 by some of america s most profitable companies and led to record peacetime deficits almost 1 trillion in fiscal 2019 in a country supposedly near full employment and even with weak investment the us had to borrow massively abroad the most recent data show foreign borrowing at nearly 500 billion a year with an increase of more than 10 per cent in america s net indebtedness position in one year alone likewise trump s trade wars for all their sound and fury have not reduced the us trade deficit which was one quarter higher in 2018 than it was in 2016 the 2018 goods deficit was the largest on record even the deficit in trade with china was up almost a quarter from 2016 the us did get a new north american trade agreement without the investment agreement provisions that the business roundtable wanted without the provisions raising drug prices that the pharmaceutical companies wanted and with better labour and environmental provisions trump a self proclaimed master deal maker lost on almost every front in his negotiations with congressional democrats resulting in a slightly improved trade arrangement and despite trump s vaunted promises to bring manufacturing jobs back to the us the increase in manufacturing employment is still lower than it was under his predecessor barack obama once the post 2008 recovery set in and is still markedly below its pre crisis level even the unemployment rate at a 50 year low masks economic fragility the employment rate for working age males and females while rising has increased less than during the obama recovery and is still significantly below that of other developed countries the pace of job creation is also markedly slower than it was under obama again the low employment rate is not a surprise not least because unhealthy people cannot work moreover those on disability benefits in prison the us incarceration rate has increased more than sixfold since 1970 with some two million people currently behind bars or so discouraged that they are not actively seeking jobs are not counted as unemployed but of course they are not employed nor is it a surprise that a country that doesn t provide affordable childcare or guarantee family leave would have lower female employment adjusted for population more than ten percentage points lower than other developed countries even judging by gdp the trump economy falls short last quarter s growth was just 2 1 per cent far less than the 4 per cent 5 per cent or even 6 per cent trump promised to deliver and even less than the 2 4 per cent average of obama s second term that is a remarkably poor performance considering the stimulus provided by the 1 trillion deficit and ultra low interest rates this is not an accident or just a matter of bad luck trump s brand is uncertainty volatility and prevarication whereas trust stability and confidence are essential for growth so is equality according to the international monetary fund so trump deserves failing grades not just on essential tasks

the difference between success and failure in forex trading is very likely to depend upon which currency pairs you choose to trade each week and not on the exact trading methods you might use to determine trade entries and exits each week i am going to analyze fundamentals sentiment and technical positions in order to determine which currency pairs are most likely to produce the easiest and most profitable trading opportunities over the next week in some cases it will be trading the trend in other cases it will be trading support and resistance levels during more ranging markets big picture 19th january 2020 in my previous piece last week i forecasted that the best trades were likely to be long of gold in usd terms following a daily close above 1575 and long of the s p 500 index in usd terms following a daily close above 3275 gold never made a daily close above 1575 during the week while the s p 500 index rose by 1 26 after closing at 3288 13 on monday these were good calls overall as these trades produced an averaged win of 0 63 last week s forex market saw the strongest rise in the relative value of the swiss franc and the strongest fall in the relative value of the japanese yen fundamental analysis market sentiment fundamental analysts are leaning in favor of a weaker usd as the federal reserve is set on a course of inflating its balance sheet and as there is little prospect of a rate increase in the foreseeable future the u s economy is still growing and fears of a pending recession have receded sentiment has been aided by the completion of a phase one u s china trade deal last week showed strong u s consumer sentiment there are solid reasons to be bullish on stock markets generally especially the u s stock market we are seeing valid long term trends in the s p 500 index the dax and the ftse 100 all bullish and the usd jpy currency pair which seems to be making a long term bullish breakout above 110 00 technical analysis u s dollar index the weekly price chart below shows last week printed a bullish candlestick which closed very near to the top of its price range the close was also above the recent resistance level at 12309 which has now probably flipped to become new support these are bullish signs but the price is below its levels from both 6 and 3 months ago which indicates a bearish trend therefore we have mixed signs here and the short term bullish action makes this week s direction hard to predict usd jpy the usd jpy currency pair just made its highest weekly close in 9 months the weekly candlestick was not especially large but closed very close to the top of its price range which is a bullish sign there is likely to be key resistance at about 112 41 so the price has lots of room to move considering how relatively low volatility has been s p 500 index the s p 500 index just made its highest ever weekly close this is always a bullish sign and recent price data shows that after this even there is typically a 53 chance that next week will close higher still last week s candlestick was bullish on above average volatility and closed very near the top of its price range both of which are bullish signs dax 30 index the dax 30 index just made its highest ever weekly close this is always a bullish sign and momentum is with the bulls however last week s candlestick was had below average volatility and closed very slightly down over the week suggesting the american stock market is probably a better opportunity right now conclusion this week i forecast the best trades are likely to be long of usd jpy and the s p 500 index in usd terms
director general and chief executive officer of the debt management office patience oniha spoke on issues concerning public debt management at an interactive session with some journalists in abuja ihuoma chiedozie was there what informed the federal government s penchant for borrowing most governments borrow it is not just nigeria whether they are capitalists or migrating from socialism to capitalism we borrow to finance specific projects and that is where the medium term external borrowing plan is situated every two years the ministry of finance on behalf of the federal government presents that request to the federal executive council loans from multilateral and bilateral sources we are talking of institutions like the african development bank confessional and semi concessional borrowings every two years it goes to the national assembly that is why it is a medium term programme it goes to fec first that is what the fiscal responsibility act says and from there to the national assembly they loans are to be used to finance specific projects borrowing is derived from the appropriation act borrowing is a source of funding the budget deficit about 90 per cent of the annual budget deficit is financed through borrowing we know the process of approving the budget the various stages it goes through by the time it is approved by the national assembly and signed into law it is really something that all of us collectively have approved so when people are talking about new borrowings we should be confident that this has gone through the rigour of the federal executive council where you are all represented by state and the national assembly before it got there we got out of recession in 2017 and what has happened the level of new borrowings has been declining we can borrow to refinance but i want to focus on financing activities and financing budget deficit we are not just talking about figures in the air have the new borrowings been made by the government to conform to the debt management strategy borrowing is not approved by one man it is not determined by one man it is a collective decision so when you say this administration has borrowed previous administrations also borrowed so borrowing is cumulative there are rules and regulations for borrowing so the point being made is that borrowing is not ad hoc it is not a decision of one man or one woman there are laws and laid down procedures that have to be complied with in fact before the budget document is presented to the national assembly it must comply with the fiscal responsibility act we are actually complying with the laws so having the laws and the budget determines the nature of the borrowing we also have the strategy the budget says how much we should raise should we issue fgn bonds should it be five years should it be ten years all that is driven by strategy all that we did in 2017 2018 and 2019 was driven by the strategy so if you look at the budget you will see that there is new domestic borrowing and new external borrowing for each of those years it is because the strategy says domestic borrowing is less expensive less risky than external in addition to that you have external because it also helps reserves and you can get more longer tenure it also says that the domestic debt portfolio has a lot of short term instruments and thresholds thresholds have also been trending lately so let s extend that to long term so that is why you saw us active in the eurobond market in 2017 and 2018 and for treasury bills we paid about a trillion naira in treasury bills there is a strategy around it the new debt management strategy is being finalised and we expect that within a month it will be sent to the federal executive council for approval we set ourselves a domestic debt to external debt portfolio ratio of 60 40 we are at 68 32 before we started implementing the rtp in 2017 we had less than 20 per cent in external debt and 80 per cent was domestic we were accused of crowding out the private sector we were accused of making the interest rate very high which was stopping the banks from lending to the real sector we have been repenting of those things since 2017 in terms of the distribution of domestic debt between long term and short term the target was 75 to 25 but as in september 2019 we were actually at 80 to 20 meaning we have overperformed the budget the reason is that we stopped using treasury bills as a new borrowing instrument like i always said government debt is to finance long term projects so treasury bills cannot be the large part of our portfolio what was the reason for the increase in public debt stock between june and september 2019 the figures as of september were the total public debt federal government states and the federal capital territory it is not the federal government alone the increase between june and september for that three month period we can explain that partly there was an external borrowing that was included in the 2019 appropriation act about n805bn that one didn t happen because we were confident as a government that the 2020 budget would be approved early so if we raise eurobonds in september and budget ends in december there is really no time to use that money for capital projects which is what it was meant for so that was suspended and it will now happen in the 2020 appropriation act for the 2019 budget as of november i can say that we have concluded the domestic borrowing and passed on the money to the federal government for appropriation that explains why the growth is marginal but the overall growth by the end of the year will not be significant the dmo recently said the country s total public debt was not the responsibility of only one administration but the debt stock rose considerably between 2015 and 2018 what is the justification for this yes our total debt stock has grown between 2015 and 2018 but we want to explain that total public debt comprises the borrowings of the federal government and the states and the fct the narrative is that it was buhari s administration but it is really the three tiers of government we want nigerians to keep it in mind that we are talking about the collective borrowings of the federal government the states and the fct but the borrowing did not just happen you know what happened to oil revenue no need to go into that but we borrow to bridge the revenue gap to finance infrastructure so that jobs can be created and to stimulate growth again it was not ad hoc it was deliberate also when the naira was devalued from n199 to n305 if you convert the external debt we had at that time without new borrowing it increased by over a trillion naira budget deficits have been dropping since 2017 so also new borrowings is nigeria s debt sustainable debt sustainability is measured by debt to gdp ratio and in september we had 18 47 per cent the simplistic assumption to make is we have room for more borrowings but that is not our position if you look at the united states and other countries they have much higher debt to gdp ratio but when you compare their debt service to revenue they are very low they are able to service debt more effectively because they are generating revenue our focus should be on revenue and we are already doing something about it new borrowings are reducing and we are trying to reduce the cost of borrowing but we can t leave revenue out of the discussion revenue must grow we are all happy about the finance act and we hope that when nerc releases the new tariff nigerians will support it and pay we are all stakeholders we can t complain about high debt service to revenue and not want government to generate revenue it is a win win on both sides not you win and we lose we have done a lot but we are not yet there what do we need to do do we continue to borrow or focus on aggressive growth of revenue so revenue can t be missing from the equation this is a time to look at public private partnerships because that will reduce the need for government to borrow then we need to diversify because we can t keep talking of oil sometimes when bad things happen in the middle east it turns out positive for the oil market but that is not the way to grow an economy or develop an economy oil price has risen to 70 per barrel who says it can t come down to 30 in a short while we can t depend on only when the price goes up we have to look for more sustainable revenue sources let us be aware that new borrowings are a collective decision of the legislature and the executive and there are laws that make that happen let me also say this i have said it before but sometimes the discussion becomes political as long as i can remember we have been running deficits in our budget whether oil prices was n110 n105 or production was over two million barrels per day we have always run on a deficit unfortunately crude oil price dropped and production dropped and we are borrowing and that becomes an issue but most of the deficits in the budget have always been financed by new borrowings so the relatively high level of new borrowing between 2015 and 2017 was for the government to bridge the revenue gap but it wasn t just a case of let s do it it was included in the economic recovery and growth plan are you saying that the borrowing was responsible for nigeria s recovery from recession the point i made was that government revenue dropped i think at a point it dropped to 23 per barrel also production dropped so borrowing came in to fund the budget which included capital projects when you finance capital projects you create an entire economy around that in terms of employment materials that you buy and what happens in the environment there are vendors selling a lot of things so we are talking about the multiplier effect of borrowing to finance infrastructure and what it generates it is just a simple economic theory some oil marketers protested that they were losing money from the promissory notes issued to them by the federal government they said they were not getting the real value why is that so government took up responsibility to say we are giving promissory notes to those we owe these were arrears prior to 2017 it is not like you did a contract for us now and we issue you a promissory note they are arrears from some years back it is voluntary on the part of the businessmen you don t have to take a promissory note you can wait until when government has money in its budget to pay you they have a sovereign instrument that they can take to the bank in exchange for cash but some of them actually owe banks heavily the instrument is liquid you can trade it like the fgn bonds and treasury bills the banks will accept it and if the bearer of the promissory note does not owe them the bank will give them the money but if they owe the banks the banks will take the promissory notes to liquidate the loans we issue promissory

islamabad the china myanmar economic corridor cmec under the belt and road framework has become the focus of china myanmar cooperation which will be jointly build by the two countries chinese president xi jinping concluded a two day visit to myanmar on saturday where he had extensive meetings with the leadership of that country according to chinese analysts myanmar can get the needed stimulus in its economy as well as create the strategic opportunities to expedite its economic growth by jointly building the cmec with china in fact myanmar s economy can register leapfrog growth if it can successfully co build the cmec the chinese are of the view that myanmar has to build more power plants and improve its transportation infrastructure to accelerate economic growth especially the shortage of electricity in myanmar is seriously hindering its industrial development the first step toward building the cmec is to build the china myanmar expressway and railway a railway that extends from kunming to ruili in yunnan province across the border to mandalay and then west to kyaukpyu in rakhine state and southeast to yangon this will establish myanmar s fundamental railway structure which can later be extended to cover the entire country the china myanmar oil and gas pipeline project connecting western myanmar and yunnan which was built by china between 2013 and 2017 has not only become a source of new income and employment for myanmar people but also eased the demand for energy along the route as such the two countries are likely to deepen cooperation on energy under the cmec framework especially to strengthen myanmar s power generation sector according to the report the cmec will promote myanmar s trade myanmar s export to neighboring countries has been restricted due to poor transportation facilities which means the country needs to urgently improve its transport infrastructure in order to reduce transportation costs and increase the export of products such as rice and fruits to china the cmec will help propel the development of myanmar s industry including the manufacturing sector especially in the mandalay industrial zone new yangon city and the kyaukpyu special economic zone the improvement of transport infrastructure and building of more power plants will help myanmar tap its full tourism potential which could play an increasingly important role in facilitating myanmar s economic takeoff the cmec is likely to attract more foreign capital it will inject added vitality into myanmar s economy report has suggested that china too will benefit from the cmec the economic corridor will ensure energy security by opening a new energy transportation channel and help establish a new pattern of further opening the chinese economy in the new era by facilitating the economic integration of china southeast asia and south asia the report said that a top level design for the cmec s construction is already in place president xi and myanmar state counselor aung san suu kyi reached a consensus on building the cmec under the belt and road framework at the end of 2017 and in september 2018 the two sides signed the mou on building the cmec and established the cmec joint committee which held its first meeting in the same year and the second in 2019 indicating that a working mechanism for the cmec too has been established several institutional arrangements have been made for example the arrangements for the china myanmar border economic cooperation zone are basically in place with the central bank of myanmar approving the yuan as the official settlement currency which will facilitate investment in cmec projects the report added besides a number of major projects are progressing smoothly among them the upgrading of the domestic section of the china myanmar railway from kunming to dali has been completed and the new section from dali to ruili is under construction on the other side of the border work on the muse to mandalay section is on in full swing the first construction phase of the kyaukpyu deep sea port has begun and the new yangon city project is progressing well in addition the energy pipeline and substation expansion projects in yangon have been completed industrial links strengthened and cross border trade has gained momentum it is believed that on the conclusion of what appears to be a fruitful visit of president xi to myanmar the construction of the cmec will gather added pace the cmec is a huge project with a long development cycle requiring huge investments the united states and countries in europe especially the united kingdom and asia such as japan the republic of korea india and a number of asean member states have been investing in myanmar building the foundation for third party market cooperation the analysts opine that china and myanmar should actively invite such countries to join the cmec development platform help build the corridor and reap mutual benefits through fair cooperation

by jeff miller theeconomic calendaris one of the lightest we will see in 2020 and we have a holiday shortened week economic data will not be the main story the news will be filled with impeachment updates but that is not a focal point for investors for us there are 144 earnings reports from s p 500 stocks it will be a case of all eyes on earnings last week recap in my last installment of wtwa i asked whether it was yet time to worry about inflation it has been so tame that most do not see the risk i said that i was probably still early in this worry and so it was i also failed to reach much of my audience despite my rationale that understanding the fed helps your investing more than railing against the government s inflation numbers many remain unconvinced at least i tried personal note mrs oldprof asked me how this picture of my box of cords got in the wsj she believes that i could have done more weeding before our recent move i m not allowed to talk about her mystery stuff she doesn t know that i have three boxes like this i think might be more the story in one chart i always start my personal review of the week by looking at a great chart this week i am featuring jill mislinski s weekly update which combines several key features in an easy to read picture the market gained 2 0 for the week the trading range was 1 9 on an intra week basis you can monitor volatility implied volatility and historical comparisons in my weekly indicator snapshot in the quant corner below noteworthy statista shares the most read wikipedia articles of 2019 i m sure there is a lesson in this the news each week i break down events into good and bad for our purposes good has two components the news must be market friendly and better than expectations i avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news and you should too new deal democrat s high frequency indicators are an important part of our regular research this week the indications are positive in all three time frames ndd has been watching for signs that manufacturing weakness might have spread to consumers his conclusion is a bit more upbeat as of this week there is little sign that the weakness in the producer sector has spread out to affect consumers the conclusion that this remains a passing slowdown vs a recession remains most likely fans of technical analysis might compare this with the improvement in market health in the quant corner below ndd s conclusion has some support from bloomberg s read on consumers mortgage applications were very strong the start is even better than last year s excellent performance the good core cpi increased only 0 1 in december versus expectations of 0 2 as i explained in the last wtwa low core inflation allows the fed to remain on the sidelines there are better indicators of economic growth core ppi increased only 0 1 in december versus expectations of 0 2 retail sales for december increased 0 3 in line with expectations but november was revised from 0 2 to 0 3 the ex auto report showed a gain of 0 7 versus an expected 0 5 marketwatch initial jobless claims surprised by recording only 204k last week this beat expectations of 217k and the prior week s 214k the jolts report for november confirms the expansionary labor market the quits rate an indication of employee confidence was 2 3 the ratio of unemployed workers to job openings declined slightly but remained at historically low levels under 1 0 the beveridge curve remains stronger than at the start of the expansion in the 2000 s washington center for equitable growth the superficial treatments of this report just mention the number of job openings the real purpose in value is the insight into labor market structure calculated risk also pushes back on the common superficial interpretations so for the twenty first consecutive month there were more job openings than people unemployed also note that the number of job openings has exceeded the number of hires since january 2015 almost 5 years housing starts for december were 1608k saar far surpassing the expected 1380k and november s upwardly revised 1375k calculated risk provides the analysis and a possible explanation emphasis in the original these were blow out numbers this was the highest level for starts since december 2006 end of the bubble however the weather was very nice in december and the weather probably had a significant impact on the seasonally adjusted housing starts number the winter months of december and january have the largest seasonal factors so nice weather can really have an impact note that permits were more in line with expectations still solid single family starts were up 29 6 year over year and multi family starts were up 74 6 yoy nfib small business optimism for december registered 102 7 down from the prior 104 7 it remains in a historically high range david templeton horan notes that it is one of the highest readings in the 46 year history of the index there is also a decline in the number of respondents describing the cost of labor as the single most important problem diana olick notes that the optimism slipped slightly but is still high the bad the nahb housing market index for january was 75 while this was a slight beat of expectations it was lower than december s 76 bespoke highlights the positive industrial production in december declined 0 3 versus expectations of a 0 1 gain november was also revised lower from the reported 1 1 gain to 0 8 the ugly puerto rican rescue supplies sitting in a warehouse for years explanations are being offered and we do not yet know if this was mismanagement or corruption it is bad enough to suffer through these natural disasters but those cannot be controlled this could be cbs the week ahead we would all like to know the direction of the market in advance good luck with that second best is planning what to look for and how to react the calendar theeconomic calendaris light and the week is holiday shortened the big news will come from corporate earnings reports 88 companies in the s p 500 have reported so far and another 130 will do so this week briefing com has a good u s economic calendarfor the week here are the main u s releases next week s theme as always earnings season provides validation or refutation of economic data and market prices this week we have all eyes on earnings background like any complex story earnings reports present a great opportunity for pundits and for those on a mission everything can seem great in a report but a few cautious words in the conference call can change everything even if a company s report is spotless a subsequent decline is interpreted as the news that was already baked in it would be interesting if those who act so smart after the reports had to tell us what is baked in before the announcements what to watch investors who are willing to do some work can learn a lot during earnings season here are some ideas that can guide your research forward earnings lead actual earnings markets act on expectations of future outcomes not history dr ed yardeni has been tracking forward earnings for decades his site provides an impressive analysis of economic series and stock prices that are strongly correlated with forward earnings here is one important example stock prices and valuation forward p e is an excellent measure of valuation the valuation measures in the table below have mostly worked to keep investors out of the markets during the entire rally the last one ey spread is the earnings yield minus the lowest investment grade bond by this measure stocks are significantly undervalued watch sector results through the earnings season this provides more information about the economy and underlying investment trends this chart shows the long term history of various sectors versus the year by year results a great source for this is john butters at factset he regularly provides updates on overall results as well as the sector analysis i ll start showing the charts next week when there is more data look at revenue as well as earnings i am not as suspicious as those on my reliably bearish commentators twitter list but we all know that some companies manage their earnings looking at revenues and cash flow provides a good check on this possibility john butters also provides this important data watch changes in forward estimates since forward estimates are so helpful changes are an early warning system for many years brian gilmartin has been a leader on this subject in this post he explains some current revisions and a possible pattern in the first quarter of each year instead of trying to do some statistical analysis of a handful of data points he takes a closer look at each year here is his conclusion but read the full post to understand the method my own opinion on the general bearishness of analysts regarding forward prospects is that it s partly a hangover from 2008 the worst recession in the post ww ii era but also management s have little incentive to be aggressive which is the complete opposite of the late 1990s this may surprise those who believe that analysts are always too bullish since the bar is always low at the time of the report they had to turn pessimistic at some point brian s hypothesis explains why things often look weak at the start of a year and then firm up read the transcripts not so long ago anyone wanting to hear a company s conference call would need to learn the number and listen to the entire presentation if you want to feed your algorithm or trade on breaking news that is still necessary for many investor purposes it is enough to read the transcript after the fact seeking alpha s transcript team publishes thousands of earnings calls in a searchable form it is very practical to use for a wide variety of purposes one important advantage is that you will know what was actually said instead of some knee jerk market reaction to a phrase or two i ll have some additional observations in today s final thought quant corner and risk analysis i have a rule for my investment clients think first about your risk only then should you consider possible rewards i monitor many quantitative reports and highlight the best methods in this weekly update featuring the indicator snapshot both long term and short term technical indicators remain neutral but are now improving last week s trading was a tonic for nervous technical indicators the c score remains in a zone which suggests that we watch for confirming data like others we don t see much of that most sources have lowered recession odds and some have moved recession chances completely out of 2020 why has the c score fallen the potential for inflation so far so good on that front but it is important to keep the fed out of play while we start to enjoy reduced trade war effects the featured sources bob dieli business cycle analysis via the c score georg vrba business cycle indicator and market timing tools the most recent update of georg s business cycle index does not signal recession brian gilmartin all things earnings for the overall market as well as many individual companies doug short and jill mislinski regular updating of an array of indicators great charts and analysis guest sources this is an important chart from jpmorgan s excellent guide to the markets keep it handy for when someone tells you about the aging bull market insight for investors investors should understand and embrace volatility they should join my delight in a well documented list of worries as the worries are addressed or even resolved the investor who looks beyond the obvious can collect handsomely best of the week if i had to recommend a single must read article for this week it would be trent hamm s how to turn what you read into financial action ht abnormal returns we are all overwhelmed with ideas making it a challenge to implement those that are important this post may seem simple in principle and it is that does not make it less important the author raises three questions is there anything in this article that feels like it could actually improve my life in a way that i seriously want is the proposed change a realistic one for my life situation what single action could you take that would start you on the right path he provides a number of great examples including a frugal valentine s day that won t be on my list make it a point that when you find an article that describes something really powerful and meaningful to do you actually translate that into one single meaningful action do just one thing don t try to do it all that s overwhelming break it down to just one step do that one step then ask yourself tomorrow how you feel about it that s how real change begins it doesn t come from reading an article and forgetting about it it doesn t come from trying to change everything all at once it comes from that one meaningful action he challenges readers to take something from his article and do it it provides proof of concept i might offer the same challenge to wtwa readers since i have some very specific suggestions this week and as for my own challenge where is that box of old cords stock ideas lyn alden schwartzer s seeking alpha 2020 preview has been published it is packed with facts and important strategic ideas i recommend reading it carefully i am answering many of the same questions so it will be fun to compare chuck carnevale explains that value investing is a long term strategy and should be judged accordingly as always he illustrates his analysis with great examples readers will as usual get both a lesson and some stock ideas oil services schlumberger a dominant oil franchise says michael a gayed he mentions that earnings will be out next week read the full analysis carefully stone fox capital analyzes boaml s call of citigroup c as the pick of the decade it is a good analysis of an interesting call an insanely cheap stock while the whole money center bank sector remains exceptionally cheap kirk spano has another report from ces 2020 evs could dominate new car sales by 2030 his article includes several key themes including when to expect fully autonomous vehicles and which companies are poised to benefit this discussion of sales trends and cost of ownership is especially helpful pharma and biotech executives at the jpmorgan healthcare conference were not worried about the political rhetoric barron s when asked many pharmaceutical and biotech executives offer the same answer whatever happens our company s drugs are important enough that we ll get paid fairly for them the great rotation here is an update on the trade war impact on agricultural exports econofact read the full article for an explanation of the retaliatory tariffs and other indirect effects even the modest phase one program unwinds some of the negative effects and begins the process toward more emerging markets could be poised to outperform u s stocks for a very long time writes andrew addison his argument is technical illustrated by this chart high yield debt junk bonds this chart shows the yield to worst that means the soonest time the bond could be called away to your disadvantage you are getting stock like yields with a lot less upside watch out for excessively high reit yields blinded by the dividend paying light beware of washington prime s sucker yield writes brad thomas about what about a dividend yield of 26 74 well let me put it bluntly it s a sucker yield frankly there s no excuse for it there are times when a dividend paying company particularly a reit like washington prime is can offer a 7 yield in a safe manner there are times when a reit can offer an 8 or even 9 yield without breaking the bank but i can t think of a single example of a dividend paying company reit or otherwise that could sustain something over 20 for too long final thought some of the easy money in the market has been made the multiple of forward earnings at 18 8 is much more reasonable than last year s it can move even higher and often does with rates this low but it will require continued confidence in the economy that translates into confidence in earnings expectations i find backward looking earnings analysis far less valuable than forward earnings oftentimes those using past earnings do so only because they do not understand how to forecast sure it is important to normalize earnings growth to reflect the business cycle i do this in every stock i purchase using the excellent fast graphs tool what is the difference in my approach i do not use data from the nineteenth century or even most of the 20th century an adjustment should reflect the relevant factors not using all of the data merely because you have it i consider interest rates as part of the process i demand a much lower p e ratio when the yield from bonds is attractive the expected inflation rate is relevant for both these concepts are more widely accepted after a ten year rally but when i first started writing they were controversial many contended that the proper p e for stocks was fixed at about 16x trailing earnings using forward earnings was something that bullish analysts did people did not accept the fact that this was the investor s choice critics continue to disparage the concept of seeking the most rewarding investment by the term tina there is no alternative that is just a sassy way of saying what some of us pointed out a decade ago an idea for beating the markets is illustrated below in this mystery chart great rotation hint of the week if you have been following my weekly hints you are building a portfolio that will take advantage of the great rotation i have been quite frank about my method if you do similar homework you ll find some really attractive stocks this earnings season i am looking for companies that complain about effects of the trade war i do not care if the earnings were weak i want to know the reason a closer look will allow me to evaluate how much the phase one deal will help for my final advice this week i am tempted to say buy low and sell high i do not mean to be glib but that is the choice facing investors it will not be enough to play along with what worked last year i ll have more on this theme in my seeking alpha preview for 2020 soon to be released inflation remains a concern despite the recent reports rental charges are moving up and the labor market remains tight business investment if uncertainty was reduced businesses could act more decisively new equipment and plants would foster productivity and economic growth some other items on my radar and then we have the mystery chart the underlying etn is the

as the senate debates donald trump s future chief executives financiers and politicians will descend on davos in the swiss alps for their annual self congratulatory defense of global capitalism the events are not unrelated trump is charged with abusing his power capitalism s global elite is under assault for abusing its power as well fueling inequality fostering corruption and doing squat about climate change chief executives of the largest global corporations are raking in more money and at a larger multiple of their workers pay than at any time in history the world s leading financiers are pocketing even more the 26 richest people on earth now own as much as the 3 8 billion who form the poorer half of the planet s population concentrated wealth on this scale invites corruption across the world big money is buying off politicians to procure favors that further enlarge the wealth of those at the top while siphoning off resources from everyone else corruption makes it impossible to fight stagnant wages climate change or any other problem facing the vast majority of the world s population that would require some sacrifice by the rich popular anger is boiling over against elites seen as irredeemably greedy corrupt and indifferent popular anger is boiling over against elites seen as irredeemably greedy corrupt and indifferent to the plight of most people struggling to get by the anger has fueled uprisings in chile spain ecuador lebanon egypt and bolivia environmental protests in the uk germany austria france and new zealand and xenophobic politics in the us the uk brazil and hungary trump s support comes largely from america s working class whose wages haven t risen in decades whose jobs are less secure than ever and whose political voice has been drowned out by big money although trump has given corporations and wall street everything they ve wanted and nothing has trickled down to his supporters he has convinced those supporters he s on their side by channeling their rage on to foreigners immigrants minorities and deep state bureaucrats it seems strangely appropriate therefore that the theme of this year s davos conclave is stakeholder capitalism the idea that corporations have a responsibility to their workers communities and the environment as well as to their shareholders expect endless speeches touting the long term benefits of stakeholder capitalism to corporate bottom lines happy workers are more productive a growing middle class can buy more goods and services climate change is beginning to cost a bundle in terms of environmental calamities and insurance so it must be stopped all true but the assembled ceos know they ll get richer far quicker if they boost equity values in the short term by buying back their shares of stock suppressing wages fighting unions resisting environmental regulations and buying off politicians for tax cuts and subsidies this has been their strategy for three decades and it s about to get worse three researchers daniel greenwald at mit s sloan school martin lettau at berkeley and sydney ludvigson at nyu found that between 1952 and 1988 economic growth accounted for 92 of the rise in equity values but since 1989 most of the increase has come from reallocated rents to shareholders and away from labor compensation in other words from workers what this means is that in order for the stock market to do as well in coming years either economic growth has to accelerate markedly highly unlikely or chief executives will have to siphon off even more of the gains from growth from workers and other stakeholders to their shareholders this is likely to require even more downward pressure on wages more payoffs to politicians for tax cuts and subsidies and further rollbacks of environmental regulations all of which will worsen the prevailing discontent there will be no mention at davos of any of this nor of the increasing political and economic power of these elites and the diminishing power of average workers and citizens around the world nothing will be achieved in the swiss alps because the growing global discontent has yet to affect the bottom lines of the corporations and financial institutions whose leaders are assembling to congratulate themselves on their wealth influence and benevolence trump meanwhile is likely to be acquitted by senate republicans who are so cowardly and unprincipled that they will ignore his flagrantly unconstitutional acts trump plans to speak at davos by the way an impeached president addressing world economic leaders while being tried in the senate he ll probably boast about the stock market bully and lie as usual one thing he won t say is that the whatever it takes abuses of economic and political power such as he and much of his audience are engaged in threaten to destroy capitalism democracy and the planet
michael fabricant was a successful businessman before becoming conservative mp in 1992 for lichfield in staffordshire he has never struggled to make ends meet and reveals he once turned down a six figure sum to take part in a reality tv programme how did you feel about december s election result it was a thrill to be re elected but not half as much a thrill as when i heard the exit poll at 10 o clock i was with my team in lichfield out for an indian curry and we all felt a huge amount of joy it was marvellous spender michael fabricant bought an 125 bottle of whisky what did your parents teach you about money not to waste it my mother was cautious with money and often said to me look after the pennies and the pounds will look after themselves my parents were middle class not wealthy we weren t rolling in money but comfortable my mother was a housewife and my father was a rabbi he was a wise academic person but he didn t think about money matters too much my mother who was welsh was more practical she was in charge of the family budget she tried to teach me to be a saver but i think i am more of a spender i think life is for living what was the first paid work you ever did during my gap year before going to university i got a job teaching 11 to 13 year olds physics and chemistry at a local high school i know i was paid 12 but i can t remember whether that was per week or per month it was not easy teaching children who were only a few years younger than me i was 18 i enjoyed it though i was given some brilliant advice there that i use today when i speak in the house of commons that is if you want to capture people s attention what you say should be 80 per cent entertainment and 20 per cent facts and figures i find that a useful maxim for my speeches as an mp have you ever struggled to make ends meet no i have had a few sleepless nights about a company i used to run that designed and built radio stations each year we would win a small number of large contracts but because we had high overheads money could be tight between contracts if the gaps were too wide there were times i worried about whether we would have enough cash in the business to pay the wages of our staff but that is the joy and worry of being in business it would be a distortion of the truth to say i have personally struggled to make ends meet have you ever been paid silly money no i have been offered silly money a substantial six figure sum by itv to do a certain tv programme which so far i have refused to do i am not allowed to say which one i turned the opportunity down because i didn t have time to do it each time i declined they kept offering me more money what was the best year of your financial life it was 1987 my business won some big overseas radio contracts as well as with the bbc the business made millions of pounds that year a seven or eight figure sum i don t want to reveal how much i personally made that year but in cash terms it was a lot more than i am paid now as an mp even all these years later what is the most expensive thing you bought for fun it was an amazing bottle of octomore whisky it cost me 125 expensive yes but i think it was good value buying it was the wildest thing i ve done i have mainly given it to colleagues to drink i don t drink much spirits myself that s why i am slim and not fat like most mps but don t quote me on that

markets ended last week on a positive note with equities making new highs and bond yields nudging higher the gbp was the worst performing currency as markets scaled up boe easing expectations after a dire retail sales report a stronger usd on friday helped push the nzd down to 0 6615 the next 24 hours should be very quiet with wellington anniversary day taking place and the us closed for martin luther king day tonight it s been a very good start to the year for risk assets the s p500 added another 0 4 on friday bringing its year to date return to 3 3 while the eurostoxx 600 increased 1 leaving it 2 1 higher so far this year both indices are at record highs us and european investment grade corporate credit spreads also tightened last week leaving them at their lowest levels since the start of 2018 and near post gfc lows high yield credit spreads are also near post gfc lows reflecting both a benign economic outlook and an intense search for yield with investors looking for alternatives to low government bond yields market sentiment was supported by a batch of strong chinese activity data on friday industrial production was well above expectations at 6 9 y y against 5 9 y y consensus and 6 2 previously while retail sales and fixed asset investment were also stronger than expected chinese gdp increased 6 y y in q4 in line with expectations recent data confirm chinese growth stabilised in the latter part of 2019 with momentum appearing to pick up towards the end of the year as past easing measures by the chinese authorities gain traction looking ahead the recently agreed phase one trade deal between the us and china should help reduce downside risks to the chinese and global economies on friday the cny closed at its strongest level since early july usd cny below 6 86 us housing data also continued its strong run with housing starts beating expectations significantly on friday night a 30 jump in the volatile multi family i e apartment category to a 33 year high accounted for a large part of the surprise but single family starts were still strong too up 11 the backdrop for the us housing market remains positive given the ultra tight labour market sharp decline in us mortgage rates last year and shortage of inventory following years of underbuilding in the aftermath of the housing market crash the university of michigan consumer confidence index remained near its cycle highs suggestive of a still strong us consumer the us yield curve steepened after the us treasury announced that it would reintroduce issuance of 20 year bonds in the first half of the year the front end of the us curve was unchanged while the 10 year yield rose 2bps to 1 82 and existing bonds in the 20 year sector rose 4bps the treasury s decision comes against a backdrop of a large and growing us budget deficit which is expected to exceed 1 trillion this fiscal year the treasury decided against introducing ultra long bonds which should quell speculation about the potential for new 50 or 100 year bonds trump on friday nominated judy shelton and christopher shelton to fill two vacant seats on the federal reserve board waller is research direction at the st louis fed which is headed up by the very dovish james bullard shelton has advised trump on economic policy she railed against low interest rates after the gfc and has previously advocated a return to the gold standard but seems to have had a change of heart since trump took the presidency and now favours lower rates the senate will need to confirm both nominees with shelton likely to be much more contentious trump will get to nominate the next fed chair next year if he is re elected and hasn t been shy about his wish for a more dovish fed a dire uk retail sales report on friday added to expectations the boe would cut rates at its meeting later this month and weighed on the gbp uk retail sales fell 0 8 in december against expectations for a 0 8 rise and fell 1 in q4 as whole the market bumped up its probability of a rate cut later this month to 70 and it now prices a cumulative 1 3 rate cuts by year end the market expects that the dreadful run of recent uk data including the big downside surprise to cpi earlier in the week will persuade more mpc members to join saunders and haskel who voted for a rate cut at the last meeting uk pmi data due on friday could yet be influential to the decision as it will be the first clean reading since the election last month the gbp was the worst performing currency on friday falling 0 5 to just above 1 30 the weakness in the gbp spilled over into eur which was down 0 4 to near its lowest levels of the year the bloomberg dollar index was up 0 2 on friday against a stronger usd backdrop the nzd drifted lower through most of the friday night session ending the week around 0 6615 0 35 the strengthening in the cny again had little flow through to the nzd and the close relationship between the two currencies may be starting to wane now the us china trade war has become less of a market driver the nz pmi released on friday was a disappointment with the index slipping back below the 50 mark indicating that the manufacturing sector was again in contraction new orders fell back to 51 well below its long term average while employment was around 50 the pmi data was shrugged off by the rates market with swap rates lifting by 1 to 3bps in a curve steepening move on friday the services equivalent of the pmi the psi is released on tuesday but the key release this week is cpi which comes out on friday we expect headline cpi to increase 0 4 in q4 1 8 y y although with upside risks the anz monthly inflation gauge suggests that non tradables inflation could be 0 2 stronger than we pick the rbnz forecasted a 0 2 rise in headline cpi for q4 1 6 y y it will be very quiet over the next 24 hours with today being wellington anniversary day and the us market closed tonight for martin luther king day but there is plenty to focus on over the remainder of the week the australian employment report is on thuesday and our nab colleagues look for the unemployment rate to tick up to 5 3 consensus is 5 2 us corporate earnings season continues with netflix the first of the big tech names to report on tuesday and pmi data released on friday will give a fresh read on the growth pulse in europe and

would have enough cash in the business to pay the wages of our staff but that is the joy and worry of being in business it would be a distortion of the truth to say i have personally struggled to make ends meet have you ever been paid silly money no i have been offered silly money a substantial six figure sum by itv to do a certain tv programme which so far i have refused to do i am not allowed to say which one i turned the opportunity down because i didn t have time to do it each time i declined they kept offering me more money what was the best year of your financial life it was 1987 my

president donald trump s trade deal with china last week opened up export opportunities for american farmers manufacturers and energy producers and his trade pact with canada and mexico approved thursday by the senate could help restore some auto production in the united states yet perhaps more than anything last week s twin breakthroughs on trade provided a breather from two chaotic years of trumpian policymaking involving threats truces and heavy u s tariffs imposed on friend and foe alike on a scale unseen since the 1930s the uncertainty had been clouding the economy causing businesses to delay investments until they knew how the trade turmoil would shake out we got trade peace said mary lovely an economist who studies trade at syracuse university at least for now trump trade deals trump to promote china mexico canada trade deals at the american farm bureau federation convention what trade deal means to you americans won t get a total reprieve after china trade deal as effects of lost factory jobs pricier goods linger but lovely and other critics warn that the deal with china leaves unresolved most of the toughest and most complicated issues dividing the world s two biggest economies and that progress could unravel over time they also caution that the new north american trade pact though it might spur some job growth will likely make american built cars more expensive and less competitive globally whatever the outcome the president s approach to trade marks a clear break with seven decades of u s policy that had favored ever freer world commerce rather than seek to tear down trade barriers and pursue rules designed to benefit all countries the administration unabashedly embraced an america first agenda armed with tariffs threats and combative rhetoric it sought to force concessions out of china mexico and canada previous presidents would have said it s about win win it s about trade liberalization it s about global growth said william reinsch a former u s trade official now at the center for strategic and international studies trump would say no it s not it s about what s good for america this is essentially might makes right we re big and important so we can push other countries around free trade has long been a mutually accepted priority for the world s major industrialized economies many trade experts say they worry that in the long run trump s relentlessly confrontational stance and eager embrace of tariffs could pose risks to both the u s and global economies president donald trump speaks before signing a trade agreement with chinese vice premier liu he in the east room of the white house jan 15 2020 in washington and even as tensions ease at least temporarily with china the trump administration is readying tariffs on the european union over subsidies to the aviation giant airbus and on france over a digital services tax that targets u s tech giants like google and amazon here is a closer look at trump s recent record on trade revamping north american trade senators voted 89 10 thursday to approve trump s u s mexico canada agreement a month after the house had passed it 385 41 the so called usmca replaces the north american free trade agreement which had eliminated most trade barriers among the united states canada and mexico nafta which took effect in 1994 triggered a surge in trade among the three countries and it created a regional manufacturing bloc to compete with east asia and europe but trump and other critics argued that nafta cost the united states jobs by encouraging factories to move south to capitalize on low wage mexican laborers who were largely prevented from forming independent unions trump s top trade negotiator robert lighthizer crafted a replacement trade agreement that is intended most of all to return some factory production to the united states to qualify for usmca s duty free benefits automakers must derive 75 of their production content from within north america up from 62 5 under nafta that means more auto content would have to be homegrown in higher wage north america not imported more cheaply from china and elsewhere at least 40 of vehicles would also have to originate in places where workers earn at least 16 an hour that would benefit the united states or canada not mexico where auto assembly workers are paid a fraction of that amount after sealing a deal with canada and mexico lighthizer had to negotiate with democrats who had taken control of the house in the 2018 midterm elections he ended up drawing overwhelming bipartisan support by agreeing to democratic demands these included calls to strengthen language meant to ensure that mexico adopts labor reforms that will encourage unions but usmca could produce negative side effects the new content requirements will raise production costs resulting in higher auto prices reduced u s demand lower auto exports and more rapid substitution of machines for workers syracuse s lovely and jeffrey schott of the peterson institute for international economics concluded in a report last month a cease fire with c after 18 months of trade combat the united states and china agreed to an interim truce wednesday under the so called phase 1 deal trump scrapped his plan to impose tariffs on 160 billion in chinese imports and he halved his import taxes on an additional 110 billion worth the administration still maintains tariffs on 360 billion in chinese products and beijing has imposed retaliatory tariffs on u s exports in return china agreed to do more to protect intellectual property and to curb its practice of forcing foreign companies to hand over trade secrets as the price of admission to the chinese market but the centerpiece of the deal was china s vow to buy an extra 200 billion worth of u s manufacturing energy and farm exports this year and next the mandated purchases are unusual for modern trade agreements trade pacts now usually set the rules for commerce but let customer demand sort out who buys how much of what trump s deal is not about competing on price and quality anymore lovely said we re using our market power to force purchases critics wonder whether china is really capable of meeting the targets under the deal for instance china is supposed to buy 40 billion in u s agricultural products a year a wildly ambitious goal considering that it s never bought more than 26 billion a year and that during the trade war it has redirected some of its farm purchases to other exporting countries and things could get nasty if the united states decides china isn t living up to its commitments in an unusual move the two countries did not arrange to let any disputes go to a neutral arbitrator instead they will try to work out their differences in a series of consultations if they can t the united states could impose tariffs and the deal could unravel perhaps most significantly the phase 1 deal did nothing about the u s key complaint that china uses illicit trade practices in its drive to surpass the united states in such advanced technologies as robotics and quantum computing specifically it didn t address beijing s massive subsidies for its own tech companies those issues are expected to be taken up in future talks talks that aren t likely to go anywhere until after november s u s election this article originally appeared on usa today

here s our summary of key economic events over the weekend that affect new zealand with news of major releases of data from china and the us first up china recorded its fewest births in 58 years in 2019 with them down to 14 7 mln and lower by 580 000 than in the previous year according to official data their population has just nudged 1 4 bln people a rise of just 0 3 in 2019 their working aged population is 64 of the total and that is very similar to the new zealand makeup china also reported that its economy grew 6 1 in 2019 ending the year with q4 growth slightly lower at 6 0 which was the same expansion at q3 a slew of other december data was released at the same time showing industrial production was up at the rate of 6 9 in december and that was the second highest month in 2019 in contrast coal and oil production hardly rose at all but electricity generation was up 3 5 many see this electricity growth data as a better reflection of actual economic activity fixed asset investment another key economic marker rose 5 4 in december retail sales were up 8 0 in december compared with the same month in 2018 fast economic growth and no population growth will mean china is making quick gains in per capita income levels and while the percentage growth gains may be slowing the absolute gains are holding and china reduced its one year prime lending rate by 10 bps to 4 05 over the weekend it reduced its five year prime rate to 4 70 both were 5 bps lower than the market was expecting it might be reducing lending rates but it definitely not allowing any movement on term deposit rates which are stuck at 1 50 for one year and 2 75 for three years as they have been since 2015 balancing the generally positive chinese data however have been generally weaker american announcements updated data from the us shows that china is letting its investment in us treasury bonds atrophy for each of the past six months japan has been the largest holder and the chinese holding has fallen by us 32 bln or 2 9 at this rate chinese holdings will fall below us 1 tln some time next year housing starts in the us took off in december up 40 from the same month a year ago which admittedly was unusually weak but it may be a short lived boost building permits for residential construction are starting to tail off from recent rises although they are still 6 higher than a year ago american industrial production wasn t so flash however coming in a full 1 lower in december 2019 than december 2018 there are many sectors with large declines and without gains in it and especially defense spending their manufacturing sector would have been in a crisis situation job openings are shrinking and actually shrinking fast they fell more than 7 in november from october and are down 11 in a year despite that consumer sentiment remained virtually unchanged in early january differing by just 0 2 index points from december on friday we reported that the atlanta fed s gdpnow calculation has economic growth shrinking to just 1 8 pa for q4 2019 a fast retreat today we can reveal that similar tracking by the ny fed has it even lower at 1 2 pa one of the most interesting data comparisons is between the real dollar gdp growth between china and the usa based on the official data released by each country the american annual rise in 2019 was us 388 bln a remarkable 32 less than the us 569 bln rise in 2018 that compares with the real dollar rise for china in 2019 which was almost exactly the same level in 2019 as in 2018 or a bit over us 800 bln in each of the past two years history will record that the tariff wars hurt the americans much more than the chinese washington is blind to this failure as much as beijing is blind to the unsustainability of their current policy direction but at the moment china is definitely winning a bigger expansion of their economy than the americans the australian bush fire news is seriously undermining their tourism industry an internal survey conducted among its 850 members of the country s peak export tourism body showed that 70 of them were seeing a lot of cancellations from their big key markets america britain and china they estimate the cost is nz 5 bln already and things are likely to worsen from here the ust 10yr yield is exactly where it was at this time last week at just under 1 83 their 2 10 curve has moved little now at 26 bps their 1 5 curve is flatter at just 6 bps and their 3m 10yr curve is also little changed at 29 bps the aussie govt 10yr is at 1 18 and very similar to where it was a week ago the china govt 10yr is marginally lower at 3 13 and the nz govt 10 yr is up 6 bps for the week at 1 55 gold is now at us 1 557 oz and almost exactly the same level as a week ago us oil prices are also little changed now just on us 58 50 bbl and the brent benchmark is just over us 64 50 bbl the kiwi dollar is now at 66 1 usc and a broadly similar level to this time last week on the cross rates we are at 96 1 auc against the euro we are at 59 6 euro cents that puts our twi 5 at 71 4 and almost the same level it was this time last week bitcoin is down 3 from where we left it on saturday to us 8 624 although it is up 6 from this time last week and up almost 20 since the start of the year the bitcoin rate is charted in the exchange rate set below and here are the 2015 and 2017 maps for easy

the newest reading on consumer sentiment from the university of michigan s surveys of consumers shows that americans are feeling pretty upbeat these days two new metrics on consumer holiday season spending published this week found that consumer spending held up through the all important holiday season the national retail federation said that retail sales in november and december excluding restaurants gasoline and cars totaled just over 730 billion a year over year increase of 4 1 percent the commerce department said retail sales rose by 0 3 percent in december when cars and gasoline two volatile components were excluded retail sales grew by 0 5 percent for the month these figures were buoyed by steady consumer sentiment which remained roughly flat in december the baseline sentiment index ticked down a tiny bit from 99 3 to 99 1 and the outlook of current conditions rose by 0 3 points although the index of consumer expectations slipped by 0 7 points this still represents a year over year increase of 10 5 all three metrics consumer sentiment current economic conditions and consumer expectations have risen year over year reflecting a recovery from worries about the federal reserve and the government shutdown that started 2019 consumers will continue to sustain the expansion due to their favorable judgements about their current and prospective financial situation surveys of consumers chief economist richard curtin wrote in the accompanying analysis consumer spending is the pillar on which the economic expansion rests said greg mcbride chief financial analyst at bankrate com there are a few good reasons for this optimism he added we ve got unemployment at a 50 year low growth in household income and growth in real spending power for most households the sharp downturn in growth apparently promised by the weakening of business surveys from the spring through the early fall has not materialized ian shepherdson chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics wrote in a client note pantheon revised its 2020 gdp average quarterly growth forecasts upward from 1 5 percent to 2 percent as a result shepherdson added mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics said the meteoric rise in the stock market also contributes a potent wealth effect that can stimulate spending the wealth effect the rising stock market should be adding about half a point of gdp growth in 2019 and are on track to do about the same in 2020 he said that supports consumer confidence that helps in terms of cash stockholders can realize those gains it makes it easier for them to borrow zandi said the increase in borrowing rates also is helped along by a combination of low interest rates and economic optimism a forecast from credit bureau transunion predicted that americans will take on more debt this year including mortgages credit cars car and personal loans some households are in fact relying on debt to meet necessities but that s not the base case the majority of it is optimism with regard to employability income and the ability to repay that debt mcbride said according to a new bankrate survey 84 percent of people expect their finances to either improve or stay the same in 2020 only 1 in 6 americans expect their financial situation to get worse this year that ties back to that willingness to spend and comfort with taking on debt in moderation mcbride said 68 percent of economic output comes from consumer spending as long as that virtuous cycle retains intact we can keep recession at bay some market observers though argued that comparative sales should have been even higher given the economic fundamentals at play it s really an easier year over year comparison said camilla yanushevsky equity analyst at cfra research the partial government shutdown that stretched on for weeks worry about rising interest rate and waning tax cut stimulus all combined to put a damper on consumer activity towards the end of 2018 yanushevsky said nrf data found that holiday spending in 2018 grew at a rate of just over 2 percent i m surprised sales weren t stronger zandi said last december was a disaster i expected christmas sales because of the easy comparison to be closer to 5 percent many suspect trade could be putting a drag on recent results shepherdson flagged tariffs as a risk factor to continued economic growth both the direct effects of the tariffs a tax on consumers and businesses and the accompanying uncertainty will continue to constrain economic growth indefinitely he said yanushevsky pointed out that in spite of this week s china trade deal the majority of tariffs remain in place which constrains the rate of expansion we think that s going to stifle economic growth she said predicting that the impact to consumers

according to the now publicised text the deal is a more or less one sided agreement targeting china over the next two years china will need to increase imports from the united states by us 200 billion china also needs to take steps to further open its markets strengthen intellectual property rights protection get rid of forced technological transfers and increase the transparency of its exchange rate policy in return the united states will cut half the tariffs it imposed in 2019 while keeping the 2018 tariffs intact this is sufficient for president trump to claim victory in the trade war equivalent to 1 per cent of us gdp the us 200 billion increase in exports to china will certainly boost his chances of re election despite its one sided nature the phase one agreement is not all bad for china for one thing china has geared up on policy reform it has adopted a new law for liberalising foreign direct investment banning forced technological transfers and allowing wholly foreign owned financial institutions to operate in the country and the us 200 billion increase in purchases is not necessarily bad for china purchasing more us goods will deepen economic ties between the two countries us voices calling for decoupling with china are growing louder but the new purchases will strengthen integration in two ways one obvious way is through the purchases themselves if the target is reached china s imports from the united states will almost double and if china s exports to the united states stay the same the us trade deficit with china will be eliminated the second way lies in how the purchase agreement is going to be fulfilled while china can find ways to increase its imports from the united states including diverting some imports from other countries there is a question about how the united states can increase its supply of us 200 billion exports in such a short period of time the us economy is now in full employment except in agriculture there is not much slack in the economy one possible remedy is to allow chinese companies to invest in the united states production capacity for example liquefied natural gas lng could contribute a large share to new exports but there are insufficient lng pipelines and port terminals in the united states if chinese companies are allowed to invest in those facilities us lng exports to china will be expedited as a result the two countries will be even more deeply integrated importing more us products is also good for the welfare of chinese people high tariffs have created a large wedge between consumer prices in china and those in the united states in addition to fulfill china s commitment to cutting carbon emissions and also to increase people s living standards china has to cut the share of coal in its energy mix and increase clean energy sources including natural gas importing more gas from the united states will help fulfil that goal the conclusion of the phase one agreement shows that the united states has not given up on china despite some hysteric panic about china mainstream us politics still favours maintaining normal if not deeper economic relations with china after two years of strife the two countries now enter a new phase of rapprochement last october 37 scholars from china the united states and other countries signed a joint statement calling for a pragmatic approach to settle the us china trade dispute the starting point was that both countries should leave room for each other to conduct domestic policy to address domestic concerns as well as respond to the external spillovers of each other s domestic policies beggar thy neighbour policies should be corrected and domestic policies with spillover effects should be negotiated if negotiation fails the negatively affected party can use domestic policy to safeguard its interests dividing the negotiations into phases is consistent with this idea the first phase dealt with issues concerning cross border trade and investment the second phase will deal with structural issues particularly subsidies and state owned enterprises in china and restrictions on technological transfers in the united states the world trade organization wto also needs reform to accommodate the shocks caused by china s rise the two countries should treat this phase as an opportunity to shape rules that the wto can use as templates for reform china in particular has to change its mindset and realise that it is no longer a newcomer tolerated by the international community as it exploits its own interests it is now time for china to take responsibility as one of the rule makers and help set rules for a post globalisation world yao yang is dean of the national school of development and director of the china center for economic research peking university

the fed is still treating the economy as if it s fragile is this good news for investors the federal reserve seems to be doing everything it can to stay out of the way of the stock market although the bulls have been on a rampage for the past 10 years creating and re creating new highs in every thinkable index the specter of the hibernating bear looms large no one wants to be the jerk who wakes it at the close of 2019 fed chairman jerome powell said he was waiting for consistent inflation above the central bank s target before he will consider hiking interest rates the federal open market committee predicted that the u s will experience 2 growth in gdp a 1 9 core personal consumption expenditure pce index for inflation and 3 5 unemployment in 2020 these are certainly not recessionary numbers however minutes from the jan 4 federal reserve meeting tell us that the fed still thinks the economy is walking on eggshells fed officials also expressed that their concern over u s inflation came mostly from economic weakness abroad add in u s china trade tensions and u s iran political tensions and you probably have a formula for a consistent and conservative monetary policy in 2020 in short the fed isn t going to take responsibility for the coming market correction when is the correction arriving whether you believe the bubble is in bonds or housing something s got to give at least that is the sentiment that will eventually boil over and actually cause the correction when is it coming who knows how big will it be see previous answer corporate debt is increasing while manufacturing is contracting but this doesn t seem to translate into people s day to day lifestyles fannie mae predicted that single family housing starts in 2020 will accelerate to an impressive 10 this year with 1 million new homes to be built in 2021 to compare single family housing starts increased only 1 in 2019 fannie mae s economic and strategic research group attributes these gains to high consumer spending and a strong labor market the fed s and fannie mae s thinking on the economy seem to line up but fannie mae s stats are built on a robust trustworthy economy not the brittle one that the fed describes smart money is still moving into speculative investments but safe havens did have a slight uptick after the killing of iranian general qassim suleimani moving forward in 2020 the trade war between the u s and china seems to be coming to an end china recently agreed to expand its purchases of farm goods and other american exports in return the u s agreed to remove around 156 billion worth of new tariffs on chinese goods and halve tariffs on another 120 billion it remains to be seen if the unrest in the persian gulf and between the u s and iran in particular will create lasting conflict and unsettle the markets polls show that the american public does not want conflict with iran which may or may not matter in today s world of bush doctrine executive privilege with all of the uncertainty surrounding the markets perhaps the fed is right to keep its hands off any possible powder kegs investors would be wise to pay attention to the fed s two favorite inflation indicators the consumer price index cpi and the personal consumption expenditure deflator the fed actually puts a bit more weight on the pce according to its meeting notes if the pce consistently stays at 2 the fed may make a move to hike interest rates the current report from the bureau of economic analysis lists it at 1 5
from yemen all the way to lebanon and syria failed economic policies are costing people their hard earned money and many are starting to see their savings shrink by the day in sanaa banknotes have become an unexpected battleground where the iran backed houthi rebels try to impose their illegal rule and play out their differences against the government at the expense of ordinary yemenis when yemen s capital was seized by the houthis in 2014 the central bank was split in two a houthi controlled branch in sanaa and another in government controlled aden which has access to printers in the areas under their control the houthis have outlawed the use of new banknotes which are printed by the central bank in aden the houthi ban is supposed to control inflation but in reality it has created two competing currencies in one country and left yemenis caught in the crossfire in the past month people living in houthis areas have had to queue for hours to exchange new banknotes for worn out bills at extortionate rates those living in the south have found themselves flooded with new banknotes that they can no longer use for basic necessities such as food and medicine yemen needs one united central bank that is neutral and non affiliated its purpose should be to serve the nation s economy not to become a weapon of war endless queues have become a common sight at yemen s currency exchange offices but also at lebanese banks the collapse of lebanon s banking sector has affected not one but two countries for the past thirty years beirut has been run by an incompetent elite that has depleted its public funds and turned lebanon into the world s third most heavily indebted country in the past months former prime minister saad hariri failed to secure another aid package from traditional donors to save the economy and the us imposed tougher sanctions to limit the reach of hezbollah a shortage of american dollars to which the lebanese pound is pegged ensued in november as a result the lebanese pound has lost half of its value on the black market the situation has snowballed into lebanon s most severe economic and financial crisis in three decades banks have started to impose informal capital controls limiting the amount of foreign currency withdrawal to a couple hundred dollars per week and forbidding people from transferring money abroad millions of people with school tuition to pay loans to reimburse and families to feed now have only limited access to their own money many have also seen the value of their salaries halve and their living conditions deteriorate in the meantime the lebanese have risen up against their government demanding competent committed and non sectarian leadership in the past week protesters have gone as far as to attack and burn the very banks where they keep their money in a desperate attempt to get politicians who have been wrangling over the formation of a new government for three months to finally act and the collapse of lebanon s banking sector has affected not one but two countries on the other side of the border the syrian pound which fared at 50 to the dollar in 2011 plummeted to 487 to the dollar after the war since the onset of lebanon s financial crisis its has lost more than half of its value on the black market reaching 1 200 pounds to the dollar syria has been under economic sanctions for years and lebanon s banking sector was its only means to access the global economy syrians have faced more than their fair share of hardships in the past nine years yet instead of working on improving the lives of his people syria s president bashar al assad issued a decree increasing the penalty for those dealing in foreign currencies to seven years of hard labour decades of war corruption and financial mismanagement have weighed on the economies of syria lebanon and yemen the origin of the problem may differ for each country but the end result is always the same vulnerable citizens must not be made to pay the price of their leaders failed economic policies while a select few benefit from the status quo

cgtn updated 2020 01 19 11 17 editor s note ji xianbai is a research fellow with the international political economy program of s rajaratnam school of international studies nanyang technological university singapore the article reflects the author s opinions and not necessarily the views of cgtn chinese president xi jinping just completed his state visit to myanmar on january 17 and 18 this rare single country overseas trip by the top chinese leader was a concrete testimony to the long standing paukphaw friendship injected with renewed vitality while president xi s visit was meant to commemorate the 70th anniversary of diplomatic relations between china and myanmar the deep running sino myanmar socio economic ties have a long ancestry that stretches over millennia myanmar was located at the crossroads of the ancient southwestern silk road and the tea horse road opened back in the han dynasty myanmar served not only as the commercial hub where chinese burmese indian and javanese merchants mingled and traded but also an interchange of religion buddhism in particular between east asia and south asia since 2013 china has been actively reviving these historic silk roads and physical linkages that once knitted peoples and civilizations in the vast afro eurasia supercontinent together through their modern day incarnations collectively labeled as the belt and road initiative bri myanmar plays a very critical role within the scope of the bri the planned bangladesh china india myanmar economic corridor carving out a path of connective infrastructure from kunming to kolkata crosses myanmar s mandalay the china myanmar economic corridor cmec provides for greater intra myanmar transport connectivity while facilitating economic integration between myanmar and china s inland province of yunnan and the kyaukphyu seaport on the bay of bengal is an integral part of the 21st century maritime silk road the maritime component of the bri for expanding and upgrading global shipping capacity myanmar has proved a firm supporter of the bri corridors and projects state counselor aung san suu kyi attended both bri summits in 2017 and 2019 and during president xi s latest visit to myanmar the two countries reaffirmed their unwavering commitment to pushing forward win win belt and road cooperation for mutual benefits and common prosperity despite some short term project setbacks and policy recalibrations some 33 agreements were signed at the tail of president xi s visit they aimed at speeding up the development of the kyaukpyu special economic zone in myanmar s rakhine state the china myanmar border economic cooperation zone along the kunlong chinshwehaw border area the new yangon city applying state of art smart city technologies and sustainable urban design concepts and comprehensive road rail and energy transboundary interconnectivity the leaders also designated the year 2020 as the china myanmar year of culture and tourism to further advance people to people exchanges and mutual cultural understanding some western commentators skeptical of booming china myanmar bonds were quick to assert that china is cultivating economic and strategic dependence on the part of myanmar by stealth through the bri perhaps they should be reminded of the context in which china emerged as myanmar s most trusted economic partner between the late 1980s to 2016 washington placed harsh restrictions on trade investment finance tourism education technology transfer and development assistance vis à vis myanmar on human rights and democracy grounds leaving the impoverished country in complete economic and diplomatic isolation from the west within the region itself myanmar failed to identify robust economic growth drivers with the exception of the greater mekong subregion program many long standing development initiatives spearheaded by the asian development bank e g indonesia malaysia thailand growth triangle and the brunei indonesia malaysia philippines growth area focused primarily on maritime southeast asia and not continental and least developed nations like myanmar japan s engagement though helpful and generous was largely confined to the realms of financial sector reforms and institution building this goes without saying that intra asean trade and investment remained too weak to propel myanmar s economic take off china by contrast embraced myanmar out of pragmatism china did not pretend as the west did that it was within its gift to dictate the development path of myanmar but nevertheless recognized myanmar s legitimate quest for economic advancement and social progress china accordingly offered over the past decades development aid humanitarian assistance trade preference and direct investment to myanmar so that the latter can grow itself out of the economic quagmires resulted from isolation with the launch of the bri and the cmec china now has a greater stake in the economic success of myanmar than ever before president xi s visit to myanmar was therefore extremely timely and of far reaching significance as china steps up its economic engagement and myanmar picks up growth momentum under the bri the time honored paukphaw friendship will only get more resilience and renewed for the better indeed as aung san suu kyi puts it china and myanmar will stand together till the end of the world
gillette wyo from behind the counter of his brother s auto parts store bubba miller looks out at the 2020 presidential race and worries about what will happen to his hometown if a democrat wins not just a democrat but based on the current frontrunners a liberal democrat or a progressive or an avowed socialist i wish we could build a wall around wyoming he says with a laugh i think there s just something wrong in their heads to think you can get everything for free shifting the wad of tobacco tucked in his lip miller 24 lays out the case for reelecting president donald trump from this coal town s booming economy to the president s protection of gun rights to his tough border policies to his efforts to reduce the size of the federal government as far as miller is concerned trump can do no wrong he s not alone in 2016 then candidate trump won 86 of the vote here as he swept every wyoming county but one the wealthy liberal enclave of teton county home to jackson hole only once since 1952 has the state voted for a democratic presidential candidate and in 2016 trump beat hillary clinton here by the widest margin of any state and ahead of the november presidential election none of the 2020 democratic candidates are making any inroads with these most conservative of voters i ve very concerned about the direction of the democratic party says robin clover a 20 year wyoming resident and registered republican who has voted for democrats at the local level they re either past their prime or far too progressive here in wyoming where every other car is a pickup and cowboy hats and boots are a working man s uniform the 2020 election worries voters who fear the election of a democrat will upend their way of life and force the coal mines to close and the oil wells to stop pumping force them to pay higher taxes force them to give up their ar 15 rifles and high capacity magazines force them to subsidize the health care of immigrants force them to pay for college loans for city kids force force force that s the problem miller says i m an adult you can t make me it s just taking away from letting people grow up like his neighbors miller says he wishes trump could lead the country the way he was elected to without being second guessed or attacked by what he considers a corrupt class of politicians and bureaucrats the way miller sees it the fact that trump is being so forcefully opposed perfectly demonstrates that the president is on the right track in draining the swamp in washington d c the state republican party officially endorses a slew of other conservative positions from disarming forest rangers to returning to a don t ask don t tell policy for the military and banning birthright citizenship the party has also called for banning the acceptance of any international refugees unless they are vetted christians defining marriage as only between a man and a woman abolishing the epa and the u s department of education and strictly enforcing all immigration laws but for most voters here coal and the jobs it provides are the biggest drivers of decisions and that means trump is their guy because wyoming has only three electoral college votes there s little chance a democrat will even bother campaigning here and even trump is considered unlikely to visit because most voters across the state will back him regardless if they see him in person shaking hands and holding babies that leaves wyoming s voters in a uniquely powerless situation ignored by both parties they are effectively sidelined despite the critical role federal policy plays in their future and they re facing democratic candidates who all see a bigger federal government as a solution to the nation s problems polls suggest their worst nightmare could come true in november former vice president joe biden sen bernie sanders i vt sen elizabeth warren of massachusetts and former south bend indiana mayor pete buttigieg are all narrowly leading or in a close tie with trump in recent polls the president s supporters in wyoming however point out that polls showed clinton winning the presidency in 2016 so they don t put much stock in them wyoming s 578 000 residents most of them white and living on land seized from native americans have long prided themselves on a frontier spirit of rugged individualism and independence they also see themselves as a world apart from the nation s big coastal states all of which tend to vote democrat for generations they ve voted republican and argued that big city liberals can t possibly understand what life is like where there s just six people per square mile new york city by contrast has 27 000 people per square mile but the outside world is increasingly moving in a different direction where global warming is settled science inclusivity diversity and tolerance are honored and access to health care is seen as a fundamental human right the united nations even has set a 2030 goal for achieving universal health coverage internationally that s setting up an increasingly stark contrast for wyomingites who see a trump victory as essential to preserving their freedoms and independence our way of life here is threatened by a democratic administration said state rep dan zwonitzer a republican who represents a portion of the largest city cheyenne where trump won 60 of the vote in 2016 every republican in wyoming you ll talk to would agree that wyoming is better off under a republican administration no one liked hillary they just knew that she was the enemy and whether it s joe biden or bernie sanders i don t think the vote totals would change by 5 there s just this attitude that you have to maintain control of the presidency at all costs to understand wyoming you have to understand a little bit about coal the state s backbone both physically and financially in gillette which calls itself the energy capital of the nation coal is inextricable from daily life the mines outside town set the pace explosives blasting the windswept ground to free the coal many of the workers are no longer full time employees but work as contractors missing out on the benefits but still keeping the same 12 hour shifts they used to before repeated bankruptcies prompted many mine operators to restructure in town restaurants proudly display coal keeps the lights on and friends of coal stickers and the diesel equipment repair shops and heavy machinery repair yards line the approaches to the historic downtown where the gillette brewing company s bar is supported by pieces of drilling rigs taxes levied on the vast trainloads of coal hauled to power plants across the west means the state has never had an income tax and its sales taxes are among the nation s lowest while eastern coal states like kentucky and west virginia get the president s attention wyoming leads the nation in coal production with its approximately 5 500 miners digging more than the next six states combined virtually all of that coal is mined from land owned by the federal government which leases the property to conglomerates to mine and then burn the coal for electricity that quirk of geology has long helped wyoming maintain its financial independence but even coal s strongest backers worry that times are changing the federal government plays a key role because slowing down new coal leases or restricting coal powered generating plants almost immediately affects the miners themselves during the 2016 campaign clinton declared we re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business a statement that infuriated wyoming residents who already disliked her for reasons ranging from benghazi to her work with the clinton foundation while clinton then went on to explain that she planned to offer job retraining to coal workers wyoming s voters who weren t going to support her anyway hardened their opposition further they say there s still life in coal and that clinton would have harmed an already struggling industry and they say the democrats running for president in 2020 have a similar playbook i think hillary would have killed our economy and i think any of the people running on the democrat side would absolutely eviscerate our economy the democrats seem to do everything they can to squash business says vicki million hughes a cheyenne real estate agent whose grandparents moved to wyoming in 1920 hughes says she s 100 behind the president aside from offensive tweets attacking specific people because his focus has been creating a strong economy growing industry and jobs jobs jobs the strength of the national and local economy is a major factor for trump s support in wyoming even though coal mining jobs have been on the decline for decades voters here believe four more years of his administration will keep the economy humming and extend the life of the coal mines for the foreseeable future if god is good enough to give us a natural resource we should use that resource wisely says hughes who like many wyoming voters says she believes the planet naturally warms and cools and that humans have little to do with it why waste what god has given us about 70 of americans say climate change is occurring and a majority 55 say it s mostly human caused according to an april 2019 study by yale university in new haven connecticut in wyoming voters like hughes and miller say they have the right to disagree and worry that their voices will be shouted down by the modern day shaming mobs populating social media i have lots of friends who live on the coasts and they tell me it s time to evolve that wyoming needs to get past fossil fuels but we make our living and livelihood off oil and gas and coal zwonitzer says you ve got people who have been involved in these industries for generations that singular focus on coal and federal land management means wyoming s voters spend little time worrying about the nuances of immigration or health care reform although many shake their heads at what they see as the entitlement culture of the democratic candidates and their supporters wyomingites pride themselves on their low tax work focused culture and the idea of erasing student loans or giving everyone government run health insurance runs counter to their deeply held ideology of taking care of their own problems and being responsible for their own decisions miller for instance is paying off medical debt accumulated when he crashed his dirtbike and blew out his knee he didn t have health insurance at the time and instead paid the obamacare tax because it was cheaper than paying for health insurance while having to pay the bills sucks miller says he accepts that it was his decision to forgo insurance everybody in wyoming would love to have the best college education the best health care and for it all to be done for free and that s just impossible said carl bunky loucks a republican state representative from casper i just don t understand the mentality that you can get everything for free loucks 52 said he and many other wyoming residents support both an audit of the federal government and a balanced budget amendment that would limit government spending to what it can actually afford instead of adding to the ballooning national deficit loucks said he s frustrated the national debt has increased under trump but says it would have been worse under a democrat trump won louck s county with 70 of the vote miller says wyoming has flourished under trump and none of his neighbors regret their 2016 votes if anything he says trump s support has increased how can you hate someone who is so good for the united states miller says i think his mouth gets him in trouble but sometimes what he says is well needed
but of course a single number target would not be met continuously monetary policy is an imprecise tool with operational lags inflation varies over the cycle the important issue is that inflation expectations should stay anchored thus the bullseye of the target was a thick point just like a target on a shooting range scoring an inner or an outer on the target was still ok what mattered over time was that the average outcomes should be broadly on target financial markets were looking for more precision than this so over time the target came to be articulated as 2 to 3 per cent whether this defined the diameter of the bullseye or not this target clearly did not have the sharp edges that had characterised the initial new zealand style target the 2 to 3 per cent did at least fit the original idea that the target should be centred at 2 5 per cent why this uneven number pragmatism is the answer when the inflation target was set inflation had been much higher and the more usual target of 2 per cent looked like a bridge too far whether the target was 2 per cent or 2 5 per cent didn t seem a critical issue alan greenspan articulated the common sense view price stability is that state in which expected changes in the general price level do not effectively alter business or household decisions advertisement that still seems true philip lowe expressed the same common sense view at the jackson hole symposium in wyoming last august financial markets might fret about decimal points but the public cares only whether inflation is low and stable in fact many people in our communities are incredulous that we would be too worried over whether inflation was 1 6 per cent 2 per cent or 2 2 per cent they ask haven t you got something more important to worry about the current below target inflation isn t holding back the economy or distorting decisions full employment is consistent with a range of longer term inflation outcomes where does that leave us while it is true that the inflation process has changed significantly over the past couple of decades it still seems highly likely that when the economy is operating at full capacity with unemployment around 4 5 per cent rather than the present rate of more than 5 per cent inflation will bew higher than it is now the problem is not that the target needs revision but that we need more effective measures for boosting activity towards full employment the role of a target is to facilitate the best setting of monetary policy it has done this the existing target has already given an unambiguous message that policy should be in expansionary mode and the rba responded the problem is that these expansionary settings here and overseas have had so little effect in stimulating investment and growth their impact has been largely on asset prices and the exchange rate where further stimulus is unhelpful other factors have been holding the economy back whether it is the legacy of the 2008 crisis overextended balance sheets heightened risk aversion trade uncertainty courtesy donald trump fiscal austerity high hurdle rates on investments short termism or just a general loss of economic mojo these problems can t be offset by distorting interest rates far below their normal setting monetary policy is already pedal to the metal and to do more would be counterproductive we don t need a revised inflation target to receive this simple message
as any south dakota farmer or rancher will tell you having a market to sell their products is vitally important to the success of their operations in south dakota we produce some of the highest quality crops and meat in the world however trade uncertainty coupled with low commodity prices and poor weather conditions has made life difficult for ag producers after years of being at the tip of the spear in ongoing trade disputes south dakota s farmers ranchers and manufacturers saw some major victories in recent weeks that will begin to reestablish and grow markets for them to sell their products i recently had the privilege of joining president trump at the white house for the signing of phase one of the u s china trade agreement under this agreement china will purchase at least 40 billion dollars of additional u s ag products the phase one agreement comes at an especially good time for american pork producers african swine fever has killed millions of pigs in china driving up demand for pork products exported from the u s we still have more to do to make sure china lives up to its obligations under the deal including stopping them from stealing our intellectual property and technologies and phase one is the first step in that process i recently cast my vote in favor of the u s mexico canada usmca trade deal which passed the senate with broad bipartisan support after months of delays by house speaker nancy pelosi it will replace the 26 year old north american free trade agreement nafta the usmca will give south dakota s farmers ranchers and manufacturers greater opportunities to sell their products in mexico and canada two of our nation s closest allies and our top trading partners trade with our north american neighbors supports 37 700 jobs in south dakota and in 2018 our state exported 924 million of goods and ag products to canada and mexico under the usmca canada will revise its grain grading policies to treat u s wheat in a way that is no less favorable than that it accords to like wheat of national origin this will level the playing field for south dakota wheat farmers by not allowing either country to have country of origin on wheat quality certificates finalizing the usmca will also provide us with better leverage to negotiate fair deals with other countries around the world it now awaits action in canada s parliament before it can go into effect these trade wins come on the heels of the unilateral trade agreement we made with japan which took effect at the beginning of january the u s japan agreement paved the way for more sales of american beef and other agricultural products additionally the european union trade negotiator recently called for a reset on trade talks with the u s so we can work to increase our markets in europe this progress is important for south dakota farmers ranchers and manufacturers who have dealt with trade instability for far too long senate republicans and president trump have remained focused on advancing policies that will help to grow the economy and so far the economy in nearly all sectors aside from agriculture has improved the stock market has reached record highs we ve cut taxes for american families including costly obamacare taxes and rolled back thousands of burdensome duplicative regulations that slowed business growth i believe that finalizing trade agreements that give farmers and ranchers a fair deal for their products is one of the final pieces of the puzzle that will allow the economy to reach its full potential free and fair trade is critical for our producers we are making significant progress toward securing better fairer trade deals for south dakota s ag community than what they ve had in the past
over the years nigeria s policies to address climate change which is one of the biggest challenges confronting the planet have not yielded meaningful results afeez hanafi reports at 12 noon that tuesday kareem salau sat patiently on a bench under a bamboo thatched shade along the shoreline of ebute a riverine community in oworonsoki lagos state at intervals his eyes flickered between the sight of teenagers swimming at the bank of dark stale water and labourers loading sand into some tippers minutes later he flashed a wry smile the moment he sighted two wooden boats approaching the jetty the middle aged man could tell from afar that the trip was successful the boats are among the over 100 boats that went to the sea around ijede and ofin in ikorodu a lagos suburb on monday evening to mine sharp sand each boat loads up to 10 tons of sand salau the chairman asiko laye irepodun sand dealers association an affiliate of the united sand dealers association of nigeria lagos chapter zone 3 disclosed to sunday punch earning a living hurting the nature by salau s account about 1 000 tons of sand is mined per trip but as alarming as the volume appears the dealer who claimed to have obtained an operating licence from the state government believes their activity portends no danger to costal system this place was established in 1980 and i inherited it from my father we carried out the survey of where we mine sand we work in the middle of water which is very far from communities there is a particular depth miners can reach and fishes don t go to where they work salau explained confidently a tipper load of sand five tons goes for n8 000 about 26 at the current official exchange rate n306 per 1 at the waterside and between five and 50 loads are sold every day depending on the market forces said salau in this business the chairman could beat his chest he has secured a comfortable livelihood working from monday to saturday and he is convinced the environment is safe he doesn t know what he is saying an associate professor at the department of marine sciences university of lagos charles onyema faulted salau s claim noting that the mining volume had massive ecological implications onyema said organisms exist and source their food in lagoons rivers and other water bodies in layers he stated that excessive mining like the one salau s workers engage in would change the depth of the soil layers and pose serious dangers to animals if an animal that is supposed to be in sandy substrate finds itself in coarse sand it won t survive onyema who specialises in coastal ecology noted the scholar explained that to replace the sand lost to dredging and mining nature recouped sediment from shorelines resulting in disappearance of coastal community whereby jetties and houses close to waters were eroded over time he said unregulated dredging also makes the water to be cloudy and polluted which affects organisms that are pollution sensitive they will be stressed they will die and reduce diversity the ones that can move away from that spot will do mining affects sea level rise which is one of the implications of climate change sea level rise is already hitting nigeria if they keep on the fishing communities will disappear sadly illegal mining continues to thrive in many parts of the country to the detriment of safety of lives and property a research conducted by department of environmental management and toxicology federal university of agriculture abeokuta and published in ethiopian journal of environmental studies management in 2014 assessed the environmental impacts of inland mining in parts of ogun state the study stated that apart from the environmental damage infrastructural facilities such as roads water and electricity were destroyed as a result of the activities of illegal sand miners for instance in the lusada area of ado odo ota local government area infrastructures such as electricity poles lean dangerously in sagamu the base of the electricity substation had been evacuated exposing the whole area to severe erosion and an impending disaster the situation is terrible at ado odo as completed buildings are almost collapsing this study has shown that the communities pay the greater environmental price due to the sand mining activities the report indicated the international journal of mining engineering and mineral processing evaluated the ecological effects of extraction of valuable minerals from the earth in nigeria and other west african countries and painted grimmer scenarios in three northern states of niger plateau and zamfara states in its 2017 report it maintained that illegal mining in pandogari niger state expanded from 17 5 kilometre square to 130 km2 from 1992 to 1998 and by 2000 mining operations had extended farther to 200 km2 the incursion of illegal miners continued in 2004 2006 from 254 km2 to 312 km2 in bukuru plateau state the report stated that forest area of 420 5 km2 in 1975 shrank to 399 56 km2 by 1986 due to the heavy toll of mining on the environment the downward slide continued almost 20 years after in 2005 with only 155 63 km2 area left with green cover the other burden of pollution risks involves the 1 000 abandoned mine ponds these threats are compounded further by the 400 fatalities from lead poisoning triggered by illegal quarrying in zamfara in 2010 the report added onyema urged the government to ensure proper regulations and compliance with the standard global practices in sand mining lagos lagoon for instance has been shrinking rapidly since 1960s we have estates like banana island which never existed before people are reclaiming land by the shoreline along lagos lagoon along river and by the ocean in the 70s and 80s the average depth of lagos lagoon is one metre now nobody knows the reality because we don t have the statistics but it is much deeper i am six feet two inches if it were before now i would walk inside most parts of the lagoon for a long distance if i try it now i will drown deforestation more damage less worries nigeria s total land area is said to be about 947 800 km2 with forests covering about 10 per cent of the landmass these forested areas are on a sharp decline on a daily basis due largely to illegal cutting of trees experts have noted that the diminishing number of tree cover and primary forest in nigeria has exposed nigerians to the dangers of heat waves rise in sea level flooding and droughts associated with climate change a former minister of state for environment mr ibrahim jibril disclosed that nigeria loses 1 5 million trees daily due to logging with deforestation rate of 3 5 per cent annually considered highest globally a 2017 report by environmental investigation agency stated that over 1 4 million illegal rosewood logs popularly known as koso worth 300m were exported to china from nigeria in connivance with top government officials this led to placing of ban on the exportation of the species used for manufacturing luxury furniture despite the disturbing statistics rashidi adebisi a logger in ilorin the kwara state capital shows no sign of slowing down on felling trees for a living like many of his colleagues across the country forty years on the job and still counting the 65 year old man is no pushover in the business which has taken him to many states of the federation in search of the next available useful wood to cut we cut trees whenever we have the opportunity to do so and sell them at sawmills the chairman fell and cut association odo okun ilorin the kwara state capital asserted frankly during an encounter with our correspondent early in january villagers lead us to forests where we get useful trees we go to any state where trees are available the intermediary who takes us to the forest will be the one to settle the owner of the land where trees are found the amount we give the intermediary depends on the volume of trees we find in the forest he said on occasions when luck is on his side the veteran timber dealer could fell three truckloads of trees including the highly demanded rosewood according to the sexagenarian each load weighs 200 cubic consisting of 12 to 18 trees depending on the size and n8 000 to n10 000 about 26 to 36 is paid to the intermediary per load we sell a load of whitewood for n35 000 114 koso is n45 000 147 the elderly man explained although his activity falls short of the standard practice the logger thought otherwise claiming that he obtained a permit from local government authorities whoever wants to be cutting trees in the forest must get a permit from the local government the permit covers our operations in kwara but if we want to work in another state we have to get a permit from a local government in that state the permit is about n20 000 and it is valid for one year he claimed although adebisi is aware of the enormity of damage his line of business does to the growing deforestation in the country he blamed the acute loss of trees in the forest on government s failure to replace them before now we cut trees free of charge now there are few trees in the forest and we are having challenges that is why the government advised that if we cut one tree we should plant two or three in replacement but that is not possible the government is supposed to use the dues we pay to plant new ones aside from deforestation and mining economic activities in transport industrial and energy sectors have terrible greenhouse effects through excess emissions of carbon dioxide c02 and other greenhouse gases serious emissions fatal dangers a 2017 record by worldometer put co2 emissions from burning fossil fuel in nigerian transport sector at 31 9 per cent in 2016 followed by 27 5 per cent recorded in cement production chemical and metal processes solvents among other related fields while the power industry which involves burning fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas accounted for 14 8 per cent greenhouse emissions from businesses and homes as well as waste handling accounted for 8 7 per cent excluded are short cycle biomass burning such as agricultural waste burning and large scale biomass burning such as forest fires fossil co2 emissions in nigeria were 82 634 214 tons in 2016 the co2 emissions increased by 0 70 per cent over the previous year representing an increase by 578 039 tons over 2015 when co2 emissions were 82 056 175 tons the record added as of 2012 over 120 million nigerians relied on firewood and charcoal for their cooking needs said the international energy agency in the world energy outlook a similar report by world health organisation in 2017 put the figure at over 100 million indicating no significant improvement the fatal consequence of this poverty induced practice was emphasised in the who s report which stated that over 470 nigerians died of ailments caused by firewood smoke between 2011 and 2016 the international body also identified smoke from open fire as nigeria s third biggest killer with over n95 000 annual deaths behind malaria and hiv aids the managing director greenado international limited an energy and environment consulting firm mr lawal gada said decisive actions must be taken to address carbon emissions from households transport and industry sectors gada who is the president african foundation on environment and climate change and national vice president for nigerian alliance for clean cookstoves an affiliate of global alliance for clean cookstoves said government must work with the private sector to encourage the use of alternative and clean energy sources he said we now have more than 100 companies producing cleaner cookstoves there are up to 30 active ones government needs to support those companies most of the producers are start ups who could not get loans from banks to upscale production only about five are now commercially doing well the rest are still struggling government has to come in so they can be commercialised and affordable to many people there were attempts in 2014 to encourage mass production of clean cookstoves along the line the procurement process was faulty and by 2015 it was a bad story over n9bn worth of clean cookstoves and up till now nobody knows what happened mass transportation including rail transport should also be enhanced that is what is done in developed economies like the united kingdom united states and china to mitigate carbon emissions if two persons drive their cars from lagos to abuja they would be emitting much carbon higher than if they use the same mass transport there is the need for political will to reduce emissions there is the need for a complete reform of the transport sector to align with the best practices elsewhere in the world we also need to certify vehicles that should be on the road in the industrial sector most machines are obsolete the ones that are standard are high in price so companies go for outdated machines that have been banned elsewhere the government needs to make deliberate efforts to address this there should be policies to make existing companies and new ones to embrace environmental friendly technology related news expert trains 85 kwara youth on climate change this is the 11th year the government has been saying they want to stop gas flaring yet they have not been able to do so we need actions not just talks to achieve these goals interestingly government especially at the federal level acknowledges the dire risks carbon emissions pose to human health and the climate by formulating policies every now and then to address them much talk little work since the last decade the federal government has been coming up with policies to address the overwhelming challenge of climate change and nigeria is a signatory to international conventions such as the united nations framework convention on climate change kyoto protocol and paris climate agreement at the national level the federal executive council in 2012 adopted the nigeria climate change policy response and strategy nccprs to reflect the increasing importance of climate change issues in the country the government adopted comprehensive strategies as well as a number of specific policies with the ultimate goal of fostering low carbon high growth economic development and build a climate resilient society other objectives of the policy are to enhance national capacity to adapt to climate change raise climate change related science and technology to a new level that will enable the country to better participate in international scientific and technological cooperation on climate change significantly increase public awareness and involve private sector participation in addressing the challenges of climate change strengthen national institutions and mechanisms to establish a suitable and functional framework for climate change governance shortly before the adoption of nccprs the national adaptation strategy and plan of action for climate change nigeria naspa ccn was set in motion to build a nigeria in which climate change adaptation would be an integrated component of sustainable development while also reducing the vulnerability to the adverse impacts of climate change the policy was designed to stimulate action plans on climate change among the three tiers of government civil society private sector universities communities individuals and the media and to achieve the set goals the department of climate change in the federal ministry of environment was established the department in its 2010 national environmental economic and development study needs for climate change in nigeria also highlighted how industrial energy and agricultural sectors as well as mines and deforestation impacted global warming and developed comprehensive plans to tackle it needs rated the relative vulnerability of nigeria among the countries of the world high on the grading scales of low medium low medium medium high and high the study stated that nigeria s economy and other sectors of development were vulnerable to climate change the coastline of nigeria is already undergoing pronounced morphological changes as a result of natural and anthropogenic activities the natural phenomena include occasional sea surges and tidal waves while human activities include haphazard construction of ill designed jetties and groynes sand mining unplanned and accelerated infrastructural development pollution and general land degradation the total area occupied by reserved forests in nigeria is less than 10 per cent of the total landmass the remaining forest area in nigeria will likely disappear by 2020 if the current rate of forest depletion continues unabated the value of lost forest cover has been estimated at 750m annually at 1989 prices the study revealed one of the key resolutions of the vision 20 2020 was to invest in low carbon fuels and renewable energy as contained in the projection of the national policy on climate change 2011 but nine years on the challenges have become more alarming with nigerians increasingly feeling the impact of climate change in the form of excess hot weather and flooding at the un climate change conference cop25 held in madrid spain recently the minister of environment dr mahmood abubakar said nigeria had been active in the climate change adaptation and would continue to progress to contribute to global efforts at ameliorating climate change the minister identified funding as the major challenge and called for climate funding from the developed countries in support of nigeria and other african countries damning consequences amid govt action plans given the comprehensive plans the government canvassed about nine years ago one would have expected mitigation of climate change impacts to some extent sadly reverse is the case as shown by the available statistics casting doubts on the minister s claim of nigeria s active role according to the international union for conservation of nature a global authority on the status of the natural world and measures needed to safeguard it as of 2018 31 species of mammals 21 bird species 74 species of fish and 205 species of higher plants were under threat in nigeria as a result of climate change also deforestation statistics for nigeria published by mongabay com revealed that 113 948 hectares of nigeria s primary forest was lost to deforestation from 2002 to 2018 while 818 286 hectares of tree cover planted by people destroyed during the same period as of 2018 tree cover in the country stood at 10 326 662 hectares 639 384 hectares short of the 10 966 046 hectares recorded in 2010 the primary forest as of 2018 was 1 789 176 hectares 80 004 short of 1 869 180 hectares accounted for in 2010 the record further stated that kwara state the epicenter of adebisi s logging has a total area of 3 547 840 hectares from 2001 2018 23 474 hectares of tree cover representing 22 per cent was lost to deforestation in the state of that figure 17 169 hectares 11 per cent of tree cover was destroyed between 2011 and 2018 within the period kwara with carbon biomass of 22 806 934 metric tons had emitted 5 290 927 mt from 2001 2018 from 2001 to 2010 the average carbon emissions per year was 153 530 mt the average emissions rose sharply from 2011 2018 to 469 454 mt during the years under review bayelsa state lost 16 104 hectares of tree cover out of the carbon biomass of 291 254 809 mt 5 613 671 mt was emitted from 2001 2018 between 2001 and 2010 the average carbon emissions in the state per year was 169 542mt it rose by over 200 per cent from 2011 2018 with the average emission per year of 489 782 mt lagos nigeria s commercial capital with a land mass of 380 570 hectares had tree cover stretching 109 068 hectares as of 2018 the report said it lost 9 983 hectares of tree cover representing 14 per cent loss from 2000 till 2018 of the 15 660 571 mt of carbon biomass the state emitted 2 220 952 mt from 2001 2018 from 2001 to 2010 the average emissions per year was 53 011 mt which increased to 211 356 mt from 2011 2018 a professor at the department of forest production and products university of ibadan abiodun oluwafemi observed that the statistics had far reaching effects on the nation there will be less quality of life greater risk of climate consequences risk of food insecurity and less productive land weather conditions cannot be predicted there will be loss of biodiversity ecosystem both flora plants and fauna animals soil erosion leading to bad lands crops failure flooding increased greenhouse gases unpredictable rainfall proneness to wildfire water cycle will be affected and availability of clean natural water will decline among others he noted oluwafemi added that the rate of deforestation was highest in nigeria with loss of primary forest close to 59 per cent making nigeria the largest rate of desertification at an annual rate of about four per cent speaking on the 2019 seasonal rainfall predictions the director general the nigerian meteorological agency prof sani mashi advised farmers to delay planting their crops that year he argued that except they planted smart food yields would be adversely affected as a result of unusually low level of rainfall in many parts of the country at a press conference in abuja on thursday ahead of the announcement of 2020 srp mashi attributed the harsh weather conditions currently witnessed in the country to changes in climatic weather patterns this year we have witnessed a lot of weather changes that had never been witnessed before as a result of changes in weather patterns over the source region and this accounts for situation whereby temperature as low as 6 celcius was recorded in some parts of the country he stated the director general national environmental standards and regulations enforcement agency prof aliyu jauro confirmed the growing impact of climate change in nigeria in an interview with our correspondent jauro lamented that most of the trees in the forest had been depleted due to farming activities bush burning and logging adding that most of the animals found in the forest are no more there all these are linked to the climate change some water bodies such as lake chad have also disappeared so the effect of climate change in nigeria is clear especially the rise in temperature it is now very hot unlike before he added agencies experts want cogent action on climate change jauro said the steady rise in the indices of climate change in nigeria despite the government s action plans was not surprising he blamed it largely on the high level of poverty in the oil rich country which is the largest economy in africa the world poverty clock in 2018 disclosed that 87 million nigerians lived on less than 1 90 a day nigeria population is about 200 million how many nigerians can afford to buy cooking gas which is a bit cleaner in rural areas they rely 100 per cent on firewood because they cannot afford to buy cooking gas lpg so they rely on felling the trees the dg noted he said the agency would soon launch national generator emission control programme and vehicular emission control programme to address excess emissions of carbon dioxide from generators and vehicles which he described as major contributors to greenhouse gases in the country jauro said the federal government was working with some local companies to produce clean cookstoves in commercial quantities and at subsidised rate so that people can afford to buy them he stated that regulations had been put in place to ensure the planting of trees to replace each tree felled adding that the agency always inspects industries to check the level of emissions he said nesrea needs other agencies to come on board so that we can sensitise the public to the dangers of climate change another issue we have is the production and exportation of charcoal which many nigerians are involved in but it is not allowed all the agencies have to be strict to ensure that everybody does the right thing on his part the acting director federal department of forestry ministry of environment mr sikiru tiamiyu said the department was collaborating with a private company in an afforestation programme aimed at replanting trees in six states and federal capital territory abuja there is also presidential pledge on 25 million seedlings which president made at the united nations general assembly department of forestry is the secretary to that committee and we are working seriously to make sure that the seedlings are planted this year across the country he stated tiamiyu said forest guards who used to curtail the activities of illegal loggers had stopped operations in most states adding that the department would soon convey a national forestry development committee meeting last held over 10 years ago to address deforestation he said it is states that have right over forests not federal government we need to have their cooperation for effective policy implementation we are trying to establish forest guards and whistleblowers in some states as an experiment it is illegal for local government to give permit to timber contractors but what happens most times is that they loggers don t take permit from the state they just go to the bush and cut trees including undersized trees a master plan has been drafted by the federal ministry of environment but the implementation is not that easy the ui professor oluwafemi also called for increased forest cover through planting of more trees sustainable management of forest estates and reserves reassessment of government policies on wood exportation to include severe punitive measures for offenders the federal government should be involved in the establishment of forest reserves and own such in each state of the federation there should be increase in research education and forestry extension towards reduced emissions nigeria needs massive climate change education to know how to mitigate climate change and global warming a professor of forest economics and sustainable development and vice chancellor osun state university labode popoola said forests had the unique attribute for carbon sequestration the trapping of carbon to reduce global warming according to popoola there is a subsisting presidential approval for presidential initiative on afforestation which if well implemented would fast track the recovery of the forest sector from its current parlous state he said there is the need to urgently undertake forest and biodiversity resources assessment of the country to establish the status of the resources one cannot adequately manage what one does not know or have control over there should be constitution of an inter ministerial committee comprising environment finance energy agriculture water resources science and technology petroleum resources education and justice to establish options and strategies for sustainable forest management if the recommended measures must work then corruption must be tackled frontally there is the need for a deliberate effort on the part of governments to take decisive steps to stamp out corruption in all facets of our national life copyright punch all rights reserved this material and other digital content on this website

gillette wyo from behind the counter of his brother s auto parts store bubba miller looks out at the 2020 presidential race and worries about what will happen to his hometown if a democrat wins not just a democrat but based on the current frontrunners a liberal democrat or a progressive or an avowed socialist i wish we could build a wall around wyoming he says with a laugh i think there s just something wrong in their heads to think you can get everything for free shifting the wad of tobacco tucked in his lip miller 24 lays out the case for reelecting president donald trump from this coal town s booming economy to the president s protection of gun rights to his tough border policies to his efforts to reduce the size of the federal government as far as miller is concerned trump can do no wrong advertisement advertisement he s not alone in 2016 then candidate trump won 86 of the vote here as he swept every wyoming county but one the wealthy liberal enclave of teton county home to jackson hole only once since 1952 has the state voted for a democratic presidential candidate and in 2016 trump beat hillary clinton here by the widest margin of any state and ahead of the november presidential election none of the 2020 democratic candidates are making any inroads with these most conservative of voters i ve very concerned about the direction of the democratic party says robin clover a 20 year wyoming resident and registered republican who has voted for democrats at the local level they re either past their prime or far too progressive here in wyoming where every other car is a pickup and cowboy hats and boots are a working man s uniform the 2020 election worries voters who fear the election of a democrat will upend their way of life and force the coal mines to close and the oil wells to stop pumping force them to pay higher taxes force them to give up their ar 15 rifles and high capacity magazines force them to subsidize the health care of immigrants force them to pay for college loans for city kids force force force that s the problem miller says i m an adult you can t make me it s just taking away from letting people grow up a sign on the outskirts of gillette wyoming offers residents health care options like his neighbors miller says he wishes trump could lead the country the way he was elected to without being second guessed or attacked by what

town s booming economy to the president s protection of gun rights to his tough border policies to his efforts to reduce the size of the federal government as far as miller is concerned trump can do no wrong he s not alone in 2016 then candidate trump won 86 of the vote here as he swept every wyoming county but one the wealthy liberal enclave of teton county home to jackson hole only once since 1952 has the state voted for a democratic presidential candidate and in 2016 trump beat hillary clinton here by the widest margin of any state and ahead of the november presidential election none of the 2020 democratic candidates are making any inroads with these most conservative of voters i ve very concerned about the direction of the democratic party says robin clover a 20 year wyoming resident and registered republican who has voted for democrats at the local level they re either past their prime or far too progressive here in wyoming where every other car is a pickup and cowboy hats and boots are a working man s uniform the 2020 election worries voters who fear the election of a democrat will upend their way of life and force the coal mines to close and the oil wells to stop

identifying correct investment themes could go a long way in delivering alpha returns to investors empirical evidence suggests that investors who are prudent enough to identify macroeconomic developments early benefit immensely for example predicting that large cap stocks would deliver better returns than their small cap peers at the beginning of the last decade would have had a tremendous impact on the performance of an equity portfolio 2020 could be a challenging one for investors considering the expected slowdown of the american economy however there s every reason to believe the market s performance will be positive this year as well driven by the success of the phase one trade deal between the u s and china the financial sector will likely be a winner as credit growth will remain robust with expectations for economic growth while some investors might find picking stocks is the best way to invest in this theme many others feel comfortable holding a portfolio of multiple banks and financial institutions this analysis will look at the outlook for this industry in 2020 and will identify a couple of exchange traded funds that provide meaningful exposure to the sector gurus are bullish on the sector evaluating the portfolio weights of renowned investors is a good way to gauge a measure of the sectors and industries they are bullish and bearish on as evident from the below graph many legendary investors have allocated a significant portion of their portfolios to the financials sector notably all these investors have a track record of investing in banks and financials sector companies at the correct time which indicates it would be a good idea to follow them into this industry banks are brushing off the threat from low rates by improving efficiency the federal open market committee decided to cut the headline interest rates three times in 2019 sending a message to investors that net interest margins will likely be lower for financial institutions in the next few years fed chair jerome powell confirmed that there will likely be no changes to the policy rates in 2020 as well accommodative monetary policy decisions have far outweighed policy tightening since 1995 which has led to an erosion of government bond yields in developed countries over the last 24 years source refinitiv low rates however have not been able to stop banks from growing their net income this is because the industry is seeing significant improvements in efficiency in a review by community banking connections it was revealed that overhead expenses noninterest expenses at many banks across the nation are increasing at a slower rate than total assets leading to profit growth this has resulted in an improvement in the return on average assets for most u s banks in the last decade source federal reserve of st louis this higher return on assets played a major role in the continued growth of banks profitability in this period which can be expected to continue as rigorous measures are implemented by the management of these institutions to improve the overall efficiency the yield curve is steepening good news for banks the inversion of the yield curve sent shockwaves through u s markets in 2019 the reaction was appropriate as such a phenomenon has preceded the last seven economic recessions in the country analysts economists and investors alike consider this to be a meaningful indication of where the economy is headed for banks this is an even more ominous sign as it reflects the inability of financial institutions to charge more from long term loans than they pay for short term debt theoretically a wider gap between the two yield curves will lead to an expansion in profit margin for lenders since september the yield curve has steepened indicating the economy is on firm footing at the moment and that fears of a recession are overblown shweta singh an analyst at ts lombard shared the reasons behind this steepening in december coinciding with the growing expectations for a truce in the u s china trade war confirmed with the interim trade deal announced late last week and with a bottoming out of world trade this has pushed long end yields higher and thus steepened the yield curve a continued widening of these two yield curves would bring good news for financial services companies in 2020 and this expectation for higher profitability will translate into the performance of shares as well big banks could become bigger technological advancements are disrupting many industries around the world and the banking sector is going through rapid changes consumers are opting for online service delivery methods and the importance of digitization has never been any higher for this sector the big banks in the united states have responded by significantly increasing the investments directed toward improving their online presence also these institutions are investing in developing modernized solutions to address the preferences of tech savvy consumers source deloitte cash rich banks are in a better position to win more customers in the next couple of years which suggests it would be a good idea to stick with renowned names in the industry this is because technology related investments are costing billions of dollars early movers to implement robust new features are likely to win and it s the big banks that have made the early moves and possess the necessary resources to invest significant amounts valuation multiples are still attractive the shiller price earnings ratio developed by robert shiller a professor at yale university is a widely measured tool to gauge the overvalued or undervalued status of the u s markets and sectors the s p 500 index is trading at a multiple of 31 8 which is much higher than the pre financial crisis ratio of around 25 the financials sector is the cheapest behind energy stocks which confirms that this sector is relatively undervalued compared to the broad market source gurufocus this is a good reason for investors to focus on bank stocks in 2020 as there is every opportunity for a convergence of earnings multiples with that of the market however thorough due diligence should be conducted on each individual security before reaching investment decisions to avoid falling into value traps earnings are expected to grow the quarterly net income of u s banks and savings institutions has grown exponentially since the financial crisis the stellar economic growth record low unemployment levels disposable income growth and an increased level of supervision and regulation have all contributed to this successful run of the industry source federal deposit insurance corporation according to data from factset and the financial times the sector will report the second highest earnings growth in the fourth quarter of 2019 as well results are currently being released to the public source factset financial times even though there could be a decline in growth rates in 2020 many analysts believe banks will continue to grow their earnings this year as well rbc analyst gerard cassidy wrote bank stocks need to be owned the current environment is similar to the monetary policy of 1994 98 when the federal reserve tightened and then cut interest rates and bank stocks outperformed as rates fell the potential for higher net income coupled with cheap valuation multiples present investors with a good opportunity the best way to play this thesis might be to own a few funds that specialize in financial services companies etfs to consider when it comes to equity market investments there s no guarantee of attractive returns even if the theses prove to be flawless such is the risk associated with these types of securities arguably picking stocks is a much more difficult task than identifying the sectors that are expected to grow based on the expectations for the financial services sector in 2020 and beyond the safest way to gain exposure is to invest in exchange traded funds that provide access to banking stocks the financial select sector etf xlf financial is one of the well known funds that invests in this sector at the end of 2019 the top 10 holdings of the fund included some of the biggest names in the industry which is a characteristic that investors should appreciate considering the growth expectations for big banks source etf com the fund which has a dividend yield of 1 85 traded at the market price of around 31 on friday and distributions have grown in each of the last nine years this is a promising sign for income investors as well vanguard financials etf vfh financial is another fund that provides the same exposure to this sector but trades at a higher yield of 2 15 conclusion the financial services sector looks prime to deliver attractive returns to investors in 2020 the biggest banks might stay on top and divert further away from their small peers which presents an opportunity for investors to

editor s note ji xianbai is a research fellow with the international political economy program of s rajaratnam school of international studies nanyang technological university singapore the article reflects the author s opinions and not necessarily the views of cgtn chinese president xi jinping just completed his state visit to myanmar on january 17 and 18 this rare single country overseas trip by the top chinese leader was a concrete testimony to the long standing paukphaw friendship injected with renewed vitality while president xi s visit was meant to commemorate the 70th anniversary of diplomatic relations between china and myanmar the deep running sino myanmar socio economic ties have a long ancestry that stretches over millennia myanmar was located at the crossroads of the ancient southwestern silk road and the tea horse road opened back in the han dynasty myanmar served not only as the commercial hub where chinese burmese indian and javanese merchants mingled and traded but also an interchange of religion buddhism in particular between east asia and south asia since 2013 china has been actively reviving these historic silk roads and physical linkages that once knitted peoples and civilizations in the vast afro eurasia supercontinent together through their modern day incarnations collectively labeled as the belt and road initiative bri myanmar plays a very critical role within the scope of the bri the planned bangladesh china india myanmar economic corridor carving out a path of connective infrastructure from kunming to kolkata crosses myanmar s mandalay the china myanmar economic corridor cmec provides for greater intra myanmar transport connectivity while facilitating economic integration between myanmar and china s inland province of yunnan and the kyaukphyu seaport on the bay of bengal is an integral part of the 21st century maritime silk road the maritime component of the bri for expanding and upgrading global shipping capacity myanmar has proved a firm supporter of the bri corridors and projects state counselor aung san suu kyi attended both bri summits in 2017 and 2019 and during president xi s latest visit to myanmar the two countries reaffirmed their unwavering commitment to pushing forward win win belt and road cooperation for mutual benefits and common prosperity despite some short term project setbacks and policy recalibrations some 33 agreements were signed at the tail of president xi s visit they aimed at speeding up the development of the kyaukpyu special economic zone in myanmar s rakhine state the china myanmar border economic cooperation zone along the kunlong chinshwehaw border area the new yangon city applying state of art smart city technologies and sustainable urban design concepts and comprehensive road rail and energy transboundary interconnectivity the leaders also designated the year 2020 as the china myanmar year of culture and tourism to further advance people to people exchanges and mutual cultural understanding some western commentators skeptical of booming china myanmar bonds were quick to assert that china is cultivating economic and strategic dependence on the part of myanmar by stealth through the bri perhaps they should be reminded of the context in which china emerged as myanmar s most trusted economic partner between the late 1980s to 2016 washington placed harsh restrictions on trade investment finance tourism education technology transfer and development assistance vis à vis myanmar on human rights and democracy grounds leaving the impoverished country in complete economic and diplomatic isolation from the west within the region itself myanmar failed to identify robust economic growth drivers with the exception of the greater mekong subregion program many long standing development initiatives spearheaded by the asian development bank e g indonesia malaysia thailand growth triangle and the brunei indonesia malaysia philippines growth area focused primarily on maritime southeast asia and not continental and least developed nations like myanmar japan s engagement though helpful and generous was largely confined to the realms of financial sector reforms and institution building this goes without saying that intra asean trade and investment remained too weak to propel myanmar s economic take off china by contrast embraced myanmar out of pragmatism china did not pretend as the west did that it was within its gift to dictate the development path of myanmar but nevertheless recognized myanmar s legitimate quest for economic advancement and social progress china accordingly offered over the past decades development aid humanitarian assistance trade preference and direct investment to myanmar so that the latter can grow itself out of the economic quagmires resulted from isolation with the launch of the bri and the cmec china now has a greater stake in the economic success of myanmar than ever before president xi s visit to myanmar was therefore extremely timely and of far reaching significance as china steps up its economic engagement and myanmar picks up growth momentum under the bri the time honored paukphaw friendship will only get more resilience and renewed for the better indeed as aung san suu kyi puts it china and myanmar will stand together till the end of the world
the fed is still treating the economy as if it s fragile is this good news for investors the federal reserve seems to be doing everything it can to stay out of the way of the stock market although the bulls have been on a rampage for the past 10 years creating and re creating new highs in every thinkable index the specter of the hibernating bear looms large no one wants to be the jerk who wakes it at the close of 2019 fed chairman jerome powell said he was waiting for consistent inflation above the central bank s target before he will consider hiking interest rates the federal open market committee predicted that the u s will experience 2 growth in gdp a 1 9 core personal consumption expenditure pce index for inflation and 3 5 unemployment in 2020 these are certainly not recessionary numbers however minutes from the jan 4 federal reserve meeting tell us that the fed still thinks the economy is walking on eggshells fed officials also expressed that their concern over u s inflation came mostly from economic weakness abroad add in u s china trade tensions and u s iran political tensions and you probably have a formula for a consistent and conservative monetary policy in 2020 in short the fed isn t going to take responsibility for the coming market correction when is the correction arriving whether you believe the bubble is in bonds or housing something s got to give at least that is the sentiment that will eventually boil over and actually cause the correction when is it coming who knows how big will it be see previous answer corporate debt is increasing while manufacturing is contracting but this doesn t seem to translate into people s day to day lifestyles fannie mae predicted that single family housing starts in 2020 will accelerate to an impressive 10 this year with 1 million new homes to be built in 2021 to compare single family housing starts increased only 1 in 2019 fannie mae s economic and strategic research group attributes these gains to high consumer spending and a strong labor market the fed s and fannie mae s thinking on the economy seem to line up but fannie mae s stats are built on a robust trustworthy economy not the brittle one that the fed describes smart money is still moving into speculative investments but safe havens did have a slight uptick after the killing of iranian general qassim suleimani moving forward in 2020 the trade war between the u s and china seems to be coming to an end china recently agreed to expand its purchases of farm goods and other american exports in return the u s agreed to remove around 156 billion worth of new tariffs on chinese goods and halve tariffs on another 120 billion it remains to be seen if the unrest in the persian gulf and between the u s and iran in particular will create lasting conflict and unsettle the markets polls show that the american public does not want conflict with iran which may or may not matter in today s world of bush doctrine executive privilege with all of the uncertainty surrounding the markets perhaps the fed is right to keep its hands off any possible powder kegs investors would be wise to pay attention to the fed s two favorite inflation indicators the consumer price index cpi and the personal consumption expenditure deflator the fed actually puts a bit more weight on the pce according to its meeting notes if the pce consistently stays at 2 the fed may make a move to hike interest rates the current report from the bureau of economic analysis lists it at 1 5

more he peers into the darkness dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before and meets a silence broken only by his whispered word lenore he closes the door the tapping starts again he flings open his shutter and with many a flirt and flutter in flies a raven grim ungainly ghastly gaunt and ominous bird of yore the bird speaks just one word nevermore that word is the poem s last but it s where poe began he started he said at the end where all works of art should begin and he first put pen to paper at what became the third to last stanza prophet said i thing of evil prophet still if

clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore quoth the raven nevermore the philosophy of composition is a lovely little essay but as poe himself admitted it s a bit of jiggery pokery too poe didn t actually write the raven backward the essay is as much a contrivance as the poem itself here is a beautiful poem it does everything a poem should do is everything a poem should be and here is a clever essay about the writing of a beautiful poem top that nearly everything poe wrote including the spooky stories for which he is best remembered has this virtuosic showy lilting and slightly wilting quality like a peony just past bloom poe didn t write the raven to answer the exacting demands of a philosophic art or not entirely anyway he wrote it for the same reason that he wrote tales like the gold bug to stave off starvation for a long while poe lived on bread and molasses weeks before the gold bug was published he was begging near strangers on the street for fifty cents to buy something to eat the raven has had a great run he wrote to a friend but i wrote it for the express purpose of running just as i did the gold bug you know the bird beat the bug though all hollow the public that swallowed that bird and bug poe strenuously resented you love poe or you don t but either way poe doesn t love you a writer more condescending to more adoring readers would be hard to find the nose of a mob is its imagination he wrote by this at any time it can be quietly led this year marks the two hundredth anniversary of poe s birth and the publication of two collections of gothic tales produced by the mystery writers of america on a raven s wing new tales in honor of edgar allan poe harper 14 99 contains stories by twenty mystery writers including mary higgins clark in the shadow of the master classic tales by edgar allan poe william morrow 25 99 pairs poe s best known stories with modern commentaries stephen king muses on the genius of the tell tale heart there s also a sensitive and haunting brief biography peter ackroyd s poe a life cut short doubleday 21 95 that offers a fitting tribute to poe s begin at the end philosophy by opening with his horrible and mysterious death in october of 1849 poe drunk and delirious seems to have been dragged around baltimore to cast votes precinct after precinct in one of that city s infamously corrupt congressional elections until he finally collapsed from ryan s tavern a polling place in the fourth ward poe was carried like a corpse to a hospital he died four days later he was forty years old my whole existence has been the merest romance poe wrote the year before his death in the sense of the most utter unworldliness this is byronic bunk poe s life was tragic but he was about as unworldly as a bale of cotton poe s world was andrew jackson s america a world of banking collapse financial panic and grinding depression that had a particularly devastating effect on the publishing industry where poe sought a perch his biography really is a series of unfortunate events but two of those events were transatlantic financial crises the panic of 1819 and the panic of 1837 the pit and the pendulum of the antebellum economy poe died at the end of a decade known in europe as the hungry forties and he wasn t the only american to fall face down in the gutter during a seven year long depression brought on by a credit collapse he did not live out of time he lived in hard times dark times up and down times indigence cast a shadow over everything he attempted poverty was his raven tapping at the door and it was poe not the bird who uttered helplessly another rhyme for nevermore i send you an original tale poe once began a letter and at its end added one line more p s i am poor edgar poe was born in boston on january 19 1809 to a talented actress named eliza poe and her hapless husband david who deserted her when edgar was two his mother died of consumption edgar and a brother and sister had little more to depend upon than the charity of strangers the poe orphans were separated and edgar landed in the home of a wealthy richmond merchant named john allan and his sickly childless wife fanny allan who ran a firm called the house of ellis never adopted the boy and never loved him either poe for his part took allan s name but never wanted it he signed letters and published as edgar a poe in 1815 allan moved his family to london to take advantage of the booming british market for virginia tobacco poe attended posh boarding schools then during the panic of 1819 the first bust in the industrializing nineteenth century banks failed factories closed and allan s business imploded allan plagued with two hundred thousand dollars of debt returned to virginia poe turned poet the earliest verses in his hand that survive were written when he was fifteen last night with many cares and toils oppress d weary i laid me on a couch to rest adolescent melancholy and nothing more but on the same sheet of paper just below poe s scrawl allan had calculated the compound interest on a debt in 1823 poe fell in love with jane stannard the unhinged mother of a school friend a year later stannard died insane poe spent much time at her graveside no more became his favorite phrase in 1825 allan inherited a fortune from an uncle he did not name poe as his heir allan rose poe kept falling at seventeen poe went to the university of virginia where he drank and gambled and in a matter of months racked up debts totalling more than two thousand dollars allan refused to honor them even though poe was at risk of debtors prison poe ran off there followed a series of huffy pronouncements and stormy departures most ended in poe creeping back begging allan for money i am in the greatest necessity not having tasted food since yesterday morning poe wrote i have no where to sleep at night but roam about the streets allan was unmoved poe enlisted in the army and served for two years as edgar a perry in 1829 fanny allan died andrew jackson was inaugurated poe while awaiting a commission to west point submitted the manuscript for a book of poems to a publisher who told him that he would publish it only if poe guaranteed him against the loss allan wouldn t front the money poe moved to baltimore where he lived with his invalid grandmother his aunt maria clemm his nine year old cousin virginia and his brother henry an alcoholic who was dying of consumption jackson meanwhile refused to renew the charter of the bank of the united states run by nicholas biddle biddle insisted on the need for federal regulation of paper currency some of jackson s supporters wanted no paper money at all between 1830 and 1837 while biddle and jackson battled three hundred and forty seven state chartered banks opened across the country they printed their own money 140 million in paper bills was in circulation by 1836 all this paper was backed by very little coin at the end of jackson s two terms american banks held six times as much paper money as gold poe who was broke didn t need a bank he could treasure up funds he came to believe in his own brain he read as much as he could borrowing books from baltimore libraries there are minds which not only retain all receipts but keep them at compound interest for ever he wrote poe may have thought that his mind was a mint but when his book of poems was finally published it earned him nothing exactly what all his collections of poetry earned he sold one of maria clemm s slaves i have tried to get the money for you from mr a a dozen times but he always shuffles me off poe wrote to one of his creditors and he added lying mr a is not very often sober i have an inveterate habit of speaking the truth poe once wrote that too was a lie that poe lied compulsively about his own life has proved the undoing of many a biographer in 1830 he finally made it to west point where he pulled pranks i cannot believe a word he writes allan wrote on the back of yet another letter from his wayward charge poe was court martialled and after that allan who had since married a woman twenty years his junior cut him off entirely poe went to new york but unable to support himself by writing he left the city within three months returning to baltimore to live with mrs clemm and little virginia he published his first story metzengerstein about a doomed hungarian baron his gloomy castle and his fiery steed he won a prize of fifty dollars from the baltimore saturday visiter for ms found in a bottle one of the editors who met him later wrote i found him in baltimore in a state of starvation in these straits poe wrote berenice a story about a man who disinters his dead lover and yanks out all her teeth the white and glistening and ghastly teeth of berenice only to realize that she is still alive it has been claimed plausibly that poe wrote this story to make a very bad and long winded joke about bad taste also he was hungry you can tell us the sound of one hand clapping here or you can tell us downtown copy link to cartoon copy link to cartoon shop shop john allan died in 1834 a rich man he left his vast estate three plantations and two hundred and thirty slaves to his second wife and their three children he left edgar a poe not a penny the following year poe was hired as the editor of a new monthly magazine the southern literary messenger in richmond he was paid sixty dollars a month modest enough but for him a fortune in 1836 poe married virginia clemm she was thirteen he was twenty seven he said she was twenty one he called her his darling little wifey i was a child and she was a child in this kingdom by the sea but we loved with a love that was more than love i and my annabel lee poe held the job at the messenger for only sixteen months he boasted that under his editorship the magazine s circulation grew from seven hundred to fifty five hundred but as the poe scholar terence whalen has discovered this was another lie the magazine had thirteen hundred subscribers when poe started and eighteen hundred when he left poe lied about the messenger s circulation because he was attempting to forge a career in the world of magazine publishing during very troubled economic times and plainly he was a very troubled man quarrelling with the publisher of the messenger poe left the magazine and in february of 1837 moved to new york the new yorker a weekly magazine edited by rufus griswold welcomed him praising his work at the messenger harper brothers was just about to publish his novel the narrative of arthur gordon pym the account of a nantucket seafarer his voyages involve whaling mutiny shipwreck sharks cannibalism letters written in blood cryptic ethiopian characters and an island of treacherous black people with black teeth whose chief is named too wit unfortunately poe arrived in new york just in time for the panic of 1837 with all that paper money speculators had gone wild in the west there had been a land grab and in the east a housing bubble in new york real estate values had risen a hundred and fifty per cent when the crash came early in the van buren presidency bankruptcies swept the nation in new york riots erupted as the swelling ranks of the city s poor broke into food shops down with the panic makers one newspaper warned promising a bright sun will soon dispel the remaining darkness but the skies didn t brighten in april one new yorker wrote in his diary wall street the blackness of darkness still hangeth over it failure on failure by the fall of 1837 nine out of ten eastern factories had closed five hundred desperate new yorkers turned up to answer an ad for twenty day laborers to be paid at the truly measly wage of four dollars a month pym failed too poe s publisher had tried to pass the novel off as an authentic travel journal even as its author left a trail of clues to the hoax pym being for instance an anagram of imp this didn t go over especially well one reviewer called the book an impudent attempt at humbugging the public poe did not write another novel he moved to philadelphia and wrote more short stories during the seven year depression that followed the panic whalen has shown poe wrote a tenth as many poems and twice as many tales he insisted that this was an aesthetic choice any piece of truly worthy writing must be able to be read at a sitting in order to achieve a single dramatic effect the nevermore ish end with which poe said every work of art must begin the tale he believed affords the best prose opportunity for display of the highest talent maybe but writing a book was exactly the kind of long term investment poe could not afford to make especially with so little prospect of return in the eighteen twenties books cost on average two dollars during the depression that price fell to fifty cents poe had started writing gothic stories before the economy collapsed but as a man without independent means he was especially vulnerable to market forces and he knew it that s probably why he worked so hard at appearing so otherworldly so romantic he tried to deduce from careful study what sold best and concluded the history of all magazines shows plainly that those which have attained celebrity were indebted for it to articles similar in nature to berenice gothic stories supernatural tales set often in medieval ruins had been popular for decades they were fun to write on a rainy day as mary shelley had discovered and even more fun to parody as jane austen found out both frankenstein and northanger abbey were published in 1818 when poe was in england the genre had since gone to seed but it still sold well a philosophy of composition no what poe developed was a philosophy of the literary marketplace he had little choice the general market for literary wares is in a state of stagnation he reported during one of the worst years of the depression the problem with poe comes to this he needed to turn his pen to profit but he also wanted to signal as with pym that he was lowering himself look see i m brilliant even at writing dreck in the story how to write a blackwood article 1838 he tells of an aspiring writer of gothic tales who visits the editor of blackwood s magazine seeking instruction your writer of intensities must have very black ink and a very big pen with a very blunt nib the editor advises then offers some examples of recent successes
the phase 1 trade deal with china that president trump signed this week is unlike any previous free trade agreement from trump s point of view that s the whole point we are righting the wrongs of the past trump said wednesday during a white house signing ceremony and delivering a future of economic justice and security for american workers farmers and families but by requiring china to buy specific amounts of goods from the u s the deal is raising concerns that it moves away from a free market arrangement to a more managed style of trade like earlier agreements the 96 page deal does call for lowering some trade barriers in china it opens a door for u s financial services for example and clears the way for china to buy more american beef dairy products and pet food but the agreement leaves many other trade barriers in place including stiff tariffs on two thirds of everything the u s buys from china according to oxford economics the average tariff on chinese imports is now 19 3 up from just 3 before the trade war began it s kind of a hidden tax said angela carr whose turbie twist company imports popular hair towels from china sometimes people because it s called a tariff i think are led to believe that perhaps china is paying for this when in fact the cost is going to be carried by either the consumers the retailers or the small businesses or all three the deal also aims to narrow the u s trade deficit with china by requiring that beijing boost its purchases of u s goods and services by more than 50 over the next two years what s to me very important number one they re going to be spending much more than 200 billion trump said the agreement sets specific targets for china to purchase a long list of farm goods manufactured products energy and services the only way for china to reach its commitments is to resort to soviet style managed trade wrote gary hufbauer a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics in a blog post hufbauer called the purchase requirements a worrisome and radical change after decades in which both republican and democratic administrations called on china to act more like a market economy allowing competition to drive purchasing decisions it is a big reversal of how the u s has tried to do business for the last 40 or 50 years hufbauer said in an interview china sharply reduced its purchases of american farm goods during the trade war the phase 1 deal seeks to more than make up for that boosting agricultural sales by 32 billion over the next two years compared to 2017 levels farmers enjoyed their best sales ever to china in 2012 but darci vetter who was the chief agricultural trade negotiator for the u s during the obama administration said she never tried to set a numerical target what u s farmers and ranchers told me they wanted was really the opportunity to form long term relationships with partners in china and to do so on a market basis vetter said trade is relationships and we re not looking for selling a lot of products to china for the next two years we re looking for a relationship that will endure some observers are skeptical that china will actually buy as much from the u s as the agreement calls for at the white house signing ceremony vice premier liu he said his country s purchases would increase naturally as a result of economic growth as the living standard of the chinese people rises we will import fine quality agricultural products from countries across the world liu said through an interpreter he stressed that imports would be based on the market demand in china if market demand is soft china might have to scale back purchases from other countries in order to meet its pledge to buy more from the united states those countries will be very unhappy hufbauer said that china is essentially diverting its purchases which were based somewhat on market principles to prefer u s exports trump has no qualms about the prospect of displacing china s other trading partners including u s allies such as canada or the european union at long last americans have a government that puts them first trump said the eu warned this week that europeans could bring a complaint to the world trade organization if the phase 1 deal puts them at an unfair disadvantage trump s top trade negotiator robert lighthizer said the china deal doesn t violate wto rules or compromise any other country s trading rights like the president lighthizer prefers to negotiate with other countries one on one rather than working through the international trading system that the u s helped to create if you re the biggest economy in the world you re far better off with bilateral agreements you ve got more leverage lighthizer said if you re switzerland you re better off working through a group and trying to get a coalition if you re the united states you don t need to copyright 2020 npr to see more visit

2019 r parthibhan the associated press abhijit banerjee is professor of economics at mit esther duflo is professor of poverty alleviation and development economics at mit they are co founders and co directors of the abdul latif jameel poverty action lab j pal at mit and with michael kremer the winners of the 2019 nobel prize in economics one of the most worrying news stories of 2019 did not receive the coverage one might expect from media outlets in north america but the economic slowdown in china and the potentially steep deceleration in growth in india will most likely receive considerably more attention in 2020 the international monetary fund the asian development bank and the organisation for economic co operation and development have downgraded their growth estimates for india in 2019 20 to around 6 per cent which would be the lowest since the beginning of the decade others claim that even this is optimistic and project much more dire narratives for example arvind subramanian until recently the indian government s chief economic adviser has argued based on triangulating evidence on various economic indicators that growth may sink as low as 3 5 per cent in china gdp growth has slowed from 14 2 per cent in 2007 to 6 6 per cent in 2018 the imf projects that it might fall to 5 5 per cent by 2024 rapid growth there and in india has lifted millions out of poverty and the slowdown is likely to impede progress on improving the lives of the poor what should china and india do or rather what should they not do when we were writing our book good economics for hard times in 2018 before the bad news about india started coming out we were already concerned about a potential downturn there the slowdown in china was already known anticipating the fall in growth we warned that india should fear complacency the point we were making is simple in countries that start from a situation in which resources are being used badly as in china under communism or india did in its days of extreme dirigisme the first benefits of reform may come from moving resources to their best uses in the case of indian manufacturing firms for example there was a sharp acceleration in technological upgrading at the plant level and some reallocation toward the best firms within each industry after 2002 this appears to be unrelated to any changes in economic policy and has been described as india s mysterious manufacturing miracle but it was no miracle just a modest improvement from a rather dismal starting point one can imagine various reasons why it happened perhaps it resulted from a generational shift as control passed from parents to children often educated abroad more ambitious and savvier about technology and world markets or maybe the accumulation of modest profits eventually made it possible to pay for the shift to bigger and better plants or maybe both causes and others played a role more generally perhaps the reason why some countries such as china can grow so fast for so long is that they start with a lot of poorly used talent and resources that can be harnessed to more valuable activities but as the economy sheds its worst plants and firms and solves its most dire misallocation issues the space for further improvement naturally shrinks growth in india similar to that in china had to slow and there is no guarantee that it will slow only when india has reached the same level of per capita income as china india may be caught in the same middle income trap that ensnared malaysia thailand egypt mexico and peru the trouble is that countries find it hard to kick the growth habit there is a risk that policymakers will flail wildly in their quest to make growth come back the recent history of japan should serve as a useful warning if japan s economy had maintained the growth rate that it recorded over the decade 1963 73 it would have overtaken the u s in terms of gdp per capita in 1985 and in overall gdp by 1998 what happened instead is enough to make one superstitious in 1980 the year after harvard s ezra vogel published japan as number one the growth rate crashed and never really recovered for the entire period 1980 2018 japan s real gdp grew at an anemic 0 5 per cent average annual rate there was a simple problem low fertility and a near complete absence of immigration meant japan was and is aging rapidly the working age population peaked in the late 1990s and has been declining at an annual rate of 0 7 per cent ever since and will continue to decline moreover during the 50s 60s and 70s japan was catching up after the disaster of the pacific war with its well educated population gradually being deployed to its best possible uses by the 80s that was over in the euphoria of the 70s and 80s many people in japan and abroad convinced themselves that japan would nonetheless sustain rapid growth by inventing new technologies which probably explains why the high investment rate in excess of 30 per cent of gdp continued through the 80s too much good money chased too few good projects in the bubble economy of the 80s as a result banks ended up with many bad loans which led to the huge financial crisis of the 90s growth ground to a halt at the end of the lost decade of the 90s japanese policymakers might have started to realize what was happening and what they had to lose after all japan was already a relatively wealthy economy with much less inequality than most western economies a strong education system and many important problems to address chief among them being how to ensure a decent quality of life for its rapidly aging population but the authorities appeared unable to adjust restoring growth was a matter of national pride as a result successive governments vied to devise a series of stimulus packages spending trillions of dollars mostly on roads dams and bridges that served no obvious purpose perhaps predictably the stimulus did nothing to increase economic growth and led to a huge increase in the national debt to some 230 per cent of gdp in 2016 by far the highest among the group of 20 countries and a possible harbinger of a massive debt crisis the lesson for policymakers in china and india is clear they must accept that growth will inevitably slow china s leaders are aware of it and have made a conscious effort to manage public expectations accordingly in 2014 president xi jinping talked about a new normal of 7 per cent annual growth rather than 10 per cent or more but it is not clear that even this projection is realistic and in the meantime china is embarking on enormous global construction projects which doesn t necessarily bode well the key ultimately is not to lose sight of the fact that gdp is a means and not an end it is a useful means no doubt especially when it creates jobs or raises wages or plumps the government budget so that it can redistribute more but the ultimate goal remains to raise the average person s and especially the worst off person s quality of life and quality of life means more than just consumption most human beings care about feeling worthy and respected and they suffer when they feel that they are failing themselves and their families while living better is indeed partly about being able to consume more even very poor people also care about their parents health about their children s education about having their voices heard and about being able to pursue their dreams higher gdp is only one way to achieve this and there should be no presumption that it is always the best one many of the important development successes of the past few decades were the direct result of a policy focus on this broader notion of well being even in some countries that were and have remained very poor for example a massive reduction in under five mortality has occurred even in some very poor countries that were not growing particularly fast largely thanks to a focus on newborn care vaccination and malaria prevention this brings us back to the slowdown in india and china there is a lot that policymakers in both countries can still do to improve the welfare of their citizens and help us cling to some hope about our planet s future a myopic focus on increasing the rate of gdp growth could squander that chance copyright project syndicate 2019
what recent trade wins mean for south dakota by u s sen mike rounds r s d as any south dakota farmer or rancher will tell you having a market to sell their products is vitally important to the success of their operations in south dakota we produce some of the highest quality crops and meat in the world however trade uncertainty coupled with low commodity prices and poor weather conditions has made life difficult for ag producers after years of being at the tip of the spear in ongoing trade disputes south dakota s farmers ranchers and manufacturers saw some major victories in recent weeks that will begin to reestablish and grow markets for them to sell their products i recently had the privilege of joining president trump at the white house for the signing of phase one of the u s china trade agreement under this agreement china will purchase at least 40 billion dollars of additional u s ag products the phase one agreement comes at an especially good time for american pork producers african swine fever has killed millions of pigs in china driving up demand for pork products exported from the u s we still have more to do to make sure china lives up to its obligations under the deal including stopping them from stealing our intellectual property and technologies and phase one is the first step in that process i recently cast my vote in favor of the u s mexico canada usmca trade deal which passed the senate with broad bipartisan support after months of delays by house speaker nancy pelosi it will replace the 26 year old north american free trade agreement nafta the usmca will give south dakota s farmers ranchers and manufacturers greater opportunities to sell their products in mexico and canada two of our nation s closest allies and our top trading partners trade with our north american neighbors supports 37 700 jobs in south dakota and in 2018 our state exported 924 million of goods and ag products to canada and mexico under the usmca canada will revise its grain grading policies to treat u s wheat in a way that is no less favorable than that it accords to like wheat of national origin this will level the playing field for south dakota wheat farmers by not allowing either country to have country of origin on wheat quality certificates finalizing the usmca will also provide us with better leverage to negotiate fair deals with other countries around the world it now awaits action in canada s parliament before it can go into effect these trade wins come on the heels of the unilateral trade agreement we made with japan which took effect at the beginning of january the u s japan agreement paved the way for more sales of american beef and other agricultural products additionally the european union trade negotiator recently called for a reset on trade talks with the u s so we can work to increase our markets in europe this progress is important for south dakota farmers ranchers and manufacturers who have dealt with trade instability for far too long senate republicans and president trump have remained focused on advancing policies that will help to grow the economy and so far the economy in nearly all sectors aside from agriculture has improved the stock market has reached record highs we ve cut taxes for american families including costly obamacare taxes and rolled back thousands of burdensome duplicative regulations that slowed business growth i believe that finalizing trade agreements that give farmers and ranchers a fair deal for their products is one of the final pieces of the puzzle that will allow the economy to reach its full potential free and fair trade is critical for our producers we are making significant progress toward securing better fairer trade deals for south dakota s ag community than what they ve had in the past
a senior american diplomat began a four day official visit to pakistan on january 19 amid warming bilateral relations that have followed meetings last year between president donald trump and pakistani prime minister imran khan the principal deputy assistant secretary alice wells is scheduled to discuss with senior government officials in islamabad issues related to bilateral and regional concerns she will also hold meetings with civil society representatives during her stay in the country according to a pre trip u s announcement the visit is part of a ten day regional tour that has already taken wells to sri lanka and india it comes a couple of days after pakistani foreign minister shah mehmood s trip to washington where he held talks with u s secretary of state mike pompeo and national security advisor robert o brien enjoyed meeting with pakistani foreign minister smqureshipti today we discussed countering iranian aggression the afghan peace process trade ties and regional stability pompeo tweeted after his talks with qureshi on january 17 the warmth in long close and turbulent u s pakistan relations stemmed mainly from islamabad s cooperation in facilitating washington s peace talks with taliban insurgents aimed at bringing an end to the war in afghanistan the trump administration last month announced it would soon resume international military education and training imet programs for young pakistani army officers u s officials say they are also working together with counterparts in islamabad to boost bilateral trade and commercial ties we expect our bilateral relationship to continue to mature to one more focused on trade than aid and we are continuing to target investments in ways that help improve the overall business climate a state department spokesperson told voa in an email she noted there is much room to grow the current 6 6 billion annual bilateral trade relationship adding washington looks forward to working together with islamabad on energy and agricultural exports in 2020 the trump administration sees the u s pakistan relationship as one of potential she added we have made clear that fulfilling that potential requires progress on our joint efforts to bring stability to afghanistan and on pakistan taking sustained and irreversible action against the militant groups and terrorist groups that destabilize the region from its soil the spokesperson stressed pakistan hails imet the imet was a part of u s security assistance for pakistan worth some 2 billion that trump suspended in january 2018 to press islamabad to crackdown on militant groups on its soil and help in afghan peace building efforts the overall security assistance remains suspended however u s officials maintain the resumption of imet administered by the state department was meant to boost military to military cooperation between the two countries to advance our shared priorities of regional security and stability through concrete actions u s decision to revive imet is one more step in the right direction and reflective of our growing bilateral relationship pakistani foreign ministry spokesperson aisha farooqui noted in her official reaction farooqui emphasized however the two countries needed to work for a broad based and enduring relationship based on mutual trust and mutual respect washington credits islamabad with helping to facilitate u s negotiations with the afghan taliban mostly held in qatar to help bring an end to the 18 year old conflict america s longest u s officials have long alleged the taliban insurgency has organized itself militarily and logistically on pakistani soil with covert support from the neighboring country s military islamabad rejects the charges latest round of meetings between u s and taliban negotiators underway in the qatari capital of doha are said to have brought the two adversaries on the verge of signing a peace deal khan sort of trump of pakistan republican senator lindsey graham a close trump ally has also called for offering more economic incentives to pakistan to encourage it to do more to bring stability to afghanistan graham noted after his last month s visit to islamabad that pakistani leadership wants an end to the afghan war to promote national and regional peace prime minister khan is a different kind of politician in many ways he is sort of trump of pakistan so we got a magic moment here where we could persuade pakistan to do things differently and give them an economic incentive they never had before to do things differently graham told reporters after his last month s visit to islamabad senator mushahid hussain who heads the foreign affairs committee of the upper house of pakistani parliament says washington s emphasizes on broadening bilateral ties beyond afghanistan and security related cooperation will go a long way in resetting relations between the two nations we welcome this american initiative as it doesn t view pakistan from the prism of geopolitics rather the focus is on people centric development this augurs well for future as it means 2020 will be promising for pakistan american relations hussain told voa michael kugelman the deputy director asia program at the wilson center in washington expects the trajectory of bilateral relations will be tied to the trajectory of u s led afghan peace efforts pointing to the turbulent history of the u s pakistan partnership recent decades have seen a consistent pattern in u s pakistan relations washington frames its relationship with islamabad through the lens of afghanistan while islamabad seeks to get the u s to adjust that lens so that it looks at pakistan through the lens of pakistan alone observed kugelman but regardless of the fate of afghan peace process critics say the u s china trade and political tensions are likely to weigh heavy also on u s pakistan relations while beijing has traditionally maintained close defense partnership with islamabad the two neighboring allied nations have in recent years deepened economic cooperation under china s trillion dollar global belt and road initiative bri roughly 30 billion in chinese investment including soft loans and grants has built or building highways power plants special economic zones gwadar deep water arabian sea port and an airport there the investment has come under the bilateral collaboration known as the china pakistan economic corridor cpec a flagship of bri u s officials are critical of both cpec and the bri in a recent statement wells said that the infrastructure development projects are burdening struggling economies like pakistan with expensive chinese loans that ultimately will turn into debt trap for recipient nations islamabad and beijing reject the criticism as unfounded and politically

does fighting climate change mean wrecking the economy that s the question my editor posed to me about a year ago it has been the focus of my reporting ever since the rhetoric from climate change skeptics suggests it would president donald trump has made canceling obama era greenhouse gas regulations a central part of his tenure economic rationales are always front and center meanwhile democratic presidential candidates say they will create millions of jobs by transforming the energy system to carbon free sources job killer or job creator leaving aside for the moment the fact that climate change is already imposing enormous costs that are only becoming worse i went looking for answers in massachusetts wyoming and colorado here s some of what i learned it s not simple and much remains to be seen 1 where steps have been taken the economy has kept growing take massachusetts for example the bay state passed the global warming solutions act in 2008 calling for an 80 reduction in greenhouse gases from 1990 levels by 2050 massachusetts requires power plants to pay for their carbon dioxide emissions the state was among the first to require power companies to generate a certain portion of their electricity from renewable sources the government offers rebates and incentives for renewable energy energy efficiency electric vehicles and more greenhouse gas emissions have come down by 17 from 2008 to 2017 in the state meanwhile massachusetts economy has continued to grow the state s total output went up by 19 in that period outperforming u s economic expansion as a whole by 3 in that time frame employment went up in massachusetts by 9 the state has invested in growing a clean energy economy jobs in renewable energy energy efficiency and related areas have grown by 86 since 2010 and now make up more than 3 of the state s workforce it s hard to know though to what extent the state s climate policies were responsible for either the greenhouse gas reductions or economic growth from 2008 to 2017 carbon emissions went down in every state but six idaho nebraska north dakota mississippi texas and washington gdp shrank in just four states connecticut louisiana nevada and wyoming that s largely because cutting carbon has become much easier to do with the rise of natural gas and renewable power 2 some of the most significant greenhouse gas reductions have happened not because of state policies but because of dramatic shifts in energy markets the biggest factor lowering carbon dioxide emissions nationwide is that natural gas has replaced coal as the main fuel for electric power plants burning natural gas generates the same amount of energy with half the carbon dioxide emissions as coal the price of natural gas has plunged as drilling technology has made the united states the world s leading producer that has helped drive a wave of fuel switching at power plants across the united states coal generation fell 40 from 2008 to 2017 while natural gas climbed 47 renewable energy is growing quickly but it still makes up a small portion of the power supply wind generated just 6 5 of the nation s electricity last year solar produced 2 2 wind and solar are starting to give fossil fuels serious competition though after dramatic cost declines over the last decade these sources are now significantly cheaper than coal and often cheaper than natural gas even without subsidies they need to replace fossil fuel generation much faster however in order to take a serious bite out of emissions 3 some good jobs are going away dealing with the changes is not easy powering the nation is not the job it used to be coal once generated more than half the nation s electricity coal mines and power plants are mostly unionized the jobs pay well and provide good benefits for workers without a higher education coal mining however employs 42 fewer workers than in 2011 more than 300 coal burning power plants have closed or are slated to be shuttered there are growing opportunities in renewable energy and energy efficiency the solar industry employed 242 000 people in 2018 for example about 45 000 more than the coal industry the jobs are not equivalent many solar installation jobs are not unionized don t pay as well and have fewer benefits than those for people working at coal plants and a solar farm doesn t need many workers once it s built while a coal plant can steadily employ hundreds workers hurt by the energy transition are a small part of the overall economy but coal mines and power plants tend to be in rural areas without much else in the way of industry when these jobs go away the pain is localized but intense some policymakers are trying to blunt the impacts last year colorado was one of several states that passed laws aimed at cutting greenhouse gas emissions and included provisions for a just transition job retraining economic development aid and other measures to help workers and communities find a life after fossil fuels 4 no one is doing enough the plunge in coal fired power helped the united states cut its emissions by an estimated 2 1 in 2018 since 2005 emissions are down 12 3 but the united states pledged to cut greenhouse gases at least 26 by 2025 under the u n paris climate agreement emissions must go down by 2 8 per year on average to hit that target it s not impossible experts say but it s a stretch the trump administration is moving policy in the opposite direction aiming to weaken fuel economy standards for vehicles approving construction of a new oil pipeline from canada and vowing to shore up america s coal industry meeting the paris pledge is not enough however scientists say the world needs to get to zero carbon emissions by 2050 to stave off a climate disaster almost no one is on track to do so unless cost effective carbon capture technology appears soon natural gas will have to go transportation the largest source of u s greenhouse gases will have to go electric or hydrogen or biofuel much much faster than it is and someone will have to figure out what to do about emissions from energy intensive industries like glass steel aluminum and concrete does fighting climate change mean wrecking the economy not necessarily but the steps taken so far will not stop the climate impacts we re already seeing from becoming much worse can we stop climate change before it s too late no one has all the answers yet but something must be done each new climate related disaster shows the cost of inaction is mounting

bloomberg opinion it s hard being a liberal these days the world seems to want to go in the opposite direction authoritarianism is on the rise in china mercantilism in the u s populism everywhere from brazil to the philippines and an oxymoronic illiberal democracy in hungary and poland liberals seem particularly irrelevant in the two biggest debates of our time about inequality and global warming the first has left wing demagogues baying once again to soak the rich in a new round of class warfare the second has spooked the loony right into denying the problem and indeed science and the loony left into flight shaming suv shaming and just shaming generally reminiscent of france s jacobins in 1793 or china s red guards in 1966 what s become almost inaudible in these two controversies is an older and more dignified voice liberalism by this i don t mean its risible and opposite caricatures in the u s and europe in american usage a liberal is a big government lefty who sees society through the lens of identity politics in left wing european parlance a liberal or worse neoliberal is a free market fundamentalist liberalism is neither it s a broad and flexible philosophy that values individual freedom liber is latin for free that s why liberals distrust concentrations of power that might oppress us often such power is found in the state which is why liberals prefer limited government other times it s found in companies mafias or mobs in which case liberals oppose those with regulation and laws but liberals are a pragmatic bunch too rising to the new challenges of each era the liberal approach to inequality it s in fact liberals who ve grappled at the highest intellectual level with inequality if you want to think deeply about justice as fairness you could do worse than open the book of that title by john rawls if you want the best answer to rawls read robert nozick his former colleague and sparring partner down the hallway at harvard university story continues what liberals since john locke the patriarch of the tradition have agreed on is that you need property to be free invariably some people will end up with more than others rawls would say that s fine as long as everybody benefits including the worst off nozick would respond that it s fine even if they don t as long as those who get more have earned it legitimately it s a mistake moreover to look at the distribution of wealth or income only at one point in time yesterday s haves could turn into tomorrow s have nots and vice versa all as a result of life choices luck skill or effort inequality becomes problematic only when the same people or the same families across generations keep ending up at the top or bottom no matter what they do in a free and fair society social mobility is therefore more important than the distribution of wealth and equality of opportunity trumps equality of outcomes that s why some liberals can live with inheritance taxes which are assessed a single time on an estate to prevent the accumulation of vast riches across generations by contrast they frown on wealth taxes which now seem to be back in fashion not only are those intrusive and hard to assess year after year they also miss the point which is as jeremy bentham put it in 1795 to make the poor richer not the rich poorer in ensuring equal opportunity however there really is a lot of work to be done at least outside of scandinavia that includes assuring equal access to education and health care in both areas the u s in particular has a problem which is why it s losing its reputation as a land of opportunity a fascinating twist is a new iteration of an old idea called the universal basic income the state could pay everybody irrespective of achievement or need a stipend on the face of it you d expect liberals to be against that and many are doesn t it sound like big government and wouldn t people simply stop working but consider the full idea a basic income wouldn t complement but completely replace the existing welfare state as it exists in its full bureaucratic insanity no more fraud or endless administration since everybody gets the benefit automatically a basic income would thus radically simplify and possibly shrink the leviathan a well designed basic income moreover would be too meager to allow recipients to live luxuriously so you d still need to earn your livelihood if it s to be a good one but the state provided cash could get you through periods of sickness or education including adult retraining as the economy becomes digital and seeks new skills it could to use the key word free you to fulfill your individual potential yet we need empirical data how would people respond and would they stop working how much would it cost unfortunately the few places that have conducted experiments have done it wrong you can t for instance just pay a few unemployed people as finland did because that s not a universal income for now the jury s out from liberalism to planetism liberals have also thought deeply about climate change long before it even became a threat it s just that they ve used different names for that type of problem such as market failure and the tragedy of the commons if individuals use a resource they believe to be infinite because it doesn t seem to have a price they will overuse it until it s ruined this explains why people overfish the oceans or why a public bathroom stinks whereas your one at home doesn t our atmosphere is in danger of becoming the most tragic commons ever we keep consuming stuff without heed to the greenhouse gases we and our products emit along the way because we cannot see the cost of the emissions we cause the liberal answer is therefore to make that hidden cost of carbon visible and force all of us to pay it there are two ways of doing that and in principle it doesn t matter which you choose you could set the price of carbon with a tax on it and observe how much that reduces the quantity of emissions or you could fix the quantity of emissions by selling allowances then observe what that does to the price of carbon this takes the form of an emissions trading system several places already have such a system including the european union but until now these markets haven t covered enough sectors of the economy or restricted the allowances enough to make the carbon price really hurt the biggest promise of the eu s green deal now in the works is that it plans to expand its emissions trading and make carbon quite expensive the signal of a much higher carbon price would quickly percolate through the whole economy influencing all our decisions companies would invest in technology to make their factories cleaner homeowners may find they can save money by retrofitting their heating systems businesspeople may take the train instead of the plane or may skype instead of traveling at all i might even stop skiing once i factor in the costs of my journey and of the regrettably necessary snow machines the advantage of this approach is that all these decisions would still be decentralized that is taken by free individuals other approaches out there by contrast involve different forms of central planning and those are the bad ideas in europe s green deal these include subsidies to homeowners and companies favoring particular technologies and rationing shaming or even banning specific behaviors such as flying government isn t good at deciding say whether future cars should run on fuel cells batteries or something else or whether electricity is best generated from wind sun or something else and central bankers certainly have no business steering money to greener uses all such steps would distort the allocation of capital and deprive people of freedom whether the topic is inequality the climate trade migration data privacy or almost anything else it s a pity that liberals and liberal parties don t have a bigger voice in policy today as others turn toward collectivism and the politics of resentment whether it s nationalism or socialism or green authoritarianism liberals should be more confident in presenting our philosophy of freedom as the better alternative it would be a liberalism adapted to the needs of our planet for want of a better label let s call it planetism to contact the author of this story andreas kluth at akluth1 bloomberg

boycotting oil and gas firms in africa is a misguided course of action many are diversifying into renewables africa s time to grow is here and its natural resources are a part of that in a 2014 article archbishop desmond tutu of south africa argued for an apartheid style boycott on coal oil and gas companies as a way to fight climate change and help ensure global environmental sustainability goals we must stop climate change and we can if we use the tactics that worked in south africa against the worst carbon emitters he wrote climate change is something to be rightfully concerned about but although tutu s sentiment is laudable it is also misguided oil and gas companies are not autocratic regimes focused on oppressing the people and steal their resources they are businesses boycotting oil and gas companies will not have an impact on carbon emissions but will raise the price of fuel in the long run that is not the intended goal oil and gas companies are increasingly diversifying their portfolios to include renewable energy assets many of them are at the forefront of research and development of new technologies to help develop renewable resources they are also transitioning into energy companies and are even rebranding with equinor formerly statoil being the most evident example who else is better prepared better funded and better placed to drive the energy transition we all seek demonizing energy companies is not a constructive way forward and ignoring the role that carbon based fuels have played in driving human progress distorts the public debate we cannot expect african nations which together emitted seven times less co2 than china last year and four times less than the us according to the global carbon atlas see figure below to undermine their best opportunities for economic development by simply aligning with the western view of how to tackle carbon emissions gabriel obiang lima equatorial guinea s minister of mines and hydrocarbons summed it up decisively to the press last week during africa oil week in cape town under no circumstances are we going to be apologising he said anybody out of the continent saying we should not develop those fields that is criminal it is very unfair while a few nations across the african continent have been producing hydrocarbons for decades these resources have mostly been exported to fuel industrial development in europe the us and asia the reasons for this are varied and have as much to do with the european colonial legacy as with the lack of existing financial resources and expertise to develop local economies over the last century we must remember that nearly half of all africans still don t have access to electricity and that nearly every company in the continent struggles with the lack of power reliability which raises operational costs reduces productivity and hurts their ability to compete in international markets as i have argued and championed for years african nations are finally starting to make use of these resources to develop their own national economies today natural gas is by far the most economically sustainable way of producing power in enough quantities to fuel economic development spot the continent image global carbon atlas the african development bank has estimated that between 130 and 170 billion a year until 2025 would be needed to close the infrastructure gap across the continent how are african nations to fund these fundamental developments if they give up on exploring their natural resources how can the western world or anyone for that matter demand that african nations leave these resources underground when it was these same resources that powered economic development everywhere else after decades of colonial occupation and subsequent political and military in fighting many african regions have now reached the level of stability that will allow them to build working functioning economies the fuel for that will be these countries natural resources be it oil gas coal or diamonds boycotting the companies that can help these countries develop these resources would be paramount to economic suicide this is not to say that environmental sustainability and climate change should not be at the top of the list of concerns when debating the african energy sector but it should inform environmental impact assessment policies and foster best practices in the industry not put a stop to it discover what is the world economic forum on africa show more with elections taking place in more than 20 african countries in 2019 the world s youngest continent is facing a new era held under the theme shaping inclusive growth and shared futures in the fourth industrial revolution the 28th world economic forum on africa will convene more than 1 000 regional and global leaders from government business civil society and academia the event held 4 6 september 2019 will explore new regional partnerships and entrepreneurial and agile leadership to create pathways for shared prosperity and drive a sustainable future loading participants will discuss ways to accelerate progress on five transformative pan african agendas in the context of the fourth industrial revolution addressing the african union s agenda 2063 priorities read more about the forum s impact in africa and our launch of a new africa growth platform to scale the region s start ups for success read our guide to how to follow af19 across our digital channels we encourage followers to post share and retweet by tagging our accounts and by using our official hashtag become a member or partner to participate in the forum s year round annual and regional events contact us now yes renewable energy sources can have a role in contributing to expand electrification in africa and solar and wind power have become competitive when compared to carbon based generation but that will always depend on the resources available in each region and will always have to be supported by other forms of generation capacity that can overcome the issue of intermittency that follows renewable power generation africa s time to grow and develop is finally here and it will be funded by its natural resources misguided moral lessons from the west will do little to change that because the financial resources coming from these activities are crucial and irreplaceable in a somewhat ironic way even if africa wanted to stop using fossil fuels and shifted every power station to renewable sources it would still be forced to develop its oil and gas fields in order to fund that transition
lagos about a year ago dolapo oni appeared to have it all he was the head of energy research for a pan african bank in nigeria s biggest city had a healthy and growing amount of savings and investments and ran an e commerce business on the side he even liked his local gym thank you for reading this post don t forget to subscribe then he resigned and moved with his family to canada eventually getting a job as an investment associate in a wealth management firm in calgary his previous employer in lagos promoted someone to replace him soon after but like oni he quit and moved to calgary this time rather than search for another replacement the bank disbanded the energy research team in some ways oni s story and that of his successor in lagos is not unusual a skilled professional leaves a job at home in search of work in wealthier parts of the world betting that the short term instability of uprooting an established life will be worth it in the long term the onis are part of an ongoing exodus of middle class nigerians to canada in particular nigeria ranks in the top 10 in terms of the number of skilled workers leaving for canada over the past four years the sparsely populated north american country has long been a favored destination of immigrants around the world because it offers economic opportunities a strong social safety net and a diverse population more recently the nigeria to canada route has had another driver one that is propelled both by ottawa s doing and abuja s undoing whereas the political and economic situation in nigeria has not improved many of these immigrants have mostly been drawn by a tweak to canadian immigration rules in 2015 canada implemented a new system for taking in skilled immigrants using a points based calculation in which applicants are scored on the basis of their age work experience education level and language skills it aims to prioritize those who are most skilled and ease their entry into the country while encouraging applicants to settle in less populated parts of canada australia and new zealand use similar systems and british prime minister boris johnson fresh off an electoral victory in december has said he wants to implement one too canada s however is the most advanced according to the organization for economic cooperation and development the country has the most elaborate and longest standing skilled labour migration system of its member states and 60 percent of its foreign born population is highly educated the highest proportion in the organization now canada is expanding its effort the immigration minister ahmed hussen who himself moved to canada in 1993 as a refugee from somalia announced in 2018 that the country wanted to attract more than 1 million people from 2019 to 2021 equivalent to nearly 3 percent of the overall population the transparency of the system canadian government websites outline how many points are awarded for specific skills experience or other criteria lets potential immigrants see whether they could make the cut oni told me that once he had decided to emigrate he had wanted to move to britain canada or the u s in that order but prioritized canada because the visa terms were less stringent and added that he was dissuaded from the u s because of persistent reports of gun violence and police shootings of black men read the philosophical differences on immigration between canada and the u s here in nigeria to say that the middle class has caught canada fever would be an understatement the subject of moving overseas has become a conversational icebreaker in lagos port harcourt and abuja the best place to have a heart attack in toronto one joke here goes is in a taxi because the driver is likely an immigrant doctor an entire economic system has emerged to help applicants navigate the bureaucracy online marketplaces are well stocked with used furniture and cars being sold by those making the move in terms of emotional support family whatsapp groups are filled with relocation tips and prayers for those applying when i started taking french lessons a couple of years ago to help navigate west africa not to move to canada many of my classmates had signed up in order to garner additional points to bolster their applications and to improve their chances of securing a job in quebec where french is the dominant language all of this reached a crescendo in april 2019 when a news website claimed that canadian prime minister justin trudeau had asked nigerian president muhammadu buhari to send 1 million nigerians to canada the story which was false went viral in effect then thanks to a tweak to an immigration system in a richer country a developing one has suffered serious consequences losing skilled professionals many of whom are highly educated and would be expected to make outsize contributions to a state s economy tax income and society more broadly in nigeria the conveyor belt of young talent that is supposed to replace those who are emigrating is whirring slowly and the impact is apparent the country s educational institutions groan under the weight of frequent strikes by underpaid staff protesting poor funding and outdated infrastructure medical procedures are regularly delayed because of a shortage of specialists and companies like oni s bank are closing down entire departments to cope with staff exits middle class nigerians much like citizens of other developing countries argue that they are leaving to give their families more options and greater security rather than waiting for their own country to realize its potential it is a familiar story what is now africa s largest economy is no stranger to the departure of its best talents in the 1970s and 80s skilled and semi skilled nigerians left the country mostly for the united states britain and elsewhere in europe fleeing the rule of successive military juntas and economic mismanagement a 2010 report by the migration policy institute a washington d c based think tank found that by the late 1970s about 30 000 nigerian professionals had graduated from universities and colleges in the united kingdom but never returned to africa by the mid 80s 10 000 nigerians were in the united states many of them highly skilled that brain drain had a knock on effect opening a route for these immigrants relatives to leave nigeria as well nigerians today face similar challenges though the country is now a democracy it is still smarting from a 15 month recession in the early years of buhari s presidency insecurity is also rife northeastern nigeria is grappling with a decade long insurgency while a kidnapping epidemic is under way in the northwest and the niger delta the nigerian government itself appears unperturbed by the outbound migration of its professionals the labor minister chris ngige told journalists last year that the country was exporting its best minds because it had a surplus of talent and in any case when they go abroad they earn money and send back home here canada gets skilled workers who are productive and contribute more to economic activities than they consume nonso obikili the chief economist at nigeria s businessday newspaper told me and he reiterated that nigerians abroad were sending remittances to relatives back home a crucial source of revenue for the country all these skilled workers are not totally cutting off links with nigeria eromo egbejule is the west africa editor of the africa report
china will negotiate with american companies and increase imports of us goods and products according to market principles an official with its state planner said yesterday the united states has high quality supply in the fields of energy manufactured goods agricultural products medical care and financial services said meng wei spokesperson for china s national development and reform commission at a press conference yesterday china will boost purchases of us goods and services by us 200 billion hk 1 56 trillion over two years in exchange for the rolling back of some tariffs under an initial trade deal between the world s two largest economies chinese vice premier liu he who signed the trade deal with us president donald trump last week said the deal would not affect third parties interests apparently in reference to deals made with other suppliers of farm goods chinese companies will import us agricultural goods according to consumers need and demand and supply in the market liu told reporters according to cctv meanwhile china s central bank injected 200 billion yuan hk 226 47 billion into the market through 14 day reverse repos at an interest rate of 2 65 percent yesterday the move aimed at maintaining liquidity in the banking system at a reasonably sufficient level before the spring festival according to a statement on the website of the people s bank of china a reverse repo is a process in which the central bank purchases securities from commercial banks through bidding with an agreement to sell them back in the future in addition china s state planner said that it had approved 157 fixed asset investment projects in 2019 worth a total 1 33 trillion yuan national development and reform commission spokeswoman meng wei told a news conference that china s economy has the foundations to continue to operate stably in 2020 separately chinese manufacturers offered the biggest support to the country s economic stabilization in the last three months of 2019 thanks to easing trade tensions and improving global demand output in industrial enterprises rose 5 9 percent from the same period in 2018 the national bureau of statistics said on saturday bouncing back from an almost decade low of 5 percent in the prior quarter manufacturers accounting for more than 85 percent of total industrial output grew 5 9 percent in the quarter from 4 8 percent previously recording the biggest increase since data was available the data adds to evidence that chinese factories struggling with higher tariffs deflationary prices and maturing debt saw demand improve toward the end of 2019 boosted by a turnaround in the global outlook
this earnings season the canadian stock market will have to prove it deserves to be trading at record highs investors largely ignored a downturn in corporate profits through the first three quarters of 2019 en route to the best calendar year for canadian equities in a decade a solid result from fourth quarter earnings reports will go a long way to justifying the stock market s winning streak said mike archibald associate portfolio manager at agf investments the market is going to want to see that there is actually some operational momentum with canadian companies and i expect you re going to see that he said with global financial conditions looking more stable and the united states and china agreeing to a kind of truce over tariffs and trade corporate canada is poised to set up a more favourable earnings outlook for 2020 with a strong finish to 2019 results for the final quarter of 2019 will start flowing over the next couple of weeks in canada with rogers communications inc reporting this wednesday and the major railways reporting next week earnings per share for companies in the s p tsx composite index are forecast to rise by 8 7 per cent over the same quarter last year that would be the strongest quarterly reading since the third quarter of 2018 according to refinitiv data back then a potent mix of negative forces was building in the global economy the trade war between the u s and china a slowdown in the world economy a global manufacturing recession and low oil prices all weighed heavily on the performance of canada s biggest companies as the earnings malaise extended through 2019 investors still found reasons to be bullish beyond the bottom line money poured into defensive stocks and sectors with generous dividends after a synchronized easing of monetary policy by global central bankers sent interest rates plunging now with the global growth scare fading into the background at least for the time being the canadian corporate sector is also showing signs of stabilizing profits generated by s p tsx composite index companies are forecast to rise by nearly 8 per cent for the full calendar year with improvement expected in nearly every sector the one big exception is the financials sector which is responsible for generating nearly half of all s p tsx composite index profits financials are forecast to post 4 7 per cent earnings growth for 2020 down from 7 7 per cent last year the big banks in particular have come under scrutiny lately amid restructuring charges slowing loan growth and rising credit losses we ll see if there are more writedowns and charges or if they took their medicine and have now set up some better comparables for 2020 said ryan bushell president and portfolio manager of toronto based newhaven asset management but the pessimism toward the banks which are trading near trough valuations offers a certain measure of protection mr bushell said i think there is a catch up trade in the canadian banks assuming we don t get some sort of domestic calamity the same logic in fact applies to the entire canadian stock market which trades at a sizable discount to its u s counterpart at a current price to earnings ratio of about 18 times against 25 times and a forward price to earnings ratio of about 15 5 times against 19 times for estimated earnings for 2020 that starts to make the canadian stock market look a little bit more attractive as long as you can get some momentum in earnings in the commodity sectors mr archibald said the materials sector is primed to do its part with fourth quarter earnings growth forecast at 17 per cent largely as a result of the recent surge in gold prices and even the battered canadian energy sector is seeing some encouraging signs the organization of the petroleum exporting countries recently agreed to deepen cuts to crude oil production while u s shale drilling is slowing dramatically higher oil prices should help canadian energy stocks realize 4 7 per cent growth in fourth quarter earnings while energy is only about 10 per cent of the market now you ve got a very good case for them to move higher in 2020 mr bushell said
opinions of sunday 19 january 2020 columnist dr muazu ibrahim what is incontrovertible is that in the midst of the hues and cry and the propaganda the management of the cedi under nana addo and dr bawumia has been the best for any first three years of any government within their first term since 1992 follow the data here to appreciate how the bank of ghana and this government has protected the local currency better don t fall for the propaganda from those who have deliberately decided to attack dr bawumia and government without adducing any data to back their claims we should as ghanaians be wise and expose people who are only just interested in attacking others even when they are doing better like him or hate him dr bawumia has been one of the finest brains and doers we have had at the seat of government since 1992 human as he is just like everyone with limited efficiency levels he may not have met all expectations by ghanaians but truly his exploits in government within the last three years have just shown a man who is incorruptible hardworking focused intelligent respectful and dedicated to his duties we should just pray for good health and long life for such personalities within our body polity ghana can only get better with personalities like him the data shows that from 2017 to date 3 years the cedi has depreciated by an average of 8 73 this compares favourably with 27 95 for 1993 1996 25 19 for 1997 2000 11 04 for 2001 2004 6 77 for 2005 2008 10 09 for 2009 2013 18 0 for 2013 2016 what does the data tell you first in terms of the three year annual average depreciations from 1992 to date both the best and second best performances are for npp governments with the best being president kufuor s second term from 2005 2008 and the second best with president akufo addo from 2017 to date but if you look at it from the point of the first term of every government too you will see the first term of president akufo addo has witnessed the best performance of the cedi relative to the dollar quite telling from the data i just shared is that the worst performance of the cedi happened under the ndc our economic history and in fact the history of all economies that practice the floating exchange rate regime such as the usa great britain south africa and so on show that exchange rates within such regimes may either appreciate or depreciate for highly import dependent and raw material based economies like ghana depreciation seems virtually a sine qua non and this has been the case for all the periods that ghana has practiced the floating exchange rate regime therefore before we are able to have a strong export led economy increase our industrial and production sectors deal with the excesses of black market forex trades have a diversified national debt portfolio with a sizable component owned by locals amongst others the best our governments can do is to manage the currency to reduce the speed and rate of its depreciation in the light of this i think this government has done well and we should simply acknowledge that while tapping on their head to do more interestingly while the cedi is presently gaining grounds relative to the dollar those complaining about the depreciation of the cedi are silent about it a colleague recently had a discussion with his friend from the opposition side about the recent gains of the cedi while his friend from the opposition admitted the cedi was appreciating he added that i m actually not happy the rate isn t good for my transfer he was clearly highlighting that with the appreciation of the cedi the transfer of dollars he is receiving from abroad isn t much compared to periods the cedi was depreciating his arguments were based on his partisan politics and egoistic benefits without focusing on the positive impact of the cedi appreciation on the welfare of the larger populace if we all put the political lenses down we will simply have to appreciate the efforts made by this government to reduce the rate of depreciation i will urge them to continue and remind them also that like oliver twist we will continuously ask for more but so far so good more room for improvement it is simply better than before and that is what all voters want we vote for a change for improvement even if it is not up to our expectation the fact that there is improvement gives us the hope that with time it will be better keep on president akufo addo keep on dr bawumia keep on bank of ghana and do more for all ghanaians
so i say to my wife i ve been asked to write about happiness peaking when we hit 47 2 years of age she stares at me like she s waiting for a punchline then shakes her head because i m about to hit 47 2 i say in case she had forgotten that we recently celebrated my 47th birthday a team of economists have worked it out there is an uncomfortable pause my wife shakes her head again and says gently no 47 2 is when you hit peak misery it s been all over the papers have you not been reading them i was going to send you the links but i didn t want you to have some sort of meltdown this is devastating information i feel a little like pg wodehouse s freddie widgeon who experienced the sort of abysmal soul sadness which afflicts one of tolstoy s russian peasants when after putting in a heavy day s work strangling his father beating his wife and dropping the baby into the city s reservoir he turns to the cupboards only to find the vodka bottle empty view image in fullscreen improved wellbeing has been linked to the number of daily portions of fruit and vegetables photograph istetiana getty images far from being happy i am wallowing in the slough of despond with hindsight the signs that i am gripped by a midlife crisis were all too obvious the incessant running to the point of exhaustion the appearance in the bathroom of a certain type of shampoo that should miraculously turn my hair a lustrous brown the urgent need to repeatedly punch myself in the face when i hear politicians like barry gardiner or iain duncan smith on the today programme the decision to read jordan b peterson s 12 rules for life twice in the same month my fate is sealed it s hard to argue otherwise not in the face of the voluminous research carried out by the eminent economist professor david blanchflower who studied data from 132 countries as he gauged the relationship between wellbeing and age blanchflower is the go to expert on happiness by my calculation since the millennium he has written at least 20 papers on the subject he and professor andrew oswald money sex and happiness an empirical study which found that found that sexual activity appears to have greater effects on the happiness of highly educated people than on those with low levels of education the thought provoking is psychological wellbeing linked to the consumption of as does eating more fruit and vegetables also with oswald which linked rises in happiness and mental health to the number of daily portions of fruit and vegetables and with another academic david bell the provocative the scots may be brave but they are neither healthy nor happy which found the wellbeing of scots lower than that of the english or the welsh view image in fullscreen professor david blanchflower identified the u shaped happiness curve in his 2007 research photograph bloomberg getty images what is striking about all this work is its consistency blanchflower first identified a u shaped happiness curve in a paper published in 2007 which found that wellbeing reaches a minimum on both sides of the atlantic in people s mid to late 40s one point from blanchflower s studies is that no matter where you are money can t buy you happiness his latest work carried out when unemployment is at historic lows in many countries confirms this he pinpoints 47 2 as the age of peak unhappiness in the developed world and 48 2 in developing nations the curve s trajectory holds true in countries where the median wage is high and where it is not and where people tend to live longer and where they don t blanchflower says in the study published by the national bureau of economic research but this is not to say that our wellbeing is independent of external events the onset of the great recession following the banking crisis of 2008 seems to have particularly impacted the prime age and especially those with low levels of education blanchflower 67 told me via email from key west where the temperature was 27c and he described himself as happy in the us he says the academics angus deaton and anne case have documented deaths of despair especially relating to these groups from suicide and drug poisonings blanchflower s work suggests when people are at their least happy but not why attempts to bridge this gap to meld the fields of economics and psychology became fashionable shortly after the millennium and then bled into the political world since 2005 the organisation for economic co operation and development has published its how s life survey which charts the wellbeing of people in 41 countries in 2007 the economist richard layard was made the uk s happiness tsar the next year the french president nicolas sarkozy asked the rock star economists amartya sen joseph stiglitz and jean paul fitoussi to find alternatives to gdp as a measure of a country s health the idea was revived last year when the new zealand prime minister jacinda ardern pledged her government would put wellbeing at the centre of its budgets view image in fullscreen social media can make young people feel anxious but they have more energy photograph thomas barwick getty images while blanchflower believes politicians now understand the need to take happiness seriously he fears they do not appreciate their role in its delivery they are getting happiness more but i think we need to understand that politicians imposed failed reckless austerity which broke down social ties even more as the west endures an explosion of depression and loneliness society must look itself in the mirror says blanchflower who thinks the keys to happiness are friends family and a supporting community it seems society does value happiness more these days but not enough we are having an explosion of depression and loneliness in the us pain is up even though 100 billion pain meds are distributed according to the washington post if blanchflower s work is correct politicians keen on improving wellbeing need to prioritise middle aged people which seems counter intuitive given the pressures facing younger people today as layard writes in today s observer new review the rise in competitiveness has been made much worse by the advent of social media which have encouraged self advertisement and made more young people feel inadequate anxious depressed and left out but there are compensations for being young blanchflower argues young people have more energy and fewer responsibilities he emailed the exclamation mark revealing the fervour with which he holds this belief he has a theory as to why we hit a nadir in our 40s life seems to get complex and it is a struggle to strike out on your own this strikes a chord before my 40s i had few cares life was simple and many places schools hospitals doctors surgeries creches nurseries playgrounds were alien to me now that i have a child a wife and elderly relatives to consider life is a shuttle between these places i have a job that has resolutely plateaued for the past two decades and thanks to familial responsibilities a squeezed disposable income i crave sleep my body is disintegrating i spend my time obsessing about air pollution and knife crime and gradually something is dawning on me i will never represent my country in any sport no one is going to be calling me from sweden with an invitation to collect a nobel gregg and john are never going to say to me mate that was an awesome tiramisu and yet there is something hopeful in blanchflower s u shaped curve and its promise that after 47 2 lies a better tomorrow as blanchflower says once you get there i think you get more realistic and happier indeed if i have learned anything as i hit the age of 47 2 it can be summarised in the observation of frank bascombe the main character aged 44 in richard ford s the sportswriter for your life to be worth anything you must sooner or later face the possibility of terrible searing regret though you must also manage to avoid it or your life will be ruined i believe i have done these two things faced down regret avoided ruin and i am still here to tell about it
by jay ambrose you almost felt sorry for them the six democratic presidential candidates having their last debate before the iowa caucuses the subject of president donald trump s razzle dazzle historically stunning economy came up what were they to do concede its accomplishments demonstrate ignorance mouth falsehoods or respectably indulge in fine tuned analysis granting the obvious while pointing to shortcomings and possible improvements joe biden quickly skipped the analysis option less like a thoughtful statesman than like king kong thumping his chest he roared that working and middle class people were being clobbered they re being killed he said he had support across the board on this emphatic stance and could hardly wait to debate trump differences with others wouldn t end there however a cnn poll shows a 19 year high 76 percent of the american people believe the economy is either very good or a least somewhat good after all as varied online magazine articles point out millions of jobs have been created under trump and unemployment is the lowest in a half century just 3 5 percent which is essentially no unemployment if you want a job send an email or knock on a door people who had given up hope and were sitting at home are getting back in the hunt african americans have experienced their lowest unemployment in history and people without college degrees have the lowest unemployment rate in nearly 20 years the economist stephen moore tells us wages have been going up four times faster than what we saw in the slow walk obama recovery but guess what apparently paying more attention to biden than to those in the know elizabeth warren who is worth 12 million said the economy was working only for those at the top not for anyone else in lower tones with more nuance pete buttigieg said something similar biden worth something like 9 million agreed the wealthy were the only ones doing well tom steyer the only billionaire in the room seemed on board and noted he was giving his money away bernie sanders the owner of three homes did not say he was giving two away but hissed about the greed and corruption of the corporate elite who are actually doing more for america than the political elite running for president what s reported is that income increases during the trump boom have been greatest at the bottom income level the new median household income of 66 000 is the highest in history meaning the middle class is probably grinning instead of being killed and clobbered as an example of those in tough situations getting significant boosts it has been noted that single parent mothers have seen their pocket books swell by 7 6 percent the poverty rate meanwhile is the lowest in decades trump helped make such good things happen through individual tax cuts boosting consumer confidence and also a corporate tax cut it invites investments to our country makes us more competitive with low taxed european corporations brings back money to our shores and unleashes corporations to advance their cause by such means as increasing wages the stated aim of the candidates was mostly to raise taxes on corporations and the wealthy that will slow down the boom while failing to finance ruinously expensive new programs that will increase a massive threatening debt that is just maybe trump s greatest failing lumping all six of these candidates together as if they are one would be absurd of course and amy klobuchar for instance separates herself from the others with a seeming attachment to common sense analysis but most have opposed every good move trump has made such as lessening illegal immigration and thereby affording more jobs to citizens already here or deregulating to the point of capitalism almost being capitalism again a sparkling economy with jobs conferring dignity is crucial to a long list of desired societal ends far more important for the overall public good than ever bigger government usurping our initiative trying to control more than it can ever understand and diminishing our liberty jay ambrose speaktojay aol com is an op ed columnist for tribune news service his commentary was distributed by tribune content agency

islamabad a senior american diplomat began a four day official visit to pakistan sunday amid warming bilateral relations that have followed meetings last year between president donald trump and pakistani prime minister imran khan the principal deputy assistant secretary alice wells is scheduled to discuss with senior government officials in islamabad issues related to bilateral and regional concerns she will also hold meetings with civil society representatives during her stay in the country according to a pre trip u s announcement the visit is part of a ten day regional tour that has already taken wells to sri lanka and india it comes a couple of days after pakistani foreign minister shah mehmood s trip to washington where he held talks with u s secretary of state mike pompeo and national security advisor robert o brien enjoyed meeting with pakistani foreign minister smqureshipti today we discussed countering iranian aggression the afghan peace process trade ties and regional stability pompeo tweeted after his talks with qureshi on friday the warmth in long close and turbulent u s pakistan relations stemmed mainly from islamabad s cooperation in facilitating washington s peace talks with taliban insurgents aimed at bringing an end to the war in afghanistan the trump administration last month announced it would soon resume international military education and training imet programs for young pakistani army officers u s officials say they are also working together with counterparts in islamabad to boost bilateral trade and commercial ties we expect our bilateral relationship to continue to mature to one more focused on trade than aid and we are continuing to target investments in ways that help improve the overall business climate a state department spokesperson told voa in an email she noted there is much room to grow the current 6 6 billion annual bilateral trade relationship adding washington looks forward to working together with islamabad on energy and agricultural exports in 2020 the trump administration sees the u s pakistan relationship as one of potential she added we have made clear that fulfilling that potential requires progress on our joint efforts to bring stability to afghanistan and on pakistan taking sustained and irreversible action against the militant groups and terrorist groups that destabilize the region from its soil the spokesperson stressed pakistan hails imet the imet was a part of u s security assistance for pakistan worth some 2 billion that trump suspended in january 2018 to press islamabad to crackdown on militant groups on its soil and help in afghan peace building efforts the overall security assistance remains suspended however u s officials maintain the resumption of imet administered by the state department was meant to boost military to military cooperation between the two countries to advance our shared priorities of regional security and stability through concrete actions u s decision to revive imet is one more step in the right direction and reflective of our growing bilateral relationship pakistani foreign ministry spokesperson aisha farooqui noted in her official reaction farooqui emphasized however the two countries needed to work for a broad based and enduring relationship based on mutual trust and mutual respect washington credits islamabad with helping to facilitate u s negotiations with the afghan taliban mostly held in qatar to help bring an end to the 18 year old conflict america s longest u s officials have long alleged the taliban insurgency has organized itself militarily and logistically on pakistani soil with covert support from the neighboring country s military islamabad rejects the charges latest round of meetings between u s and taliban negotiators underway in the qatari capital of doha are said to have brought the two adversaries on the verge of signing a peace deal khan sort of trump of pakistan republican senator lindsey graham a close trump ally has also called for offering more economic incentives to pakistan to encourage it to do more to bring stability to afghanistan graham noted after his last month s visit to islamabad that pakistani leadership wants an end to the afghan war to promote national and regional peace prime minister khan is a different kind of politician in many ways he is sort of trump of pakistan so we got a magic moment here where we could persuade pakistan to do things differently and give them an economic incentive they never had before to do things differently graham told reporters after his last month s visit to islamabad senator mushahid hussain who heads the foreign affairs committee of the upper house of pakistani parliament says washington s emphasizes on broadening bilateral ties beyond afghanistan and security related cooperation will go a long way in resetting relations between the two nations we welcome this american initiative as it doesn t view pakistan from the prism of geopolitics rather the focus is on people centric development this augurs well for future as it means 2020 will be promising for pakistan american relations hussain told voa michael kugelman the deputy director asia program at the wilson center in washington expects the trajectory of bilateral relations will be tied to the trajectory of u s led afghan peace efforts pointing to the turbulent history of the u s pakistan partnership recent decades have seen a consistent pattern in u s pakistan relations washington frames its relationship with islamabad through the lens of afghanistan while islamabad seeks to get the u s to adjust that lens so that it looks at pakistan through the lens of pakistan alone observed kugelman but regardless of the fate of afghan peace process critics say the u s china trade and political tensions are likely to weigh heavy also on u s pakistan relations while beijing has traditionally maintained close defense partnership with islamabad the two neighboring allied nations have in recent years deepened economic cooperation under china s trillion dollar global belt and road initiative bri roughly 30 billion in chinese investment including soft loans and grants has built or building highways power plants special economic zones gwadar deep water arabian sea port and an airport there the investment has come under the bilateral collaboration known as the china pakistan economic corridor cpec a flagship of bri u s officials are critical of both cpec and the bri in a recent statement wells said that the infrastructure development projects are burdening struggling economies like pakistan with expensive chinese loans that ultimately will turn into debt trap for recipient nations islamabad and beijing reject the criticism as unfounded and politically motivated
