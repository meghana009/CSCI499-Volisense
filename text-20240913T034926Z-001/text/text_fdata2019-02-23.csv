partners to evaluate potential gold opportunities in west africa and sweden substantially all of centerra s revenues are derived from the sale of gold and copper the company s revenues are derived from gold and gold copper concentrate production from its mines and gold and copper prices realized upon the sale of these products gold doré production from the kumtor mine is purchased by kyrgyzaltyn jsc kyrgyzaltyn a kyrgyz republic state owned refinery and significant shareholder of centerra for processing at its refinery in the kyrgyz republic while gold and copper concentrate produced by the mount milligan mine in canada is sold to various smelters and off take purchasers the mount milligan mine in canada is subject to a streaming arrangement whereby rgld gold ag and royal gold inc collectively royal gold is entitled to purchase 35 of the gold and 18 75 of the copper produced from the mount milligan mine for 435 per ounce of gold delivered and 15 of the spot price per metric tonne of copper delivered the mount milligan streaming arrangement the company s costs are comprised primarily of operating costs at the kumtor and mount milligan mines and the langeloth molybdenum processing facility project development costs at the öksüt gold project the kemess project and the greenstone gold property care and maintenance costs at the company s molybdenum mines endako mine and thompson creek mine exploration expenses relating to the company s own projects and its earn in projects administrative costs from offices worldwide and depreciation depletion and amortization dd a there are many operating variables that affect the cost of producing an ounce of gold and a pound of copper in the mine unit costs are influenced by the ore grade and the stripping ratio the stripping ratio is the ratio of the tonnage of waste material which must be removed per tonne of ore mined ore grade refers to the amount of gold and or copper contained in a tonne of ore the significant costs of mining include labour diesel fuel and equipment maintenance at the mill costs are impacted by the ore grade and the metallurgical characteristics of the ore which can impact gold and copper recovery for example a higher grade ore would typically result in a lower unit production cost the significant costs of milling are labour energy grinding media reagents consumables and mill maintenance mining and milling costs are also affected by the cost of labour which depends mostly on the availability of qualified personnel in the region where the operations are located the wages in those markets and the number of people required mining and milling activities involve the use of many materials the varying costs of acquiring these materials and the amount used in the processing of the ore also influence the cash costs of mining and milling the non cash costs namely dd a are influenced by the amount of capital costs related to the mine s acquisition development and ongoing capital requirements and the estimated useful lives of capital items the company s 2018 production costsng at its two operating mines totaled 598 million compared to 592 million in 2017 production costs at kumtor were 2 2 higher than 2017 368 million in 2018 compared to 360 million in 2017 the increase reflects the impact of higher mining costs especially for diesel fuel higher input prices and consumption at mount milligan production costs in 2018 were 230 million similar to 2017 reflecting higher labour and environmental consulting costs offset by lower drill and blast costs over the life of each mine another significant cost that must be planned for is the closure reclamation and decommissioning of each operating site in accordance with standard practices for international mining companies centerra carries out remediation and reclamation work during the operating period of the mine where feasible in order to reduce the final decommissioning costs nevertheless the majority of rehabilitation work can only be performed following the completion of mining operations centerra s practice is to record the estimated final decommissioning costs based on conceptual closure plans and to accrue these costs according to the principles of ifrs kumtor has established a reclamation trust fund to pay for these costs from the revenues generated over the life of the mine as required by canadian provincial laws and us federal and state laws the company has provided reclamation bonds for mine closure obligations at its canadian and u s sites the company reports the results of its operations in u s dollars however not all of its costs are incurred in u s dollars as such the movement in exchange rates between currencies in which the company incurs costs and the u s dollar also impact reported costs of the company economic indicators gold price the average quarterly gold spot price of 1 229 in the fourth quarter of 2018 was slightly above the

inclusive of the currency hedging cost of 0 3 million 1 2 million gain for the year ended december 31 2017 a photo accompanying this announcement is available at diesel fuel prices one of the more significant movements in commodity prices in 2018 was the decline in the west texas intermediate wti and brent crude oil prices in the last quarter of the year according to the u s energy information administration brent crude oil prices averaged 71 bbl in 2018 ending the year at 54 bbl a decrease of 13 bbl from the end of 2017 wti crude oil prices averaged 65 bbl in 2018 ending the year at 45 bbl

movements of brent crude oil the purchase price for diesel fuel for kumtor in 2018 increased 26 when compared to 2017 averaging 0 53 l for the year kumtor sources its fuel from russia either directly or through kyrgyz distributors kumtor s diesel prices include additional costs such as seasonal premiums for winterizing the diesel fuel and transportation costs from the russian refineries the

consumption resulting from increased haulage distances this was partially offset by lower maintenance cost on the haul trucks and the liebherr shovels in 2018 as compared to 2017 lower camp catering costs and benefits from continuous improvement initiatives a photo accompanying this announcement is available at milling costs amounted to 67 3 million in 2018 compared to 66 7 million in 2017 due to higher carbon fines processing costs 2 3 million which activities only commenced in 2018 and higher mill reagents carbon and cyanide costs 1 8 million resulting from a higher consumption rate and higher grinding balls costs due to higher mill throughput these were partially offset by lower maintenance costs 3 3 million resulting from decreased activities in 2018 site support costs 2018 compared to 2017 site support costs in 2018 totalled 51 7 million compared to 45 1 million in the comparative year this increase is attributable to camp charges which ceased to be allocated to mining and milling activities starting in 2018 partially offset by lower insurance premiums other cost movements depreciation depletion and amortization dd a associated with sales increased to 154 6 million in 2018 from 145 7 million in the comparative period mainly due to higher amortization of capitalized stripping associated with the early release of high grade ore from cut back 18 all in sustaining costs on a by product basis per ounce soldng which excludes revenue based tax was 694 in 2018 compared to 698 in 2017 the decrease was mainly due to lower capitalized stripping costs and decreased sustaining capital expenditures partially offset by fewer ounces sold including revenue based taxes all in sustaining costs on a by product basis per ounce soldng was 869 in 2018 compared to 874 in the comparative year the decrease was mainly due to lower all in sustaining costsng explained above and lower revenue based taxes resulted from decreases sales revenue in 2018 mount milligan mine the mount milligan mine is an open pit mine located in north central british columbia canada producing a gold and copper concentrate production at mount milligan is subject to the mount milligan streaming arrangement pursuant to which royal gold is entitled to purchase 35 of the gold produced and 18 75 of the copper production at the mount milligan mine for 435 per ounce of gold delivered and 15 of the spot price per metric tonne of copper delivered developments in 2018 on december 27 2017 the company reported that due to a lack of sufficient water resources mill processing operations at the mount milligan mine had been temporarily suspended mill processing operations resumed at partial capacity in february 2018 utilizing one ball mill to manage water requirements the mill s second ball circuit resumed operation in march 2018 after a build up of sufficient water in the tailings storage facility tsf although the mill continued to operate at reduced capacity until the spring melt following the spring melt mount milligan steadily improved mill throughput as additional water became available and improvements were made to the milling and maintenance processes water update as noted earlier starting in the fourth quarter of 2018 mount milligan reduced its milling throughput to properly manage its water balance during the winter season the company expects that the mill will return to a more normalized throughput following the onset of the 2019 spring melt in the second quarter in late 2018 the company initiated a groundwater exploration drilling program at mount milligan in december 2018 a five hole 567 metres phase 1 scout drilling program was conducted east and north of the tailing storage facility this program followed up results from nuclear magnetic resonance nmr and transient electromagnetic tem geophysical surveys completed between august and november 2018 that were designed to support water well targeting efforts for mill operations three of the five drill holes in two target areas alpine lake and lower rainbow produced low flow water indicating good potential as areas for water well development mount milligan continues to seek approvals to access more sources of water in the medium and long term the company has already obtained approvals to i pump from groundwater wells within mount milligan s tsf as well as from a single groundwater well outside of the tsf for the entire life of mine and ii pump up to 15 of the base flow from philip lake until april 30 2019 in addition the company expects to receive significant volumes of additional water from a number of sources philip lake rainbow creek meadows creek and additional ground water sources within a radius of approximately 6 kilometres of the tsf to that end the company has made applications to further amend its environmental assessment certificate as well as water license applications to enable drawing of water from such sources at rates that are protective of the environment the company continues its discussions with regulators first nations and other affected stakeholders regarding these applications and is seeking to have the amendments remain valid through september 2021 the approvals would enable the company to benefit from spring melt flows for three seasons while a long term updated water supply plan is developed with respect to the updated long term water supply plan the company has retained a consultant to develop a methodology to assess water sources that are best able to supply water to the mill for life of mine while meeting environmental and other parameters formal applications and government review of that methodology is expected to commence shortly and will be the subject of discussion with regulators first nations and other interested parties the company s expectation is that its updated long term water source or sources will be available from and after 2021 for the entire life of mine see caution regarding forward looking

the mount milligan streaming arrangement royal gold will pay 435 per ounce of gold delivered and 15 of the spot price per metric tonne of copper delivered payable production for copper and gold reflects estimated metallurgical losses resulting from handling of the concentrate and payable metal deductions subject to metal content levied by smelters the current payable percentage applied is approximately 95 for copper and 97 5 for gold which may be revised on a prospective basis after sufficient history of payable amounts is determined revenue in 2018 revenues totalled 263 0 million compared to 368 9 million mainly as a result of lower sales volumes for gold and copper and a lower realized gold price 971 oz compared to 1 003 oz total revenue from gold was 173 5 million in 2018 178 882 oz sold compared to 242 9 million 242 331 oz sold in 2017 total revenue from copper was 89 5 million 44 4 million lbs sold in 2018 compared to 125 9 million 59 7 million lbs in 2017 there were ten shipments in 2018 compared to thirteen shipments in 2017 mainly due to the reduced mill operating levels in the first quarter 2018 production during 2018 mining activities focused on continued development of phases 3 and 4 in the open pit with the majority of ore mined from phase 3 and an increasing percentage of ore from phase 4 throughout the year the majority of waste mined through the year was from phase 4 overburden stripping in phase 8 continued to expose the first mining benches for development with drilling and blasting of rock initiated in the fourth quarter of 2018 total waste and ore mined in 2018 was 33 2 million tonnes and total tonnes moved was 35 8 million compared to 42 0 million tonnes and 44 5 million respectively in 2017 mine production for 2018 was lower than the comparative year primarily due to overall lower mill throughput through the year total mill throughput was 13 6 million tonnes in 2018 compared to 17 7 million tonnes in 2017 during 2018 mill throughput averaged roughly 37 000 tonnes per calendar day 47 000 tonnes per operating day compared to 49 000 tonnes per calendar day 54 000 tonnes per operating day in 2017 reflecting the temporary mill shutdown in january 2018 processing with only one ball mill from early february 2018 to march 2018 the gradual ramp up during the spring melt unplanned downtimes in july and september and operating at a reduced throughput level from october 2018 to december 2018 to properly manage the water balance during the winter season during 2018 total payable gold and copper production was 194

sales basis ng including standby costs in the 2018 was 176 4 million compared to 209 7 million in 2017 operating costs in the fourth quarter of 2018 were lower than the same quarter of 2017 mainly due to lower sales volumes the movements in the major components of operating costs mining milling and site support before changes in inventory is explained below a photo accompanying this announcement is available at mining costs totalled 57 1 million in 2018 which was 6 4 million lower than 2017 the decrease in costs for 2018 includes lower drill and blast supplies cost 4 7 million due to the impact of a reduced powder factor higher capital allocation to the tailings facility 2 4 million due to higher mining costs per tonne lower maintenance costs 2 1 million resulting from timing in mining fleet rebuilds and the termination of a long term maintenance management agreement lower tire costs 0 9 million resulting from extended tire life due to improved road conditions this was partially offset by higher in pit drilling services costs 2 5 million associated with long term mine planning process improvements and higher diesel costs 1 2 million due to higher prices a photo accompanying this announcement is available at milling costs including standby costs of 10 8 million totalled 95 6 million in 2018 compared to 95 9 million in 2017 the slight decrease in operating costs was due to lower electricity costs 5 3 million resulting from lower mill throughput and lower milling consumable costs 1 5 million due to lower production this was partially offset by higher maintenance cost 3 0 million associated with primary and pebble crusher repairs higher labour costs 2 6 million due to an increase in manpower with the addition of a maintenance night shift crew and higher water sourcing costs 0 5 million attributed to additional water supply other cost movements site support costs in 2018 totalled 44 1 million compared to 41 2 million in 2017 the increase in site support costs includes higher labour costs 2 4 million due to increased manpower higher consultants costs 2 2 million associated with water permitting this was partially offset by lower cost of royalties 2 9

2018 16 9 million pounds of molybdenum oxide was roasted 9 lower than in 2017 due in part to the timing of concentrate purchases which were more significant at the end of 2018 and resulted in a 15 increase in unroasted concentrates at year end toll roasted and upgraded molybdenum was 18 higher in 2018 than 2017 due to increased demand for upgraded molybdenum oxide a total of 15 7 million pounds of molybdenum were sold and 5 6 million pounds were tolled during 2018 resulting in sales revenue of 206 3 million the company s average molybdenum sale price for 2018 was 12 85 per pound compared to 9 43 per pound in 2017 this increase largely accounts for the 44 increase in molybdenum sales revenue in 2018 versus 2017 also contributing was a 5 increase in unit sales volume versus 2017 reflecting increased purchased volume of molybdenum in concentrates during the year an increase in reclamation expenses of 51 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018 mainly from a requirement for additional processing to treat water at thompson creek mine the underlying water treatment reclamation provision at thompson creek mine is over a 100 year period with the initial water treatment plant

items impacting the fourth quarter of 2018 as compared to 2017 gold production for the fourth quarter of 2018 increased 33 to 288 367 ounces poured including 228 096 ounces from kumtor and 60 271 ounces from mount milligan the 44 increase in ounces poured at kumtor is primarily due to processing higher grade and recovery ore from cut back18 stockpiles compared to the remaining lower grade stockpiled ore from cut back 17 and the sarytor pit processed in the same quarter of 2017 during the fourth quarter of 2018 kumtor s average mill head grade was 5 49 g t with a recovery of 87 5 compared to 3 76 g t and a recovery of 80 4 in the fourth quarter of 2018 of 2017 in the fourth quarter of 2018 mount milligan produced 26 861 dry metric tonnes dmt of concentrate containing 11 8 million pounds of copper and 60 271 ounces of gold compared to 28 158 dmt containing 12 3 million pounds of copper and 58 587 ounces of gold in the fourth quarter of 2017 lower mining rate in the fourth quarter of 2018 was primarily due to lower processing levels resulting from the water inventory management strategy revenues in the fourth quarter of 2018 increased 9 to 391 5 million reflecting higher sales volumes at kumtor and at mount milligan for both gold and copper and significantly higher sales from the molybdenum business due to higher molybdenum prices partially offset by lower average realized gold and copper prices ng as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 cost of sales for the fourth quarter of 2018 increased 28 to 232 2 million compared to the same quarter of 2017 the increase reflects higher sales volumes for gold copper and molybdenum as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 regional administration costs decreased to 4 1 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 from 5 8 million in the comparative quarter as a result of lower employee costs due to a restructuring of the management team at the end of 2017 corporate administration costs decreased by 1 4 million as compared to the same period of 2017 as a result of lower legal consulting and employee costs in the fourth quarter of 2018 an increase in reclamation expenses of 41 8 million was recorded mainly for additional water treatment requirements at the thompson creek mine exploration expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2018 totalled 6 5 million compared to 4 7 million in the comparative period of 2017 reflecting increased drilling activities in the current quarter the company accrued a 21 3 million tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to the enactment of the u s tax cuts and jobs act which reduced the applicable u s corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 and repealed the alternative minimum tax see overview of consolidated results cash provided

product inventory of 389 3 million 2017 298 9 million and supplies inventory of 209 4 million 2017 209 0 million the consolidated increase year over year of 90 7 million is all attributable to product inventories and reflects increases at kumtor of 42 8 million 23 8 million at mount milligan both due to the timing of shipments and 23 6 million at the langeloth processing facility due to the timing of receipt of molybdenum feed material property plant and equipment the aggregate book value of property plant and equipment at december 31 2018 was 1 9 billion which compares to 1 7 billion at the end of 2017 the increase in 2018 of 211 6 million is mainly due to the acquisition of aurico including the kemess project which added 206 million the further spending in 2018 at öksüt of 46 3 million and the removal of the mongolian assets which reduced capitalized assets by roughly 40 million asset retirement obligations the total future asset retirement obligations were estimated by management

total asset retirement obligations to be 212 4 million as at december 31 2018 2017 167 0 million the significant increase in 2018 reflects changes in reclamation costs mainly for water treatment at the thompson creek mine as a result of the company s decision in 2018 not to pursue the final development phase of the mine given the current molybdenum price environment the increase also includes the recognition of additional closure costs at the kemess project acquired in january 2018 the removal of the mongolian provision as a result of the sale of the business unit and impacts from regul
saturday nigeria decides chika amanze nwachuku chronicles the political trajectory of incumbent president muhammadu buhari his first term performance and his bid for a second term born on december 17 1942 in daura katsina state muhammadu buhari a retired major general was nigeria s head of state from december 31 1983 to august 27 1985 as a military head of state buhari was regarded as an incorruptible disciplinarian who would spare no one in his war against corruption and indiscipline his perceived firm stance against corruption which dates back to his 20 month stint as a military leader propelled him to international prominence indeed the launch of war against indiscipline which was aimed to promote positive values in nigerian society boosted his public image and catapulted him to sudden fame however his government was overthrown by major gen ibrahim babangida in another coup d etat in august 1985 his ambition to become a democratically elected president of nigeria came to limelight in 2003 when he contested for the office of the president under the platform of all nigeria peoples party anpp he won only 32 2 of the total votes and was defeated by the then incumbent president olusegun obasanjo of the people s democratic party pdp he again contested in 2007 and 2011 under the same anpp platform but lost to the ruling pdp candidates umaru yar adua now late and dr goodluck jonathan respectively the good luck charm third time lucky did not work in his favour yet he never gave up despite losing three elections in 2014 he was nominated by the all progressives congress apc as its candidate in the 2015 presidential election a total of 14 candidates vied for the number one office but the real contest was between pdp s candidate goodluck jonathan who also was the incumbent president and buhari in what was adjudged as the most keenly contested election ever buhari defeated the incumbent president jonathan having won by a significant margin of 2 5 million votes this marked the first time in the history of nigeria that an incumbent president lost to an opposition candidate in a general election he was sworn in on may 29 2015 as 15th president of nigeria and fourth president in the fourth nigerian republic prior to his assumption of office the nigerian economy was already in a bad shape as the price of oil had fallen from highs of about 112 a barrel in 2014 to below 50 at the moment following the consistent drop in prices of crude nigerian economy had slowed to a crawl within his first six months in office by march 2015 precisely about two months before he took over the mantle of leadership the external reserve had dropped to 31 billion as crude price had plummeted to about 48 per barrel from all time highs of 112 a barrel in 2014 the country s receipt from export of crude dropped to 1 3billion while the demand for forex and the demand for import had remained high besides most macro economic variables had worsened within buhari s first year in office as the country witnessed contracting gdp rising unemployment declining capacity utilisation foreign exchange shortages aside the huge budget deficit also other economic indicators were bad the nigerian stock exchange market capitalisation had plunged from a high of n11 trillion to about n8 65 trillion with business confidence significantly eroded the economy eventually slipped into recession the worst in the country s history since 1987 barely one year after he assumed office the buhari administration had blamed the economic quagmire on corruption and mismanagement of public funds by successive governments particularly the outgone goodluck jonathan regime however economic analysts who though aligned with his submission also noted that the president s six months delay in appointing his cabinet as well as the delay in the passage of budget contributed to worsen the already bad economic situation in fact the economic downturn was further exacerbated by buhari s opposition to naira devaluation a development which resulted in a severe foreign exchange shortage the situation was so bad that the nation s currency crashed to about n520 to a us dollar also inflation figure rose to 18 6 in december 2016 the highest in over a decade according to the nbs records a few measures were then taking by the cbn to stablise the economy and in the words of godwin emefiele the cbn governor to return the economy to growth part they included the local currency adjustments forex restrictions on some 41 items raising the interest rate to checkmate the inflation as well interventions through injection of dollars into the forex market although these interventions have helped to lower the pressure on the naira which has since stablised across market segments critics argue that earlier floating of the local currency would have done the economy a lot good although nigeria exited recession in 2017 the economy under buhari s watch has continued to suffer setbacks growing at a slow pace the world bank recently put the estimated growth rate for nigeria s economy in 2019 at 2 2 percent with its forecast oil price at average 67 per barrel however the inflation rate is looking better it stood at 11 37 per cent in january 2019 similarly the external reserve has risen to about 43 billion while the gdp growth is currently at 2 3 per cent although this is commendable analysts argue that the gdp figure is well below nigeria s population growth of over 180 million they opined that the gdp should grow by over 4per cent for the country to come out of poverty away from the economy the boko haram insurgency in the northeast part of the country which has claimed the lives of many innocent nigerians besides the destruction of valuable properties has remained a major challenge to buhari administration since inception as the president seeks reelection in today s polls analysts who examined the string of promises he made during his campaign in 2015 have expressed divergent views on some of his administration s policies whereas some analysts have commended his various programmes including the much publicised social investment programme sips which government said was aimed to ameliorate hardship faced by the most vulnerable poor and unemployed nigerians critics believed it is yet another vote buying strategy which will not live beyond the 2019 election year the four components of the sip the n power the home grown school feeding hgsfp conditional cash transfer cct and government enterprises entrepreneurship programme geep which comprises the marketmoni the farmermoni and the tradermoni are being implemented across the 36 states and the federal capital territory fct also one of the core pillars of buhari s campaign in 2015 was his promise to fight corruption which is the bane of economic growth and stability in this regard the federal government in december 2016 through the federal ministry of finance introduced the whistleblowing policy which has since yielded n13 8billion from tax evaders and n7 8 billion 378 million 27 800 in recoveries from public officials also n8 1 trillion was discovered to have been underpaid into the federation account between 2010 and 2015 by 15 revenue generating agencies in line with his avowed war against corruption his government had instituted scores of corruption cases against some top government functionaries including high court judges although government lost in most of those cases as it was only able to secure a few convictions it appeared not deterred only recently the chief justice of nigeria just walter onnoghen was removed from office and was arraigned yesterday before the code of conduct tribunal for alleged failure to declare his asset his removal has elicited widespread condemnations with many calling on government to follow due process in its action against the former cjn although buhari claimed he has delivered on his 2015 campaign promises his critics think otherwise critics also pointed out what they described as blatant nepotism cronyism and tribalism in buhari s administration noting that the northern states are mostly favoured in appointments opportunities and provision of infrastructure also it is believed that buhari s acclaimed fight against corruption was targeted at political opponents and perceived enemies of his government the main opposition and other critics also believe the buhari administration is losing the war against terrorism and has not done enough to checkmate activities of these insurgents who spare no one including the nigerian soldiers despite the barrage of criticism buhari has rated his almost four years in office very high insisting he has delivered on all his 2015 campaign promises he is therefore seeking reelection today in order to take his acclaimed achievements to the next level but whether his re election bid would be achieved or not only today can tell buhari gcfr was born on december 17 1942 in daura katsina state to a fulani family his father hardo adamu a fulani chief died when he was only about four years the twenty third child of his father buhari was raised by his mother zulaihat following the demise of his father he enrolled in the nigerian military training college nmtc now the nigerian defence academy nda in 1962 at the age of 19 he later proceeded to officer cadet training at mons officer cadet school in aldershot in england 1962 to 1963 upon completion of his programme buhari was commissioned a second lieutenant and appointed platooncommander of the second infantry battalion in abeokuta nigeria from november 1963 to january 1964 buhari attended the platoon commanders course at the nigerian military training college kaduna in 1964 he facilitated his military training by attending the mechanical transport officer s course at the army mechanical transport school in borden united kingdom he was appointed governor of the north eastern state from august 1 1975 to february 3 1976 by the late general murtala mohammed he also briefly served as governor of borno state from 3 february 3 1976 to march 15 1976 in march 1976 the then head of state general olusegun obasanjo appointed buhari as the federal commissioner for petroleum and natural resources when the nigerian national petroleum corporation was created in 1977 buhari was also appointed as its chairman a position he held until 1978 following the creation of the nigerian national petroleum corporation in 1977 buhari was also appointed as its chairman a position he held until 1978 from 1978 to 1979 he was military secretary at the army headquarters and was a member of the supreme military council from 1978 to 1979 from 1979 to 1980 at the rank of colonel buhari attended the us army war college in carlisle pennsylvania in the united states and gained a masters degree in strategic studies he served as the nation s head of state from december 31 1983 to 27 august 27 1985 after taking power in a military coup d état he was married to safinatu yusuf whom he divorced in 1988 the same year he married aisha his marriage was blessed with 10 children but he lost two
u s review signs point to more moderate economic growth ahead existing home sales dropped 1 2 in january reflecting continued housing market weakness the nahb housing market index rose to 62 in february as more builders expressed confidence on lower mortgage rates durable goods orders increased 1 2 in december core orders fell 0 7 indicating that business investment will likely slow fomc minutes for the january 29 30 meeting were released and revealed a consensus among members that patience should be exercised with further rate hikes many members also appeared ready for the end of the balance sheet run off signs point to more moderate economic growth ahead data for 2019 are still somewhat limited but several signs point to a moderate slowdown in overall economic growth relative to the strong pace registered throughout 2018 the weakness in the housing market felt through much of last year has extended into 2019 existing home sales dropped 1 2 in january as the lingering effects of rapid home price appreciation and higher mortgage rates in the second half of 2018 dampened sales for the third consecutive month while overall sales have slumped lower mortgage rates more recently make us optimistic that gradual improvements in home sales should be forthcoming a similar sentiment was expressed by homebuilders in the nahb housing market index which posted its second consecutive monthly gain in february after dramatically falling in the final month of 2018 more builders feel confident about future market conditions given the lower rates which bodes well for new residential construction headed into the spring mortgage applications also improved to start the year the mba mortgage applications purchase index rose 1 7 for the week ending february 15 while extremely volatile on a weekly basis the average index reading seven weeks into 2019 is 3 1 higher than the same period last year meanwhile durable goods orders rose in december overall orders increased 1 2 during the month while shipments for core capital goods edged 0 5 higher however much of december s gain was due to a 28 4 surge in nondefense aircraft orders core capital goods orders which is an important barometer of future business investment slipped for the second straight month and fell 0 7 we still expect business investment to rise and be supportive of overall gdp growth in q4 however the drop in core orders makes the prospect of continued growth at its current pace unlikely the leading economic index lei continues to point to generally favorable economic conditions in coming months the 0 1 decline registered in january was weighed down by a drop in average consumer expectations likely a fallout from the partial federal government shutdown and stock market volatility towards the end of 2018 the government closure also led to an uptick in jobless claims which were also a drag on the topline index more recent data however revealed that the spike in claims was temporary initial jobless claims fell 23 000 to 216 000 for the week ending february 16 underscoring just how resilient the labor market is at present the topic of a strong labor market was also breached in the minutes for the most recent january 29 30 fomc meeting released this week while no change was made to the target federal funds rate during the meeting the minutes revealed that participants generally agreed that patience should be exercised in the face of tighter financial conditions and moderating global economic growth we still believe that the fomc is not entirely finished with rate hikes and modest price pressures and sturdy employment growth should lead to another hike toward the end of the year furthermore the minutes appear to confirm our view that the balance sheet runoff will likely come to an end by the end of 2019 or early 2020 u s outlook consumer confidence index tuesday a partial government shutdown rung in the new year trade discussions between the united states and china to prevent a fullblown trade war remain ongoing and financial markets have recovered but remain suppressed from all time highs seen only a few short months ago such market noise has inevitably found its way into the confidence of consumers the consumer confidence index has declined the past three months with most of the weakness concentrated in the expectations component we expect a modest rebound in confidence this month if confidence falls short of our expectation it will be the latest affirmation that a slowdown in consumer spending is in store this year a miss to the upside however would suggest that the still strong job market and the modest gain in wages that has finally begun to transpire have provided some much needed support to the outlook of consumers previous 120 2 wells fargo 124 0 consensus 124 2 q4 gdp thursday on thursday market participants attention will turn to q4 gdp given that it has been more than a month since the originally scheduled release date the census bureau has decided this will be a combined release of the first and second estimates of q4 growth recent data have pointed to a slower than anticipated pace of growth in the final months of the year as such we have reduced our q4 gdp growth forecast to 2 0 from 2 3 previously consumption growth is likely to be weak as retail sales plummeted 1 2 in december the largest one month decline since 2009 however as we noted it was hard to square the plunge in sales with other variables which suggests revisions may eventually be in order business fixed investment on the other hand may surprise to the upside the advance estimate of durable goods data for december revealed a rise in capital goods shipments which bodes well for q4 investment spending previous 3 4 wells fargo 2 0 consensus 2 5 quarter over quarter annualized ism manufacturing index friday with durable goods data having been delayed in recent months the ism manufacturing index has received particular emphasis as an indication of how the factory sector is faring the ism manufacturing index rose 2 3 points in january however that rebound occurred after the index posted its single largest monthly drop since december 2008 underlying details of january s report and slower domestic and global growth continue to point to factory activity slowing on trend this year consistent with what we have seen from the regional pmis to date we expect the ism index to give up a bit of ground in february if the index falls more than we anticipate it would support the cautious policy stance by the fomc a miss to the upside however would provide some comfort that activity in the factory sector has held up at least through february previous 56 6 wells fargo 55 0 consensus 56 0 global review still quiet on the global central bank front the global economic data released this week have been decidedly mixed in the eurozone service sector confidence improved but manufacturing confidence fell into contraction territory australian employment figures were sturdy but other data were mostly soft in tone finally in japan the economic figures over the past five days have been generally subdued given this mixed backdrop things should remain quiet on the global central bank front for now central bank comments from europe and japan have been mostly dovish in recent weeks while australia has adopted a more balanced outlook it could still be some time before these central banks adjust policy rates all we need is just a little patience the eurozone february manufacturing and service sector pmis provided the latest reading on the state of the region s economy those figures hardly offered a silver lining although perhaps made the economic clouds a little less dark on the negative side the manufacturing pmi fell to 49 2 the first time that index has been in contraction territory since mid 2013 that largely confirms softness seen in other indicators including a large decline in december industrial production on a more positive note the service pmi rose to 52 3 the first increase since september meaning that the economy wide composite pmi also rose in february germany s economy has been weak in recent quarters and the fall in the february ifo business confidence to 98 5 hints at continued subdued growth overall with growth sluggish and several european central bank policymakers adopting a more dovish tone in recent speeches we do not anticipate the central bank will begin raising its deposit rate from the current 0 40 until the final quarter of this year reserve bank of australia on hold while there have pockets of strength in some australian data the reserve bank of australia rba is also likely to be on hold for an extended period january labor market figures were sturdy with employment rising 39 100 led by a 65 400 gain in full time jobs while the unemployment rate was steady at 5 0 still the early february pmi readings showed softness while wage growth remains moderate as the q4 wage price index rose 2 3 year over year australian economic sentiment was also hurt to some extent by news reports that china had banned imports of australian coal indefinitely at five key ports despite the encouraging employment news the rba remains firmly on hold for now earlier this month the central bank moved to a neutral outlook with governor lowe saying that the probability of the next interest rate move being up or down was more evenly balanced a view he reiterated at parliamentary testimony this week bank of japan sounds dovish bank of japan governor kuroda also spoke to parliament this week telling japanese lawmakers the central bank may consider additional monetary easing if moves in the yen were to affect the economy and inflation kuroda s comments were largely supported by this raft of economic data the january cpi rose just 0 2 year over year while the core cpi rose 0 8 both well short of the bank of japan s medium term inflation goal of 2 meanwhile activity data were broadly soft in tone as the december all industry activity index fell 0 4 month over month and core private sector machinery orders dipped 0 1 japan s manufacturing pmi also fell in february given the central bank s recent comments and the subdued overall tone of the economic figures there is a risk that the window closes on our base case of a modest adjustment towards less accommodative monetary policy by the bank of japan in q2 a policy adjustment that would be far enough in advance of japan s consumption tax increase scheduled to take place in q4 2019 global outlook canada gdp tuesday canada s q4 gdp is due next week with the slower growth of q3 expected to continue into q4 canada s economy rose at just a 2 0 annualized rate in q3 and monthly data hint at subdued growth in the final quarter of 2018 retail sales excluding motor vehicles recorded five straight monthly declines through december while manufacturing shipments fell in each month during q4 meanwhile oil production cuts in alberta likely also weighed on growth during the quarter we forecast that canada s q4 gdp slowed further to just 1 5 annualized although given the recent rebound in oil prices and a lessening drag from the alberta production cuts we expect growth to improve on a sequential basis as 2019 progresses next week also sees the release of january cpi inflation data the consensus expects the headline cpi to rise just 1 5 year over year which would be the smallest gain since october 2017 while core inflation measures should be broadly steady just below 2 0 previous 2 0 wells fargo 1 5 consensus 1 5 quarter over quarter annualized brazil gdp thursday brazil s q4 gdp should show an economic expansion that remains somewhat uneven but on an overall upswing after gdp rose 0 8 quarter over quarter in q3 the consensus expects sequential growth slowed in q4 monthly retail sales data suggest consumer spending was relatively solid last quarter although weakness in industrial production hints at possible weakness in investment spending on a year over year basis growth is expected to quicken further though to 2 0 overall we expect brazil s economic growth to remain moderate over the medium term that outlook depends critically on whether president bolsanaro can successfully push through pension reforms successful passage of which would likely limit the pace of growth but improve the sustainability of economic expansion india s q4 gdp is due and is expected to slow to 6 7 year over year while next week other key emerging market data include china s february manufacturing and services pmis previous 1 3 consensus 1 5 year over year eurozone cpi friday the latest reading on eurozone inflation is released next friday although we do not expect those figures to shift the eurozone s monetary policy outlook we forecast the headline cpi rose 1 5 year over year in february slightly more than the january increase moreover there is arguably some upside rise to that outlook given a rise in oil prices through much of february and a relatively stable euro versus the u s dollar that said underlying inflation pressures are building only gradually and we forecast the core cpi to rise 1 1 year over year in february the same as the previous month and well short of the ecb s inflation goal with economic growth still relatively subdued and inflation pressures building only gradually we still expect it will be some time before the ecb begins to raise interest rates eurozone february economic confidence is also released with the consensus forecasting the index to ease to 106 0 previous 1 4 wells fargo 1 5 consensus 1 5 year over year point of view interest rate watch the markets matter minutes from the fomc s january meeting offered insight into the reasons for the committee s abrupt pivot from december to a decidedly more dovish policy stance as chair powell laid out in the post meeting press conference the committee viewed the downside risks to growth had increased specifically members were concerned about a slowdown in global growth waning fiscal stimulus trade policy tensions and tightening financial conditions tighter financial conditions in the immediate wake of the december meeting came as markets viewed the fomc as insufficiently flexible in its policy path given the perceived risks to the outlook although not wanting to appear beholden to markets it nonetheless looks like the fomc s about face was determined to demonstrate flexibility of course policy adjustments are not warranted only when conditions or risks are perceived to have worsened since the start of the year financial conditions have loosened and are now the easiest levels in more than a year top chart while equity markets are up about 10 since the december meeting the improvements come as markets no longer expect the fed to hike rates further this cycle the minutes were not definitive in that view however the base case for growth appears little changed therefore if the downside risks subside many participants believe the patient stance would need to be revisited evenly split for now the majority of the fomc was not clear which way the fomc s next move would be several expected it would be appropriate for at least one more hike this year while another several thought hikes would only be necessary if inflation came in higher than expected we anticipate inflation will be roughly two tenths stronger by q4 what the most recently published fomc estimates middle chart which along with recent easing in financial conditions results in one more hike this year bottom chart the fomc may indeed be flexible but just not in the way the market currently expects credit market insights canary in the camry seven million americans are seriously delinquent on their auto loans according to the new york fed the current number of borrowers 90 days behind on their auto loan payments vastly exceeds the maximum reached in the height of the last recession with wage growth picking up and job growth still incredibly strong is this a harbinger of widespread financial distress or something more benign due to the centrality of cars to the economic and personal stability of so many consumers typically prioritize auto loan payments over other liabilities even mortgage or credit card debt thus a growing number of consumers transitioning into delinquency on their auto loans can be an indicator of significant financial distress yet this alarming number of delinquent borrowers is to a large extent simply a consequence of an increase in the magnitude of the auto loan market lenders originated a record 584 billion of auto loans in 2018 increasingly to prime borrowers who still comprise a much larger share of outstanding debt than subprime borrowers the portion of vehicle purchases financed by debt has remained stable and the flow into serious delinquency in q4 only reached 2 4 still this marks a noticeable deterioration in performance this is up from the 2012 cycle low of 1 5 and is concentrated among the young and the subprime while the headline of seven million may not indicate a systematic threat it can offer clues into where financial hardship is the most acute topic of the week refund status still processing the tax cuts passed in the final days of 2017 resulted in increased after tax income for most u s households however due to a number of factors changes in withholdings and the government shutdown there remains considerable uncertainty about how much of that gain was realized in calendar year 2018 and how much will or will not be realized during the 2019 filing season what is known so far the pace of filings and returns is slower than in prior years fewer people are filing taxes early this year and those who are have seen tax refunds that are down on average 8 7 through versus this period last year february 8 2019 what is unknown whether once the dust settles the actual aggregate amount and average refund will fall as precipitously as they have so far an inauspicious start does not necessarily mean that tax refunds are sure to be lower for the year but should this trend continue it poses a potential threat to q1 gdp growth the bottom line from our perspective is that the timing of tax returns might be running a few weeks behind early filers are doing so at a slower pace and even despite the slower pace of filing the irs is having a more difficult time keeping up while the size of the refund being down so far does not necessarily mean smaller refunds are certain for 2019 it does pose a challenge for q1 spending february is the biggest month for tax returns bottom chart so the smaller refunds at the outset and the fact that the irs is running a little behind processing means some durables spending could be put off into march or perhaps q2 we plan to further unpack the factors that complicate this issue in an upcoming special report as a practical way to monitor this year s refunds
china us rivalry and gold it s unimaginable what great progress china made in the last forty years the rise of such economic power triggered many fears or hopes about the future international order we invite you to read our today s article about the rivalry between china and the us and find whether the red dragon will replace america as a global hegemon and what would such a shift mean for the gold market the economic growth of china raises many worries while some people fear the slowdown or stagnation in the middle kingdom others claim that china will turn the existing international world upside down you see since the end of the world war ii the us has been the most powerful country in the world the soviet union rivaled but it was too weak and collapsed eventually the global hegemony of the us became total then however china which is now the biggest or the second biggest economy in the world wants to challenge this order some experts even claim that the world enters the so called thucydides trap i e the situation where the growing contender thinks that its position does not reflect its strength and that the old hegemon limits his development when we add that a rising power causes fear in an established power we get the recipe for a war in 12 out of 16 historical cases of thucydides trap the result was war as the table below shows table 1 thucydides trap cases source belfercenter org of course russia also challenges the us hegemony but the country is economically too weak but china is different just one of its province has bigger gdp than russia and the chinese have really ambitious plans they want to create a new silk road i e a trade route running through the eurasian land as an alternative to the sea routes which are still controlled by the us and as gold bulls often repeat china tries to weaken the dominant position of the us dollar and strengthen the yuan the geopolitical analyses are fascinating but they have several flaws first of all there is a lot of determinism here geography does not determine the economic success or failure the central idea of geopolitics is that the country has to control trade routes to prosper and rise in power but the wealth comes from effective production not from controlling any particular geographical area we did not live any longer in the middle ages when there were few available trade routes so those who controlled them had monopolistic rents second the rising economic powerhouse does not have to intent to challenge the hegemon and the war does not have to occur as the table above clearly shows you see threat means a combination of capability and intentions there is no doubt that china has substantially built up its capabilities but there are no evidence that the country s military ambitions go substantively beyond taiwan you see it might be the case that china does not want to dominate but just to restore an equilibrium that lasted throughout much of the recorded history china s actual achievements are really admirable but they prompted many analysts and pentagon which has to justify its funding requests to overblow the country s position yes china is a rising power but given the amount of us military spending and its worldwide network of allies it is not a global geostrategic peer equivalent in power to the latter country the us spends on defense three or four times more than china and it can rely on help of many countries all around the world have you heard about the five eyes rightly or not the us is considered to be a cool kid while china is well a kind of a surveillance country it s soft power or ability to form alliances is thus much weaker can you name just two friends of china north korea does not count to be clear we are not saying that there will be no conflicts at all no we are not that naïve to claim the end of history china may test the hegemon but it will be wise enough to do it far from his core interests so as not to upset the us too much we are still decades from china being strong enough to threaten the us what does it all mean for the gold market well gold bulls should wake up and acknowledge the reality the chinese yuan will not replace the greenback anytime soon as it comprises about 1 percent of the total foreign exchange reserves held globally still a tiny share investors should not buy gold counting on that and china will not replace the us as a global hegemon shortly it s not strong enough its economy is slowing down actually the trade disputes and the debt burden inhibit the growth given the need for a shift of the economy from export led toward consumption led model of growth and for a careful navigating between the risk of excessive indebtedness and deleveraging too much which could lead to a significant slowdown triggering a military conflict with the global superpower seems to be the last thing the chinese leaders could wish for now so don t expect tectonic shifts in the international order and the resulting rally in the gold prices however we also have good news for the gold bulls the yellow metal may shine even without the atomic parousia what it only needs are strong fundamentals and positive market sentiment surely the current pax americana is not set in stone and it may change but be careful what you wish for you just might get it as for us gold prices even at 10 000 would be a poor consolation if the world falls into nuclear winter thank you if you enjoyed the above analysis and would you like to know more about the gold etfs and their impact on gold price we invite you to read

submitted by pachamama for decades we in the caribbean misguidedly so have been living under a false presumption that our here and dear homeland was a zone of peace we well remember those homilies as oft repeated by generations of the political elites as if mantra but not at all well based in truism these thinly veiled falsities have been laid bare by the existential realities of our time enter the bolivarian republic of venezuela as wilpert has argued the pink tide governments currently facing serial reversals in the wider region always had venezuela as their epicenter thus the internal logic employed by washington was not to be limited to the rollbacks in brazil argentina ecuador and guatemala for venezuela was always the main target of course cuba and nicaragua remain firmly within the bullseye of empire as well mexico under its new left leaning president will soon more openly also attract empire s ire under this global financial hegemony no deviations to the established orthodoxy shall be permitted they posture imperialism has gone through at least three 3 distinct phases classical imperialism meant you outright stole other peoples things at the point of a sword colonial imperialism has meant that one was committed to bearing the costs of administrative control or management on the ground directing the theft of resources thereby reducing the net margin of surpluses extracted the colonial extraction of surpluses by financial imperialism is the purest and most efficient formation thus removing up to 95 of surplus production from the host directly to the german bankers or parasites as in the recent case of greece in the case of the militarized financial colonialism which seeks to re impose itself on the bolivarian republic of venezuela the adversary is seeking to create conditions on the ground aimed at the renewal of historical patterns of extraction by pressuring the country with a contrived humanitarian crisis by paying off its national debt and kicking out the international monetary fund imf hugo chavez denied the money changers the rentier economy most efficient in extracting surpluses this is a long planned artificial crisis to which they are presenting the faux but ready made solution of course the united states has for many years now deployed dollar supremacy to create artificial scarcities in venezuela primarily through financial manipulation and employing other petroleum producers to sink the price of crude such a scenario unduly pressurizes the population suggest that the military should be disloyal and commit treason aims to set up a rival government in venezuela is portentous for a civil war locates the caribbean well within a final war scenarios but america should try to avoid a hot war for it has lost every conflict except grenada in more than one hundred 100 years however civil confusion fictitious claims to governmental authority and disaster capitalism are also in america s immediate interests like in syria and contrary to popular claims claims just as propagandistic as those about zones of peace anywhere the usa has set up financial companies in colombia to invite holders of us dollars to remove them from the country venezuela mainly the wealthy venezuelans left behind they have set up financial services companies in miami whose sole role are to act to drive down the parity for the bolivar creating inflation of more than a million percent in a year then they blame chavez and maduro for mismanagement and they own the media to often repeat their memes lies they have insisted for years that venezuela was not to borrow in us dollars from anywhere they have demanded that american companies operating in venezuela were to repatriate their reserves of us dollars and more more recently we have seen the weaponization of international finance taken to a new and worrying level it s worrying for russia china turkey and others the united states has contravened the well established understanding of international law what sovereign statism means when removing the legal protections the government of venezuela has had viz a viz its us dollar reserve holdings in american banks and its holdings of bullion in london institutions we are witnessing a global colonial conspiracy with obvious extraterritorial implications it is or should be intolerable to all world nations the grapes of globalization you say what connects the bolivarian republic of venezuela to the dirty looks of american empire is the three 3 letter word which has been since its discovery been the bane of all countries of the south what s worse is that imperial american control of oil we say control not necessarily ownership not that trump and those currently in the white house care much about the differentiation any more for they are gangsters but crude oil is the single strategic mineral which has since 1971 could have acted to impose a perceived value on a fiat american currency through forced demand market conditions as imposed by empire without which the paper tiger of an american empire falls tomorrow morning these are the orders of magnitude the present illegal and aggressive humanitarian war against the bolivarian republic of venezuela represents for the caribbean the wider region and the very existence of live on our mother earth these scenarios make nonsense of quaint notions about zones of peace anywhere for russia china iran and others will not be forever dominated by american fiat currency control mechanisms for resistance must come sooner or later and if venezuela is to be the battle ground no pretenses about the caribbean as a zone of peace can contain these configurations of forces we are endeavouring to ignore the bellicose mouthings of trump and company beyond that all the other international indicators suggest the end of imperium all the forces within the united states of america itself also point to an unescapable collapse and very soon too war with venezuela as urged by the deep state or permanent american government and particularly the bankers running the federal reserve remains the last flicker of hope for maintaining or extending american global hegemony for they have failed to control russian oil iranian crude central asian resources so venezuela seems a necessary but insufficient target they should expect millions of freedom fighters from venezuela and elsewhere to deliver a righteous resistance in several neighbouring countries as well venezuela represent another miscalculation for the internal and external constellations are working against the continuation of american hegemony and are well disposed to denying empire any lifeline the very existence of america has always been about global hegemony we simply have to look to see where its nearly 1000 military bases are located we ll discover that they are primarily situated near oil fields to protect oil shipping lanes and other strategic minerals the oil majors have always acted as instruments for imperial power starting with iran 1953 as british petroleum as successor acted with the cia and british intelligence mi6 to remove mohammad mosadegh a duly elected leader who nationalized iranian oil by these the oil majors on whose behalf the united states military has always been praetorian guard of course they enlist their partners in crime to assist in the policing of the world s resources france s hegemonic relationships with its former colonies still represent the most perverse contradiction from the country which continues to claim to have given us liberty why the increased recklessness at this time well major countries are coming to realize that the fiat dollar has been used to threaten them wage wars against them impose sanctions against them subjected them to intractable poverty been extractive of real wealth owned by them subjected them to more and more irrational american demands the rising list of demands never seems ends strengths also present weaknesses and the growing weakness of empire also presents the achilles heel as a point of attack so we have a number of countries establishing systems which seek to bypass the us dollar as global reserve currency and the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication swif system used for its transfer venezuela just last years and in its own defense decided to price its oil in the yuan or petro yuan the currency of china this military response by trump and his gang in the white house is not dissimilar to what happened to maumar khadafy when he decided to sell iraqi oil solely in the gold dinar meaning buyers had to hold gold to buy libyan crude oil no such competition is ever to be given to the devil s dollar the same fate met saddam hussien of iraq who deciding to price iraqi crude similarly they are many other countries facing this colonial reprisal we will do well to remember that our region has never been a stranger to american backed wars subversions and intrigues contrary to the predictions of trump we expect the american empire to collapse long before his wish for socialism as an organizing principle to have a chance in the heart of imperium the truth is that america has many aspects of what he calls derisively as socialism indeed trump himself is a product of statist or corporate socialism through the privatization of surpluses and the socialization of debt his many unpaid debt from several bankruptcies as we approach the weekend we now see the british billionaire richard branson bringing a threatening humanitarian live aide type concerts to venezuela s borders this is the threatening behavior of the humanitarian war hawks and venezuela should have a prepared counter measure for any kinds of forces threatening it branson an acolyte of obama must also be an agent for empire venezuela a country is not starving as they would wish us to believe why can t this man branson who got his billions through the thief of public assets not encourage the aggressive countries for which he acts as agent to deliver the resources of the bolivarian republic instead everything here proves that it was a mistake for hugo chavez to expect to launch a real structural revolution to liberate the masses of the venezuelan peoples while at the same time leaving the capitalist structures in place these capitalists have always been the agent of slavery colonialism neo colonialism and now financial imperialism they are the ones who like the americans always believed that all the resources of the bolivarian republic of venezuela were theirs and theirs alone even as they served their white masters from abroad
here are three things that have happened so far in 2019 the former chief economist of the international monetary fund olivier blanchard argued in a speech that for countries like the united states high public debt isn t necessarily a problem to people who follow the i m f it was as if a former pope came out with an endorsement of the devil alexandria ocasio cortez the charismatic new congresswoman who has shown an uncanny ability to drive public policy debates indicated openness to modern monetary theory the idea that public spending need not be constrained by tax revenues president trump delivered an 82 minute long state of the union speech in which he did not use the words debt or budget deficit economic orthodoxy that ruled for decades held that fiscal responsibility was inherently good and the national debt a leviathan to fear now the intellectual and political currents are flowing gushing really in the opposite direction after president trump s election republicans decided to pursue their agenda of tax cuts and higher military spending without doing the unpopular work of paying for it democrats are coming to believe they have hamstrung themselves in pursuit of their goals by worrying about so called pay fors policies that offset the cost when they next take power they may feel empowered to take on a much more ambitious expensive agenda and macroeconomists are confronting the reality that the sky did not fall even as the united states swung from a 236 billion surplus in the 2000 fiscal year to a 779 billion deficit in 2018 by their old theories high deficits and debt should have caused interest rates and inflation to rise and government borrowing should have crowded out capital from the private sector

people in the united states are being hit with an avalanche of propaganda about venezuela and the government of president nicolás maduro this happens in the run up to every u s war the tactic is to psychologically prepare people to accept the coming aggression by connecting it to a noble cause the information war always precedes the real war the answer coalition has issued an anti war call to action based on opposition to the u s backed coup sanctions and war which allows people with varying opinions of the venezuelan government to find the necessary points of unity to take action together the psl agrees that this is the correct approach for building the movement with that said we think it is critical to challenge the mass media s depiction of the venezuelan government that demonization is constant led by donald trump mike pence john bolton and marco rubio and then echoed by the opposition like nancy pelosi joe biden cnn and the new york times it is repeated so often that it has an impact even on progressive people who are against a new war in opposing a coup or intervention many will quickly add of course i don t support maduro who is dictatorial corrupt and undemocratic or has mismanaged the economy but is this really true or is it just propaganda of the war makers themselves is maduro a dictator if president maduro is a dictator why has he allowed large demonstrations to take place on a regular basis calling for his ouster promoted by huge private media corporations does a dictatorship allow 11 opposition parties to take part in elections as happened in the most recent vote the country held last december even the u s backed coup leader juan guaidó who pronounced himself president and every day calls for the military to mutiny and for a hostile foreign power to intervene is free to travel around the capital city giving speeches and holding meetings as part of his campaign to overthrow the government is the electoral system fraudulent venezuela has had 24 elections since chavez was first elected in 1998 international observer missions have long verified the electoral system as free fair and top notch the right wing opposition even won some of these elections and didn t claim fraud then the system is unchanged since then the claim of electoral fraud has not been backed by evidence it has been made precisely because the opposition could not find a way to dislodge the governing socialist party and president maduro what about the images of violence on the streets opposition protests large and small take place all the time in venezuela without incident following maduro s first election in 2013 right wing forces initiated a series of riots called guarimbas in 2014 that claimed 43 lives the majority of the 43 people killed were bystanders or others who were targeted by the rioters including nine members of the police or national guard they set up barricades and barbed wire to close off intersections and whole neighborhoods and commit horrific violence against those who stood in their way elvis rafael durán was one of their victims his father luis recalled two years after his death on way home he crashed into a barbed wire that was hanging across the boulevard and he was decapitated if these people hadn t called for these violent acts none of this would have happened my son would not have lost his life in 2014 an opposition demonstration marched on a government agency that provides free housing to the poor and attempted to burn down the building which included a nursery filled with children the opposition revived these tactics in 2017 with renewed brutality and with their extreme white supremacy on full display one of their victims was a young afro venezuelan named orlando figuera who was stabbed multiple times then doused with gasoline and burned alive the riots were aimed at escalating the conflict with venezuela s government to give the image of instability or provoke the sort of repression which could usher in an international intervention any government would punish the perpetrators of such violence one opposition freedom fighter celebrated by u s politicians like marco rubio was oscar perez who was killed in a shootout while being arrested his crime he had hijacked a helicopter and dropped grenades on the venezuelan supreme court despite all this the government has cracked down on police excesses after violent anti government protests in late 2016 for example seven police officers were arrested and charged with violations of fundamental rights in 2014 a police officer was charged with the murder of an opposition protester despite the fact that he was surrounded and being pelted with rocks maduro s interior minister defended the officer s arrest saying we will be relentless in the application of justice and the law are opposition leaders being arrested the right wing leaders who were arrested and jailed like leopoldo lopez freddy guevara and david smolansky were those who organized and encouraged this violent movement they were not arrested because of their beliefs this is who the u s considers political prisoners opposition parties and leaders drawing on huge sums from the country s upper class and u s agencies continue to organize and agitate openly one such opposition leader henri falcon ran in the 2018 presidential election and received 2 million votes just under 20 percent he accepted his defeat to maduro what about the removal of opposition parties some of the opposition parties that boycotted the last few elections have been de listed by the government that is true but hardly a scandal in most states in the united states too a third party is only on the ballot if it reaches a certain threshold in votes in the last election and if it fails to do so it has to start from scratch did maduro ruin the economy the country is in the midst of a serious economic crisis but laying the blame on maduro ignores both the causes of the crisis and the government s response the main reason for the economic problems is the historic collapse of the price of oil that began in 2014 for the last 100 years venezuela has depended on oil almost exclusively to fund its national budget and acquire foreign currency earnings the bolivarian revolution has led to enormous social progress since hugo chavez s election in 1998 but it has not yet been able to overcome this legacy of foreign domination a difficult task that few countries have been able to accomplish the price of oil reached a peak of more than 105 per barrel in june 2014 and then fell dramatically to under 35 in february 2016 this has been greatly exacerbated by u s sanctions against the industry that has now turned into a full blown blockade which trump s national security adviser john bolton estimates will cost venezuela about 30 million a day at the urging of the united states in late 2017 belgian financial services firm euroclear froze 1 65 billion of venezuelan public funds including 450 million of cash that the government was attempting to use to purchase food and medicine in january the bank of england essentially plundered 1 2 billion worth of venezuelan gold that the government had deposited with them announcing that they would only allow the coup leader guaidó to access the assets this is pure colonial looting is the economic crisis because of socialism while the bolivarian revolution and venezuelan government have declared that their project is to build socialism and have made major strides in that direction the vast majority of the economy is still in the hands of capitalists the private sector controls 50 percent of production and distribution of food 80 percent of personal hygiene items 70 percent of pharmaceutical items and 80 percent of clothes and shoes venezuela exists in a global order dominated by hostile capitalist classes to whom it has to sell its exports such as oil and from whom it has to import goods as wide ranging as food to technology and spare parts even the state owned and nationalized enterprises have to operate by the rules of those foreign corporations banks and creditors all this creates a large toolkit for the forces of capitalism not socialism to sabotage extort and undermine venezuela s economic development what about the inflation in 2003 hugo chávez instituted currency exchange controls to keep the venezuelan elite from taking their money out of the country and its banks exchanging it for dollars which would leave the country broke and collapse its currency only certain amounts of currency could be exchanged for dollars and it had to go through government approved institutions this led to an underground exchange of currency that widened over time when oil prices collapsed the government could have done what the governments of the rich do cut off all social programs sell off government assets to private investors and let the poor fend for themselves and starve instead the government continued to finance these programs and import food and medicine with its dwindling foreign currency reserves the government tried to issue debt to investors to stabilize its finances like so many others do but u s sanctions and a pullout by international capital limited this in response the maduro government printed more money to import needed food and technology for the people this increased inflationary pressures however there is also considerable evidence that suggests the u s federal reserve devalued venezuelan currency at various moments for political reasons meanwhile privately run websites like dolartoday publishes wildly inflated estimates of the true value of the venezuelan currency relative to the u s dollar dolartoday is run by gustavo díaz a former venezuelan military officer who participated in the failed 2002 coup this constitutes a form of psychological warfare constantly throwing workers and businesses into doubt about the real value of their wages and products with each exchange rate spike stores increased their prices but fearing future instability did not then lower prices in equal measure when the exchange rate declined this too accelerated inflation meanwhile private distributors and importers hoarded goods to inflate their costs and deepen the social crisis state subsidized and price controlled goods such as gasoline have been pilfered into the underground market and resold at huge profits at the colombian border for instance one raid conducted by security forces in 2015 uncovered a stockpile of 176 000 liters of gasoline 1 260 liters of vehicle oil 2 000 cases of beer two tons of sugar three tons of rice a half ton of cooking oil and nearly 15 tons of other essential food goods altogether these factors created a crisis of confidence in the currency as a whole mistakes and mismanagement are of course part of the problem as the government has always declared but at its core venezuela has been punished by international capitalism for continuing to prioritize the needs of the poor throughout this economic downturn and against the sanctions is the government letting people starve no six million families now benefit from a new initiative called local committees for supply and production that directly distributes packages of essential food and other consumer goods on a regular basis to those who are most affected by inflation the venezuelan government has repeatedly raised the minimum wage to try and make up for inflationary pressures other steps include making the metro transportation system of caracas although already affordable completely free so people can go to work and school unimpeded by finances are all the country s resources being stolen by the venezuelan leadership as the u s government claims there is of course bureaucratic corruption in venezuela as the government readily admits and as there is in many countries but in the face of this crisis the venezuelan government has focused on defending the living standards of poor and working people in 2016 during the collapse of oil prices the venezuelan government allocated 73 percent of its budget to social programs in 2017 maduro announced a new program aimed at guaranteeing jobs to young people called chamba juvenil nearly 200 000 youths enrolled in the program venezuelan youth especially those historically excluded from higher education because of poverty now enjoy free education and real opportunity thanks to 45 public universities and colleges that have been created in 20 years of the bolivarian revolution perhaps the maduro government s most impressive social program is the grand housing mission venezuela an initiative to give free or nearly free homes to every venezuelan who is in need of dignified housing at the beginning of this year the housing mission reached a new milestone 2 5 million new homes constructed and distributed to the people taking an average family size of four this means one third of venezuela s 30 million people benefiting from the program imagine the u s government which is far richer providing homes to 100 million poor people what about the medical shortages venezuela s constitution guarantees the right to medical care and more than 20 000 cuban doctors and nurses provide free care to the population with cuban venezuelan cooperation thousands of venezuelans have been trained to become the new generation of doctors but these health gains have been threatened by u s sanctions and even right wing violence targeting these facilities and doctors in 2018 venezuela s purchase order of five major medical shipments was blocked by u s banks under government order the year s vaccination program for children was delayed for five months and the country s 60 000 plus diabetics were denied insulin again because of u s sanctions why is the maduro government blocking humanitarian aid the united nations and red cross have both declared that the aid at the colombian border does not meet the definition of humanitarian which has to be neutral apolitical and requested by the receiving country why would venezuela allow the very countries that have looted its resources and treasury to now pretend to be for humanitarian aid it rightly views this as political theater to try and humiliate the government in the media and provoke it into a military conflict venezuela has not rejected aid from its international friends venezuelan health minister carlos alvarado announced last week the arrival of 933 tons of medicines and medical supplies from china cuba and the pan american health organization earlier this week president maduro announced that 300 tons of russian aid is scheduled to arrive soon this is more than 10 times the amount being offered by usaid whose director has been giving militant speeches calling for regime change in venezuela conclusion there is no need to bow before the lies about venezuela from trump bolton or senator marco rubio there is a reason that the maduro government continues to enjoy its widest support among the country s poor and working class even though they have been hit hardest by the economic crisis millions see that the government and united socialist party has consistently tried to make society more just equal participatory and independent and that is precisely why u s imperialism and the country s oligarchy are trying to strangle it
central banks are getting twitchy on average recessions have come along once a decade since the mid 1970s and the nadir of the last downturn occurred almost a decade ago the nobel prize winning economist paul krugman has predicted that there will be a recession in america by the time donald trump comes up for re election at the end of next year the darkening outlook for global growth is putting pressure on the us president to resolve his trade dispute with china when the white house announced its first tranche of protectionist measures almost a year ago hopes were high that the world economy had at last shrugged off the long hangover from the financial crisis and deep slump of 2008 09 in the months before trump went toe to toe with china s president xi jinping it was expanding strongly and the international monetary fund was talking about a synchronised upturn a year later and with the 1 march deadline for a fresh round of us tariffs fast approaching the mood has changed all of which raises three big questions 1 what is happening to the global economy official statistics in the us have been delayed as a result of the federal government shutdown but when the figures for growth in the fourth quarter of 2018 are finally released this week they are expected to show that the world s biggest economy has joined in a slowdown that is affecting europe china and a slew of other strategically important countries if the second half of 2018 provided isolated evidence that global growth had peaked the data since the turn of the year has been unambiguous all of the world s major economies look weaker than they did 12 months ago britain grew by just 0 2 in the final three months of 2018 as did the eurozone and italy is suffering its fifth recession in two decades spending by american consumers in december was weak but perhaps of more significance was the sharp pull back in manufacturing in january which fits with a picture of declining factory output elsewhere in the winter of 2008 crashing industrial production and a contraction in trade flows were signs of the depth of the global slump ominously both are again weak for countries heavily dependent on exports as a source of growth china germany japan and south korea falling demand for their goods is bad news globalisation has increased the tendency of one economy to be synchronised with all the others there was a generalised upswing in the 1990s when china was a destination for western foreign investment a growing market for exporters of commodities and industrial machinery and the source of cheap goods that kept inflation and interest rates low but the flipside of this model is that everybody suffers together when times are tough while spectacular by western standards china s growth of 6 6 in 2018 was the slowest since 1990 and weakness intensified as the year wore on china has been a key export market for germany which has only barely escaped falling into a technical recession defined as two successive quarters of negative growth the latest snapshot of manufacturing in japan pointed to a contraction in factory output announcing the international monetary fund s latest forecasts for the world economy in davos last month the fund s managing director christine lagarde said that while a recession was not around the corner the risks of a sharper decline in activity had increased policymakers should make greater efforts lagarde added to prepare for a slowdown 2 what steps are being taken in december the us central bank raised interest rates possibly for the last time this decade considered by many economists to be a huge mistake the increase to between 2 25 and 2 5 was an act of pride coming as it did after a series of tweets from trump urging the federal reserve to pause trump s tweets were deemed to be the work of a bully and in its determination to defend its independence the fed ignored the fact that on this issue the president might have had a point when its policymakers met again in january there was an almost complete u turn no longer would the fed be making three quarter point rate rises this year it would also do more to keep intact the stimulus programme it adopted in the wake of the banking crash a process known as quantitative easing qe which the fed has reduced from 4 5tn to 4tn over the past couple of years they will have a permanently gigantic balance sheet said ward mccarthy chief us financial economist at investment bank jefferies they always said it would be larger than pre crisis but earlier commentary suggested it would be significantly smaller mario draghi the head of the european central bank ecb is staring at the same data as the fed his message to the world has been as someone who was less bullish in the good times i have less reason to be panicked today view image in fullscreen paul krugman we re clearly in worse shape we came into the last crisis with rates well above zero photograph david levene the guardian at his january press conference he said the ecb was not yet ready to reverse its policy set out in december of stabilising its stimulus package he said its stock of loans would stay at 2 6tn yes he was gloomier about prospects for the eurozone economy but no he wasn t ready to change course yet in rome the coalition government comprising the far right league and radical m5s wanted him to loosen the purse strings and keep pumping out cheap money while the german government wanted the ecb to follow the fed s previous policy draghi looked calm taking the middle road in tokyo the bank of japan has remained immune to all talk of normalising monetary policy 10 years after the banking crash it has continued to expand its lending and in the past week hinted that it might even accelerate the policy to prevent japan falling into recession china meanwhile has taken a series of steps to boost spending and lending in an effort to counter the forces bringing about a dramatic slowing of consumer spending and business investment pantheon macroeconomics chief asia economist freya beamish and senior asia economist miguel chanco said last week that the people s bank of china had surreptitiously cut interest rates by using complex financial instruments we think the bank would like to make the effective rate cut overt trade talks for now are making that difficult they said 3 what if these measures are not enough central banks and finance ministries had better hope that the action taken so far will be enough to avert a recession because they will soon run out of conventional policy options in 2008 09 the response to the financial crisis was fivefold the central banks cut interest rates aggressively they pumped cheap money into their economies through qe finance ministries bailed out the banks with taxpayers money governments ran bigger budget deficits as a way of boosting growth and international cooperation kept trade flowing but today interest rates are still either zero or just about zero in most of the developed world qe has been subject to the law of diminishing returns and has proved politically controversial the public appetite for another round of bank bailouts is nonexistent government debt levels are much higher than they were a decade ago and economic nationalism is on the rise krugman said in a bloomberg interview we re clearly in worse shape we came into the last crisis with interest rates well above zero we came into the last crisis with debt substantially lower than it is now and we came into the last crisis with substantially better leadership our current treasury secretary is no hank paulson i think we re in much worse shape we probably don t have a crisis of that magnitude about to hit us god help us if we do but we re in much worse shape to deal with whatever shocks come along than we were 10 years ago central banks and finance ministries would have some options in the event of another severe downturn vicky redwood senior economic adviser at capital economics says rates could be cut to below zero qe could be expanded and governments could run even bigger deficits than they currently have serious consideration could also be given to the use of helicopter money tax cuts and public spending that are paid for by a permanent increase in the money supply by central banks almost as though the government were dropping money from the sky for citizens to spend but redwood adds a cautionary note policymakers are not powerless in the face of the next downturn indeed we expect their tools to prove adequate to cope with a relatively modest slowdown however if there was a more severe downturn we think that policymakers would be reluctant to undertake the more radical steps that would be required with a weak policy response raising the risk of a prolonged slump

morning everyone this morning i m joined by our cfo toni sanzone who will discuss our earnings guidance and balance sheet also touching upon the portfolio and i will focus on our recent transactions and the market environment as well as making some high level comments about where we are as a company we re also joined this morning by our president john park and our head of asset management brooks gordon who are available to answer questions for 2018 we were a net buyer at attractive spreads to our cost of capital in addition to the 5 9 billion of assets we acquired in our merger with cpa 17 at around a 7 cap rate we completed close to 1 billion of on balance sheet investments in 2018 primarily into industrial properties at a weighted average cap rate of 7 and with a weighted average lease term of 20 years our 2018 acquisitions and completed capital investment projects spanned 88 properties net leased to 20 tenants operating in 12 different industries and located in seven countries enhancing the diversity of our portfolio in recent years amid disruption to the retail sector we ve noticed net lease reits have increasingly emphasized the breadth of their portfolios a confirmation of our long held belief that broad diversification is the best approach to net lease investment having covered the strategic portfolio and balance sheet benefits of the cpa 17 merger on prior calls today i will focus more on our recent acquisitions we had an active last quarter of the year completing 248 million of investments consisting of eight acquisitions for 211 million along with the completion of three capital investment projects at a total cost of 37 million our fourth quarter investments were primarily into industrial assets and exemplify the types of investments we like to make critical properties on long term leases with built in growth leased to market leading tenants with growing businesses providing the potential for credit upgrades and future expansion opportunities the first was a 33 million sale leaseback of a six property portfolio with lakeshore recycling systems the largest independent waste company in illinois and wisconsin advertisement advertisement the transaction included five industrial facilities as well as their corporate headquarters all located in the greater chicago area the portfolio is under a master lease on a triple net basis for a period of 25 years with annual cpi based rent bumps second was a 31 million investment also in the greater chicago area into two properties that house the distribution warehouse and global headquarters of brake parts inc a multinational manufacturer and distributor of aftermarket automotive products the properties are triple net leased with a remaining lease term of 11 years and fixed rent increases third we completed the 41 million acquisition of a distribution facility in texas leased to orgill the world s largest independent hardware distributor which serves as its distribution center for the surrounding states in addition the transaction provides for a 14 million investment into the expansion of the facility which we expect to complete in 2019 this is a triple net lease on a 25 year term that resets upon completion of the expansion and fourth we completed a 55 million cross border investment in a three property portfolio net leased to faurecia a global leader in automotive seating interiors and emissions control technology that equips one in four vehicles sold worldwide and has approximately 20 billion in annual sales the transaction was comprised of a manufacturing facility in mexico an r d facility just outside of paris and a warehouse facility in poland these are critical assets on long term leases with lease terms of approximately 19 years for the mexican site and 15 years for the european sites they provide built in rent growth with annual uncapped cpi rent escalations with rent payable in u s dollars for the facility in mexico and euros for facilities in europe in addition to acquisitions a meaningful portion of our 2018 investment volume came from discretionary capital investment projects through follow on transactions with existing tenants during the fourth quarter we completed three projects at a total cost of 37 million this was primarily the completion of an additional 24 million build to suit expansion for nord anglia a leading global operator of k 12 private schools like the other build to suit expansions we completed with this tenant in 2018 the lease term on the existing property was reset to 25 years and includes annual uncapped cpi rent increases advertisement advertisement our larger pool of assets post merger provides us a wider opportunity set from which to source follow on transactions and we have an active pipeline of such opportunities at year end we had nine capital investment projects outstanding for an expected total investment of approximately 235 million of which 160 million is currently expected to be completed during 2019 and is therefore included in our acquisition guidance the 235 million total includes the build to suit transaction we announced earlier this week with cuisine solutions for a 75 million state of the art food production facility in texas which we expect to complete in 2020 as part of the transaction our existing lease with the tenant for its facility in virginia will be incorporated into a new master lease governing both properties and extended to a term of 26 5 years with fixed annual rent increases turning to the market environment in europe activity levels remain high with many countries experiencing record deal volume in 2018 foreign capital inflows continue to put pressure on cap rates across all geographies although interest rates have remained low and are not expected to move up rapidly allowing sufficient investment spread industrial remains the favored sector in europe high levels of construction and the tightest yields there has been a trend toward last mile and multilevel assets in proximity to large urban areas and european retail is still attracting strong investor interest there are indicators of an economic slowdown however and of course brexit continues to create uncertainty and therefore could generate opportunities particularly where a tenant s business model is less impacted by brexit or may even benefit from it in the u s deal flow remains high and sentiment is positive especially given the recent pullback in interest rates increased m a activity which is forecast to further accelerate is also creating more sale leaseback opportunities an area of the market in which we excel the industrial sector has seen massive capital inflows driving high demand and lower yields within industrial we re focusing on sale leasebacks which generally allow a yield premium to market levels for office we re seeing pockets of opportunity although we d be very selective about where we would execute with conservative underwriting and we ve generally not been excited about u s retail and continue to feel that way geographically the momentum appears to be shifting back to the u s advertisement advertisement in terms of where we are seeing the better opportunities our pipeline is strong the number of deals that fit our investment criteria has increased versus a year ago and we re also better positioned from a cost capital perspective i ll finish with some high level remarks 2018 marked an important milestone in the history of w p carey essentially completing the company s evolution from its origins as a manager of high quality net lease real estate funds to a pure play net lease reit and a significant one at that ranking as one of the largest reits in the msci us reit index real estate ownership is of course a capital intensive business that benefits from scale and efficiency and a cost of capital that provides an attractive investment spread since converting to a reit in 2012 we ve made a number of structural changes to improve the quality of our earnings and increase our operational efficiency the total market opportunity for net lease investments remains vast and we have both the expertise and resources to capitalize on it built on an investment process honed over nearly five decades our increased size also means we can absorb larger single asset or portfolio deals and m a activity this adds flexibility to our balance sheet and reduce leverage putting us in a very strong position to support our 2019 acquisitions and continue to grow real estate affo per share and with that i ll hand the call over to toni to talk more about our balance sheet earnings and guidance advertisement advertisement toni sanzone chief financial officer thank you jason good morning everyone this morning we announced affo per share of 1 33 for the fourth quarter and 5 39 for the 2018 full year this represents a 1 7 increase over our full year results for the prior year real estate affo per share for 2018 increased 3 8 to 4 39 reflecting the accretive impact of our merger with cpa 17 over the last two months of the year as well as the impact of our net acquisition volume and same store growth investment management earnings declined for the year due primarily to the elimination of advisory fees from cpa 17 in the last two months of the year as well as lower structuring revenue jason covered our fourth quarter investment activity which totaled 248 million at a weighted average cap rate of 7 this brought total investment volume for the year to 940 million also at a weighted average cap rate of 7 and with a weighted average lease term of 20 years these are going in cap rates so our expected yield will rise over time through attractive rent escalations either from fixed rent bumps or increases tied to inflation disposition volume for the full year totaled 525 million driven by 340 million of sales during the fourth quarter primarily from two transactions which helped reduce our top 10 tenant concentration and further refined our geographic focus while also achieving great execution exiting the properties at a weighted average cap rate of 6 8 first we sold nine do it yourself retail properties in germany for 180 million which we discussed in our last earnings call allowing us to harvest value created within the portfolio while also proactively managing our overall diversification second we continue to execute on our strategy to focus the portfolio on the u s advertisement advertisement and northern and western europe specifically we sold a portfolio of 28 properties in australia for 146 million taking advantage of strong market conditions to opportunistically exit our australian assets at a cap rate significantly tighter than where we purchased them same store rent was 1 4 higher year over year on a constant currency basis the definition of same store properties excludes acquisitions and the properties we acquired in the cpa 17 merger until we have owned them for 12 months however cpa 17 assets have rent escalators very similar to our existing portfolio and once included we fully expect our same store rent growth on a combined basis to be in line with our premerger portfolio by investing outside of the commodity segment of net lease we have assembled a portfolio with 99 of abr coming from leases with built in rent growth at year end 64 of our abr had rent escalators in the leases linked to cpi while 32 had fixed increases as we ve discussed on prior calls the assets we acquired in the cpa 17 merger are well aligned with our existing portfolio whether by geography tenant industry or property type maintaining broad diversity we ended 2018 with 63 of abr coming from net lease properties in the u s and 35 in europe industrial properties including warehouse facilities represented 44 of abr at year end this is followed by office properties representing 26 up very slightly as a result of the merger retail assets represented 18 of abr at year end with the vast majority in europe and with tenants we view as less prone to disruption from e commerce europe continues to have significantly lower retail square foot per capita and higher barriers to development relative to the u s our top 10 tenant concentration has been noticeably reduced as a result of the merger representing 23 5 of total abr at the end of 2018 compared to 30 7 just prior to closing the transaction that s a meaningful decrease enhancing our diversification and thereby lowering portfolio risk advertisement advertisement it also positions us with one of the lowest top 10 concentrations in the net lease peer group moving to our capitalization and balance sheet during 2018 we raised approximately 1 5 billion in long term and permanent capital through our capital markets activities this included two 500 million euro denominated bond offerings in march and october of 2018 with a weighted average coupon rate just under 2 2 and around an 8 5 year term net proceeds partially funded our european acquisitions thereby naturally hedging euro currency risk as well as advancing our unsecured debt strategy we utilized our atm program during the fourth quarter and in the first quarter of this year to efficiently raise approximately 350 million of equity at a weighted average stock price of just under 70 per share our atm activity along with our merger which was an all stock transaction has deleveraging impact on our balance sheet enables us to enter 2019 in a position of balance sheet strength we ended the year with debt to gross assets at 42 8 and net debt to ebitda at 5 8 times we have a well laddered series of debt maturities with just 74 million of debt maturing in 2019 and limited floating rate debt relative to the size of our overall balance sheet we remain committed to our unsecured debt strategy and while secured debt as a percentage of gross assets increased moderately as a result of the mortgages on the cpa 17 properties we acquired ending the year at 18 3 we view this as temporary as we have a clear path to reducing secured debt with minimal frictional costs by continuing to repay mortgages as they come due we ve conservatively managed our balance sheet to ensure ample liquidity which at year end stood just over 1 6 billion in conjunction with our disposition pipeline this ensures we re well positioned to execute on the acquisition volume in our guidance while maintaining maximum flexibility to access the capital markets when it s advantageous to do so turning now to guidance for 2019 we expect to generate total affo of between 4 95 and 5 15 per share and real estate affo of between 4 70 and 4 90 per share at the midpoint of our guidance range we expect real estate affo per share to increase almost 10 year over year reflecting the full year impact of the merger with cpa 17 our guidance assumes investment volume of between 750 million and 1 25 billion which includes capital investment projects such as expansions with existing tenants and build to suits it also assumes dispositions of between 500 million and 700 million including the 250 million new york times we purchased during the fourth quarter advertisement advertisement we expect g a expense to increase moderately in 2019 to between 75 million and 80 million due to the elimination of expense reimbursements previously received from cpa 17 while we lose the benefit of those reimbursements we are operating much more efficiently on the same platform with a very scalable business model as illustrated by the significant decline in g a as a percentage of both assets and revenue compared to premerger levels we anticipate our investment management business will represent approximately 5 of our 2019 total affo reflecting both the full year impact of the cpa 17 merger on our advisory fees and our expectation that structuring revenue will have virtually no impact on our overall earnings we re extremely pleased with the improvement we are seeing in the quality of our earnings which we believe is being reflected in the expansion of our affo trading multiple creating value for our shareholders and lowering our cost of capital this increases the spreads we can achieve and expands the pool of investment opportunities that are accretive to earnings thereby enhancing our ability to grow real estate affo per share and with that i ll hand the call back to the operator to take questions questions and answers operator our first question today is coming from anthony paolone from jpmorgan anthony paolone j p morgan analyst my first question is as it relates to just the deal pipeline as you look into 2019 if you can comment on whether you re seeing more m a type transactions or one offs and also similarly on the transaction side can you give us a sense as to how your acquisition volume and your guidance for 2019 compares to what historically you ve done when you combine both the fund business and the reit balance sheet jason fox chief executive officer right ok let me start with kind of pipeline and how we characterize it i would say that it consists mostly of sale leasebacks and build to suits some of which are associated with m a activity and we have seen out in the market increased m a activity and i think projections from various sources would suggest that that s going to accelerate throughout the year so while some of the sale leasebacks in our portfolio or pipeline are now m a related i think you can expect more of that to happen throughout the year in terms of geography we re seeing a little bit more opportunity right now in the u s relative to years past i think some of that could be attributed to a little bit of the slowdown in europe but i think it s more attributed to some of the growth dynamics that we re seeing in the u s right now again some of which is m a activity but more of it is along the lines of growth with the companies whether through expansions wanting to access capital through sale leasebacks and in build to suits in some cases as well the last question about where our pipeline or where our guidance for that matter is relative to years past especially when we ve done some mergers i m not so certain it really correlates with the mergers at all but our guidance and our pipeline for that matter are stronger than they have been over the last several years i think you probably have to go back to maybe 2014 and 2015 years in which across the w p carey group we did about 3 5 billion of net lease transactions during that two year period anthony paolone j p morgan analyst ok and then in the guidance is there much impact assumed from currency and also any thoughts on where leverage ran sort of at the end of 2019 toni sanzone chief financial officer sure let me start with the currency in terms of what we re projecting now we re looking at the current rates basically flowing through our guidance projection so with the euro at usd 1 13 expecting that to carry through but i ll say that we are very well hedged and feel comfortable that any movement in the euro would have a very minimal impact on our earnings at this point i think you can kind of translate it to a 10 movement in the euro wouldn t move earnings by more than 1 and then just in terms of your question on leverage i d say we were happy to be able to bring our leverage down with the atm execution in the fourth quarter and earlier this year our target leverage levels continue to be in the mid 40 range on the on debt to gross assets and in the mid to high 5s on net debt to ebitda so i think again we re comfortable at those levels and we gave ourselves a little bit of room with the activity that we did on the atm operator our next question today is coming from todd stender from wells fargo todd stender wells fargo securities analyst just wanted to flesh out the self storage acquisition was this taking at a partner in a jv i noticed the 90 noncontrolling interest if you could just provide more color on that jason fox chief executive officer yes sure this actually was the second component of a portfolio of self storage assets that cpa 17 had bought earlier in the year prior to the merger and so this was just the end of that transaction that closed post merger which is why it shows up as part of our acquisition volume in the fourth quarter and it was a 90 10 joint venture with extra space who is our property manager as well todd stender wells fargo securities analyst ok so are they out and you own it wholly owned at this point jason fox chief executive officer no they re still our jv partner they still have a 10 interest correct todd stender wells fargo securities analyst are they managing it as well jason fox chief executive officer they are todd stender wells fargo securities analyst ok got it can you provide pricing on that and are these stabilized assets jason fox chief executive officer brooks do you have any color on that brooks gordon head of asset management these are not stabilized assets so they are in various stages of lease up right now and we expect those to stabilize over the coming quarters todd stender wells fargo securities analyst any yield expectations any color you can provide around that brooks gordon head of asset management hard to say now i mean it really depends on how the lease up goes but it s going according to plan and we re continuing to focus on the lease up there jason fox chief executive officer yes i think for round numbers in the sixes that s kind of our expectation on a stabilized cap rate basis todd stender wells fargo securities analyst ok and then just moving to dispositions guidance could push up to 700 million where are these coming from are these cpa 17 assets and maybe just some of the characteristics of what you are selling brooks gordon head of asset management sure this is brooks again the guidance is 500 million to 700 million dispositions that does include the new york times at 250 million so that s really the big chunk in terms of deal type about 50 of that at the low end is purchase option from new york times maybe 30 is what we would call non core some of which came over in cpa 17 so for example operating hotel as well as an asset in japan and those are really the main buckets it s not as toni mentioned the cpa 17 portfolio fits very very nicely with w p carey s existing portfolio so there s not a huge amount of required cleanup there operator our next question is coming from manny korchman from citi manny korchman citi analyst jason maybe you could help us just think about yield expectations on both the total pipeline of acquisitions and dispositions especially in light of you discussing some competitive markets globally jason fox chief executive officer right sure i ll let brooks touch on dispositions but in terms of the acquisition i think in the u s especially with our lower cost of capital we re targeting deals in the low sixes and into the sevens i would say in europe it s in that range perhaps 25 basis points lower given the lower borrowing costs which should allow us to achieve meaningful spreads and if you look at it historically i think 2018 our weighted average cap rate was in and around 7 and if you look back to the last couple of years it s probably fallen within very close to that range as well so that s probably something that we would hope to expect this year to achieve but i think it all depends on market conditions brooks gordon head of asset management and on the disposition front we expect the all in execution to be roughly in line with where we re acquiring assets in that 7 low 7 cap rate range and i ll just add that on the discretionary capex component of the investment volume we have seen and continue to expect to see a meaningful premium to marketed investments from a cap rate perspective manny korchman citi analyst and then is there or are there any other sort of pipeline deals similar to what you discussed with the storage assets that are built into either cpa 17 or the core portfolio that are sort of just lined up and waiting to close rather than you trying to find opportunities jason fox chief executive officer well i mean i wouldn t say that they re related to the cpa 17 acquisition i think that cpa 17 was fully invested in the self storage portfolio that was the transaction throughout the year in 2018 was a bit unique but in terms of the pipeline we do have an active pipeline it s across geographies and asset classes a lot of them as i mentioned before are build to suits and i should add to the cap rate question you asked that when we re doing these sale leasebacks and build to suits we re typically getting on average call it 50 to 100 basis points premium to where we think these assets would trade in the market so i want to give you a sense of what a 7 cap rate may look like in terms of the risk profile especially given how we source them and of course our pipeline also includes expansion opportunities and other capital investment projects within the portfolio some of which are part of cpa 17 acquired assets i guess there is some correlation there again those type of transactions we tend to have a lot of leverage on structure and pricing so those tend to be higher yielding investments all else being equal we also tend to get the benefit of extended lease terms on the leases that are encumbering those existing assets so i think all positive operator our next question is coming from chris lucas from capital one securities chris lucas capital one securities analyst just a couple of quick questions for you just jason on the maybe just touching on the acquisition perspective for 2019 do you have a sense as to how much potentially could come from existing customers versus new customers jason fox chief executive officer i mean our pipeline right now of active projects is a little under or i shouldn t say pipeline our current active projects is a little under 250 million i think about 160 million of that is expected to close this year and would be included in our acquisition volume for the year brooks do you want to kind of talk more generally about what we re targeting and what you can expect from capital investment projects brooks gordon head of asset management sure i mean i think to emphasize the one of the benefits of bringing on cpa 17 is that substantially opens up that pool of target opportunities we re very focused on it proactively meeting with tenants and identifying tenants that have a need to grow so we expect that to be a meaningful opportunity set over the next few years kind of in the range of the 200 million ish range which is currently in the discretionary capex we expect that to be a good working number for the next few years chris lucas capital one securities analyst ok great and then jason just maybe refresh my memory as it relates to how you guys are thinking about the self storage portfolio from a core non core basis and what your views are in terms of the holding period for it jason fox chief executive officer yes sure as we ve talked about in the past i mean we are focused on being a pure play net lease reit so we re not long term holders of operating properties like storage but it is an asset class that we know well it s a high quality portfolio so we re going to be patient with what we decide to do there we are currently evaluating a number of options but there s really nothing more to report at this point in time chris lucas capital one securities analyst ok and then toni just on the debt maturity profile there s certainly more mortgage debt today than premerger in terms of the overall pro rata share there s also a fair amount of it due over the next several years but at rates that look pretty reasonable in terms of a mark to market i guess the question i have is what sort of capacity do you have within the overall balance sheet from a refi perspective that would allow you to sort of refi that mortgage debt with eurobonds which are obviously significantly lower cost right now toni sanzone chief financial officer yes i mean i think just starting with the mortgage debt in general as you mentioned it is maturing over a couple of years and even if we were to pay that down as they mature we d expect to bring our secured debt back in line with where it was premerger levels within a couple of years in terms of opportunity to bring that forward we re certainly always evaluating that i think for us we evaluate that against kind of the cost to break that at any point in time but in terms of the overall leverage euro versus u s we did see the cpa 17 merger coming on at the time that we did our last eurobond issuance in october and certainly took that into account so we increased our euro leverage a bit there i think we re comfortable with the euro leverage levels we have now but there is still a bit more room should we choose to do that again it would be certainly market driven and as i ve mentioned needs to have sort of a catalyst to want to bring forward that debt at that point in time operator our next question today is coming from greg mcginniss from scotiabank greg mcginniss scotiabank analyst brooks just want to dig into your comment on the 30 dispositions focused on non core assets a bit is the plan to hold onto the eastern european assets from cpa 17 and could this geography potentially be an area of additional investments from wpc brooks gordon head of asset management so first of all specifically to my comment those assets are not baked into that number that s a very small component of the whole important to note that those are high quality properties with long term leases and good credit tenants i think that s about 3 of total abr and so while those aren t target markets from a new investment perspective we re certainly comfortable holding those assets and we do like the investments themselves and over time we can be opportunistic with those should we choose to exit those in the future but those aren t in the 2019 disposition guidance greg mcginniss scotiabank analyst ok and toni as the stock continues to trade near all time highs how are you thinking about atm usage in 2019 and you spoke about this a bit but i m just trying to get a sense for your thoughts on leverage versus earnings dilution at this point and also are there any additional issuances baked in the guidance toni sanzone chief financial officer yes like we said we re very happy with the equity we ve raised on our atm since december we were able to issue capital pretty attractively priced relative to where we can invest accretively and we also had the benefit of increased trading volume in our shares which we d hoped to achieve as a result of the cpa 17 merger so our ability to take advantage of that did a couple of things for us it reduced our leverage bringing our net debt to ebitda back down to under 6x which is well ahead of what we initially expected and it allowed us to prefund some of our expected acquisition activity so right now our balance sheet strength leaves us well positioned with the flexibility to act opportunistically we don t necessarily need to have an issuance of additional capital this year which is what our guidance assumes but we ll continue to evaluate the opportunity relative to our capital needs greg mcginniss scotiabank analyst ok yes so guidance is not assuming any additional issuances and jason just a final question here could you just give a few details on the decline in occupancy since q2 was that related to a specific tenant are you looking to sell those vacant properties are they making good releasing opportunities jason fox chief executive officer i ll let brooks cover that brooks gordon head of asset management sure yes the pickup in vacancy really relates to a portfolio of former bon ton locations retail stores which we do intend to sell important to note that one of those is a very high quality located warehouse in allentown pennsylvania and we re in the process of working to redevelop that into a much larger facility which will be a class a warehouse facility and we re working through the permitting process now and we expect that to be a very good outcome operator our next question today is coming from john massocca from ladenburg thalmann john massocca ladenburg thalmann analyst can you maybe provide some additional color on what drove the sale of the australia assets leased to inghams just a little bit maybe curious because you only purchased those about four years ago and i know you got kind of a decent return even when factoring in the ti dollars or sorry the capex dollars you spent there but is that just a simplification of the story or was it something where you felt like these assets were as valuable as they ever were going to get or just maybe some color there would be helpful brooks gordon head of asset management sure this is brooks again we did exit the inghams portfolio which completes our exit from australia so there s certainly a simplification aspect to the deal itself but i will add it was a fantastic outcome we realized on the order of 100 or 250 basis points of cap rate compression over about a four and half year hold so fantastic performing asset for us it s just australia is not a target market of ours we don t have scale there and it s certainly much more difficult to manage from afar but that said it was an opportunistic exit and we re very satisfied with the deal itself jason fox chief executive officer and let me just add quickly that deal was done it was a sale leaseback as part of an m a transaction so i think it s a good example of how we re able to generate significant yield premium through the structuring of sale leasebacks especially alongside private equity firms in m a transactions and that 250 basis point compression i think some of that was on the upfront structuring some of it was the markets there got stronger and i think this tenant also improved its credit i think that s all part of our thesis on how we invest on and the result was a great return i mean a very high returning asset for a four five year hold john massocca ladenburg thalmann analyst do you have a general irr on the hold brooks gordon head of asset management that was about 15 unlevered irr over that four and a half year hold period john massocca ladenburg thalmann analyst ok and then looking at kind of page 14 of the supp tenant improvements and operating expenses or non maintenance capital expenditures to operating properties were maybe a little high this quarter versus some past quarters especially when it seems like not a lot of that was maybe tied to lease renewals and extensions done in the quarter so maybe kind of what drove that brooks gordon head of asset management sure so there s a couple different buckets there this is brooks on the nondiscretionary capex piece the tis about 4 million or thereabouts was the actual funding of tenant improvement allowance from a deal we actually entered into in 2017 and was just funded in this particular quarter an office long term new lease with a new tenant on the non maintenance front there s another line item there which relates to one of our operating hotels that s going through a renovation i believe that s about the 6 3 million number and that s one of the assets which we expect to sell this year but we will complete the renovation as well so that s really the kind of noise in that number this quarter john massocca ladenburg thalmann analyst makes sense and then lastly given we re kind of getting to a point here where cwi one is kind of laid out as target for potentially seeking a liquidity event and i know you guys do lay out kind of the exact terms of your back end fees on page 43 of the supp but have you started kind of formulating maybe kind of a range of what the financial benefit of a potential sale is to w p carey or is it just too early for that right now toni sanzone chief financial officer well i think at this point as you mentioned the process that the directors are running is one that they re focused on we don t have a whole lot of involvement in the direction that that will take so i think it s certainly premature at this point to kind of put any dollar value in terms of where we see that benefiting us and we ve mentioned we wouldn t bring those assets on our balance sheet given they re lodging assets but i m not sure there s much more there that we can assume at this point operator our next question is coming from sheila mcgrath from evercore sheila mcgrath evercore isi analyst i was just wondering if you could update us on if anything meaningful changed in the assumptions on the asset management aspect in terms of what the winding down fees if anything changed there toni sanzone chief financial officer in terms of the investment management business sheila mcgrath evercore isi analyst exactly toni sanzone chief financial officer no at this point sheila i think we somewhere in the supplemental in the back we lay out the remaining four funds that we have our assumption is that we ll continue to manage those through 2019 that s what s reflected at guidance as i mentioned with the cpa 17 going away that comes down to a much less meaningful portion of our total results so about 5 and i think if you looked at even the q4 total the asset management fees and our interest in the fund that s probably a reasonable run rate for where we expect that to go for the rest of this year sheila mcgrath evercore isi analyst ok great and then could you update us on the tenant watch list are there any meaningful tenants or just update us on the current watch list that would be great brooks gordon head of asset management sure this is brooks credit quality is very good right now and in fact improves overall with the acquisition of cpa 17 as you can see in the supplemental investment grade increases to 29 from a watch list perspective it s pretty stable the primary tenant we have on there which we discussed in the past is the agrokor portfolio we re making a lot of progress working through restructure with them and we expect that to come off the watch list soon too early to report any details but we do expect to realize some upside relative to the 50 haircut we underwrote when acquiring the assets and that s fully baked into our guidance range sheila mcgrath evercore isi analyst is the 50 you closed on the asset at the 50 rental brooks gordon head of asset management so the 11 6 million that s flowing through abr represents a 50 haircut and reserved to contract rent and so we expect some upside relative to that sheila mcgrath evercore isi analyst perfect and then could you just remind us the exact closing date of the new york times for modeling purposes brooks gordon head of asset management december 1 sheila mcgrath evercore isi analyst ok and then capital expenditure outlook in terms of tis for this year kind of versus historical brooks gordon head of asset management i think the way to think about tis is it s certainly very deal specific it s hard to handicap an exact number because in certain deals we ll take a very capital light approach and in others we ll choose to invest a lot more capital so i hesitate to handicap that with a very specific number but i will on the maintenance front that will tick up somewhat with the addition of the operating properties again which jason mentioned in the long run those aren t assets we will own as operating properties operator our next question is coming from john massocca from ladenburg thalmann john massocca ladenburg thalmann analyst just a quick follow up and i know it s fallen out of the top 10 here with the close of the merger with cpa 17 but universal technical institute which was in the top 10 previously has kind of talked about potentially restructuring how it views its real estate and is there any potential downside to your guys holdings of them there or do you think you have a pretty secure investment with those guys brooks gordon head of asset management well we have a diversified portfolio of campuses with them again as you noted it is becoming a less meaningful part of our total and falling out of the top 10 and we re presently working through restructuring leases with them kind of one by one so nothing kind of material we already did one of them and extended that and working on the others so each campus is different but we re making good progress working with them operator at this time i m not showing any further questions i ll hand the call back to mr sands peter sands director of institutional investor relations thank you everyone for your interest in w p carey if anyone has additional questions

positive developments in trade talks between the world s two largest economies should boost riskier assets according to julian brigden managing partner at hedge fund consultant macro intelligence 2 partners the 53 year old wall street veteran who s been mostly bearish on securities from developing nations since 2014 said extended u s china negotiations are slightly positive for the asset class meantime they will probably lead to a weaker dollar supporting oil prices and other riskier securities this is the start of the next big dollar down leg he said adding that brazil s real could be one asset to benefit it s absolutely the time to buy risk brigden who made a prescient bet against emerging market equities within two days of their 2015 high said he began advising hedge fund clients to go long risk assets at the beginning of the year developing nation shares have rallied 9 7 percent during that span while currencies from russia to chile and colombia climbed against the dollar donald trump speaking friday at the white house alongside chinese vice premier liu he and members of his own cabinet said a march 1 deadline for higher tariffs may get pushed back a month or so if both sides make progress brigden said easing trade tensions coupled with a weaker dollar and a pause in the federal reserve s tightening cycle may boost assets from the developing world the comparative period is january 2016 when janet yellen wobbled and backed away from hikes he said here s what other investors and strategists had to say samy muaddi a money manager at t rowe price group in baltimore a u s china trade deal almost in any form will be a material positive for em assets still lack the ever important details but the initial knee jerk reaction higher in risk assets is sensible remains positive on em assets in 2019 for many other reasons but incremental news flow would be welcomed while there would be a halo for all em assets those in particular which stand to benefit include chinese equities chinese high yield property bonds and asian currencies including idr and krw gorky urquieta a money manager at neuberger berman in atlanta deal helps support emerging market bulls there s not massive upside in em but the base case was probably extended negotiations beyond march 1 this seems a little more than that but we need to see details of what s agreed to so far and what s pending south korean won brazilian real mexican peso and south african rand could benefit sonja gibbs senior director at institute of international finance in washington assuming the headline news on a deal is backed up with credible content em equities could do some catching up em would benefit more broadly particularly em asia a greater degree of certainty about the outlook for global trade would lay a solid foundation for trade reliant em economies lu yu senior emerging market money manager at allianz global investors the final announcement will be a boost to the market sentiment but we believe the key driver of em will be the fed s action on interest rates if there are no more hikes from the fed we expect the u s dollar to weaken further and em to rally monetary loosening and fiscal policy support in china will probably stabilize economic growth to shore up the market even more kathryn rooney vera head of research at bulltick in miami a deal with china will make em fly she recommends the msci em index china and brazil stocks as well as argentine equities and fixed income roberto sanchez dahl money manager at manulife asset management in boston if talks are delayed em will trade more on sentiment towards china growth outlook and ability of government stimulus to stabilize it he doesn t expect the issue with china to be resolved in the coming weeks and says the key risk is if trump wants to claim a win just by selling more soybeans while all the other issues remain unresolved michael roche strategist at seaport global holdings in new york to the extent that the agreement deals with post trade agreement currency policy then that is constructive for asian currencies extended deadline is hard to read with regard to impact on em jim craige co cio of stone harbor investment partners in new york an actual deal would take away an uncertainty which could have negatively impacted global growth and as a result should be viewed positively all risk assets would benefit particularly commodity sensitive currencies including the south african rand and assets from angola and zambia peter cecchini chief market strategist at cantor fitzgerald lp in new york

upon the portfolio and i will focus on our recent transactions and the market environment as well as making some high level comments about where we are as a company we re also joined this morning by our president john park and our head of asset management brooks gordon who are available to answer questions for 2018 we were a net buyer at attractive spreads to our cost of capital in addition to the 5 9 billion of assets we acquired in our merger with cpa 17 at around a 7 cap rate we completed close to 1 billion of on balance sheet investments in 2018 primarily into industrial properties at a weighted average cap rate of 7 and with a weighted average lease term of 20 years our 2018 acquisitions and completed capital investment projects spanned 88 properties net leased to 20 tenants operating in 12 different industries and located in seven countries enhancing the diversity of our portfolio in recent years amid disruption to the retail sector we ve noticed net lease reits have increasingly emphasized the breadth of their portfolios a confirmation of our long held belief that broad diversification is the best approach to net lease investment having covered the strategic portfolio and balance sheet benefits of the cpa 17 merger on prior calls today i will focus more on our recent acquisitions we had an active last quarter of the year completing 248 million of investments consisting of eight acquisitions for 211 million along with the completion of three capital investment projects at a total cost of 37 million our fourth quarter investments were primarily into industrial assets and exemplify the types of investments we like to make critical properties on long term leases with built in growth leased to market leading tenants with growing businesses providing the potential for credit upgrades and future expansion opportunities the first was a 33 million sale leaseback of a six property portfolio with lakeshore recycling systems the largest independent waste company in illinois and wisconsin the transaction included five industrial facilities as well as their corporate headquarters all located in the greater chicago area the portfolio is under a master lease on a triple net basis for a period of 25 years with annual cpi based rent bumps second was a 31 million investment also in the greater chicago area into two properties that house the distribution warehouse and global headquarters of brake parts inc a multinational manufacturer and distributor of aftermarket automotive products the properties are triple net leased with a remaining lease term of 11 years and fixed rent increases third we completed the 41 million acquisition of a distribution facility in texas leased to orgill the world s largest independent hardware distributor which serves as its distribution center for the surrounding states in addition the transaction provides for a 14 million investment into the expansion of the facility which we expect to complete in 2019 this is a triple net lease on a 25 year term that resets upon completion of the expansion and fourth we completed a 55 million cross border investment in a three property portfolio net leased to faurecia a global leader in automotive seating interiors and emissions control technology that equips one in four vehicles sold worldwide and has approximately 20 billion in annual sales the transaction was comprised of a manufacturing facility in mexico an r d facility just outside of paris and a warehouse facility in poland these are critical assets on long term leases with lease terms of approximately 19 years for the mexican site and 15 years for the european sites they provide built in rent growth with annual uncapped cpi rent escalations with rent payable in u s dollars for the facility in mexico and euros for facilities in europe in addition to acquisitions a meaningful portion of our 2018 investment volume came from discretionary capital investment projects through follow on transactions with existing tenants during the fourth quarter we completed three projects at a total cost of 37 million this was primarily the completion of an additional 24 million build to suit expansion for nord anglia a leading global operator of k 12 private schools like the other build to suit expansions we completed with this tenant in 2018 the lease term on the existing property was reset to 25 years and includes annual uncapped cpi rent increases our larger pool of assets post merger provides us a wider opportunity set from which to source follow on transactions and we have an active pipeline of such opportunities at year end we had nine capital investment projects outstanding for an expected total investment of approximately 235 million of which 160 million is currently expected to be completed during 2019 and is therefore included in our acquisition guidance the 235 million total includes the build to suit transaction we announced earlier this week with cuisine solutions for a 75 million state of the art food production facility in texas which we expect to complete in 2020 as part of the transaction our existing lease with the tenant for its facility in virginia will be incorporated into a new master lease governing both properties and extended to a term of 26 5 years with fixed annual rent increases turning to the market environment in europe activity levels remain high with many countries experiencing record deal volume in 2018 foreign capital inflows continue to put pressure on cap rates across all geographies although interest rates have remained low and are not expected to move up rapidly allowing sufficient investment spread industrial remains the favored sector in europe high levels of construction and the tightest yields there has been a trend toward last mile and multilevel assets in proximity to large urban areas and european retail is still attracting strong investor interest there are indicators of an economic slowdown however and of course brexit continues to create uncertainty and therefore could generate opportunities particularly where a tenant s business model is less impacted by brexit or may even benefit from it in the u s deal flow remains high and sentiment is positive especially given the recent pullback in interest rates increased m a activity which is forecast to further accelerate is also creating more sale leaseback opportunities an area of the market in which we excel the industrial sector has seen massive capital inflows driving high demand and lower yields within industrial we re focusing on sale leasebacks which generally allow a yield premium to market levels for office we re seeing pockets of opportunity although we d be very selective about where we would execute with conservative underwriting and we ve generally not been excited about u s retail and continue to feel that way geographically the momentum appears to be shifting back to the u s in terms of where we are seeing the better opportunities our pipeline is strong the number of deals that fit our investment criteria has increased versus a year ago and we re also better positioned from a cost capital perspective i ll finish with some high level remarks 2018 marked an important milestone in the history of w p carey essentially completing the company s evolution from its origins as a manager of high quality net lease real estate funds to a pure play net lease reit and a significant one at that ranking as one of the largest reits in the msci us reit index real estate ownership is of course a capital intensive business that benefits from scale and efficiency and a cost of capital that provides an attractive investment spread since converting to a reit in 2012 we ve made a number of structural changes to improve the quality of our earnings and increase our operational efficiency the total market opportunity for net lease investments remains vast and we have both the expertise and resources to capitalize on it built on an investment process honed over nearly five decades our increased size also means we can absorb larger single asset or portfolio deals and m a activity this adds flexibility to our balance sheet and reduce leverage putting us in a very strong position to support our 2019 acquisitions and continue to grow real estate affo per share and with that i ll hand the call over to toni to talk more about our balance sheet earnings and guidance toni sanzone chief financial officer thank you jason good morning everyone this morning we announced affo per share of 1 33 for the fourth quarter and 5 39 for the 2018 full year this represents a 1 7 increase over our full year results for the prior year real estate affo per share for 2018 increased 3 8 to 4 39 reflecting the accretive impact of our merger with cpa 17 over the last two months of the year as well as the impact of our net acquisition volume and same store growth investment management earnings declined for the year due primarily to the elimination of advisory fees from cpa 17 in the last two months of the year as well as lower structuring revenue jason covered our fourth quarter investment activity which totaled 248 million at a weighted average cap rate of 7 this brought total investment volume for the year to 940 million also at a weighted average cap rate of 7 and with a weighted average lease term of 20 years these are going in cap rates so our expected yield will rise over time through attractive rent escalations either from fixed rent bumps or increases tied to inflation disposition volume for the full year totaled 525 million driven by 340 million of sales during the fourth quarter primarily from two transactions which helped reduce our top 10 tenant concentration and further refined our geographic focus while also achieving great execution exiting the properties at a weighted average cap rate of 6 8 first we sold nine do it yourself retail properties in germany for 180 million which we discussed in our last earnings call allowing us to harvest value created within the portfolio while also proactively managing our overall diversification second we continue to execute on our strategy to focus the portfolio on the u s and northern and western europe specifically we sold a portfolio of 28 properties in australia for 146 million taking advantage of strong market conditions to opportunistically exit our australian assets at a cap rate significantly tighter than where we purchased them same store rent was 1 4 higher year over year on a constant currency basis the definition of same store properties excludes acquisitions and the properties we acquired in the cpa 17 merger until we have owned them for 12 months however cpa 17 assets have rent escalators very similar to our existing portfolio and once included we fully expect our same store rent growth on a combined basis to be in line with our premerger portfolio by investing outside of the commodity segment of net lease we have assembled a portfolio with 99 of abr coming from leases with built in rent growth at year end 64 of our abr had rent escalators in the leases linked to cpi while 32 had fixed increases as we ve discussed on prior calls the assets we acquired in the cpa 17 merger are well aligned with our existing portfolio whether by geography tenant industry or property type maintaining broad diversity we ended 2018 with 63 of abr coming from net lease properties in the u s and 35 in europe industrial properties including warehouse facilities represented 44 of abr at year end this is followed by office properties representing 26 up very slightly as a result of the merger retail assets represented 18 of abr at year end with the vast majority in europe and with tenants we view as less prone to disruption from e commerce europe continues to have significantly lower retail square foot per capita and higher barriers to development relative to the u s our top 10 tenant concentration has been noticeably reduced as a result of the merger representing 23 5 of total abr at the end of 2018 compared to 30 7 just prior to closing the transaction that s a meaningful decrease enhancing our diversification and thereby lowering portfolio risk it also positions us with one of the lowest top 10 concentrations in the net lease peer group moving to our capitalization and balance sheet during 2018 we raised approximately 1 5 billion in long term and permanent capital through our capital markets activities this included two 500 million euro denominated bond offerings in march and october of 2018 with a weighted average coupon rate just under 2 2 and around an 8 5 year term net proceeds partially funded our european acquisitions thereby naturally hedging euro currency risk as well as advancing our unsecured debt strategy we utilized our atm program during the fourth quarter and in the first quarter of this year to efficiently raise approximately 350 million of equity at a weighted average stock price of just under 70 per share our atm activity along with our merger which was an all stock transaction has deleveraging impact on our balance sheet enables us to enter 2019 in a position of balance sheet strength we ended the year with debt to gross assets at 42 8 and net debt to ebitda at 5 8 times we have a well laddered series of debt maturities with just 74 million of debt maturing in 2019 and limited floating rate debt relative to the size of our overall balance sheet we remain committed to our unsecured debt strategy and while secured debt as a percentage of gross assets increased moderately as a result of the mortgages on the cpa 17 properties we acquired ending the year at 18 3 we view this as temporary as we have a clear path to reducing secured debt with minimal frictional costs by continuing to repay mortgages as they come due we ve conservatively managed our balance sheet to ensure ample liquidity which at year end stood just over 1 6 billion in conjunction with our disposition pipeline this ensures we re well positioned to execute on the acquisition volume in our guidance while maintaining maximum flexibility to access the capital markets when it s advantageous to do so turning now to guidance for 2019 we expect to generate total affo of between 4 95 and 5 15 per share and real estate affo of between 4 70 and 4 90 per share at the midpoint of our guidance range we expect real estate affo per share to increase almost 10 year over year reflecting the full year impact of the merger with cpa 17 our guidance assumes investment volume of between 750 million and 1 25 billion which includes capital investment projects such as expansions with existing tenants and build to suits it also assumes dispositions of between 500 million and 700 million including the 250 million new york times we purchased during the fourth quarter we expect g a expense to increase moderately in 2019 to between 75 million and 80 million due to the elimination of expense reimbursements previously received from cpa 17 while we lose the benefit of those reimbursements we are operating much more efficiently on the same platform with a very scalable business model as illustrated by the significant decline in g a as a percentage of both assets and revenue compared to premerger levels we anticipate our investment management business will represent approximately 5 of our 2019 total affo reflecting both the full year impact of the cpa 17 merger on our advisory fees and our expectation that structuring revenue will have virtually no impact on our overall earnings we re extremely pleased with the improvement we are seeing in the quality of our earnings which we believe is being reflected in the expansion of our affo trading multiple creating value for our shareholders and lowering our cost of capital this increases the spreads we can achieve and expands the pool of investment opportunities that are accretive to earnings thereby enhancing our ability to grow real estate affo per share and with that i ll hand the call back to the operator to take questions questions and answers operator our first question today is coming from anthony paolone from jpmorgan anthony paolone j p morgan analyst my first question is as it relates to just the deal pipeline as you look into 2019 if you can comment on whether you re seeing more m a type transactions or one offs and also similarly on the transaction side can you give us a sense as to how your acquisition volume and your guidance for 2019 compares to what historically you ve done when you combine both the fund business and the reit balance sheet jason fox chief executive officer right ok let me start with kind of pipeline and how we characterize it i would say that it consists mostly of sale leasebacks and build to suits some of which are associated with m a activity and we have seen out in the market increased m a activity and i think projections from various sources would suggest that that s going to accelerate throughout the year so while some of the sale leasebacks in our portfolio or pipeline are now m a related i think you can expect more of that to happen throughout the year in terms of geography we re seeing a little bit more opportunity right now in the u s relative to years past i think some of that could be attributed to a little bit of the slowdown in europe but i think it s more attributed to some of the growth dynamics that we re seeing in the u s right now again some of which is m a activity but more of it is along the lines of growth with the companies whether through expansions wanting to access capital through sale leasebacks and in build to suits in some cases as well the last question about where our pipeline or where our guidance for that matter is relative to years past especially when we ve done some mergers i m not so certain it really correlates with the mergers at all but our guidance and our pipeline for that matter are stronger than they have been over the last several years i think you probably have to go back to maybe 2014 and 2015 years in which across the w p carey group we did about 3 5 billion of net lease transactions during that two year period anthony paolone j p morgan analyst ok and then in the guidance is there much impact assumed from currency and also any thoughts on where leverage ran sort of at the end of 2019 toni sanzone chief financial officer sure let me start with the currency in terms of what we re projecting now we re looking at the current rates basically flowing through our guidance projection so with the euro at usd 1 13 expecting that to carry through but i ll say that we are very well hedged and feel comfortable that any movement in the euro would have a very minimal impact on our earnings at this point i think you can kind of translate it to a 10 movement in the euro wouldn t move earnings by more than 1 and then just in terms of your question on leverage i d say we were happy to be able to bring our leverage down with the atm execution in the fourth quarter and earlier this year our target leverage levels continue to be in the mid 40 range on the on debt to gross assets and in the mid to high 5s on net debt to ebitda so i think again we re comfortable at those levels and we gave ourselves a little bit of room with the activity that we did on the atm operator our next question today is coming from todd stender from wells fargo todd stender wells fargo securities analyst just wanted to flesh out the self storage acquisition was this taking at a partner in a jv i noticed the 90 noncontrolling interest if you could just provide more color on that jason fox chief executive officer yes sure this actually was the second component of a portfolio of self storage assets that cpa 17 had bought earlier in the year prior to the merger and so this was just the end of that transaction that closed post merger which is why it shows up as part of our acquisition volume in the fourth quarter and it was a 90 10 joint venture with extra space who is our property manager as well todd stender wells fargo securities analyst ok so are they out and you own it wholly owned at this point jason fox chief executive officer no they re still our jv partner they still have a 10 interest correct todd stender wells fargo securities analyst are they managing it as well jason fox chief executive officer they are todd stender wells fargo securities analyst ok got it can you provide pricing on that and are these stabilized assets jason fox chief executive officer brooks do you have any color on that brooks gordon head of asset management these are not stabilized assets so they are in various stages of lease up right now and we expect those to stabilize over the coming quarters todd stender wells fargo securities analyst any yield expectations any color you can provide around that brooks gordon head of asset management hard to say now i mean it really depends on how the lease up goes but it s going according to plan and we re continuing to focus on the lease up there jason fox chief executive officer yes i think for round numbers in the sixes that s kind of our expectation on a stabilized cap rate basis todd stender wells fargo securities analyst ok and then just moving to dispositions guidance could push up to 700 million where are these coming from are these cpa 17 assets and maybe just some of the characteristics of what you are selling brooks gordon head of asset management sure this is brooks again the guidance is 500 million to 700 million dispositions that does include the new york times at 250 million so that s really the big chunk in terms of deal type about 50 of that at the low end is purchase option from new york times maybe 30 is what we would call non core some of which came over in cpa 17 so for example operating hotel as well as an asset in japan and those are really the main buckets it s not as toni mentioned the cpa 17 portfolio fits very very nicely with w p carey s existing portfolio so there s not a huge amount of required cleanup there operator our next question is coming from manny korchman from citi manny korchman citi analyst jason maybe you could help us just think about yield expectations on both the total pipeline of acquisitions and dispositions especially in light of you discussing some competitive markets globally jason fox chief executive officer right sure i ll let brooks touch on dispositions but in terms of the acquisition i think in the u s especially with our lower cost of capital we re targeting deals in the low sixes and into the sevens i would say in europe it s in that range perhaps 25 basis points lower given the lower borrowing costs which should allow us to achieve meaningful spreads and if you look at it historically i think 2018 our weighted average cap rate was in and around 7 and if you look back to the last couple of years it s probably fallen within very close to that range as well so that s probably something that we would hope to expect this year to achieve but i think it all depends on market conditions brooks gordon head of asset management and on the disposition front we expect the all in execution to be roughly in line with where we re acquiring assets in that 7 low 7 cap rate range and i ll just add that on the discretionary capex component of the investment volume we have seen and continue to expect to see a meaningful premium to marketed investments from a cap rate perspective manny korchman citi analyst and then is there or are there any other sort of pipeline deals similar to what you discussed with the storage assets that are built into either cpa 17 or the core portfolio that are sort of just lined up and waiting to close rather than you trying to find opportunities jason fox chief executive officer well i mean i wouldn t say that they re related to the cpa 17 acquisition i think that cpa 17 was fully invested in the self storage portfolio that was the transaction throughout the year in 2018 was a bit unique but in terms of the pipeline we do have an active pipeline it s across geographies and asset classes a lot of them as i mentioned before are build to suits and i should add to the cap rate question you asked that when we re doing these sale leasebacks and build to suits we re typically getting on average call it 50 to 100 basis points premium to where we think these assets would trade in the market so i want to give you a sense of what a 7 cap rate may look like in terms of the risk profile especially given how we source them and of course our pipeline also includes expansion opportunities and other capital investment projects within the portfolio some of which are part of cpa 17 acquired assets i guess there is some correlation there again those type of transactions we tend to have a lot of leverage on structure and pricing so those tend to be higher yielding investments all else being equal we also tend to get the benefit of extended lease terms on the leases that are encumbering those existing assets so i think all positive operator our next question is coming from chris lucas from capital one securities chris lucas capital one securities analyst just a couple of quick questions for you just jason on the maybe just touching on the acquisition perspective for 2019 do you have a sense as to how much potentially could come from existing customers versus new customers jason fox chief executive officer i mean our pipeline right now of active projects is a little under or i shouldn t say pipeline our current active projects is a little under 250 million i think about 160 million of that is expected to close this year and would be included in our acquisition volume for the year brooks do you want to kind of talk more generally about what we re targeting and what you can expect from capital investment projects brooks gordon head of asset management sure i mean i think to emphasize the one of the benefits of bringing on cpa 17 is that substantially opens up that pool of target opportunities we re very focused on it proactively meeting with tenants and identifying tenants that have a need to grow so we expect that to be a meaningful opportunity set over the next few years kind of in the range of the 200 million ish range which is currently in the discretionary capex we expect that to be a good working number for the next few years chris lucas capital one securities analyst ok great and then jason just maybe refresh my memory as it relates to how you guys are thinking about the self storage portfolio from a core non core basis and what your views are in terms of the holding period for it jason fox chief executive officer yes sure as we ve talked about in the past i mean we are focused on being a pure play net lease reit so we re not long term holders of operating properties like storage but it is an asset class that we know well it s a high quality portfolio so we re going to be patient with what we decide to do there we are currently evaluating a number of options but there s really nothing more to report at this point in time chris lucas capital one securities analyst ok and then toni just on the debt maturity profile there s certainly more mortgage debt today than premerger in terms of the overall pro rata share there s also a fair amount of it due over the next several years but at rates that look pretty reasonable in terms of a mark to market i guess the question i have is what sort of capacity do you have within the overall balance sheet from a refi perspective that would allow you to sort of refi that mortgage debt with eurobonds which are obviously significantly lower cost right now toni sanzone chief financial officer yes i mean i think just starting with the mortgage debt in general as you mentioned it is maturing over a couple of years and even if we were to pay that down as they mature we d expect to bring our secured debt back in line with where it was premerger levels within a couple of years in terms of opportunity to bring that forward we re certainly always evaluating that i think for us we evaluate that against kind of the cost to break that at any point in time but in terms of the overall leverage euro versus u s we did see the cpa 17 merger coming on at the time that we did our last eurobond issuance in october and certainly took that into account so we increased our euro leverage a bit there i think we re comfortable with the euro leverage levels we have now but there is still a bit more room should we choose to do that again it would be certainly market driven and as i ve mentioned needs to have sort of a catalyst to want to bring forward that debt at that point in time operator our next question today is coming from greg mcginniss from scotiabank greg mcginniss scotiabank analyst brooks just want to dig into your comment on the 30 dispositions focused on non core assets a bit is the plan to hold onto the eastern european assets from cpa 17 and could this geography potentially be an area of additional investments from wpc brooks gordon head of asset management so first of all specifically to my comment those assets are not baked into that number that s a very small component of the whole important to note that those are high quality properties with long term leases and good credit tenants i think that s about 3 of total abr and so while those aren t target markets from a new investment perspective we re certainly comfortable holding those assets and we do like the investments themselves and over time we can be opportunistic with those should we choose to exit those in the future but those aren t in the 2019 disposition guidance greg mcginniss scotiabank analyst ok and toni as the stock continues to trade near all time highs how are you thinking about atm usage in 2019 and you spoke about this a bit but i m just trying to get a sense for your thoughts on leverage versus earnings dilution at this point and also are there any additional issuances baked in the guidance toni sanzone chief financial officer yes like we said we re very happy with the equity we ve raised on our atm since december we were able to issue capital pretty attractively priced relative to where we can invest accretively and we also had the benefit of increased trading volume in our shares which we d hoped to achieve as a result of the cpa 17 merger so our ability to take advantage of that did a couple of things for us it reduced our leverage bringing our net debt to ebitda back down to under 6x which is well ahead of what we initially expected and it allowed us to prefund some of our expected acquisition activity so right now our balance sheet strength leaves us well positioned with the flexibility to act opportunistically we don t necessarily need to have an issuance of additional capital this year which is what our guidance assumes but we ll continue to evaluate the opportunity relative to our capital needs greg mcginniss scotiabank analyst ok yes so guidance is not assuming any additional issuances and jason just a final question here could you just give a few details on the decline in occupancy since q2 was that related to a specific tenant are you looking to sell those vacant properties are they making good releasing opportunities jason fox chief executive officer i ll let brooks cover that brooks gordon head of asset management sure yes the pickup in vacancy really relates to a portfolio of former bon ton locations retail stores which we do intend to sell important to note that one of those is a very high quality located warehouse in allentown pennsylvania and we re in the process of working to redevelop that into a much larger facility which will be a class a warehouse facility and we re working through the permitting process now and we expect that to be a very good outcome operator our next question today is coming from john massocca from ladenburg thalmann john massocca ladenburg thalmann analyst can you maybe provide some additional color on what drove the sale of the australia assets leased to inghams just a little bit maybe curious because you only purchased those about four years ago and i know you got kind of a decent return even when factoring in the ti dollars or sorry the capex dollars you spent there but is that just a simplification of the story or was it something where you felt like these assets were as valuable as they ever were going to get or just maybe some color there would be helpful brooks gordon head of asset management sure this is brooks again we did exit the inghams portfolio which completes our exit from australia so there s certainly a simplification aspect to the deal itself but i will add it was a fantastic outcome we realized on the order of 100 or 250 basis points of cap rate compression over about a four and half year hold so fantastic performing asset for us it s just australia is not a target market of ours we don t have scale there and it s certainly much more difficult to manage from afar but that said it was an opportunistic exit and we re very satisfied with the deal itself jason fox chief executive officer and let me just add quickly that deal was done it was a sale leaseback as part of an m a transaction so i think it s a good example of how we re able to generate significant yield premium through the structuring of sale leasebacks especially alongside private equity firms in m a transactions and that 250 basis point compression i think some of that was on the upfront structuring some of it was the markets there got stronger and i think this tenant also improved its credit i think that s all part of our thesis on how we invest on and the result was a great return i mean a very high returning asset for a four five year hold john massocca ladenburg thalmann analyst do you have a general irr on the hold brooks gordon head of asset management that was about 15 unlevered irr over that four and a half year hold period john massocca ladenburg thalmann analyst ok and then looking at kind of page 14 of the supp tenant improvements and operating expenses or non maintenance capital expenditures to operating properties were maybe a little high this quarter versus some past quarters especially when it seems like not a lot of that was maybe tied to lease renewals and extensions done in the quarter so maybe kind of what drove that brooks gordon head of asset management sure so there s a couple different buckets there this is brooks on the nondiscretionary capex piece the tis about 4 million or thereabouts was the actual funding of tenant improvement allowance from a deal we actually entered into in 2017 and was just funded in this particular quarter an office long term new lease with a new tenant on the non maintenance front there s another line item there which relates to one of our operating hotels that s going through a renovation i believe that s about the 6 3 million number and that s one of the assets which we expect to sell this year but we will complete the renovation as well so that s really the kind of noise in that number this quarter john massocca ladenburg thalmann analyst makes sense and then lastly given we re kind of getting to a point here where cwi one is kind of laid out as target for potentially seeking a liquidity event and i know you guys do lay out kind of the exact terms of your back end fees on page 43 of the supp but have you started kind of formulating maybe kind of a range of what the financial benefit of a potential sale is to w p carey or is it just too early for that right now toni sanzone chief financial officer well i think at this point as you mentioned the process that the directors are running is one that they re focused on we don t have a whole lot of involvement in the direction that that will take so i think it s certainly premature at this point to kind of put any dollar value in terms of where we see that benefiting us and we ve mentioned we wouldn t bring those assets on our balance sheet given they re lodging assets but i m not sure there s much more there that we can assume at this point operator our next question is coming from sheila mcgrath from evercore sheila mcgrath evercore isi analyst i was just wondering if you could update us on if anything meaningful changed in the assumptions on the asset management aspect in terms of what the winding down fees if anything changed there toni sanzone chief financial officer in terms of the investment management business sheila mcgrath evercore isi analyst exactly toni sanzone chief financial officer no at this point sheila i think we somewhere in the supplemental in the back we lay out the remaining four funds that we have our assumption is that we ll continue to manage those through 2019 that s what s reflected at guidance as i mentioned with the cpa 17 going away that comes down to a much less meaningful portion of our total results so about 5 and i think if you looked at even the q4 total the asset management fees and our interest in the fund that s probably a reasonable run rate for where we expect that to go for the rest of this year sheila mcgrath evercore isi analyst ok great and then could you update us on the tenant watch list are there any meaningful tenants or just update us on the current watch list that would be great brooks gordon head of asset management sure this is brooks credit quality is very good right now and in fact improves overall with the acquisition of cpa 17 as you can see in the supplemental investment grade increases to 29 from a watch list perspective it s pretty stable the primary tenant we have on there which we discussed in the past is the agrokor portfolio we re making a lot of progress working through restructure with them and we expect that to come off the watch list soon too early to report any details but we do expect to realize some upside relative to the 50 haircut we underwrote when acquiring the assets and that s fully baked into our guidance range sheila mcgrath evercore isi analyst is the 50 you closed on the asset at the 50 rental brooks gordon head of asset management so the 11 6 million that s flowing through abr represents a 50 haircut and reserved to contract rent and so we expect some upside relative to that sheila mcgrath evercore isi analyst perfect and then could you just remind us the exact closing date of the new york times for modeling purposes brooks gordon head of asset management december 1 sheila mcgrath evercore isi analyst ok and then capital expenditure outlook in terms of tis for this year kind of versus historical brooks gordon head of asset management i think the way to think about tis is it s certainly very deal specific it s hard to handicap an exact number because in certain deals we ll take a very capital light approach and in others we ll choose to invest a lot more capital so i hesitate to handicap that with a very specific number but i will on the maintenance front that will tick up somewhat with the addition of the operating properties again which jason mentioned in the long run those aren t assets we will own as operating properties operator our next question is coming from john massocca from ladenburg thalmann john massocca ladenburg thalmann analyst just a quick follow up and i know it s fallen out of the top 10 here with the close of the merger with cpa 17 but universal technical institute which was in the top 10 previously has kind of talked about potentially restructuring how it views its real estate and is there any potential downside to your guys holdings of them there or do you think you have a pretty secure investment with those guys brooks gordon head of asset management well we have a diversified portfolio of campuses with them again as you noted it is becoming a less meaningful part of our total and falling out of the top 10 and we re presently working through restructuring leases with them kind of one by one so nothing kind of material we already did one of them and extended that and working on the others so each campus is different but we re making good progress working with them operator at this time i m not showing any further questions i ll hand the call back to mr sands peter sands director of institutional investor relations thank you everyone for your interest in w p carey if anyone has

the weekend edition is pulled from the daily stansberry digest we just saw a big bullish sign for gold in short over the past several months the precious metal has been moving higher despite a strong rally in the u s dollar this is unusual most of the time gold and the dollar trade inversely so seeing gold rally in spite of this headwind suggests this rally could have legs but this isn t the only sign that this move higher is different from others we ve seen recently as longtime readers know comparing the performance of gold stocks to gold itself through the so called gold stocks to gold ratio can be valuable because gold stocks provide leverage to the price of gold they tend to rise much faster than gold during bull markets and fall much faster than gold during bear markets so if this were the start of a new uptrend in gold we would expect to see this ratio moving sharply higher as you can see in the following chart that s exactly what has happened since making a new multiyear low last fall this ratio has moved sharply higher and it is now just shy of making its first higher high in nearly three years this is a big deal it hasn t happened since early 2016 back then gold moved roughly 25 higher over the next several months while gold stocks as tracked by the vaneck vectors gold miners fund gdx surged nearly 140 and there s good reason to believe we ll see a higher high soon you see history shows gold stocks also tend to dramatically outperform the broad stock market during gold bull markets and as the next chart shows the ratio of gold stocks to the s p 500 has already made a higher high for the first time since early 2016
purpose i look at the high frequency weekly indicators because while they can be very noisy they provide a good nowcast of the economy and will telegraph the maintenance or change in the economy well before monthly or quarterly data is available they also are an excellent way to mark your beliefs to market in general i go in order of long leading indicators then short leading indicators then coincident indicators a note on methodology data is presented in a just the facts ma am format with a minimum of commentary so that bias is minimized where relevant i include 12 month highs and lows in the data in parentheses to the right all data taken from st louis fred unless otherwise linked a few items e g financial conditions indexes regional fed indexes stock prices the yield curve have their own metrics based on long term studies of their behavior where data is seasonally adjusted generally it s scored positively if it s within the top 1 3 of that range negative in the bottom 1 3 and neutral in between where it s not seasonally adjusted and there are seasonal issues waiting for the year over year change to change sign will lag the turning point thus i make use of a convention data is scored neutral if it s less than 1 2 as positive negative as at its 12 month extreme with long leading indicators which by definition turn at least 12 months before a turning point in the economy as a whole there s an additional rule data is automatically negative if during an expansion it has not made a new peak in the past year with the sole exception that it s scored neutral if it s moving in the right direction and is close to making a new high recap of monthly reports january data was headlined by very negative industrial production the worst in nearly a decade cpi was flat

city down 3 to 1 dallas down 2 8 to 11 6 month over month rolling average down 5 to 1 the regional average is more volatile than the ism manufacturing index but usually correctly forecasts its month over month direction it was very positive for most of last year since last summer it gradually cooled to weakly positive as of this week it has declined to neutral employment metrics initial jobless claims 216 000 down 23 000 four week average 235 750 up 4 000 initial claims had generally been very positive for over a year in november they briefly spiked and have done so again in the past three weeks the worst of which was probably connected to the government shutdown particularly via contractors because it s both higher year over year and more than 10 above its low point i m mechanically changing its rating for purposes of this exercise to neutral but i suggest this be taken with a big grain of salt until the big spike three weeks ago is no longer in the four week average temporary staffing index from the american staffing association unchanged at 94 w w down 0 5 yoy this index was positive with a few exceptions all during 2017 it was negative for over a month at the beginning of 2018 but returned to a positive since for most the year in the last three months it gradually declined turning neutral in the last month and finally turning negative for the last two weeks tax

last year i have been adjusting based on treasury department estimates of a decline of roughly 4 billion over a 20 day period this is the final week of a four week phase out of this adjustment beginning next week year over year comparisons should be valid again oil prices and usage from the e i a oil up 1 43 to 57 17 w w down 9 4 yoy gas prices up 04 to 2 32 w w down 0 24 yoy usage four

plummeted this is a negative for the oil patch but a positive for consumers so the rating changes from neutral to positive usage was positive yoy during most of 2018 but turned negative again in the last two months before turning positive again in the past two weeks bank lending rates 0 280 ted spread down 0 041 w w 2 481 libor unchanged w w both ted and libor rose in 2016 to the point where both were usually negatives with lots of fluctuation of importance is that ted was above 0 50 before both the 2001 and 2008 recessions the ted spread was generally increasingly positive in 2017 while libor was increasingly negative earlier this year the ted spread has whipsawed between being positive or negative but more recently was very positive it has risen again recently but is still positive coincident indicators consumer spending johnson redbook up 5 4 yoy retail economist up 0 5 w w up 2 7 yoy both the retail economist and johnson redbook indexes generally improved from weak to moderate or strong positives during 2017 and remained positive all last year the retail economist measure decelerated in the past few months last week it decelerated enough to change to neutral but rebounded this week and so is positive again johnson redbook has fallen sharply from briefly being 9 yoy three weeks ago if it falls to 3 5 or below it will rate a neutral but for now is still positive transport railroads from the aar carloads down 3 9 yoy intermodal units down 2 1 yoy total loads down 3 0 yoy shipping transport harpex up 3 to 502 440 678 baltic dry index up 2 to 630 610 1775 rail was generally positive during 2017 with the exception of some of autumn in 2018 after some weakness in january and february it remained positive until autumn when it weakened precipitously probably due to tariffs it rebounded strongly in the last month until the last three weeks when it declined to negative yoy as to carloads it s thus mixed or neutral harpex made multi year lows in early 2017 and after oscillating improved to new multi year highs earlier this year but has now fallen enough to rate negative bdi traced a similar trajectory and made three year highs near the end of 2017 and at mid year hit multi year highs but has since declined all the way to negative now i m wary of reading too much into price indexes like this since they are heavily influenced by supply as in a huge overbuilding of ships in the last decade as well as demand steel production from the american iron and steel institute down 0 6 w w up 3 8 yoy steel production was generally positive in 2017 it turned negative in january and early february of 2018 but with the exception of three weeks recently has been positive since then for the last two weeks the year over year comparison abruptly declined to less than 1 2 of it recent range over 10 year over year and so is changed to a neutral summary and conclusion among the long leading indexes real m1 and m2 real estate loans the chicago fed adjusted financial conditions index and the leverage subindex are positives the yield curve and mortgage rates are neutral treasuries corporate bonds and refinance applications are negative joined this week by purchase mortgage applications among the short leading indicators the only positives are the chicago national conditions index and oil and gas prices note that i m weighting the benefit to consumers more than the distress to the oil patch initial jobless claims are neutral joined this week by stock prices and the regional fed new orders indexes both measures of the us dollar the general commodity index the spread between corporate and treasury bonds industrial metals and temporary staffing are negative joined this week by gas usage among the coincident indicators consumer spending tax withholding and the ted spread are positive steel is neutral libor the baltic dry index harpex and rail are negative the short term forecast turned sharply negative last week and slightly more this week even though stocks moved back from negative to neutral the coincident nowcast has returned from negative to neutral the long term forecast shaded slightly to negative as well this week although with the improvement in interest rates and real money supply it looks like this segment wants to bottom once again i caution that the effects of the government shutdown may be temporarily skewing the data to the downside if so i expect a recovery in the next couple of weeks

news national by staff reporter the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz has effectively brought back the local currency after denoting the existing electronic balances bond notes and coins in circulation as real time gross settlement rtgs dollars making them the official legal tender as part of a host of monetary policy measures announced yesterday the bank has also removed the 1 1 peg on the local currency against the us dollar practically de dollarising in a move which authorities hope will curb growth of the parallel market and ease foreign currency shortages which have crippled business in a widely anticipated move rbz governor john mangudya said the legal instrument to give effect to the new legal tender was being prepared and that the central bank would establish an interbank platform where currency would be traded freely from monday february 25 the 2019 budget which was announced by finance minister mthuli ncube last year is also denominated in rtgs dollars he added the country adopted mainly the us dollar after dumping its hyperinflation ravaged currency in 2009 but has been struggling with a shortage of real dollars since 2016 previously the central bank had maintained a fixed exchange rate where rtgs balances bond notes and coins were pegged at par with the united states dollar but this has largely resulted in intensified acute shortage of foreign exchange price distortions and heightened inflationary pressures mangudya who had previously been opposed to the idea of allowing the currency to float freely said the situation was no longer tenable and needed to be addressed immediately in order to restore the value of money the bank considered the implications accounting financial economic legal and social that are embedded in the establishment of an inter bank forex market within the context of the current national payment systems made up of rtgs mobile payment platforms point of sale pos bond notes and coins after taking into account the implications and putting in place safeguards to maintain stability in the forex market the bank is with immediate effect establishing an inter bank foreign exchange market in zimbabwe to formalise the trading of rtgs balances and bond notes with us and other currencies on a willing buyer willing seller basis through banks and bureaux de change he said bureaux de change shall be authorised to purchase foreign currency without limits but shall be limited to sell foreign currency for small transactions such as subscriptions business and personal travel up to a maximum aggregate daily limit of 10 000 like with banks bureaux de change and their agents shall report their activities of the inter bank on a daily basis as required by the central bank mangudya said the central bank had arranged sufficient lines of credit to underpin the foreign exchange market but he would not be drawn into disclosing the source of funding or the quantum foreign currency from the interbank market shall be utilised for current bona fide foreign payment invoices except for school fees he said foreign currency requirements for government expenditure and other essential commodities that include fuel cooking oil electricity medicines and water chemicals shall continue to be made available through the existing letters of credit facilities and or the foreign exchange allocations committee all foreign liabilities or legacy debts due to suppliers and service providers such as the international air transport association iata declared dividends etc shall be treated separately after registering such transactions with exchange control for the purposes of providing the bank with sufficient information that will allow it to determine the roadmap for orderly expunging the legacy debt the rbz chief said on exports mangudya announced that the export incentive scheme which had been put in place to spur exports would cease to exist after it was eroded by inflationary pressures both large and small scale gold producers will continue to retain 55 of their foreign currency earnings while the rest will be paid in rtgs dollars the horticulture manufacturing transport and tourism sectors will retain 80 of their export earnings tobacco and cotton merchants for input schemes will also retain 80 while growers will be allocated 30 similarly in order to enhance liquidity within the foreign currency market exporters shall be entitled to utilise their retained export receipts within 30 days after which the unutilised export receipts will be offloaded into the market at the prevailing exchange rate mangudya added all international remittances and individual funds received from offshore shall continue to be treated as free funds in 2018 foreign receipts amounted to 6 3 billion with export proceeds contributing 68 of the total amount received international remittances declined by 19 from 1 4 billion received in 2017 to 1 1 billion received in 2018 of the 1 4 billion diaspora remittances contributed 619 2 million a decline of 11 4 as compared to 699 million received in 2017 according to the bank the decline in diaspora remittances is mainly attributed to the interception of remittances in south africa by cross border traders south africa contributes about 34 of the total diaspora remittances proceeds from loans accounted for 13 of the total foreign receipts

it s not uncommon to read news stories that quite explicitly identify economic mismanagement for example news reports on the hyperinflation in zimbabwe routinely and correctly attribute the cause to the poor economic management by its leaders we will see similar attributions of mismanagement to a wide range of developing countries one place we will never see the term mismanagement or any equivalent term applied is in reference to the austerity imposed on the euro zone countries by the european commission acting largely at the direction of the german government in fact major news outlets like the new york times seem to go out of their way to deny the incredible harm done to euro zone economies and to the lives of tens of millions of people in these countries as a result of needless austerity a decade ago it would at least have been an arguable point as to whether austerity meaning budget cuts in the wake of the great recession was reasonable policy there was some research suggesting that the boost to confidence from lower budget deficits could spur enough investment and consumption to offset the impact on demand of reductions in government spending since then however we have far more evidence on the impact of deficit reduction in the context of an economy coming out of recession there have been numerous studies most importantly several from the international monetary fund s research department which show that lower deficits in this context slow growth and raise unemployment furthermore they show that periods of high unemployment have a lasting impact as a result of workers losing skills and companies and governments in a downturn foregoing investment that they would have undertaken if the economy were closer to its potential level of output this means that insistence on deficit reduction not only led to one time drops in output and employment but could reduce potential output by trillions of dollars over subsequent years at this point the advocates of fiscal austerity in the context of economies that are operating well below potential gdp are ignoring a large body of evidence in favor of personal prejudices these people should be viewed like global warming deniers or creationists they are not credible people and their policies have inflicted enormous damage where they have been put in place incredibly instead of pointing out that the advocates of austerity have been shown wrong most reporting continues to treat their policies as being credible and in fact often works to hide evidence of its failure the new york times 2 14 19 gave us a great example of this practice in an article on the decline of the middle class across europe with a focus on spain spain has been especially hard hit by the demands for austerity in contrast to greece and italy spain had actually been running budget surpluses in the years leading up to the crisis its debt to gdp ratio was just 22 3 percent when the crisis hit less than half of germany s so there was no story of profligate government spending what spain did have was a massive housing bubble fueled largely by german banks who apparently were not very good at their business when the bubbles burst in spain and elsewhere the economy in spain was especially hard hit with the unemployment rate crossing 26 percent in 2013 while the unemployment rate has come down in the last five years the number of people employed is still more than 1 million less than before the crisis spain is a country that could have benefited enormously from a large scale stimulus program both domestically and the across the eurozone since much of its gdp is exported instead the great minds in charge of the euro zone s economic policy insisted that spain had to reduce its budget deficits to comply with the euro s rules given this history the cause of the decline of the middle class in spain seems about as clear as the causes of a person s mobility problems after they have been run over by a truck instead the new york times made it all seem very mysterious telling readers spain s economy like the rest of europe s is growing faster than before the 2008 financial crisis and creating jobs but the work they could find pays a fraction of the combined 80 000 euro annual income they once earned by summer they figure they will no longer be able to pay their mortgage it is a precarious situation felt by millions of europeans since the recession of the late 2000s the middle class has shrunk in over two thirds of the european union echoing a similar decline in the united states and reversing two decades of expansion while middle class households are more prevalent in europe than in the united states around 60 percent compared with just over 50 percent in america they face unprecedented levels of vulnerability the hurdles to keeping their status or recovering lost ground are higher given post recession labor dynamics the loss of middle income jobs weakened social protections and skill mismatches have reduced economic mobility and widened income inequality automation and globalization are deepening the divides just about every part of this story is wrong spain and most other european countries are not growing faster than before the recession according to the imf spain s economy grew at a 2 7 percent rate in 2018 and is projected to grow 2 2 percent this year by comparison it grew at an average rate of more than 3 9 percent in 2006 and 2007 the last two years before the recession but more importantly the immediately relevant factor is cumulative growth not a single year as a result of its sharp downturn and weak recovery spain s per capita gdp was just 3 0 percent higher in 2018 than it was in 2007 by comparison coming out of the great depression in the united states per capita income in 1940 was more than 8 0 percent higher than in 1929 given these basic growth numbers it would be surprising if spain s middle class had not taken a big hit while other factors like the weakening of labor market protections have made its plight worse the dismal story on growth goes a very long way in explaining the decline in spain and europe s middle class unfortunately this sort of story in the new york times is not an exception the paper has repeatedly told readers that policies that undermined the welfare state and redistributed money upward were being done for the purpose of revitalizing the economy this was especially the case with emanuel macron in france here here and here in these and other cases the media took at face value the claims of politicians that the reason for the measures was to help workers not to reduce their bargaining power which is their immediate effect to be clear labor market regulations can be excessive and there are certainly contexts in which streamlining them would end up benefiting most of the labor force even if such streamlining could hurt narrow groups of workers but the idea that excessive labor market regulation rather than inept macroeconomic policy is the main problem limiting growth and reducing employment in france spain and elsewhere in europe does not have any evidence to support it david howell andrew glyn john schmitt and i did a study showing the limited impact of labor market protections on employment more than a decade ago based on our work the oecd did its own analysis and reached similar conclusions in short the new york times and other media outlets have been engaged in a great exercise in misdirection while the blame for europe s economic problems over the last decade can very clearly be laid at the doorstep of its leaders who have insisted on austerity the media consistently ignore evidence that is as clear as day they instead treat the problems facing europe s workers as being mysterious in origin or due primarily to an overly generous welfare state and excessive regulations that protect workers this is some seriously biased and or

dives into a different sector of the stock market every day today is thursday february 21st and this is part two of our discussion on the brookfield family of companies i m your host nick sciple and today i m joined by motley fool contributor matt dilallo via skype how are you doing matt matt dilallo i m doing great how are you sciple i m doing great i m excited to talk today about two more brookfield asset management subsidiaries that s brookfield infrastructure partners and brookfield renewable partners first let s start off talking about brookfield infrastructure partners this is a company that went public in 2008 came out from the brookfield asset management parent company it s one of the largest owners and operators of infrastructure assets in the world as the name brookfield infrastructure partners might tell you matt what type of infrastructure does brookfield infrastructure partners invest in where in the world are they allocating their capital dilallo for those who aren t familiar with what infrastructure is it s the underlying structure of the economy anything from railroads to pipelines to electricity poles it s those things that we tend not to see unless they cause problems brookfield really casts a wide net they have four businesses one s utilities and that s distributing electricity natural gas to customers then they have energy which is pipelines natural gas storage district energy which is in cities where you ll have a couple of buildings connected and they ll have a connected energy system then they have transportation which is ports rail and toll roads finally we ve got data infrastructure that s your cell towers and your data centers really a broad range and they re invested all over the world sciple yeah what s great about all these infrastructure assets is that they really put out predictable cash flows any of these you re getting capital based on the volume of use that your customers are using for a pipeline for example the more natural gas or oil that flows through your pipeline the more you get paid for something like natural gas which we ve discussed on this show you have to get the gas to the market so you re going to get continual cash flows it makes their cash flows really predictable which is great for a business like this that tends to lean more toward an income type of strategy can you talk about what those steady cash flows really do when it comes to the reliability of the dividend and the way you can really count on that as an investor dilallo because there s long term contracts especially in the natural gas pipelines brookfield knows what s going to come in even in some of the more economically sensitive businesses like a toll road where they re dependent on volumes of cars passing through which will decline when there s a recession there s still a predictability in that they have that predictability of cash flow from those they also have as you mentioned the volume growth as the economy grows more cars will go on their toll roads more oil or natural gas will flow through their pipelines so then there s that gdp linkage you ll see the income go up that really gives them a solid base of cash flow that they can pay out in their distribution they target about 70 to pay out that s a pretty conservative rate that gives them some money to invest in some expansion projects it s a really good way to play infrastructure especially if you re an income focused investor sciple yeah they have a really strong track record from what i ve seen they hold their average investment for about eight years and they generate an internal rate of return above 20 on average which is a really strong rate of return when you think about the way the business grows it s predominantly through acquisitions as we mentioned their cash flows for the infrastructure that they own are going to be pretty stable over time they re going to grow by buying an asset at a reasonable price holding it for their holding period then selling it for more than they bought it for then reinvesting that capital rinse and repeat is that a fair characterization of the way the business tends to operate dilallo yeah that s exactly what they re trying to do because they re 10 years old a lot of the assets that they initially had they sold them out they re entering another period where they re starting to sell assets that they ve held for several years they had an electricity distribution business in chile that they sold last year for 1 1 billion they had held it for years and years and years but it had gotten to the point where they d really maximized all the value out of it it was only going to grow by about 1 to 2 a year based on the inflation that they were expecting so they topped out it was a good time to sell and then take that cash and i think they re up to six or seven acquisitions that they have in the pipeline to replace that that s their business model maximize it then we ll buy something else that s earlier in the business cycle sciple they ve changed their strategy over the past year or so in the past they had to rely a little bit more on debt to fund their acquisitions whereas management has really been open about talking about how they want to transition from that model more toward self funding growth as you mentioned by recycling their assets through the pipeline as we look into the results from 2018 there was a go forward year when it came to shifting that strategy shares were down about 1 over the year when you adjust funds from operations to a per unit basis they were basically flat can you talk about how the company is absorbing or adjusting to this change in the way that they fund their acquisitions and how investors should think about that going forward into 2019 dilallo brookfield you mentioned that they used debt and equity part of what they re trying to get away from is issuing equity because that dilutes investors the market just hasn t been as open to new equity issuances from income type entities mlps have been hit very very hard by the energy thing a lot of it has to do with rising interest rates there just isn t the investor interest in buying equities brookfield used to be able to issue equity no problem to make acquisitions but because they re so value focused they looked at the value of their equity and it wasn t appealing to issue it anymore however the value of their assets to others they could sell that for a premium and then reinvest that that s how they ve decided to shift now that hurt them last year as you mentioned on a per unit basis funds from operation barely budged however that was almost entirely due to selling an asset which they re subsequently reinvesting into several businesses that should grow ffo by about 20 going forward it s kind of like they re literally shifting gears they slowed down so that they can really accelerate with this new business model that should make them less susceptible to market crashes like we saw back in december they had a deal that they wanted to fund that wouldn t have been as attractive if they had to do it as the market was selling off sciple we re talking about how the business has transitioned they re really starting to recycle their assets through let s talk about where brookfield is really seeing opportunities to redeploy its capital in infrastructure one of the places they really called out as a significant opportunity for them you mentioned mlps and pipelines that s a place that brookfield really finds attractive back in october they closed their acquisition of enbridge s western canadian natural gas gathering and processing business that was a large acquisition that really increased their position in the natural gas pipeline business can you talk about that acquisition and then more broadly how brookfield looks at the gas distribution pipeline business as an opportunity for them to grow dilallo as you hinted at the energy market downturn in recent years has really made it hard for mlps and pipeline companies like enbridge to sell equity to fund growth they ve turned to selling assets brookfield had an opportunity to buy one of the best gathering and processing businesses out in western canada what gathering and processing is basically they take the natural gas from the wellhead and then they separate the natural gas liquids from the gas they make money based on fees the producers pay them fees to do this very stable cash flow lots of growth out there shale plays come to mind we don t know it much here in the states but it s a very fast growing shale play out in canada lots of natural gas liquids there s a lot of growth opportunity out there as canada finally starts exporting natural gas in a couple of years and shell finishes their plant and the natural gas liquids they can use those they make petrochemicals and other things with those it s an opportunity to participate in that growth out there more broadly as you mentioned investors aren t buying mlps and pipelines anymore with interest rates rising there s other competition like cds and then the market for mlps just tanked there s investor fear of investing in those types of assets it s opened the door for brookfield to start looking at hunting for new deals i wouldn t be surprised if they have a couple more this year it s a huge market opportunity they ve said it s about 150 billion in the next couple of years just from asset acquisitions and then helping mlps recapitalize lots of opportunities for them out there sciple brookfield has positioned their balance sheet to put them in a position to really start deploying capital throughout the next year management has mentioned over the past year they ve raised 800 million in debt and preferred equity as well as refinanced 1 5 billion in debt to put them in a position where management has said quote they don t have any maturities to worry about for the next five years they have 3 5 billion in liquidity available right now in addition to whatever assets sales they may undergo to raise more capital and redeploy that as you look forward into the growth opportunities for brookfield as i mentioned they have a balance sheet that puts them in a position to redeploy their capital how bullish are you on the growth opportunities for brookfield infrastructure partners looking out over the next few years dilallo i m really excited about them what s exciting about them what we haven t talked about yet is brookfield doesn t bake acquisitions into their growth forecasts they think they can grow their funds from operations by 6 9 per year and that s all organic that s volume growing through their ports it s inflation linked contracts in their natural gas pipelines then there s this third aspect of expansion projects they have a bunch of expansion projects all around the world they re working with kinder morgan on a natural gas pipeline in the gulf coast they ve got some projects on their cell towers out in france they have a lot of these organic growth projects you have those that should give you that steady growth in the next couple of years and then you have the added kicker of this value uplift as they sell assets you mentioned the electricity transmission business they thought that was only going to grow about 2 3 a year so they sell that and buy six businesses that should grow by mid single digit rates so you re getting a faster organic growth rate from that plus the uplift in the earnings from selling one business and buying these other ones that they re getting for a better price i think it could do maybe a double digit total return when you add in the dividend going forward you re not talking about doubling in the next year or so but you re talking about if you hold this for several years you should do very well sciple you re going to have more cash after holding brookfield infrastructure partners than you did before you bought into the company and i think that s what you re looking for an investment in brookfield can reliably give you that and has a track record to prove that ok matt let s talk a little bit about brookfield renewable partners this is another brookfield subsidiary launched in 2011 as the name may indicate they invest in renewable energy assets can you talk a little bit about how the brookfield renewable business is structured and how they make money dilallo brookfield s core businesses is hydro power that s what their foundation is they ve gotten into wind and more recently they ve added some solar they acquired a stake in terraform power and terraform global which are two renewable companies focused on wind and solar now they have that full renewable platform what s different about brookfield though from a utility is that they sell this power to utilities under long term contracts they ll generate steady cash flow as electricity is generated out of their hydro power they re getting paid a steady rate that insulates them from power prices which can fluctuate based on demand you ve got that steady cash flow coming in that s what makes them an interesting way to play renewables sciple you mentioned they re mostly hydro power about three quarters of brookfield renewable s assets are allocated toward hydroelectric power they really like the opportunity there because it has a really long useful life once you get the dam in place to generate power the capital costs to maintain it are relatively low another thing that they mentioned which i find interesting and it ties into some discussions we ve had previously on the show is that they re able to match power supply with demand you talk about solar and wind there can be some issues with demand for power not lining up to when the sun is shining or the wind s blowing but when it comes to hydro power you can really regulate that because you can just stop water flowing through the dam to line things up with demand they ve really focused in hydro for a long period of time but over the past few years as you mentioned they ve started moving more into wind and solar management has said the reason they stayed away from wind and solar for the longest time was because the economics didn t make sense there wasn t a clear path to profitability to acquiring these assets however in the past few years as prices for these systems have started to come down they ve really started to push into those assets that s another case of indicating the way brookfield thinks about investing in assets it s not demand for this is going to grow over time it s how can i make a cash return on this investment we talked about how this terraform investment has really moved them into solar energy in a meaningful way where they hadn t been before this terraform acquisition lines up with those other acquisitions we talked about in part one last week they bought terraform power out of bankruptcy from sunedison can you talk about how that transaction shook out and what advantages that gave to brookfield being able to buy a distressed asset like terraform dilallo it lines up with brookfield asset management s overarching goals to buy for value they ll target something and they ll keep an eye out until they see something of value but it also needs to be substantial enough to provide them a platform they saw an opportunity when sunedison went bankrupt to take over their yieldcos so they pounced on that opportunity and they took terraform global private they have a sizable stake in terraform power that gives them that platform in wind and solar that they can expand they ve been able to help terraform power expand significantly since they bought this stake they bought a spanish wind and solar company last year that expanded them into western europe that s their goal going forward is to be able to expand this business sciple i saw from that acquisition they doubled annualized cash flows for terraform power it really helped them with capital structure they were able to help them get out of some unfavorable financing covenants and put them in a position to generate stable cash flows over time it s just another example of how when brookfield buys these assets they really know how to position them well not just for the value that they have when they acquired them but what steps they can take after they acquire the asset to increase its value even further another thing they re moving into another thing i found interesting they re moving into energy storage when you talk about renewable energy i mentioned lining up supply of energy with demand energy storage helps with that when you re looking at wind and solar do you think that is a significant opportunity for brookfield or is that more peripheral to the other assets they own how should we think about the energy storage part of their investments dilallo i do think that it s going to be important for renewable growth overall to be able to have storage that s cheap enough to make it economically viable one company that s really on the forefront of that is nextera energy they actually just signed a deal with a utility to do wind solar and storage at the same location sciple another thing that i really found interesting about what brookfield renewable is doing is they re expanding their investments into energy storage we ve talked about on this show in the past and it relates to what i said earlier on the hydroelectric assets when it comes to the ability to line up renewable energy supply with demand for energy production assets like wind and solar that only produce power when the sun is out or the wind is blowing do you see the energy storage opportunity as one of significance for brookfield renewable how should investors think about that when they think about this investment dilallo i do think it s a significant step for them as you mentioned the intermittency of renewables has been a drag on growth it s been something that those who are against it have pointed out we need this baseline power it does take companies to invest in these and to add them now so it s good to see them making these investments i do think we re going to see a lot more of that going forward not only from brookfield but from others in the industry nextera energy is one that has been on the forefront of energy storage they recently signed an interesting deal with a utility out on the west coast where they re building a huge energy facility that will include wind solar and storage if the sun s not shining it ll probably be windy and if it s not windy and the sun s not shining they ll have that energy storage component i think that s going to be something that we ll see a lot more of where they re going to add in this energy storage nextera energy s ceo was clear that the way the cost curve has come the way technologies have improved i m paraphrasing his quote because i don t have it offhand within a decade when you add in energy storage to wind and solar and this is without government incentives it should be lower than all forms of power other than natural gas on a high efficiency system that was a bold statement but it s definitely the direction that the industry is heading in that s really exciting climate change worries and just getting rid of emissions in general to see that happening it s exciting sciple yeah and for a company like brookfield it shows that there s opportunities to make profits on these investments today which is why we re seeing them start to move into the space particularly with wind and solar let s talk a little bit about brookfield renewable s yield that s one of the most attractive parts about this business it yields almost 7 when you talk about the energy assets they have their cash flows are really predictable because particularly with renewable energy the sun is going to keep coming out the wind s going to keep blowing and the rivers are going to keep flowing to power these hydro assets when you look at this dividend how attractive is it to you as an investor what prospects might we have for it to continue to increase over time dilallo i m very much of an income focused investor companies that increase their dividends the data shows that they tend to outperform all other companies so any time i see a company that pays an attractive dividend that they have clear ways to be able to increase it that s going to catch my eye then you add in the renewables and it just makes this such an attractive long term holding for any investor you re going to need income eventually whether you re quite a ways away from retirement like i am still i can reinvest that into other opportunities you re looking at an investment that s going to pay very steady cash flow it s going to increase they just raised it to 5 for this coming year they have clear ways to be able to continue to raise it because they can sign up higher price contracts for the power as contracts expire and they re developing new wind and hydro projects and solar around the world and then acquisitions you have three or four growth drivers of this company that are going to take that dividend up and up and up sciple yeah and if you look out over time throughout its history as a business it s delivered an annual total return taking into account the dividend of 15 over time really if you can give me a 15 compounded annual return over time that s going to compound your wealth in a significant way let s talk a little bit about brookfield renewable s balance sheet we got another question from listener noel sayers about that he s been staying away from brookfield renewable both because he sees them as having a heavy debt load on their balance sheet as well as as we mentioned on part one of this brookfield discussion that you can listen to last week he s concerned about the fees that brookfield asset management charges to the brookfield renewable subsidiary we already covered the question about the management fees you can go back and listen to our episode last week if you want to hear about that when you look at brookfield renewable s balance sheet do you have concerns over the level of debt that they are carrying today dilallo i don t because brookfield structures its debt to investment grade ratings they also do it typically on an asset level or on the business level they own several operating businesses we mentioned terraform power they own a big stake in that you factor in terraform s debt then they own a business out in ireland they own one in i believe colombia the debt is at those business levels those asset levels it s nonrecourse to brookfield which means if one of those businesses goes bankrupt they would restructure that business and it wouldn t have any impact on brookfield you have that debt down at those levels it s all investment grade how they structure it in this case brookfield looks for three times ebitda for a business that s generating very stable cash flow that s pretty low so i m not worried about them i actually like the fact that they have an investment grade balance sheet for me that s a stamp of approval to say that and somebody that s a lot smarter than me on credit believes that this is solid from a credit standpoint what an investment grade balance sheet means is that when a downturn comes this is a company that should still be able to pay its bills so that s something that i m very comfortable with sciple it also allows brookfield to raise debt at lower interest rates when you talk about the ability that they have to allocate their capital in a way to drive attractive returns if you can say raise debt at 3 4 and then invest that capital at 7 8 that s a really good position to be in as an asset allocating business when we think about where brookfield renewable is going to be going forward their opportunities to continue expanding over time what opportunities do you see there for the business how excited are you about the opportunities in renewables both for brookfield and in general across the broader market dilallo it was a third quarter as a shareholder letter that brookfield put out and i highly recommend reading any of brookfield s shareholder letters there s always some nugget in there that s just mind blowing this one in particular the ceo of brookfield renewable said that it s a 10 trillion opportunity in renewables to basically wean the global economy off of fossil fuels and that s only in the markets that brookfield operates in which are big markets the united states canada those big developed countries but that just shows you the size of the opportunity for them to invest capital with them investing it at a value basis there s just going to be really good opportunities for them they ll look they ll wait for situations like a terraform where they can scoop it up for really good valuations i m very excited about what they can do they think they can invest probably 700 million a year on just acquisitions and that ll grow over time as their cash flow grows it s one of the most exciting for me renewables out there sciple yeah because when you look at renewables the way they re positioned to grow over time as i ve continued to mention the ability of brookfield executives to allocate capital in a very prudent way that s going to generate returns over time it s an attractive way to get exposure to renewables in a space that sometimes can be difficult to find opportunities that give you a strong risk adjusted return when you look at solar panel makers over time they ve been tough companies to own for investors brookfield gives you a way to get exposure to those really important trends in a way that you can sleep at night which i find really attractive as an investor what do you think matt dilallo absolutely i ve been burned to use a pun on solar panel makers several times this is one of the few times i ve actually made money on renewables i m excited for that to continue sciple before we go away over these last two episodes we ve discussed brookfield asset management brookfield property partners business partners infrastructure the entire family of brookfield companies as you look out at this potential basket of investments are there any of them that particularly stand out to you as if i only had a certain amount of capital to invest this would be the one that i would invest in how do you think about choosing between this entire family of businesses to invest in dilallo if i was an investor just starting out i would go with brookfield asset management for two reasons one you get the whole pie you get the renewables you get the infrastructure you get the property you also don t have to deal with those schedule k 1s that we mentioned in last week s episode it s a much easier investment for somebody to make in a retirement account for example that s where i would start but if somebody wanted specifically exposure to renewables or property then i would look more at the subsidiaries especially if you re more income focused but if you re younger and looking for a retirement option brookfield asset management would be the top one i d buy sciple awesome matt i d agree with you there the simplicity from a tax point of view the exposure across all the family of businesses i really find attractive i will say brookfield renewable is something that does appear very attractive to me i like the way they ve allocated assets you just mentioned how big the total market opportunity is but you really can t go wrong with anybody in this family of companies they check a lot of the boxes that you re looking for as an investor definitely a company that our listeners should pay attention to both the parent as well as all the subsidiaries matt i want to thank you for coming on these past couple of episodes i hope we shared some valuable information for our listeners dilallo thanks for having me sciple awesome matt as always people on the program may own companies discussed on the show and the motley fool may have formal recommendations for or against stocks mentioned so don t buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear thanks to rick engdahl and dan boyd for their work behind the glass for matt dilallo i m nick sciple thanks for listening and fool on
quantitative easing was supposed to be an emergency measure the federal reserve eased shrinkage in the money supply due to the 2008 09 credit crisis by pumping out trillions of dollars in new bank reserves after the crisis the presumption was that the fed would normalize conditions by sopping up the excess reserves through quantitative tightening qt raising interest rates and selling the securities it had bought with new reserves back into the market the fed relentlessly pushed on with quantitative tightening through 2018 despite a severe market correction in the fall in december fed chairman jerome powell said that qt would be on autopilot meaning the fed would continue to raise interest rates and to sell 50 billion monthly in securities until it hit its target but the market protested loudly to this move with the nasdaq composite index dropping 22 from its late summer high worse defaults on consumer loans were rising december 2018 was the first time in two years that all loan types and all major metropolitan statistical areas showed a higher default rate month over month consumer debt including auto student and credit card debt is typically bundled and sold as asset backed securities similar to the risky mortgage backed securities that brought down the market in 2008 after the fed had progressively raised interest rates chairman powell evidently got the memo in january he abruptly changed course and announced that qt would be halted if needed on february 4th mary daly president of the federal reserve bank of san francisco said they were considering going much further you could imagine executing policy with your interest rate as your primary tool and the balance sheet as a secondary tool one that you would use more readily she said qe and qt would no longer be emergency measures but would be routine tools for managing the money supply in a february 13th article on seeking alpha titled quantitative easing on demand mark grant wrote if the fed does decide to pursue this strategy it will be a wholesale change in the way the financial system in the united states operates and i think that very few institutions or people appreciate what is taking place or what it will mean to the markets all of the markets the problem of debt deflation the fed is realizing that it cannot bring its balance sheet back to normal it must keep pumping new money into the banking system to avoid a recession this naturally alarms fed watchers worried about hyperinflation but qe need not create unwanted inflation if directed properly the money spigots just need to be aimed at the debtors rather than the creditor banks in fact regular injections of new money directly into the economy may be just what the economy needs to escape the boom and bust cycle that has characterized it for two centuries mark grant concluded his article by quoting abraham lincoln the government should create issue and circulate all the currency and credits needed to satisfy the spending power of the government and the buying power of consumers by the adoption of these principles the taxpayers will be saved immense sums of interest money will cease to be master and become the servant of humanity the quote is apparently apocryphal but the principle still holds new money needs to be regularly added to the money supply to avoid an overwhelming debt burden and allow the economy to reach its true productive potential regular injections of new money are necessary to avoid something economists fear even more than inflation the sort of debt deflation that took down the economy in the 1930s most money today is created by banks when they make loans when overextended borrowers pay down old loans without taking out new ones the money supply deflates or shrinks demand shrinks with it and businesses lacking customers close their doors in the sort of self feeding death spiral seen in the great depression as australian economist steve keen observes today the level of private debt is way too high and that is why so little lending is occurring but mainstream economists consider the rate of growth of debt to be irrelevant to macroeconomic policy because lending is thought to simply redistribute spending power from savers to investors conventional economic theory says that banks are merely intermediaries recirculating existing money rather than creating spending power in their own right but this is not true says prof keen banks actually create new money when they make loans he cites the bank of england which said in its 2014 quarterly report anks do not act simply as intermediaries lending out deposits that savers place with them and nor do they multiply up central bank money to create new loans and deposits in the modern economy most money takes the form of bank deposits but how those bank deposits are created is often misunderstood the principal way is through commercial banks making loans whenever a bank makes a loan it simultaneously creates a matching deposit in the borrower s bank account thereby creating new money loans create deposits and deposits make up the bulk of the money supply money today is created by banks as a debt on their balance sheets and more is always owed back than was created since the interest claimed by the banks is not created in the original loan debt thus grows faster than the money supply when overextended borrowers quit taking out the new loans needed to repay old loans the gap widens even further the result is debt deflation a debt induced reduction in the new money needed to stimulate economic activity and growth thus the need for injections of new money to fill the gap between debt and the money available to repay it however the money created through qe to date has not gone to the consuming public where it must go to fill this gap rather it has gone to the banks which have funneled it into the speculative financialized markets nomi prins calls this dark money the trillions of dollars flowing yearly in and around global stock bond and derivatives markets generated by central banks when they electronically fabricate money by buying bonds and stocks she writes these dark money flows stretch around the world according to a pattern of power influence and of course wealth for select groups she shows graphically that the rise in dark money is directly correlated with the rise in financial markets qe has worked to reverse the debts of the banks and to prop up the stock market but it has not relieved the debts of consumers businesses or governments and it is these debts that will trigger the sort of debt deflation that can take the economy down keen concludes that no amount of exhorting banks to intermediate will end the drought in credit growth that is the real cause of the great malaise the only way to reduce the private debt burden without causing a depression he says is a modern debt jubilee or people s quantitative easing qe funded debt relief in antiquity as prof michael hudson observes debts were routinely forgiven when a new ruler took the throne the rulers and their advisors knew that debt at interest grew faster than the money supply and that debt relief was necessary to avoid economic collapse from an overwhelming debt overhang economic growth is arithmetic and can t keep up with the exponential growth of debt growing at compound interest consumers need that sort of debt relief today but simply voiding out their debts as was done in antiquity will not work because the debts are not owed to the government they are owed to banks and private investors who would have to bear the loss the alternative suggested by keen and others is to fill the debt gap with a form of qe dropped not into bank reserve accounts but digitally into the bank accounts of the general public debtors could then use the money to pay down their debts in fact keen says it should go first to pay down debts non debtors would receive a cash injection properly managed these injections need not create inflation see my earlier article here money is created as loans and extinguished when they are paid off so the money used to pay down debt would be extinguished along with the debt and the cash injections not used to pay down debt would just help fill the gap between real and potential productivity allowing demand and supply to rise together keeping prices stable a regular injection of money into personal bank accounts has been called a universal basic income but better would be to call it a national dividend something all citizens are entitled to equally without regard to economic status or ability to work it would serve as a safety net for people living paycheck to paycheck but the larger purpose would be as economic policy to stimulate demand and productivity keeping the wheels of industry turning money might then indeed become a servant of humanity transformed from a tool of oppression into a means of securing common prosperity but first the central bank needs to become a public servant it needs to be made a public utility responsive to the needs of the people and the economy this article was first published on

dives into a different sector of the stock market every day today is thursday february 21st and this is part two of our discussion on the brookfield family of companies i m your host nick sciple and today i m joined by motley fool contributor matt dilallo via skype how are you doing matt matt dilallo i m doing great how are you sciple i m doing great i m excited to talk today about two more brookfield asset management subsidiaries that s brookfield infrastructure partners and brookfield renewable partners first let s start off talking about brookfield infrastructure partners this is a company that went public in 2008 came out from the brookfield asset management parent company it s one of the largest owners and operators of infrastructure assets in the world as the name brookfield infrastructure partners might tell you matt what type of infrastructure does brookfield infrastructure partners invest in where in the world are they allocating their capital dilallo for those who aren t familiar with what infrastructure is it s the underlying structure of the economy anything from railroads to pipelines to electricity poles it s those things that we tend not to see unless they cause problems brookfield really casts a wide net they have four businesses one s utilities and that s distributing electricity natural gas to customers then they have energy which is pipelines natural gas storage district energy which is in cities where you ll have a couple of buildings connected and they ll have a connected energy system then they have transportation which is ports rail and toll roads finally we ve got data infrastructure that s your cell towers and your data centers really a broad range and they re invested all over the world sciple yeah what s great about all these infrastructure assets is that they really put out predictable cash flows any of these you re getting capital based on the volume of use that your customers are using for a pipeline for example the more natural gas or oil that flows through your pipeline the more you get paid for something like natural gas which we ve discussed on this show you have to get the gas to the market so you re going to get continual cash flows it makes their cash flows really predictable which is great for a business like this that tends to lean more toward an income type of strategy can you talk about what those steady cash flows really do when it comes to the reliability of the dividend and the way you can really count on that as an investor dilallo because there s long term contracts especially in the natural gas pipelines brookfield knows what s going to come in even in some of the more economically sensitive businesses like a toll road where they re dependent on volumes of cars passing through which will decline when there s a recession there s still a predictability in that they have that predictability of cash flow from those they also have as you mentioned the volume growth as the economy grows more cars will go on their toll roads more oil or natural gas will flow through their pipelines so then there s that gdp linkage you ll see the income go up that really gives them a solid base of cash flow that they can pay out in their distribution they target about 70 to pay out that s a pretty conservative rate that gives them some money to invest in some expansion projects it s a really good way to play infrastructure especially if you re an income focused investor sciple yeah they have a really strong track record from what i ve seen they hold their average investment for about eight years and they generate an internal rate of return above 20 on average which is a really strong rate of return when you think about the way the business grows it s predominantly through acquisitions as we mentioned their cash flows for the infrastructure that they own are going to be pretty stable over time they re going to grow by buying an asset at a reasonable price holding it for their holding period then selling it for more than they bought it for then reinvesting that capital rinse and repeat is that a fair characterization of the way the business tends to operate dilallo yeah that s exactly what they re trying to do because they re 10 years old a lot of the assets that they initially had they sold them out they re entering another period where they re starting to sell assets that they ve held for several years they had an electricity distribution business in chile that they sold last year for 1 1 billion they had held it for years and years and years but it had gotten to the point where they d really maximized all the value out of it it was only going to grow by about 1 to 2 a year based on the inflation that they were expecting so they topped out it was a good time to sell and then take that cash and i think they re up to six or seven acquisitions that they have in the pipeline to replace that that s their business model maximize it then we ll buy something else that s earlier in the business cycle sciple they ve changed their strategy over the past year or so in the past they had to rely a little bit more on debt to fund their acquisitions whereas management has really been open about talking about how they want to transition from that model more toward self funding growth as you mentioned by recycling their assets through the pipeline as we look into the results from 2018 there was a go forward year when it came to shifting that strategy shares were down about 1 over the year when you adjust funds from operations to a per unit basis they were basically flat can you talk about how the company is absorbing or adjusting to this change in the way that they fund their acquisitions and how investors should think about that going forward into 2019 dilallo brookfield you mentioned that they used debt and equity part of what they re trying to get away from is issuing equity because that dilutes investors the market just hasn t been as open to new equity issuances from income type entities mlps have been hit very very hard by the energy thing a lot of it has to do with rising interest rates there just isn t the investor interest in buying equities brookfield used to be able to issue equity no problem to make acquisitions but because they re so value focused they looked at the value of their equity and it wasn t appealing to issue it anymore however the value of their assets to others they could sell that for a premium and then reinvest that that s how they ve decided to shift now that hurt them last year as you mentioned on a per unit basis funds from operation barely budged however that was almost entirely due to selling an asset which they re subsequently reinvesting into several businesses that should grow ffo by about 20 going forward it s kind of like they re literally shifting gears they slowed down so that they can really accelerate with this new business model that should make them less susceptible to market crashes like we saw back in december they had a deal that they wanted to fund that wouldn t have been as attractive if they had to do it as the market was selling off sciple we re talking about how the business has transitioned they re really starting to recycle their assets through let s talk about where brookfield is really seeing opportunities to redeploy its capital in infrastructure one of the places they really called out as a significant opportunity for them you mentioned mlps and pipelines that s a place that brookfield really finds attractive back in october they closed their acquisition of enbridge s western canadian natural gas gathering and processing business that was a large acquisition that really increased their position in the natural gas pipeline business can you talk about that acquisition and then more broadly how brookfield looks at the gas distribution pipeline business as an opportunity for them to grow dilallo as you hinted at the energy market downturn in recent years has really made it hard for mlps and pipeline companies like enbridge to sell equity to fund growth they ve turned to selling assets brookfield had an opportunity to buy one of the best gathering and processing businesses out in western canada what gathering and processing is basically they take the natural gas from the wellhead and then they separate the natural gas liquids from the gas they make money based on fees the producers pay them fees to do this very stable cash flow lots of growth out there shale plays come to mind we don t know it much here in the states but it s a very fast growing shale play out in canada lots of natural gas liquids there s a lot of growth opportunity out there as canada finally starts exporting natural gas in a couple of years and shell finishes their plant and the natural gas liquids they can use those they make petrochemicals and other things with those it s an opportunity to participate in that growth out there more broadly as you mentioned investors aren t buying mlps and pipelines anymore with interest rates rising there s other competition like cds and then the market for mlps just tanked there s investor fear of investing in those types of assets it s opened the door for brookfield to start looking at hunting for new deals i wouldn t be surprised if they have a couple more this year it s a huge market opportunity they ve said it s about 150 billion in the next couple of years just from asset acquisitions and then helping mlps recapitalize lots of opportunities for them out there sciple brookfield has positioned their balance sheet to put them in a position to really start deploying capital throughout the next year management has mentioned over the past year they ve raised 800 million in debt and preferred equity as well as refinanced 1 5 billion in debt to put them in a position where management has said quote they don t have any maturities to worry about for the next five years they have 3 5 billion in liquidity available right now in addition to whatever assets sales they may undergo to raise more capital and redeploy that as you look forward into the growth opportunities for brookfield as i mentioned they have a balance sheet that puts them in a position to redeploy their capital how bullish are you on the growth opportunities for brookfield infrastructure partners looking out over the next few years dilallo i m really excited about them what s exciting about them what we haven t talked about yet is brookfield doesn t bake acquisitions into their growth forecasts they think they can grow their funds from operations by 6 9 per year and that s all organic that s volume growing through their ports it s inflation linked contracts in their natural gas pipelines then there s this third aspect of expansion projects they have a bunch of expansion projects all around the world they re working with kinder morgan on a natural gas pipeline in the gulf coast they ve got some projects on their cell towers out in france they have a lot of these organic growth projects you have those that should give you that steady growth in the next couple of years and then you have the added kicker of this value uplift as they sell assets you mentioned the electricity transmission business they thought that was only going to grow about 2 3 a year so they sell that and buy six businesses that should grow by mid single digit rates so you re getting a faster organic growth rate from that plus the uplift in the earnings from selling one business and buying these other ones that they re getting for a better price i think it could do maybe a double digit total return when you add in the dividend going forward you re not talking about doubling in the next year or so but you re talking about if you hold this for several years you should do very well sciple you re going to have more cash after holding brookfield infrastructure partners than you did before you bought into the company and i think that s what you re looking for an investment in brookfield can reliably give you that and has a track record to prove that ok matt let s talk a little bit about brookfield renewable partners this is another brookfield subsidiary launched in 2011 as the name may indicate they invest in renewable energy assets can you talk a little bit about how the brookfield renewable business is structured and how they make money dilallo brookfield s core businesses is hydro power that s what their foundation is they ve gotten into wind and more recently they ve added some solar they acquired a stake in terraform power and terraform global which are two renewable companies focused on wind and solar now they have that full renewable platform what s different about brookfield though from a utility is that they sell this power to utilities under long term contracts they ll generate steady cash flow as electricity is generated out of their hydro power they re getting paid a steady rate that insulates them from power prices which can fluctuate based on demand you ve got that steady cash flow coming in that s what makes them an interesting way to play renewables sciple you mentioned they re mostly hydro power about three quarters of brookfield renewable s assets are allocated toward hydroelectric power they really like the opportunity there because it has a really long useful life once you get the dam in place to generate power the capital costs to maintain it are relatively low another thing that they mentioned which i find interesting and it ties into some discussions we ve had previously on the show is that they re able to match power supply with demand you talk about solar and wind there can be some issues with demand for power not lining up to when the sun is shining or the wind s blowing but when it comes to hydro power you can really regulate that because you can just stop water flowing through the dam to line things up with demand they ve really focused in hydro for a long period of time but over the past few years as you mentioned they ve started moving more into wind and solar management has said the reason they stayed away from wind and solar for the longest time was because the economics didn t make sense there wasn t a clear path to profitability to acquiring these assets however in the past few years as prices for these systems have started to come down they ve really started to push into those assets that s another case of indicating the way brookfield thinks about investing in assets it s not demand for this is going to grow over time it s how can i make a cash return on this investment we talked about how this terraform investment has really moved them into solar energy in a meaningful way where they hadn t been before this terraform acquisition lines up with those other acquisitions we talked about in part one last week they bought terraform power out of bankruptcy from sunedison can you talk about how that transaction shook out and what advantages that gave to brookfield being able to buy a distressed asset like terraform dilallo it lines up with brookfield asset management s overarching goals to buy for value they ll target something and they ll keep an eye out until they see something of value but it also needs to be substantial enough to provide them a platform they saw an opportunity when sunedison went bankrupt to take over their yieldcos so they pounced on that opportunity and they took terraform global private they have a sizable stake in terraform power that gives them that platform in wind and solar that they can expand they ve been able to help terraform power expand significantly since they bought this stake they bought a spanish wind and solar company last year that expanded them into western europe that s their goal going forward is to be able to expand this business sciple i saw from that acquisition they doubled annualized cash flows for terraform power it really helped them with capital structure they were able to help them get out of some unfavorable financing covenants and put them in a position to generate stable cash flows over time it s just another example of how when brookfield buys these assets they really know how to position them well not just for the value that they have when they acquired them but what steps they can take after they acquire the asset to increase its value even further another thing they re moving into another thing i found interesting they re moving into energy storage when you talk about renewable energy i mentioned lining up supply of energy with demand energy storage helps with that when you re looking at wind and solar do you think that is a significant opportunity for brookfield or is that more peripheral to the other assets they own how should we think about the energy storage part of their investments dilallo i do think that it s going to be important for renewable growth overall to be able to have storage that s cheap enough to make it economically viable one company that s really on the forefront of that is nextera energy they actually just signed a deal with a utility to do wind solar and storage at the same location sciple another thing that i really found interesting about what brookfield renewable is doing is they re expanding their investments into energy storage we ve talked about on this show in the past and it relates to what i said earlier on the hydroelectric assets when it comes to the ability to line up renewable energy supply with demand for energy production assets like wind and solar that only produce power when the sun is out or the wind is blowing do you see the energy storage opportunity as one of significance for brookfield renewable how should investors think about that when they think about this investment dilallo i do think it s a significant step for them as you mentioned the intermittency of renewables has been a drag on growth it s been something that those who are against it have pointed out we need this baseline power it does take companies to invest in these and to add them now so it s good to see them making these investments i do think we re going to see a lot more of that going forward not only from brookfield but from others in the industry nextera energy is one that has been on the forefront of energy storage they recently signed an interesting deal with a utility out on the west coast where they re building a huge energy facility that will include wind solar and storage if the sun s not shining it ll probably be windy and if it s not windy and the sun s not shining they ll have that energy storage component i think that s going to be something that we ll see a lot more of where they re going to add in this energy storage nextera energy s ceo was clear that the way the cost curve has come the way technologies have improved i m paraphrasing his quote because i don t have it offhand within a decade when you add in energy storage to wind and solar and this is without government incentives it should be lower than all forms of power other than natural gas on a high efficiency system that was a bold statement but it s definitely the direction that the industry is heading in that s really exciting climate change worries and just getting rid of emissions in general to see that happening it s exciting sciple yeah and for a company like brookfield it shows that there s opportunities to make profits on these investments today which is why we re seeing them start to move into the space particularly with wind and solar let s talk a little bit about brookfield renewable s yield that s one of the most attractive parts about this business it yields almost 7 when you talk about the energy assets they have their cash flows are really predictable because particularly with renewable energy the sun is going to keep coming out the wind s going to keep blowing and the rivers are going to keep flowing to power these hydro assets when you look at this dividend how attractive is it to you as an investor what prospects might we have for it to continue to increase over time dilallo i m very much of an income focused investor companies that increase their dividends the data shows that they tend to outperform all other companies so any time i see a company that pays an attractive dividend that they have clear ways to be able to increase it that s going to catch my eye then you add in the renewables and it just makes this such an attractive long term holding for any investor you re going to need income eventually whether you re quite a ways away from retirement like i am still i can reinvest that into other opportunities you re looking at an investment that s going to pay very steady cash flow it s going to increase they just raised it to 5 for this coming year they have clear ways to be able to continue to raise it because they can sign up higher price contracts for the power as contracts expire and they re developing new wind and hydro projects and solar around the world and then acquisitions you have three or four growth drivers of this company that are going to take that dividend up and up and up sciple yeah and if you look out over time throughout its history as a business it s delivered an annual total return taking into account the dividend of 15 over time really if you can give me a 15 compounded annual return over time that s going to compound your wealth in a significant way let s talk a little bit about brookfield renewable s balance sheet we got another question from listener noel sayers about that he s been staying away from brookfield renewable both because he sees them as having a heavy debt load on their balance sheet as well as as we mentioned on part one of this brookfield discussion that you can listen to last week he s concerned about the fees that brookfield asset management charges to the brookfield renewable subsidiary we already covered the question about the management fees you can go back and listen to our episode last week if you want to hear about that when you look at brookfield renewable s balance sheet do you have concerns over the level of debt that they are carrying today dilallo i don t because brookfield structures its debt to investment grade ratings they also do it typically on an asset level or on the business level they own several operating businesses we mentioned terraform power they own a big stake in that you factor in terraform s debt then they own a business out in ireland they own one in i believe colombia the debt is at those business levels those asset levels it s nonrecourse to brookfield which means if one of those businesses goes bankrupt they would restructure that business and it wouldn t have any impact on brookfield you have that debt down at those levels it s all investment grade how they structure it in this case brookfield looks for three times ebitda for a business that s generating very stable cash flow that s pretty low so i m not worried about them i actually like the fact that they have an investment grade balance sheet for me that s a stamp of approval to say that and somebody that s a lot smarter than me on credit believes that this is solid from a credit standpoint what an investment grade balance sheet means is that when a downturn comes this is a company that should still be able to pay its bills so that s something that i m very comfortable with sciple it also allows brookfield to raise debt at lower interest rates when you talk about the ability that they have to allocate their capital in a way to drive attractive returns if you can say raise debt at 3 4 and then invest that capital at 7 8 that s a really good position to be in as an asset allocating business when we think about where brookfield renewable is going to be going forward their opportunities to continue expanding over time what opportunities do you see there for the business how excited are you about the opportunities in renewables both for brookfield and in general across the broader market dilallo it was a third quarter as a shareholder letter that brookfield put out and i highly recommend reading any of brookfield s shareholder letters there s always some nugget in there that s just mind blowing this one in particular the ceo of brookfield renewable said that it s a 10 trillion opportunity in renewables to basically wean the global economy off of fossil fuels and that s only in the markets that brookfield operates in which are big markets the united states canada those big developed countries but that just shows you the size of the opportunity for them to invest capital with them investing it at a value basis there s just going to be really good opportunities for them they ll look they ll wait for situations like a terraform where they can scoop it up for really good valuations i m very excited about what they can do they think they can invest probably 700 million a year on just acquisitions and that ll grow over time as their cash flow grows it s one of the most exciting for me renewables out there sciple yeah because when you look at renewables the way they re positioned to grow over time as i ve continued to mention the ability of brookfield executives to allocate capital in a very prudent way that s going to generate returns over time it s an attractive way to get exposure to renewables in a space that sometimes can be difficult to find opportunities that give you a strong risk adjusted return when you look at solar panel makers over time they ve been tough companies to own for investors brookfield gives you a way to get exposure to those really important trends in a way that you can sleep at night which i find really attractive as an investor what do you think matt dilallo absolutely i ve been burned to use a pun on solar panel makers several times this is one of the few times i ve actually made money on renewables i m excited for that to continue sciple before we go away over these last two episodes we ve discussed brookfield asset management brookfield property partners business partners infrastructure the entire family of brookfield companies as you look out at this potential basket of investments are there any of them that particularly stand out to you as if i only had a certain amount of capital to invest this would be the one that i would invest in how do you think about choosing between this entire family of businesses to invest in dilallo if i was an investor just starting out i would go with brookfield asset management for two reasons one you get the whole pie you get the renewables you get the infrastructure you get the property you also don t have to deal with those schedule k 1s that we mentioned in last week s episode it s a much easier investment for somebody to make in a retirement account for example that s where i would start but if somebody wanted specifically exposure to renewables or property then i would look more at the subsidiaries especially if you re more income focused but if you re younger and looking for a retirement option brookfield asset management would be the top one i d buy sciple awesome matt i d agree with you there the simplicity from a tax point of view the exposure across all the family of businesses i really find attractive i will say brookfield renewable is something that does appear very attractive to me i like the way they ve allocated assets you just mentioned how big the total market opportunity is but you really can t go wrong with anybody in this family of companies they check a lot of the boxes that you re looking for as an investor definitely a company that our listeners should pay attention to both the parent as well as all the subsidiaries matt i want to thank you for coming on these past couple of episodes i hope we shared some valuable information for our listeners dilallo thanks for having me sciple awesome matt as always people on the program may own companies discussed on the show and the motley fool may have formal recommendations for or against stocks mentioned so don t buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear thanks to rick engdahl and dan boyd for their work behind the glass for matt dilallo i m nick sciple thanks for listening and fool on

washington ap u s and chinese negotiators agreed friday to extend high level trade talks through the weekend and president donald trump said he hoped to meet next month at his florida resort with president xi jinping to try to finalize an agreement the news followed two days of negotiations in washington aimed at resolving a trade war that has rattled financial markets and threatened global economic growth we re making a lot of progress trump told reporters at the white house i think there s a very good chance that a deal can be made treasury secretary steven mnuchin said the negotiations which had been scheduled to conclude friday afternoon would continue through sunday the chinese delegation is led by xi s special envoy vice premier liu he the american team by trade representative robert lighthizer trump had originally warned that he would escalate the tariffs he has imposed on 200 billion in chinese imports from 10 to 25 percent if the two sides failed to reach a deal by march 2 but in recent days and again on friday he raised the possibility of extending that deadline if negotiators were nearing an agreement the world s two biggest economies are sparring over u s allegations that beijing uses predatory tactics in a drive to make chinese companies world leaders in such advanced industries as robotics and driverless cars those tactics the trump administration argues include cyber theft unfair subsidies for state owned chinese companies the use of regulations to hobble china s foreign competitors and pressure on american companies to hand over technology in exchange for access to the chinese market the administration contends that beijing has repeatedly failed to live up to its past commitments to open its markets and to treat foreign companies more fairly the president has imposed 25 percent tariffs on 50 billion in chinese imports and 10 percent tariffs on 200 billion worth the latter grouping would face the 25 percent tariffs too if no agreement is reached beijing has lashed back with import taxes of its own on 110 billion in u s goods these tariffs are heavily aimed at soybeans and other agricultural products in an effort to pressure trump supporters in the u s farm belt on friday the president and his advisers provided few details on this week s negotiations trump did say the two sides had reached some agreement on currency manipulation but offered no specifics the administration has worried that beijing would blunt the impact of trump s sanctions by manipulating its currency down to give chinese companies a competitive edge in international markets trump said both sides want to make this a real deal we want to make it a meaningful deal the president said not a deal that s done and doesn t mean anything we want to make this a deal that s going to last for many many years and a deal that s going to be good for both countries trump raised the possibility that the u s will drop criminal charges against chinese telecommunications giant huawei saying the issue would be discussed with attorney general bill barr and u s attorneys the u s has charged huawei with lying about violating sanctions against iran and with stealing trade secrets asked about huawei before the oval office meeting with liu trump said that a decision on huawei is pending but right now it s not something we re discussing after trump appeared with liu agriculture secretary sonny perdue announced that beijing had agreed to buy 10 million metric tons of american soybeans tweeting hats off to at potus for bringing china to the table china s soybean tariffs have squeezed many american farmers in the first 10 months of 2018 u s soybean exports to china dropped to 8 2 million metric tons from 21 4 million metric tons a year earlier a 62 percent freefall according to the agriculture department in front of liu and the press corps trump ridiculed members of his own trade team for using the term memoranda of understanding or mou to describe the agreements they were working out with the chinese you either make a deal or you re not trump said to have these other agreements doesn t mean anything because they re not that meaningful in my opinion lighthizer at first defended the acronym describing mous as binding contracts then made light of the rebuke and vowed never to use the term again the u s china conflict has rattled markets it has also fanned uncertainty among businesses that must decide where to invest and whether trump s tariffs which raise the cost of imports on the target list will last long enough to justify replacing chinese suppliers with those from countries not subject to the tariffs the international monetary fund the world bank and the organization for economic cooperation and development have all downgraded their forecasts for the global economy citing the heightened trade tensions the chinese economy in particular is decelerating the imf expects china to record 6 2 percent growth this year down from 6 6 percent in 2018 the chinese economy is definitely hurting right now said timothy keeler partner at the law firm mayer brown and former chief of staff for the office of the u s trade representative there s a lot of leverage for the u s myron brilliant head of international affairs at the u s chamber of commerce said the two countries have yet to bridge their differences over nettlesome issues such as the forced technology transfer he said the chamber wants to see an end to the tariffs between washington and beijing but he also said american businesses are demanding a deal that would produce lasting improvement in chinese trade practices we simply can t go back to business as it was before brilliant said beijing he said has got to deliver the goods darlene superville in

us and chinese negotiators had made progress and will extend this week s round of negotiations by two days through sunday trump told reporters at the white house as he met with his top negotiators and their counterpart chinese vice premier liu he doug mills the new york times president donald trump said on friday there was a very good chance the united states would strike a deal with china to end their trade war and that he was inclined to extend his march 1 tariff deadline and meet soon with chinese president xi jinping us and chinese negotiators had made progress and will extend this week s round of negotiations by two days through sunday trump told reporters at the white house as he met with his top negotiators and their counterpart chinese vice premier liu he i think that we both feel there s a very good chance a deal will happen trump said advertisement the republican president said he probably would meet with xi in march in florida to decide on the most important terms of a trade deal extending the deadline would put on hold trump s threatened tariff increase to 25 percent from 10 percent on 200 billion of chinese imports into the united states that would prevent a further escalation in a trade war that already has disrupted commerce in goods worth hundreds of billions of dollars slowed global economic growth and roiled markets optimism that the two sides will find a way to end the trade war lifted stocks especially technology shares the s p 500 stock index reached its highest closing level since nov 8 oil prices rose to their highest since mid november with brent crude reaching a high of 67 73 a barrel currency agreement trump and treasury secretary steven mnuchin said the two sides had reached an agreement on currency trump declined to provide details but us officials long have expressed concerns that china s yuan is undervalued giving china a trade advantage and partly offsetting us tariffs advertisement announcement of a pact aimed at limiting yuan depreciation was putting the currency cart before the trade horse but would likely be positive for asian emerging market currencies said alan ruskin global head of currency strategy at deutsche bank

clients in a letter to trump read aloud by an aide to liu at the white house xi called on negotiators to work hard to strike a deal that benefits both country trump said a deal with china may extend beyond trade to encompass chinese telecommunications companies huawei technologies and zte corp the justice department has accused huawei of conspiring to violate us sanctions on iran and of stealing robotic technology from t mobile us inc advertisement chinese peer zte was last year prevented from buying essential components from us firms after pleading guilty to similar charges crippling its operations memorandums no more trump appeared at odds with his top negotiator us trade representative robert lighthizer on the preliminary terms that his team is outlining in memorandums of understanding for a deal with china trump said he did not like mous because they are short term and he wanted a long term deal i don t like mous because they don t mean anything trump said either you are going to make a deal or you re not lighthizer responded testily that mous were binding but that he would never use the term again advertisement reuters reported exclusively on wednesday that the two sides were drafting the language for six mous covering the most difficult issues in the trade talks that would require structural economic change in china negotiators have struggled this week to agree on specific language within those memorandums to address tough us demands for structural changes in china s economy according to sources familiar with the talks the six memorandums include cyber theft intellectual property rights services agriculture and non tariff barriers to trade including subsidies an industry source briefed on the talks said both sides have narrowed differences on intellectual property rights market access and narrowing a nearly 400 billion us trade deficit with china but bigger differences remain on changes to china s treatment of state owned enterprises subsidies forced technology transfers and cyber theft of us trade secrets lighthizer pushed back when questioned on forced technology transfers saying the two sides made a lot of progress on the issue but did not elaborate advertisement the united states has said foreign firms in china are often coerced to transfer their technology to chinese firms if they want to operate there china denies this the us chamber of commerce on friday urged the us government to ensure the deal was comprehensive and addressed core issues rather than one based on more chinese short term purchases of goods china has pledged to increase purchases of agricultural produce energy semiconductors and industrial goods to reduce its trade surplus with the united states china committed to buying an additional 10 million tonnes of us soybeans on friday us agriculture secretary sonny perdue said on twitter china bought about 32 million tonnes of us soybeans in 2017 advertisement the commitments are a show of good faith by the chinese and indications of more good news to come perdue wrote china was the top buyer of us soybeans before the trade war but beijing s retaliatory tariffs on us soybeans slashed business that had been worth 12 billion annually
most people expect that our signal of an impending reduction in world oil or coal production will be high prices looking at historical data for example this post and this post this is precisely the opposite of the correct price signal oil and coal supplies decline because prices fall too low for producers these producers make voluntary cutbacks because the prices they receive fall below their cost of production there often are supply gluts at the same time this strange situation arises because prices must be high enough for the producersat the same time that goods and services made by oil and other energy products are inexpensive enough for consumers to afford there is a two way battle taking place 1 prices producers require tend to rise over time because of depletion the easiest to extract portion of any resource such as oil coal copper or lithium tends to be removed first what is left tends to be deeper lower quality or otherwise more difficult to extract cheaply 2 prices consumers can afford for discretionary goods such as cell phones and automobiles tend to fall for a combination of reasons wages of many workers fall because of competition from lower cost labor in other countries some jobs are eliminated through the use of computers or robots young people are increasingly being required to pay for higher education beyond that which is provided free leaving many with loans to repay reducing their discretionary income changes to us healthcare law mostly starting january 1 2014 lead to required health insurance premiums while some citizens find cost savings in this approach healthy young people often experience cutbacks in discretionary income as a result rents and home prices keep rising faster than incomes when the discretionary income of the many non elite workers of the world falls they buy fewer finished goods and services finished goods and services are manufactured using commodities of many kinds including oil coal copper iron ore and fresh water when discretionary demand falls commodity prices tend to fall this is the problem we are encountering now it tends to cause the prices of many commodities to fall below the cost of production eventually producers decide to quit because production is no longer profitable this is the issue that leads to peak oil coal or copper if the affordability price clash mostly affects non elite workers does it matter when i talk about non elite workers i am talking about workers who are in the bottom 90 of the wage distribution elite workers will always have enough income for the necessities of life there are so many non elite workers in the world that they indeed do make a difference also the forces that adversely affect non elite workers tend to have several effects they tend to send a larger share of wages to elite workers as the economy becomes more complex and more specialized they tend to send more unearned income to elite workers through capital appreciation because elite workers can afford to buy shares of stock and expensive homes the wealthy spend their income differently from non elite workers non elite workers tend spend the bulk of their discretionary income on devices made using commodities such as cell phones and automobiles the wealthy are likely to spend their discretionary income in less energy intensive ways such as investing in shares of stock and buying services such as private college education for their children history shows that economies tend to collapse when wage and wealth disparity becomes too great collapse can take various forms including revolutions by the disgruntled underclass increased susceptibility to epidemics or the financial collapse of governments wars become more likely as one country tries to aid its citizens at the expense of citizens of other countries the world today seems to be approaching a crisis point with respect to wage and wealth disparity young people in particular are adversely affected figure 2 shows a chart indicating that wage disparity seems to be back to the level it was at the time of the great depression of the 1930s this was also a time of low commodity prices and gluts of food and oil gluts tend to occur because commodity prices rise to a level where devices made with these commodities such as cell phones and automobiles become too expensive for non elite workers to afford elite workers can still afford the devices but there are not enough elite workers to make up for the shortfall in non elite buyers of these devices so industrial output per capita tends to fall figure 3 shows the important role that the wages of non elite workers play in generating adequate demand if their wages are high enough they can buy enough goods and services made with commodities to keep commodity prices high with sufficiently high commodity prices production can continue why the peak in world oil production likely occurred in 2018 if we look at recent oil data we see a pattern of growing gluts in supply as indicated by the red bars in figure 4 even in the most recent week the week ending february 15 2019 after all of the cuts begun by opec and other oil exporters us crude oil stocks continue to build this is not the impact a person would expect if the production cuts are truly effective this is precisely the kind of signal we would expect if products made with oil and using oil in their operation are becoming increasingly unaffordable for the non elite workers of the world note that these bars are becoming more frequent and are occurring at lower prices this is the expected outcome of a clash between the falling discretionary income of non elite workers and the rising costs of oil producers when prices fall too low producers cut back production opec reports its view of the effect of recent production cutbacks in figure 5 given the nearly worldwide problem of falling affordability of goods by non elite workers we should not be surprised if the peaks in oil production in october and november 2018 ultimately prove to be the maximum production ever recorded in fact it seems quite likely that the year 2018 will prove to be the year with the highest ever oil production the cutback in production will appear to be voluntary once cutbacks start they will tend to feed upon themselves unless oil prices really spike following the cutbacks say to 90 per barrel exporting countries will find themselves worse off after the cutbacks for a combination of reasons the cutback in production will reduce the number of workers directly and indirectly employed by the oil industry their reduced spending will lead to a need for expanded government programs housing prices will fall in oil exporting countries this is likely to ultimately lead to debt defaults tax revenue that governments of oil exporters can collect on the smaller amount of oil will be lower even though the needs of the economy will be greater ultimately it seems likely that at least some governments of oil exporting countries will be overthrown depressing oil production further if the breakeven price for most opec members including necessary tax revenue was over 100 per barrel in 2014 it is hard to see how exporters can get along with much less today world coal production following a similar pattern to oil one thing that most people don t realize is that coal prices follow a very similar pattern to those of oil in figure 6 coal prices experience a major peak in 2008 followed by a lower peak in the 2011 period which peters out by 2013 prices recently are much lower than in the 2008 period or in the 2011 to 2013 period this pattern is very similar to the recent pattern in oil prices the similarity in the patterns of coal prices and oil prices makes perfect sense if prices of both oil and coal are based primarily on affordability and this affordability depends heavily on the wages of non elite workers when countries such as china ramp up their debt more non elite workers can be hired at higher wages these workers can make more computers automobiles steel ingots and many other goods they can also afford to buy more output of the world economy this ramped up demand tends to raise the prices of both coal and oil for many commodities china s demand represents close to half of the world demand china has become the world s number one manufacturer of goods china needs growing energy consumption to maintain its growth of manufactured goods because it takes energy to operate machines even computers it even takes energy to keep the lights on unfortunately with the recent lower prices for coal and oil china is experiencing lower production of both coal and oil figure 7 without growing energy supplies china cannot meet the world s growing need for manufactured goods the reason why china has recently reduced production of both coal and oil is the usual one the rising cost of production conflicts with the low prices available in the marketplace making production unprofitable for a growing share of producers how about china s total energy consumption do imports make up for china s lack of local production not really china is the world s largest importer of coal oil and natural gas it is also the number one user of wind and solar included in the tiny orange other renewables portion of the chart even with these huge additions to china s energy production its annual growth in the quantity of energy it consumes including imports has plummeted figure 9 china reports that its real gdp growth rate is still very high over 6 net of inflation but many observers are skeptical of this claim certainly going forward its coal and oil production cannot continue to decline or the economy will encounter huge problems the amount of goods china will be able to manufacture will fall as will the number of new homes it can build without continued growth china is likely to run into debt default problems china is such a large country that its problems can be expected to adversely affect the world economy as a whole figure 10 shows that china produces nearly half of the world s total coal if china s coal production declines world production is also likely to decline the only way to prop up coal production for either china or the rest of the world is higher prices indirectly coming from higher demand from non elite workers businesses can perhaps use rising debt to hire these non elite workers but if there is not a sufficient supply of buyers who can afford the additional goods and services made by these workers the final outcome will be debt defaults the fundamental problem is a physics problem the fundamental problem is that the economy grows for the same reason that hurricanes ecosystems stars and plants and animals grow they are dissipative structures that grow in the presence of energy flows in the case of hurricanes the energy comes from the heat in the warm ocean in the case of the economy the energy flows are of many different types including among others human energy energy of draft animals solar energy fossil fuels and wind energy one key characteristic of dissipative structures is that they are not permanent permanent growth in a finite system is not possible the laws of physics sets up the system in such a way that dissipative structures grow and eventually collapse over time new dissipative structures form each varying in a random way from previous dissipative structures those best adapted to the ever changing circumstances tend to last the longest this is the way that the evolution of economies takes place just as the evolution of plants and animals takes place one characteristic of economies is that physics determines how much energy is needed to manufacture and transport a particular product it also determines how much the mix of buyers can afford to pay for finished products using this energy thus physics determines the potential profitability of a particular manufacturing process with lower energy costs tending to make production more profitable as energy costs rise because of diminishing returns the system eventually reaches a point where it must collapse the cost of production rises so high relative to wages that many non elite workers cannot afford the finished goods and services made by the system the laws of physics also determine what wage distributions must look like given the availability of energy and other resources in general if there are not enough resources to go around some members of the economy tend to get frozen out by low wages in addition in a low energy per capita situation the energy that is available tends to rise to the top to the high earners of the economy somewhat like heating water transforms it to its gas phase steam which rises to the top with this structure even with a severe energy shortfall some members of the economy can be survivors with today s worldwide economy the survivors might be some humans and businesses within the world economy the system would need to start over building up smaller economies from pieces that managed to stay intact but the system as a whole would not die out unless the energy shortfall were to be severe modeling the world economy one issue with academic research today is that it tends to be divided into many academic silos researchers tend to know more and more about their own field but less and less about other fields that might be peripherally related for example economists tend not to keep up with the physics of self organizing networked systems geophysicists understand the physics that governs the extraction of fuels but they have no insight into the fact that the laws of physics might also affect prices and wage distributions without understanding the forces that are causing the results that are being observed it is very easy to create a model that is more misleading than helpful for example a simple model of the earth is the one each of us can see as we look around us the model shown in figure 11 is a flat map this is a perfectly good representation of what the earth looks like if a person is not concerned about what happens at a distance of course to extend the map out a person really needs to convert the model into a globe a globe is a very different model economic researchers tend to have some of the same modeling issues as illustrated by the flat map model economists favor fitting curves to past data to forecast the future patterns curve fitting tends not to be good for determining turning points when dealing with energy and other resources we are really interested in when a turning point will happen forcing production of energy products and resources of many kinds downward another model favored by economists is the standard two dimensional supply and demand model figure 12 this model ignores the special role that energy products play because of the operation of the laws of physics energy products as they work through the networked economy affect both the supply and demand of finished goods and services making the two dimensional model shown inappropriate with neither curve fitting or nor the standard supply and demand model sounding an alarm with respect to energy prices not being able to rise forever economists have tended to overlook this issue of course policymakers are happy to hear happily ever after endings few policymakers question the reasonableness of the models they do not consider the possibility that the falling discretionary income of non elite workers around the world might choke off demand for goods made with energy products even geophysicists who have looked at the problem tend to get the story only half right they understand underground physics but they tend not to understand that prices cannot rise indefinitely this is a different related issue also associated with the physics of the situation climate change is our biggest problem is a corollary to bad modeling if a person truly believes that energy prices can and will rise forever then it is an easy corollary to assume that all fossil fuels that we can identify within the earth s crust will eventually become extractable there are no limits except for the limits imposed by climate change of course if we are really hitting price limits here and now the situation is likely to be very different these price limits will cause a very near term decline in energy supply which we essentially have no control over financial systems are likely to collapse international trade will be scaled way back world population is likely to fall co2 levels will in time adjust to this radically changed world i showed earlier in how the peak oil story could be close but not quite right that the models used to prove that wind and solar can be helpful to the system greatly overstate their benefit to the system as a result we don t really have evidence that wind and solar are even helpful to the system consequently we really have two false models working together to give an illusion that we have a huge problem which is fixable if we just exert enough effort physics puts a cap on our efforts however the physics of the system makes the system collapse before policymakers can hope to even make a small fix the unfortunate problem is that policymakers are not really in charge the laws of physics are in charge energy and other resources are no longer inexpensive enough to extract to allow the system to work the proposed solutions wind and solar are not cheap enough to save the system either we can temporarily hide the problem with more debt indirect promises of future energy at lower interest rates but this does not fix the system conclusion many of the problems the world economy is facing today seem to be the result of reaching the limits of energy extraction very few researchers understand how a self organized networked economy really operates as a result the symptoms of economic health and economic illness have been confused it looks quite possible that we have reached both peak oil and peak coal approximately simultaneously this is a frightening situation because it could be an indication of collapse in the next few years this would likely be much worse than the depression of the 1930s of course even with these observations we do not know precisely what lies ahead somehow multicellular animals have lived on this earth for a very long time amazing coincidences have happened and may continue to happen allowing economies to flourish we humans do not have as much control over the current situation as we would like to think that we have fortunately we cannot rule out the possibility of more amazing coincidences perhaps even caused by a literal higher power behind the energy flows thus the result may be different from what our models seem to suggest gail e tverberg graduated from st olaf college in northfield minnesota in 1968 with a b s in mathematics she received a m s

washington ap u s and chinese negotiators agreed friday to extend high level trade talks through the weekend and president donald trump said he hoped to meet next month at his florida resort with president xi jinping to try to finalize an agreement the news followed two days of negotiations in washington aimed at resolving a trade war that has rattled financial markets and threatened global economic growth we re making a lot of progress trump told reporters at the white house i think there s a very good chance that a deal can be made treasury secretary steven mnuchin said the negotiations which had been scheduled to conclude friday afternoon would continue through sunday the chinese delegation is led by xi s special envoy vice premier liu he the american team by trade representative robert lighthizer trump had originally warned that he would escalate the tariffs he has imposed on 200 billion in chinese imports from 10 to 25 percent if the two sides failed to reach a deal by march 2 but in recent days and again on friday he raised the possibility of extending that deadline if negotiators were nearing an agreement the world s two biggest economies are sparring over u s allegations that beijing uses predatory tactics in a drive to make chinese companies world leaders in such advanced industries as robotics and driverless cars those tactics the trump administration argues include cyber theft unfair subsidies for state owned chinese companies the use of regulations to hobble china s foreign competitors and pressure on american companies to hand over technology in exchange for access to the chinese market the administration contends that beijing has repeatedly failed to live up to its past commitments to open its markets and to treat foreign companies more fairly the president has imposed 25 percent tariffs on 50 billion in chinese imports and 10 percent tariffs on 200 billion worth the latter grouping would face the 25 percent tariffs too if no agreement is reached beijing has lashed back with import taxes of its own on 110 billion in u s goods these tariffs are heavily aimed at soybeans and other agricultural products in an effort to pressure trump supporters in the u s farm belt on friday the president and his advisers provided few details on this week s negotiations trump did say the two sides had reached some agreement on currency manipulation but offered no specifics the administration has worried that beijing would blunt the impact of trump s sanctions by manipulating its currency down to give chinese companies a competitive edge in international markets trump said both sides want to make this a real deal we want to make it a meaningful deal the president said not a deal that s done and doesn t mean anything we want to make this a deal that s going to last for many many years and a deal that s going to be good for both countries trump raised the possibility that the u s will drop criminal charges against chinese telecommunications giant huawei saying the issue would be discussed with attorney general bill barr and u s attorneys the u s has charged huawei with lying about violating sanctions against iran and with stealing trade secrets asked about huawei before the oval office meeting with liu trump said that a decision on huawei is pending but right now it s not something we re discussing after trump appeared with liu agriculture secretary sonny perdue announced that beijing had agreed to buy 10 million metric tons of american soybeans tweeting hats off to potus for bringing china to the table china s soybean tariffs have squeezed many american farmers in the first 10 months of 2018 u s soybean exports to china dropped to 8 2 million metric tons from 21 4 million metric tons a year earlier a 62 percent freefall according to the agriculture department in front of liu and the press corps trump ridiculed members of his own trade team for using the term memoranda of understanding or mou to describe the agreements they were working out with the chinese you either make a deal or you re not trump said to have these other agreements doesn t mean anything because they re not that meaningful in my opinion lighthizer at first defended the acronym describing mous as binding contracts then made light of the rebuke and vowed never to use the term again the u s china conflict has rattled markets it has also fanned uncertainty among businesses that must decide where to invest and whether trump s tariffs which raise the cost of imports on the target list will last long enough to justify replacing chinese suppliers with those from countries not subject to the tariffs the international monetary fund the world bank and the organization for economic cooperation and development have all downgraded their forecasts for the global economy citing the heightened trade tensions the chinese economy in particular is decelerating the imf expects china to record 6 2 percent growth

how budget delay is affecting economy with the hope of the passage of the national budget still uncertain stakeholders worry this may have a rippled negative effect on the economy reports ibrahim apekhade yusuf and medinat kanabe no doubt there has been a long wait for the passage of the national budget but for how much longer the wait would be is what many stakeholders are worried about one such stakeholder who has raised his voice above the din is the top echelons of the chartered institute bankers of nigeria cibn dr uche olowu at a public forum recently he decried the incessant delay in the passage of the national budget saying it impacts negatively on national productivity even as he called on the federal government and the national assembly to close ranks in order to release the budget on time according to cibn president there was need for a new approach to the nation s budget the country needs to rethink its strategy of handling some of its economic activities for instance according to the african development bank adb nigeria needs to re orient its federal budget currently dominated by recurrent spending towards more capital expenditure and accumulating savings to sustain social spending besides delays in budget approval and signing have become predominant that it is not available for implementation in most cases in the first quarter and rare cases a better part of the second quarter over the past 15 years incidentally this year is not an exception this has led to uncertainty in the system affecting the delivery of projects which has profound impact on productivity in the economy i therefore wish to implore the executive and legislative arms of government to close ranks to release the budget on time olowu said budget 2019 president muhammadu buhari presented the 2019 budget to joint session of the two chambers proposed a total of n8 83 trillion last month budget parameters details of the proposed budget showed that it was based on crude oil benchmark price of 60 per barrel of oil and 2 3 million barrels per day the budget is further predicated on an exchange rate of n305 to 1 a real gross domestic growth of 3 01 per cent and inflation rate of 9 98 per cent the proposed budget shows that about a quarter of the sum n2 14 trillion will be used for debt servicing while capital expenditure is expected to gulp n2 031 trillion further breakdown presented by the president shows that proposed recurrent expenditure is n4 04 trillion statutory transfer is n492 36 billion there is a sinking fund of n120 billion while capital expenditure is n2 031 trillion mixed reactions trail 2019 budget proposal apparently wary of the performance of the previous budget a lot of stakeholders have expressed concern that the 2019 budget need to address a lot of grey areas firing the first salvo the director general of the lagos chamber of commerce and industry lcci muda yusuf in a statement made available to the nation while noting that the latest gross domestic product gdp statistic released by the national bureau of statistics nbs shows that the nigerian economy grew by 1 81 year on year in the third quarter of 2018 amongst others he observed that this performance is lower than the lcci imf and economic recovery and growth plan ergp growth forecasts of 3 5 2 1 and 4 1 respectively for 2018 the managing director of cowry asset management limited johnson chukwu on his part said the projected revenue from crude oil based on production and price was cause for worry i think the oil price benchmark is too optimistic we have never reached 2 3 million barrels per day production in the last four years and now the oil cartel has cut production level if you cannot achieve your revenue projection it becomes difficult to carry out capital expenditure plans we would surely overshoot our deficit projections again and as usual we would borrow more in the view of gabriel ikese a public affairs commentator presenting the 2019 budget proposals in december should not be an excuse to delay the passing of the bill within reasonable time 2017 and 2018 budgets were presented november fairly reasonable time frame but still lingered for over 5 months at the national assembly members of the legislature he stressed should be patriotic enough to put aside personal interests and frivolous allegations from any quarters for the overriding national interest in passing the budget expeditiously with commitment and adequate capacity the budget can be passed in 30 working days the 2019 budget proposal should be expeditiously considered and passed in record time as a test of integrity and attestation of a responsible legislature this would change the negative perception of lawmakers and the hallowed institution of the national assembly also speaking in an interview with the nation sola fijabi managing director ceo brookes and blakes a media relations company with expertise in the emerging economies said the sign at the macroeconomic level hardly shows any promising except in the microeconomic levels worries over budget delay in the view of prof sheriffdeen tella professor of economics olabisi onabanjo university ago iwoye ogun the delay in budget approval in the last two years has affected the growth of the economy because such delay will not allow for the implementation of the capital part if the budget to a large extent and the implementation of capital budget is what engineers growth in every economy pressed further he said the delay is very bad and it has been affecting the economy in the last three or four years because in the last three or four years budget has not being passed earlier than may or june which is very bad for the economy so the current delay will also bring about the same thing the last report states that the economy grew in the last quarter of the year but in the first two quarters of the year there was no such growth when you have that kind of situation it means that if the budget is not passed in time that growth that we witnessed in the last quarter of the rest will start growing down by the first second quarter of the year so if the budget is passed in time definitely that growth will continue and it will help us to get out of the economy problem that we are in now according to him the problem is not with the government but the legislature the government has submitted the document but also the government didn t send it to the nearly 2017 the government submitted the budget early enough on october 7 but was not passed now the government submitted late but it is not good for the legislature to delay especially because of the period that we are in the election period they ought to have done everything before they embark on a full scale politicking so now that that has happened one will implore them that as soon as they come back they should not focus on the out one of the election anymore but on how to pass the budget in time so that the economy will continue go forward the university who reiterated that the perennial delays in passing yearly budgets showed that the legislature was ignorant of its responsibility said the early passage of the budget would promote economic growth and development the nigerian economy depends on government s budget to function properly the private sector particularly needs to see government direction to plan and execute their plans early passage of budget helps in this regard the private sector is the major participant in the capital market growth enhancing activities in the capital market are negatively affected by the delay in passing the budget tella said he noted that passing the federal budget in good time was capable of promoting economic growth assisting private sector for optimal business performance as well as energising money and capital market activities tella explained that early budget passage would promote planning in the lower levels of governments and the private sector in the assertion of prof leo ukpong of university of uyo it is bad for the economy one it sends a bad signal to investors in terms of expenditure projects that are approved or expected to be involved in when they delay the budget that means those budgets will also be delayed in terms of expenditure activities that will also delay the second major problem he stressed is in terms of uncertainty it creates fear because we don t even know when they will approve it so those who want to invest and those who have contracts all those things will slow down the question is not whether it will be bad for them economy the question should be how long the budget will be delayed we do you know because right now we are in election cycle and right now most of the focus right now is on election so this may throw things up for about two to three months i hope it is not that long before they will focus on the budget we don t know who is coming in and no party will like to pass a budget when you are not sure your re going to be there so generally we are going to see a drop in a lot of activities we are going to see a drop in stock market especially the foreign investors hold back and those are all negative feedbacks of negative effect of the delayed budget like tella ukpong argues that constitutionally budget should be passed one year before the next fiscal year so that we don t have any problem unfortunately that is in our constitution and it is the right thing because it is like saying i should pass a budget for what i will do next year so that the budget is approved and then the allocation in terms of payment can start taking place i think every other country that is what they do they make sure that one year ahead budget is on ground so that have start fighting for the other year at least we have money on ground to keep the government going if you follow usa you will see that they shut down the government for about three weeks because there was a budget fight between the parties on the forward ukpong who has expertise in economics energy economics monetary economics advises that the constitution need to be strengthened the presidency as the executive must do everything to make sure that the budget is approved one year before we start reading other expenditure so that it doesn t completely throw us off right now we are hoping that they will finish election and focus on budget mr sola oni a chartered stockbroker and chief executive officer sofunix investment and communications said delay in the passage of the budget was highly injurious to economic growth and development this enables them to advise their clients on taking positions and reviewing their portfolios accordingly at macro level early passage of the budget implies prompt implementation of capital projects this is critical to the growth of the economy as it has impact on growing the gross domestic products gdp oni said light at the end of the tunnel in the view of zainab ahmed finance minister nigeria recorded the highest capital spending in history under the present government led by president muhammadu buhari she was optimistic that the 2019 budget would achieve its set objective you see that s the thing we can t dictate to the national assembly how they do their work in the process of budget preparation the ministry of budget and national planning meets with every mdas to defend their budget before us and then we collate that budget and submit to the national assembly we simply cannot decide or dictate to nass how they handle the budget process or any of their processes for that matter they are a different organ of government it s just like saying the judiciary and the executive is trying to determination how they take cases in court you can t do that

in a statement yesterday rbz governor dr john mangudya said pursuant to the resolution of the monetary policy committee the mpc on march 28 2023 to complement the issuance of physical gold coins with gold backed digital products the bank wishes to advise that it will be issuing gold backed digital tokens with effect from may 8 2023 tawanda musarurwa senior business reporter banks have commenced trading in foreign currency at a rate of 2 5 to the united states dollar following the decision by the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz to float the currency on wednesday this rate according to observers is likely to bring stability on the market rbz governor dr john mangudya announced the introduction of an inter bank foreign exchange market while delivering his monetary policy statement yesterday the governor told business leaders that the central bank had met with banks and agreed to start at a rate of 2 5 which is lower than the prevailing rate of around 4 on the illegal market this is in line with indications of a managed float whereby banks will operate under some guidelines we came to a conclusion with the bankers last night thursday of 2 5 and we hope thereafter that the rate will continue to find itself said the rbz governor we have also put a number of safeguards to ensure that the exchange rate is going to remain stable and we are quite happy with the austerity measures announced by the ministry of finance because there is no longer too much demand on the fiscus university of zimbabwe economics lecturer and former government economic advisor professor ashok chakravati said the concept of a managed float had been successfully implemented in other countries such as nigeria and was optimistic it would work in zimbabwe too such a managed market has been successfully introduced in west africa nigeria angola and many other countries in africa so when we have such a managed market then we will be able to control the exchange rate prior to the floating of the us dollar the rbz had pegged rtgs balances at 1 1 to the us dollar however shortages had resulted in high premiums for us dollars on the parallel market which led to increases in prices the managed float is therefore expected to result in lowering of prices that had been pegged at over 1 4 with speculators cashing in on foreign currency shortages the inter bank market will work via banks and bureaux de change on a willing buyer willing seller basis according to the rbz the formalisation of foreign currency trading will entail denominating the existing rtgs balances bond notes and coins in circulation as rtgs dollars to establish an exchange between current monetary balances and foreign currency the rbz governor said the bulk of foreign currency will be allocated to the productive sectors of the economy seventy percent of the foreign currency will be utilised for productive sector s imports and requirements while the 30 percent will go to other things you cannot have us 5 million going towards purchasing of a private jet at the expense of companies like delta dairibord and the like he said companies need to boost production because the floating of the us dollar alone will not enhance productivity it is the hope of many industrialists and zimbabweans in general that the managed free float is going to bring sanity in foreign currency exchange

washington ap u s and chinese negotiators agreed friday to extend high level trade talks through the weekend and president donald trump said he hoped to meet next month at his florida resort with president xi jinping to try to finalize an agreement the news followed two days of negotiations in washington aimed at resolving a trade war that has rattled financial markets and threatened global economic growth we re making a lot of progress trump told reporters at the white house i think there s a very good chance that a deal can be made treasury secretary steven mnuchin said the negotiations which had been scheduled to conclude friday afternoon would continue through sunday the chinese delegation is led by xi s special envoy vice premier liu he the american team by trade representative robert lighthizer trump had originally warned that he would escalate the tariffs he has imposed on 200 billion in chinese imports from 10 to 25 percent if the two sides failed to reach a deal by march 2 but in recent days and again on friday he raised the possibility of extending that deadline if negotiators were nearing an agreement the world s two biggest economies are sparring over u s allegations that beijing uses predatory tactics in a drive to make chinese companies world leaders in such advanced industries as robotics and driverless cars those tactics the trump administration argues include cyber theft unfair subsidies for state owned chinese companies the use of regulations to hobble china s foreign competitors and pressure on american companies to hand over technology in exchange for access to the chinese market the administration contends that beijing has repeatedly failed to live up to its past commitments to open its markets and to treat foreign companies more fairly the president has imposed 25 percent tariffs on 50 billion in chinese imports and 10 percent tariffs on 200 billion worth the latter grouping would face the 25 percent tariffs too if no agreement is reached beijing has lashed back with import taxes of its own on 110 billion in u s goods these tariffs are heavily aimed at soybeans and other agricultural products in an effort to pressure trump supporters in the u s farm belt on friday the president and his advisers provided few details on this week s negotiations trump did say the two sides had reached some agreement on currency manipulation but offered no specifics the administration has worried that beijing would blunt the impact of trump s sanctions by manipulating its currency down to give chinese companies a competitive edge in international markets trump said both sides want to make this a real deal we want to make it a meaningful deal the president said not a deal that s done and doesn t mean anything we want to make this a deal that s going to last for many many years and a deal that s going to be good for both countries trump raised the possibility that the u s will drop criminal charges against chinese telecommunications giant huawei saying the issue would be discussed with attorney general bill barr and u s attorneys the u s has charged huawei with lying about violating sanctions against iran and with stealing trade secrets asked about huawei before the oval office meeting with liu trump said that a decision on huawei is pending but right now it s not something we re discussing after trump appeared with liu agriculture secretary sonny perdue announced that beijing had agreed to buy 10 million metric tons of american soybeans tweeting hats off to potus for bringing china to the table china s soybean tariffs have squeezed many american farmers in the first 10 months of 2018 u s soybean exports to china dropped to 8 2 million metric tons from 21 4 million metric tons a year earlier a 62 percent freefall according to the agriculture department in front of liu and the press corps trump ridiculed members of his own trade team for using the term memoranda of understanding or mou to describe the agreements they were working out with the chinese you either make a deal or you re not trump said to have these other agreements doesn t mean anything because they re not that meaningful in my opinion lighthizer at first defended the acronym describing mous as binding contracts then made light of the rebuke and vowed never to use the term again the u s china conflict has rattled markets it has also fanned uncertainty among businesses that must decide where to invest and whether trump s tariffs which raise the cost of imports on the target list will last long enough to justify replacing chinese suppliers with those from countries not subject to the tariffs the international monetary fund the world bank and the organization for economic cooperation and development have all downgraded their forecasts for the global economy citing the heightened trade tensions the chinese economy in particular is decelerating the imf expects china to record 6 2 percent growth this year down from 6 6 percent in 2018 the chinese economy is definitely hurting right now said timothy keeler partner at the law firm mayer brown and former chief of staff for the office of the u s trade representative there s a lot of leverage for the u s myron brilliant head of international affairs at the u s chamber of commerce said the two countries have yet to bridge their differences over nettlesome issues such as the forced technology transfer he said the chamber wants to see an end to the tariffs between washington and beijing but he also said american businesses are demanding a deal that would produce lasting improvement in chinese trade practices we simply can t go back to business as it was before brilliant said beijing he said has got to deliver the goods ___ darlene

by tawanda musarurwa banks have commenced trading in foreign currency at a rate of 2 5 to the united states dollar following the decision by the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz to float the currency on wednesday this rate according to observers is likely to bring stability to the market rbz governor dr john mangudya announced the introduction of an inter bank foreign exchange market while delivering his monetary policy statement yesterday the governor told business leaders that the central bank had met with banks and agreed to start at a rate of 2 5 which is lower than the prevailing rate of around 4 on the illegal market this is in line with indications of a managed float whereby banks will operate under some guidelines we came to a conclusion with the bankers last night thursday of 2 5 and we hope thereafter that the rate will continue to find itself said the rbz governor we have also put a number of safeguards to ensure that the exchange rate is going to remain stable and we are quite happy with the austerity measures announced by the ministry of finance because there is no longer too much demand on the fiscus university of zimbabwe economics lecturer and former government economic advisor professor ashok chakravati said the concept of a managed float had been successfully implemented in other countries such as nigeria and was optimistic it would work in zimbabwe too such a managed market has been successfully introduced in west africa nigeria angola and many other countries in africa so when we have such a managed market then we will be able to control the exchange rate prior to the floating of the us dollar the rbz had pegged rtgs balances at 1 1 to the us dollar however shortages had resulted in high premiums for us dollars on the parallel market which led to increases in prices the managed float is therefore expected to result in lowering of prices that had been pegged at over 1 4 with speculators cashing in on foreign currency shortages the inter bank market will work via banks and bureaux de change on a willing buyer willing seller basis according to the rbz the formalisation of foreign currency trading will entail denominating the existing rtgs balances bond notes and coins in circulation as rtgs dollars to establish an exchange between current monetary balances and foreign currency the rbz governor said the bulk of foreign currency will be allocated to the productive sectors of the economy 70 percent of the foreign currency will be utilised for productive sector s imports and requirements while the 30 percent will go to other things you cannot have us 5 million going towards purchasing of a private jet at the expense of companies like delta dairibord and the like he said companies need to boost production because the floating of the us dollar alone will not enhance productivity it is the hope of many industrialists and zimbabweans in general that the managed free float is going to bring sanity in foreign currency exchange the chronicle

warren buffett has long been a booster of american business and in his latest annual letter to berkshire hathaway brk a brk b shareholders published saturday buffett not only touts the united states economic track record but also takes a jab at the doomsayers he s met along the way including a younger version of himself on march 11th it will be 77 years since i first invested in an american business buffett writes the year was 1942 i was 11 and i went all in investing 114 75 i had begun accumulating at age six what i bought was three shares of cities service preferred stock i had become a capitalist and it felt good buffett notes that on that day in 1942 the united states prospects in world war ii appeared challenging but buffett writes that leaving aside congenital pessimists americans believed that their children and generations beyond would live far better lives than they themselves had led the nation expected post war growth a belief that proved to be well founded in fact the nation s achievements can best be described as breathtaking the amount buffett invested in those preferred shares of cities service 114 75 would have grown to 606 811 if invested in a no fee index fund tracking the s p 500 buffett writes a million dollars invested in the same instrument at the time would have grown to 5 3 billion of course there is no way to capture the exact returns of the s p 500 without incurring any costs but the point is well taken investing in common stocks of u s companies has been a good bet over the last 77 years during which american companies have enjoyed these stellar returns a lot has changed about the country and its financial standing the national debt for instance is now more than 22 trillion those worried most acutely about this debt load note that the overhang presents a challenge to future economic growth a financial burden for future generations and risks the status of the dollar as the world s reserve currency gold wouldn t have saved you buffett knows that for many this debt burden makes investing in a hard asset like gold attractive one day the debt must be dealt with and that day will be a painful one for investors the thinking goes advertisement advertisement but to buffett it will be and has been far more painful for investors that try to anticipate that day of reckoning for the u s government while eschewing the american tailwind that has been so kind to him and many other investors those who regularly preach doom because of government budget deficits as i regularly did myself for many years might note that our country s national debt has increased roughly 400 fold during the last of my 77 year periods buffett writes that s 40 000 suppose you had foreseen this increase and panicked at the prospect of runaway deficits and a worthless currency to protect yourself you might have eschewed stocks and opted instead to buy ounces of gold with your 114 75 and what would that supposed protection have delivered you would now have an asset worth about 4 200 less than 1 of what would have been realized from a simple unmanaged investment in american business the magical metal was no match for the american mettle warren buffett chairman and ceo of berkshire hathaway gestures as he plays bridge outside berkshire owned borsheims jewelry store in omaha neb sunday may 6 2018 ap photo nati harnik in the long run buffett notes we re all dead anyway advertisement advertisement and along the way towards that inevitable end there are those who will believe they alone foresee how the collective story concludes perhaps it is with runaway inflation rioting in the streets a collapse of the modern economic system but in this year s shareholder letter as he has in recent editions buffett reminds readers of the financial calamities endured during his own investing career the reminder is not however to heed history s warnings but to recall that all difficult moments of this history eventually become history our country s almost unbelievable prosperity has been gained in a bipartisan manner buffett writes since 1942 we have had seven republican presidents and seven democrats in the years they served the country contended at various times with a long period of viral inflation a 21 prime rate several controversial and costly wars the resignation of a president a pervasive collapse in home values a paralyzing financial panic and a host of other problems all engendered scary headlines all are now history christopher wren architect of st paul s cathedral lies buried within that london church near his tomb are posted these words of description translated from latin if you would seek my monument look around you those skeptical of america s economic playbook should heed his message no one does it alone buffett also reminds readers that the story of america s economic success is a shared one in a country of self made success stories no one truly meets the definition advertisement advertisement charlie and i happily acknowledge that much of berkshire s success has simply been a product of what i think should be called the american tailwind buffett writes it is beyond arrogance for american businesses or individuals to boast that they have done it alone the tidy rows of simple white crosses at normandy should shame those who make such claims there are also many other countries around the world that have bright futures about that we should rejoice americans will be both more prosperous and safer if all nations thrive at berkshire we hope to invest significant sums across borders over the next 77 years however the major source of our gains will almost certainly be provided by the american tailwind we are lucky gloriously lucky to have that force at our back myles udland is a

washington president donald trump said friday that he will probably host chinese president xi jinping next month at his mar a lago estate in florida and expects to finalize a sweeping trade agreement that would end a nearly year long tariff war speaking in the oval office the president said chinese negotiators who had planned to leave washington today had agreed to extend their stay for two additional days an apparent sign of progress if the two sides can t make a deal by march 1 u s tariffs on 200 billion in chinese products are scheduled to jump to 25 percent from 10 percent ultimately i think the biggest decisions and some even smaller decisions will be made by president xi and myself the president told reporters and we expect to have a meeting some point in the not too distant future and i think president xi and i will work out the final points perhaps and perhaps not trump said negotiators this week reached a final agreement to stabilize currency values the first tangible accord with beijing since he began imposing tariffs on chinese imports last year administration officials released no additional details but have been seeking china s agreement to avoid manipulating the value of the yuan to gain a trade advantage advertisement the chinese government intervenes in foreign exchange markets to prevent the yuan from rising or falling in value too rapidly between april and october 2018 the yuan dropped about 9 percent all but offsetting the effect of trump s first round of tariffs some analysts said the currency deal represents no real concession chinese authorities are very reluctant to let the dollar value of one yuan rise above 7 because it encourages chinese citizens to move their money outside the country said robin brooks chief economist for the institute of international finance so this agreement isn t a big win for the u s since china doesn t want a destabilizing yuan devaluation anyway brooks said on twitter the fate of two chinese telecommunications companies that u s officials say pose national security concerns huawei and zte also may be included in the trade discussions trump said adding that he will consult with attorney general william barr before deciding the president and his chief trade negotiator robert lighthizer had a bizarre exchange in front of the press over what to call a china trade deal the white house had announced feb 15 that the two sides were negotiating several memoranda of understanding but after lighthizer gave a lengthy explanation of the term mou saying it was equivalent to a contract trump contradicted his trade chief in front of chinese officials and reporters saying flatly i disagree after a back and forth over what the two sides were negotiating which included the president saying that mous don t mean very much lighthizer conceded we ll never use mou again advertisement the veteran trade negotiator also said that major hurdles remain before a deal can be struck that s just as well say some analysts who fear the president is preparing to settle for minor concessions and chinese promises to buy more american products beijing s perennial strategy for defusing trade complaints if we walk away with just some purchase commitments that means this whole process would have been essentially for nothing we need to get a lot more or this wasn t worth it said scott kennedy a china expert at the center for strategic and international studies on wall street the dow jones industrial average rose more than 180 points as investors anticipated u s and chinese negotiators would head off a planned march 2 tariff increase on 200 billion worth of chinese goods the dow is up nearly 6 percent over the past month a period that coincides with the president s increasingly positive statements about the likelihood of a deal we are encouraged at this point that they re getting closer to getting an agreement said myron brilliant executive vice president and head of international affairs for the u s chamber of commerce who said he has spoken this week with officials from both governments but brilliant said the remaining gaps over issues at the center of the year long trade dispute mean that talks are likely to continue for some time trump has publicly suggested that he may extend his original deadline saying earlier this week there was nothing magical about the march date chinese vice premier liu he who leads beijing s team met this week with lighthizer and his 11 man u s delegation in two days of talks at the eisenhower executive office building the two sides are trying to hammer out six mous that will address u s complaints about china s trade practices including intellectual property protections joint venture technology transfer requirements and non tariff barriers along with specifying a substantial increase in chinese purchases of american products advertisement chinese officials have reportedly offered to buy an additional 30 billion worth of u s agricultural exports each year more than doubling the current 24 billion figure and to buy more american semiconductors the president has said that any deal must include profound structural changes in china s state led economic system we re covering everything all of the points that people have been talking about for years and said couldn t be done he said last week that s a tall order brilliant who visited beijing earlier this week said chinese officials have been slow to recognize the need to offer more than just an increase in their purchases from the united states notable gaps remain over trump s demand for far reaching changes in china s compulsory technology transfer requirements for foreign companies and its subsidies for state owned enterprises structural reform means something different for both governments trump said chinese officials have tried to parry u s demands by repackaging policy changes they already had planned to make and by launching a frontal attack on lighthizer s claims of chinese misdeeds said michael pillsbury a china expert at the hudson institute chinese officials also have drafted a contingency plan to offer additional trade concessions if the threatened tariff increase to 25 percent from 10 percent is implemented he added the two sides also are far apart on provisions for enforcing any agreement an issue that lighthizer has called essential to remaking the u s china relationship u s officials have considered leaving some tariffs in place or reimposing them if china fails to fulfill its promises advertisement chinese officials

warren buffett has long been a booster of american business and in his latest annual letter to berkshire hathaway brk a brk b shareholders published saturday buffett not only touts the united states economic track record but also takes a jab at the doomsayers he s met along the way including a younger version of himself on march 11th it will be 77 years since i first invested in an american business buffett writes the year was 1942 i was 11 and i went all in investing 114 75 i had begun accumulating at age six what i bought was three shares of cities service preferred stock i had become a capitalist and it felt good advertisement advertisement buffett notes that on that day in 1942 the united states prospects in world war ii appeared challenging but buffett writes that leaving aside congenital pessimists americans believed that their children and generations beyond would live far better lives than they themselves had led the nation expected post war growth a belief that proved to be well founded in fact the nation s achievements can best be described as breathtaking the amount buffett invested in those preferred shares of cities service 114 75 would have grown to 606 811 if invested in a no fee index fund tracking the s p 500 buffett writes a million dollars invested in the same instrument at the time would have grown to 5 3 billion of course there is no way to capture the exact returns of the s p 500 without incurring any costs but the point is well taken investing in common stocks of u s companies has been a good bet over the last 77 years during which american companies have enjoyed these stellar returns a lot has changed about the country and its financial standing the national debt for instance is now more than 22 trillion those worried most acutely about this debt load note that the overhang presents a challenge to future economic growth a financial burden for future generations and risks the status of the dollar as the world s reserve currency gold wouldn t have saved you buffett knows that for many this debt burden makes investing in a hard asset like gold attractive one day the debt must be dealt with and that day will be a painful one for investors the thinking goes but to buffett it will be and has been far more painful for investors that try to anticipate that day of reckoning for the u s government while eschewing the american tailwind that has been so kind to him and many other investors those who regularly preach doom because of government budget deficits as i regularly did myself for many years might note that our country s national debt has increased roughly 400 fold during the last of my 77 year periods buffett writes that s 40 000 suppose you had foreseen this increase and panicked at the prospect of runaway deficits and a worthless currency to protect yourself you might have eschewed stocks and opted instead to buy ounces of gold with your 114 75 and what would that supposed protection have delivered you would now have an asset worth about 4 200 less than 1 of what would have been realized from a simple unmanaged investment in american business the magical metal was no match for the american mettle story continues warren buffett chairman and ceo of berkshire hathaway gestures as he plays bridge outside berkshire owned borsheims jewelry store in omaha neb sunday may 6 2018 ap photo nati harnik in the long run buffett notes we re all dead anyway and along the way towards that inevitable end there are those who will believe they alone foresee how the collective story concludes perhaps it is with runaway inflation rioting in the streets a collapse of the modern economic system but in this year s shareholder letter as he has in recent editions buffett reminds readers of the financial calamities endured during his own investing career the reminder is not however to heed history s warnings but to recall that all difficult moments of this history eventually become history our country s almost unbelievable prosperity has been gained in a bipartisan manner buffett writes since 1942 we have had seven republican presidents and seven democrats in the years they served the country contended at various times with a long period of viral inflation a 21 prime rate several controversial and costly wars the resignation of a president a pervasive collapse in home values a paralyzing financial panic and a host of other problems all engendered scary headlines all are now history christopher wren architect of st paul s cathedral lies buried within that london church near his tomb are posted these words of description translated from latin if you would seek my monument look around you those skeptical of america s economic playbook should heed his message no one does it alone buffett also reminds readers that the story of america s economic success is a shared one in a country of self made success stories no one truly meets the definition charlie and i happily acknowledge that much of berkshire s success has simply been a product of what i think should be called the american tailwind buffett writes it is beyond arrogance for american businesses or individuals to boast that they have done it alone the tidy rows of simple white crosses at normandy should shame those who make such claims there are also many other countries around the world that have bright futures about that we should rejoice americans will be both more prosperous and safer if all nations thrive at berkshire we hope to invest significant sums across borders over the next 77 years however the major source of our gains will almost certainly be provided by the american tailwind we are lucky gloriously lucky to have that force at our back myles udland is a reporter and anchor at yahoo finance follow him on

should the direction of dallas urban growth continue to grow north does inserting low income housing in north dallas create an inclusive urban growth direction for dallas does the direction of dallas and its current goal of moving low income wage earners closer to higher wage jobs in north dallas increase or decrease wealth for low income families the smu george w bush institute conference policies to promote inclusive urban growth was a meaningful conference on the direction of dallas and cities and gave clues to all these questions the information and insights provided built on and went beyond the new cities conference held a few years ago in dallas the festival of ideas conference in dallas and the 2 0 cities section of talks at the main ted conference cullum clark director of the bush institute smu economic growth initiative and adjunct professor of economics along with joel kotkin executive director center for opportunity urbanism and joseph cahoon professor director of folsom institute of real estate did a remarkable job of curating the speakers and participants along with presenting a preview and summary of the key points of the discussion regarding urban growth and the direction of dallas i have always thought that the success of dallas came from the city pursuing best policies for growth rather than replicating other cities best practices for bad policy this conference reconfirmed this thought here are some of the ideas that resonated with me provoked questions or validated my previous ideas about the direction of dallas and how best to achieve inclusive urban growth middle income neighborhoods are fragile and should be the highest priority i have been very aware that all city neighborhoods are fragile this conference made me even more acutely aware of the fragility of middle income neighborhoods having been raised in hinsdale a village west of chicago the first session featuring chicago was of particular interest to me and a good starting point for discussion of cities and the direction of dallas from 1990 to 2010 the number of low income neighborhoods in chicago rapidly expanded high income neighborhoods expanded and stayed strong and middle income neighborhoods almost disappeared an economic neighborhood map of chicago was the perfect way to begin the conference it was the foundation of a subtle theme expressed throughout the day middle income neighborhoods are the most fragile the most difficult to create and the most important to a city it is the middle class neighborhoods that are the lobby for schools parks services and amenities areas often ignored by those in the poor and rich neighborhoods middle income neighborhoods are made up of people that make a city run shopkeepers small business owners tradespeople school teachers firemen and police it is interesting that chicago is third in the nation behind new york and seattle for its number of construction cranes but in my mind still a failing city gentrification i think the most misunderstood urban concept is gentrification when i was initiating revitalization of a very distressed dallas inner city neighborhood the chairman of the smu real estate department periodically had graduate students call me as they were working on a paper or a thesis about gentrification in dallas they were wanting to identify and interview tenants who were displaced i offered each graduate student that called 100 if they could find a single displaced tenant in old east dallas the neighborhood in which i was working i never had to pay 100 because they were unable to find one weekly tenants paying 20 per week rent with no deposit and staying an average of two or three weeks with not paying their rent before they moved on to any number of vacancies on the same block or the same neighborhood was an economic and transient environment that did not cause displacement over forty years later there are still some low income vacant apartments further within a six block area there is economic diversity of single family homes including those over 2 million on swiss avenue and under 200 000 in mount auburn there is also a wide variety of small apartment units duplexes and fourplex apartment units in the same neighborhood many speakers throughout the conference had many different opinions on gentrification but they all agreed it was misunderstood as a concept and in some cases did not even exist as reported a speaker stated about one city low income persons were pushed in and pushed out it was also pointed out that in one city 100 000 low income people were added to the city while only 60 000 high income people were added to the city the gentrification voices had been able to keep the conversation solely on the 60 000 high income people added to the city not the greater 100 000 of low income people that had been added to the city vicki been professor and former new york city housing commissioner mentioned that 100 neighborhoods in new york had a 10 increase in low income residents and only 60 neighborhoods had an increase in high income residents detroit and san francisco have opposite problems san francisco has a dearth of low income housing and detroit has an overabundance of low income housing the myth of gentrification and emotional appeal of showing concern and discussing gentrification can be seen in comments made by developer jack matthews someone whose preservation and revitalization work i admire greatly he knows as much about land acquisition appreciating land prices and city subsidies as anyone in dallas still he described a heartbreaking story of potential gentrification if an affordable housing developer bought 50 lots around a 10 000 home owned by a little old lady he said if once he started building 50 000 homes on these 50 lots her land value might go up 100 000 to 150 000 over ten years but she would be forced out in two years because of higher taxes and not realize this profit on her land because her taxes would go up so much in two years she would not be able to keep her house 10 years this is a sad story but not true direction of dallas determines wealth creation for low income families my experience is that the dallas central appraisal district keeps very close tabs on the increase and value of 10 million homes but is not near as interested in constantly reappraising 10 000 homes or lots the dallas county appraisal district usually only reevaluates an entire neighborhood every three years or so this in itself would mean there would be no tax increases for three or four years further if the developer is buying 50 houses and lots in the neighborhood of this little old lady presumably he would be buying the property at the same price as her 10 000 house in the event the appraisal district reappraised the properties in the entire neighborhood before three years they would find 50 comparable sales of 10 000 further submitting the value of her home at 10 000 even with new 50 000 homes built around her the appraisal district cannot compare new 50 000 homes to a 10 000 old house and land if however in two years prices of land soared the state law could not allow more than 10 increases annually in taxes or a 30 increase over three years in the third or fourth year after the developer started building houses if the little old lady s lot was appraised for a much higher price the most she could pay that year would be tax on a 1 000 increase in property value her increase in taxes for the year would be 30 however since she has a senior citizen exemption she is only required to pay half of those taxes or 15 per year obviously the little old lady will not have to move out in two years when the taxes have not gone up or in three to four years when she is required to only pay an extra 15 if her property went up as jack matthews hypothesized to 100 150 000 her average annual tax increase over 10 years would be less than 50 per year hardly enough to make her move on the other hand in 10 years she would have 100 000 150 000 equity in her house her return on 10 years of slightly increased taxes would be 10 000 20 000 all middle income and even many high income property owners are burdened by added taxes when their property appreciates in value however a low income person benefits the most by rapid appreciation we should be rooting for the prices of properties to go up for low income homeowners because it creates wealth for them too many policy makers and politicians want property values in low income neighborhoods to stagnate so low income people will remain in these low income neighborhoods projecting potential gentrification horror stories about higher taxes forcing little old ladies out of their homes if new housing is built in their deteriorating neighborhoods discourages politicians to promote or builders to build new homes in deteriorated neighborhoods sad stories like this make decision makers even more reluctant to create new middle income neighborhoods in dallas that is good for dallas and creates real wealth for low income wage earners density every session had thought provoking comments and ideas about density including the following cities cannot densify their way out of problems and california has become a renter society one landlord in california does not rent rooms he rents a fleet of 1 000 minivans with mattresses in the back at 400 month this reminds me that architect and city councilperson pedro aguirre was onto something when he wrote in the 1973 dallas housing report that dallas needed to lower building codes for low income housing he gave as an example the simple metal structures found in mexico that were better for people than living under bridges politicians squeamishness about 400 month 1 200 square foot single family homes with dirty carpet and rotted boards were still probably better housing for a family than a minivan with a mattress many speakers said that adding density itself does not solve urban problems adding crappy density just makes dense crap speakers suggested that added density needs to be accompanied with green space and other amenities that offset the debilitating effect that density generally adds to a neighborhood while not mentioned at the conference the most important thing to remember about density is that both renters and homeowners would rather live next to a single family home than another apartment cities are fragile san francisco is choking from a concentration of wealth and homelessness detroit is gasping from once being a city of two million people to becoming a city of 800 000 people detroit is my favorite example of the fragility of cities it is also the city i compared dallas to in my 1976 thesis on the economic incentives to reverse migration and the inner city neighborhood in the 1950s and 1960s detroit was the strongest city in the nation it had music industry banking and philanthropy then from 1968 to 1974 detroit was in such a decline that the city fathers hired an urban economist to propose a way not to revitalize the city but just to stem the decline during this period detroit had the highest safety net of social benefits and the highest unemployment rates while dallas had the lowest social safety net benefits and the lowest unemployment over the next 40 years detroit continued to plummet while dallas soared rental society the popular avant garde thought is that millennials the next generation love living in apartments and in dense cities not single family neighborhoods single family zoned neighborhoods are so out of political and urban planning fashion that they are beginning to be outlawed in cities such as portland and minneapolis even dallas with no neighborhood hearings or notices blanket zoned every single family neighborhood in dallas with adu backyard rental house zoning joel kotkin led the thought that was mentioned by several others that millennials are about to grow up have families and seek homes that come with a yard the growth in the population of the economic elite and hipsters moving to the city is in decline renters don t accumulate wealth renters are transient and don t contribute to the stability or long term sociability of a neighborhood the more low income renters are pushed to high income neighborhoods the further they are moved away from the potential wealth creation of owning a home it is interesting that there is so much preoccupation with gentrification and the resulting displacement of people from their longtime neighborhoods at the same time the anti gentrification voices advocate a rental society of moving low income residents across town to high income neighborhoods which removes people from their long term neighborhoods and a rental society is based on the very notion of transience rather than stable long term neighborhoods parking requirements twenty seven years ago i wrote an op ed post in the dallas morning news that called for parking requirements in downtown dallas to be eliminated i argued that a developer spending 20 million on a building had a better idea of what parking requirements their building needed rather than a 40 000 per year planner i also suggested that the mom and pop owner of a dry cleaner who had seven parking spaces that were mostly empty were unable to expand their business because of a city requirement of additional parking spaces inhibited the vitality and the economic growth of a city one was able to see how sacrosanct parking requirements in dallas and across the country were by the letter to the editor that the dallas city planning director wrote to the dallas morning news her written response to my op ed was so vicious that the city manager at the time john ware required her to send me an apology how things have changed it was music to my ears to hear the santa monica mayor rick cole explained that there are seven parking spaces for every car in santa monica so they recently eliminated all parking requirements in downtown santa monica he used the same argument that owners have a better idea of their parking needs than do planners eliminating parking requirements would positively impact the direction of dallas and its efficient growth wealth versus income dedrick asante muhammad chief of equity and inclusion national community reinvestment coalition provided an important economic insight everyone is focused on income inequality and that blacks make only 65 cents on the dollar of what whites earn however the much more disturbing statistic is that the average white family has an average wealth of 110 000 while the average wealth for black families is 4 000 creating wealth for minorities and low income persons should be one of the highest priorities of a city however almost every current urban policy curtails and diminishes the possibility of wealth creation for minorities and low income families moving low income families to high income areas in order them to be close to jobs and higher wages requires they become renters this is a wealth killer density is created by apartments that by definition create transience transience is also a wealth killer the cost of a move from one apartment to another apartment costs more than the total wealth of most of these minority renters escalating rent throughout a lifetime is also a wealth killer urban planners advocating density and apartments in high income areas are imprisoning low income families in a no wealth state of poverty regardless of their income prissy standards for affordable housing politicians planners and policy experts predictably call for better housing conditions for low income persons the mantra is they should have at least minimum housing standards the problem is minimum housing standards have been set for middle income and rich families i think of the artists academics and young professionals who in past decades purchased and moved into substandard falling down houses and on weekends cleaned them up and fixed them up many low or middle income families would prefer a comfortable apartment over a deteriorated house the deteriorated house however provides an opportunity for wealth creation and neighborhood creation the more low income people can buy homes in any condition the better their economic prospects become and the better the prospects for the neighborhood become income groups are becoming further segregated klaus desmet of smu mentioned that income groups in dallas are growing further apart to the north and to the south the current vision is to move low income families to high income neighborhoods rather than as cullum clark suggested in his remarks that jobs should be created in low income areas urban restrictions for centuries urban growth restrictions and policies have been either in favor of more density and less sprawl or less density which has prompted people to move further away from the city center highly restrictive and regulated cities are seeing neighboring cities and towns with explode with growth planners often propose regulations and politicians pass laws because they sound good without considering any of the obvious consequences adus backyard rental houses there were only passing references to adus and how they that might be part of the solution to inclusive urban growth it is my opinion that adus disrupt the very neighborhoods that should be coddled there are dozens of reasons why adus are harmful to neighborhoods they are also unnecessary when additional apartments and dwelling units can be placed nearby or in areas in need of redevelopment urban hippocratic oath do no harm to urban neighborhoods this urban hippocratic oath should be the foundation of any urban policy while no one from the main stage of the conference mentioned this urban hippocratic oath many said that beautiful neighborhoods and middle income neighborhoods should be protected to give continuity for the future making existing neighborhoods and their success a priority should be a central theme for the future direction of dallas affordable housing subsidies one of the most interesting points made was that developers need to intentionally add human dignity to their low income housing projects a beautiful playground at the front of an affordable housing project saves the school child embarrassment when the school bus drops them off because their classmates think they live in a cool place visible amenities and green spaces also make the project more palatable and beneficial to the neighborhood affordable housing developers all agreed that it was very hard to double up on local state and federal subsidy programs the red tape on acquiring multiple government subsidies usually exceeds the economic time limit for a project an interesting point was made about urban opportunity zones that provide incentives to developers to build in these zones if a developer receives a 10 000 project subsidy the sellers of the land quickly recognize this and raise the price of their land 10 000 this leads me to believe that opportunity zones should be large enough that the owners still feel like there is a lottery effect and they cannot immediately raise their prices by the cost of the subsidy the conference also included discussion on how much money from the government was going into the pockets of developers to create affordable housing or other projects desired by the city dallas is fortunate to have quality well intended developers receiving city money however this topic reminds me that most of the public corruption in dallas has centered around housing subsidies for developers i recall in the 1980s a key city planner was privately steering zoning in deep ellum to benefit one developer in deep ellum to the detriment of several hundred other deep ellum owners the city planner right after the zoning passed was hired by the developer within a year the court by summary judgment overturned the zoning dallas passed an ethics law and the developer was investigated and eventually went to jail for falsely receiving government housing subsidies i continue to think there are many ways to provide or encourage affordable housing beyond what is built by developers who receive money from the government this flow of money from the government to developers that has caused dallas public officials and housing developers to continue to go to jail since the 1980s the higher the price of the neighborhood where low income housing is built the more government money has to flow to developers projects outside of government subsidized housing also has the benefit of possibly being more interesting and less disruptive one of the affordable housing developers at the conference encouraged an architect who was in the audience to design and build interesting one off affordable homes this was a comment and idea i very much appreciated alternatives to government paying developers the government will always be paying developers to build low income housing however there are alternative ways to provide low income housing for decades in dallas there has been an abundance of very inexpensive homes many of these homes were inherited from family members and then torn down because they were in bad shape and there was not a marketplace to match up these homes with potential buyers over 20 years ago i wrote an op ed published in the dallas morning news that suggested the creation of a database of every home valued under 10 000 owned by an absentee owner in today s economy now the price of these tracked homes might need to be adjusted to homes valued under 50 000 nonprofits and churches could create a list of potential homeowners who live in the zip codes of these inexpensive homes and help match up these potential homeowners with these inexpensive homes professionals like accountants attorneys and real estate agents that help build habitat for humanity houses might help identify and coordinate owner financing from some of these absentee owners who own these inexpensive homes the churches and nonprofits might also help the home buyers fix up the home i have seen firsthand the positive result of a church coordinating owner financing on a 10 000 home 50 years ago my next door neighbor purchased such a home continues to live in the home and has subsequently had four generations of children also periodically live in the home that is surrounded by renovated homes in a historic district building one off affordable homes is another approach dallas has many people interested in affordable housing and investing in dallas here are some exciting possibilities of how this could be accomplished 1 architects either by themselves or teaming up with a friend design build and invest in a single affordable home or duplex for low income families while interesting architecture for an affordable home might not be practical for an affordable housing development company it could be a great project for an individual and make a great impact on the aesthetics of the neighborhood besides individuals making a philanthropic contribution because dallas is an economically vibrant city it could possibly even be a good economic investment 2 individual investors not reporting to shareholders could renovate a home or two or adapt a small commercial building for affordable homes this one off building of affordable homes would also provide low income families and the individual investors with personal interaction that would be mutually beneficial banks as pegasus bank in dallas has done might invest in an affordable home to fix up and rent out to a family or invest in small apartments and specifically rent to low income working families 3 for decades there have been small clubs or groups of friends investing in stocks why not have affordable home clubs small investments from club members could be pooled to buy and fix up a single family home to rent or sell specifically to a low income family 4 high end homebuilders might hire the architect of their expensive spec homes to design a small affordable home that the homebuilder rents out or sells to a low income family the city rather than subsidizing developers would invest in specific neighborhoods where these one off projects might thrive new curbs sidewalks streets streetlights and mowing overgrown vacant lots could create a pleasant environment for both low income families and middle income families and be a place where people would like to invest in or donate to affordable homes the dallas advantage dallas has a great advantage over any other city because it is economically thriving and it has an abundance of cheap underused land currently city politicians and city planners are looking to throw away that advantage and direct affordable housing to the most expensive land and neighborhoods inspired idea i have been involved in successfully revitalizing a neighborhood as a result i understand the steps and dynamics needed for revitalization efforts to be a success most of these initiatives can be easily replicated in southern dallas however i remain puzzled by neighborhoods that are made up of mostly vacant land or have housing without much potential emotional or aesthetic appeal recently the solution came to me when i read about cities like minneapolis and portland that are beginning to do away with single family zoning when dallas joined this anti single family zoning hysteria by blanket zoning the entire city for backyard rental houses deliberately diluting single family neighborhoods the solution came to me for these architecturally uninteresting neighborhoods in south dallas the solution is for some of the distressed neighborhoods in southern dallas to offer precisely what is being banished in the other neighborhoods across the city protected single family neighborhoods specified southern dallas neighborhoods could be a safe haven for single family homes the property owners in these neighborhoods could place 50 year deed restrictions on a critical mass of contiguous land that restricts the lots to strictly single family homes even if the city changed the zoning from single family the deed restrictions would let the homeowners and future homeowners know their single family neighborhood would always be protected from multi family intrusions rather than these neighborhoods being perceived as distressed they would be the beacon for long term stability and the security of protected neighborhoods these once distressed areas might become some of the most desirable places in dallas people moving into dallas from high density cities would find these neighborhoods with single family homes and yards charming quiet and relaxed for their families we need to remember renters and homeowners both prefer to live next door to a single family home rather than a multi family apartment the city could also support the effort of single family deed restricted neighborhoods by providing new sidewalks curbs and streetlights conclusion dallas has outperformed other cities because it did not copy best practices of bad policies dallas should continue to create the best policies that allow the city to thrive with inclusive

yen and dollar closed the week generally lower on strong risk appetite there was some sort of optimism over us china trade negotiations throughout the week and that helped dow and china sse extend recent rally dow closed above 26000 for the first time since november sse also closed above 2800 for the first time since september too the talks extend into the weekend and we might see some more market volatility after the meetings conclude australian dollar and new zealand dollar were the weakest ones even with such positive risk sentiments that highlights the problems the aussie and kiwi are facing china denied reported that the dalian port banned australian coal import and helped aussie pared some losses towards the end of the week but in the background westpac now forecasts rba to cut interest rates two this year in august and november rbnz proposed raising capital requirements for top banks it s an act that might eventually tighten up financial conditions and force rbnz to cut interest rates again on the other hand sterling was the strongest one as traders saw risk of no deal brexit fading canadian dollar followed oil prices higher trump hopes to seal trade agreements in not too distant future us china trade talks appeared to have made some important progress and are extended by two days through sunday in washington in the oval office while meeting chinese vice premier liu he trump said we both feel there s a very good chance a deal will happen he added that both parties want to make this a real deal and we want to make this a deal that s going to last for many many years and a deal that s going to be good for both countries the final deal would be signed off at a summit with chinese president xi jinping and trump said he hoped to meet with in the not too distant future the current march 1 trade truce deadline could be extended by another month meanwhile the final agreement might extend beyond trade to encompass chinese telecommunications companies huawei technologies and zte corp treasury secretary steven mnuchin said the summit is tentatively scheduled for late march at the mar a lago resort in florida chinese vice premiere also said at the white house that there had been great progress and from china we believe that it is very likely that it will happen and we hope that ultimately we ll have a deal and the chinese side is ready to make our utmost effort later in a statement published by xinhua liu said the two countries have conducted fruitful negotiations and made positive progress in areas including the trade balance agriculture technology transfer intellectual property protection and financial services both teams are now working on trade agreements directly rather than memorandum of understandings as trump dislikes mous the original idea was to have six mous covering cyber theft intellectual property rights services agriculture and non tariff barriers to trade including subsidies it s uncertain what the new structures of the agreement would be mnuchin also said both sides have made an agreement on currency without details dow entered into sell zone dow s strong rebound from 21712 53 extended last week to closed at 26031 81 above 26k handle for the first time since last november dow is now in sell zone above 78 6 retracement of 26951 81 to 21712 53 at 25830 6041 while further rise could still be seen dow should start to lose upside momentum on overbought condition as seen in daily rsi we don t expect a break of 26951 81 to resume larger up trend meanwhile break of last week s low at 25762 21 should at least trigger pull back to 55 day ema now at 24872 94 china sse extended corrective rebound china shanghai sse also extended the rise from 2440 90 to close strongly at 2804 22 currently we re viewing price actions from 2449 91 as a corrective pattern with rise from 2440 90 as the third leg thus we d expect strong resistance between 55 week ema now at 2819 27 and 38 2 retracement of 3587 03 to 1449 19 at 2883 84 to limit upside t break of last week s low at 2699 81 should at least bring pull back to 55 day ema now at 2630 27 sterling strongest as on bet on no hard brexit sterling was the strongest one last week as traders add their bets that no deal brexit could eventually avoided it s still uncertain whether uk attorney general geoffrey cox could work out something with the eu to legally assure that irish backstop would be temporary if triggered if he can deliver something in the early part of this week a revised brexit deal would be put for another vote in the commons on february 27 with cox s endorsement it s possible for prime minister theresa may to get enough support uk would then enter the final stage to prepare for an orderly brexit if may couldn t get anything new for another meaningful vote in the commons the parliament would then vote for amendments to take over control of brexit in that case it s very likely the the parliament would then seek article 50 extension or even change strategy with a brexit delay it would be finally be a time for uk lawmakers that they can vote in majority for something instead of just against something canadian dollar followed oil price higher canadian dollar was the second strongest one as oil prices extends recent strong rally the strength was attributed to opec production cut as well as trade optimism but it s partly offset by surging us production wti crude oil extended the medium term rise from 42 05 to close at 27 20 above 57 level for the first time since november further rise is still expected for the near term but still from 42 05 is seen as a corrective move hence strong resistance will likely be seen around 61 8 projection of 42 05 to 55 85 from 51 49 at 60 01 to limit upside that is is actually close to 50 retracement of 77 06 to 42 05 at 59 55 55 week ema now at 59 60 is also in proximity position trading we re holding on to aud jpy short entered at 78 40 stop at 79 84 and target at 61 8 retracement of 70 27 to 79 84 at 73 92 the rebound from 77 44 extended to as high as 79 81 it s way stronger than expected but we narrowly escaped being stopped out fundamentally we d like to reiterate that aussie s failure to ride on stock rally last week said something about it s underlying weakness upcoming data might start to affirm the case of rba rate cut and stocks could start to reverse once the trade optimism becomes reality technically the rebound from 77 44 to 79 81 is seen as a three wave correction fall from 79 81 is a impulsive move and recovery from 78 33 looks corrective the cross also struggled to sustain above 55 day ema we d expect current recovery to be limited well below 79 81 to bring another decline at least for a test on 77 44 support break there will confirm that rebound from 70 27 has completed so we d hold on to the short position with stop and target unchanged we tentatively look at lowing the stop of break of 78 33 support usd cad weekly outlook despite some brief recovery usd cad s decline from 1 3340 extended to as low as 1 3133 last week initial bias is back on the downside for 1 3068 key support decisive break there will firstly resume whole fall from 1 3664 secondly it will be a strong sign of medium term bearish reversal on the upside above 1 3242 minor resistance will turn bias back to the upside for 1 3340 resistance instead in the bigger picture structure of the medium term rise from 1 2061 2017 low to 1 3664 is not clearly impulsive hence we d stay cautious on strong resistance from 61 8 retracement of 1 4689 2016 high to 1 2061 at 1 3685 and 1 3793 resistance to limit upside and bring medium term topping but in any case medium term outlook will stay bullish as long as channel support now at 1 3099 holds sustained break of 1 3793 will pave the way to retest 1 4689 2015 high firm break of the channel support should confirm reversal target 1 2061 low again in the longer term picture corrective fall from 1 4689 2015 high should have completed with three waves down to 1 2061 just ahead of 50 retracement of 0 9406 2011 low to 1 4689 2015 high at 1 2048 the development keeps long term up trend from 0 9406 and that from 0 9056 2007 low intact for now there is still prospect of extending the long term up trend through 1 4689

by jeff mason and david lawder washington reuters president donald trump said on friday there was a very good chance the united states would strike a deal with china to end their trade war and that he was inclined to extend his march 1 tariff deadline and meet soon with chinese president xi jinping u s and chinese negotiators had made progress and will extend this week s round of negotiations by two days through sunday trump told reporters at the white house as he met with his top negotiators and their counterpart chinese vice premier liu he i think that we both feel there s a very good chance a deal will happen trump said liu agreed there had been great progress from china we believe that it is very likely that it will happen and we hope that ultimately we ll have a deal and the chinese side is ready to make our utmost effort he said at the white house the republican president said he probably would meet with xi in march in florida to decide on the most important terms of a trade deal extending the deadline would put on hold trump s threatened tariff increase to 25 percent from 10 percent on 200 billion of chinese imports into the united states that would prevent a further escalation in a trade war that already has disrupted commerce in goods worth hundreds of billions of dollars slowed global economic growth and roiled markets optimism that the two sides will find a way to end the trade war lifted stocks especially technology shares the stock index reached its highest closing level since nov 8 oil prices rose to their highest since mid november with reaching a high of 67 73 a barrel currency agreement trump and treasury secretary steven mnuchin said the two sides had reached an agreement on currency trump declined to provide details but u s officials long have expressed concerns that china s yuan is undervalued giving china a trade advantage and partly offsetting u s tariffs announcement of a pact aimed at limiting yuan depreciation was putting the currency cart before the trade horse but would likely be positive for asian emerging market currencies said alan ruskin global head of currency strategy at deutsche bank de in new york how can you agree to avoid excessive depreciation or volatility if you have not made an agreement on trade that could have huge fx implications ruskin asked in a note to clients in a letter to trump read aloud by an aide to liu at the white house xi called on negotiators to work hard to strike a deal that benefits both country trump said a deal with china may extend beyond trade to encompass chinese

appeared at odds with his top negotiator u s trade representative robert lighthizer on the preliminary terms that his team is outlining in memorandums of understanding for a deal with china trump said he did not like mous because they are short term and he wanted a long term deal i don t like mous because they don t mean anything trump said either you are going to make a deal or you re not lighthizer responded testily that mous were binding but that he would never use the term again reuters reported exclusively on wednesday that the two sides were drafting the language for six mous covering the most difficult issues in the trade talks that would require structural economic change in china negotiators have struggled this week to agree on specific language within those memorandums to address tough u s demands according to sources familiar with the talks the six memorandums include cyber theft intellectual property rights services agriculture and non tariff barriers to trade including subsidies an industry source briefed on the talks said both sides have narrowed differences on intellectual property rights market access and narrowing a nearly 400 billion u s trade deficit with china but bigger differences remain on changes to china s treatment of state owned enterprises subsidies forced technology transfers and cyber theft of u s trade secrets lighthizer pushed back when questioned on forced technology transfers saying the two sides made a lot of progress on the issue but did not elaborate the united states has said foreign firms in china are often coerced to transfer their technology to chinese firms if they want to operate there china denies this the u s chamber of commerce on friday urged the u s government to ensure the deal was comprehensive and addressed core issues rather than one based on more chinese short term purchases of goods china has pledged to increase purchases of agricultural produce energy semiconductors and industrial goods to reduce its trade surplus with the united states china committed to buying an additional 10 million tonnes of u s soybeans on friday u s agriculture secretary sonny perdue said on twitter china bought about 32 million tonnes of u s soybeans in 2017 the commitments are a show of good faith by the chinese and indications of more good news to come perdue wrote china was the top buyer of u s soybeans before the trade war but beijing s retaliatory tariffs on u s soybeans slashed business that had been worth 12 billion annually
global look press roman camacho you will never have a safety pin when you need one and you will have thousands when you don t need one wild animals are breathtakingly majestic until they re crawling up your pant leg a us presidential administration will never admit that it invaded another country or backed a coup attempt in order to essentially steal the natural resources oil of said country 1 being socialist 2 dropping the us dollar 3 having oil or other natural resources the us needs juan guaidó is the product of a decade long project overseen by washington s elite regime change trainers while posing as a champion of democracy he has spent years at the forefront of a violent campaign of destabilization according to a study conducted in early january 2019 86 percent of venezuelans would disagree with international military intervention grayzone s ben norton reported last month and 81 percent oppose the us sanctions that have gravely hurt the nation s economy lee camp is an american stand up comedian writer actor and activist dubbed by salon as the john oliver of russia today camp is the host of rt america s first comedy news show redacted tonight which tackles the news

clarity and neither sophisticated nor intelligent lee s stand up comedy has also been featured on comedy central abc s good morning america showtime s the green room with paul provenza al jazeera bbc s newsnight e mtv and spike tv socialism ditching the dollar and having natural resources are the three crimes that usually provoke the us into overthrowing a foreign government and these are the reasons it s backing the coup in venezuela there are three things i know for sure in this fanciful sometimes inglorious experience we call life this is why it was so very shocking last week when members of the trump administration admitted they were backing a coup attempt in order to essentially steal the natural resources oil of another country that country is venezuela i ll get back to this in a moment let s take a second to go over the big three if your country has one of these things the us might screw with you if your country has two of these things the us will definitely screw with you if your country has three of these things then look behind you because the us is currently screwing you pretty self explanatory if you don t have the same economic system as we do we treat it like you have candy and we re not allowed to have any so we slip razor blades in yours and tell everyone your candy kills people iraq dropped the dollar we invaded syria dropped the dollar we invaded iran dropped the dollar we want to invade libya planned to drop the dollar we invaded pakistan dropped the dollar in trade with china and the us added them to the list of countries violating religious freedom i guess you could argue they did indeed violate our religion the dollar in case you were curious venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the known world but we haven t checked northern wyoming yet because it s a long cold drive with nary a 7 11 so these are the three actual reasons the us has created an attempted coup in venezuela over the past several weeks and right now you are falling into one of two categories either you re saying to yourself of course those are the reasons those are the only reasons the us ever tries to bring down governments or you still have some strange deep rooted faith in our pepsi and pharmaceutical owned media outlets and therefore you re thinking that s not true the us supports the opposition in venezuela because we want to help those poor starving people these outlets froth at the mouth while presenting segments explaining that the venezuelan people are starving but they also purposefully avoid mentioning that a lot of venezuela s hardships are due to us sanctions but that s what our sanctions are designed to do l over a year ago when rex tillerson was secretary of state he publicly said we could tell our sanctions on north korea were working great because poor fishermen were washing up on the beaches starved to death one is perplexed by how difficult it is at times to tell the difference between helping other countries and mass murder furthermore the us humanitarian aid that we claim to be sending is not what it seems and mcclatchy last week uncovered that the north carolina based private freight company 21 air llc has made 40 secretive flights to venezuela from the us in the past month and apparently we thought the venezuelans were going to cook up a fresh pot of bullet stew to ease their hunger pains to make matters worse two executives at the company have ties to an air cargo company that helped the cia rendition supposed terrorists to black sites for interrogation read torture the next piece of propaganda lovingly pedestalled by our mainstream media robot heads is simply calling juan guaidó the interim president without mentioning that he was not elected to that position and only 30 out of 200 nations recognize him as such he just declared himself president last i checked that s not really how governments work but if it is ok i hereby declare myself governor of let s say idaho no one will really notice i m pretty sure the current governor is a hedgehog in a bow tie on top of that guaidó went to george washington university as the grayzone project reported he moved to washington d c to enroll in the governance and political management program at george washington under the tutelage of venezuelan economist luis enrique berrizbeitia one of the top latin american neoliberal economists berrizbeitia is a former executive director of the international monetary fund guaidó went to gw trained under mr imf and then we declared him president of venezuela that s like studying at the wwe training under henry kissinger and then the us declares you the king of japan but it doesn t stop there according to the grayzone project furthermore juan guaidó has already said he wants to sell venezuela s oil to foreign companies and let the imf back in which will drown the country in debt but if this is what the venezuelan people really want then we should respect their wishes the corporate media tells us this is what the people want right except that it s not so based on the hinterlaces poll most venezuelans didn t know guaidó until recently most venezuelans still support maduro even if they believe corruption in the government has increased whether you personally like maduro or not doesn t matter and most venezuelans don t want military intervention or us sanctions yetbut maybe i m wrong maybe those people really need our help and us intervention will work out great exactly like it did in syria and yemen and iraq and iran and afghanistan and chile and honduras and haiti and somalia and libya and guatemala and nicaragua and colombia and panama and fraggle rock and those tree forts where the ewoks lived now that we have a general understanding of the situation and why anderson cooper is not keen to remind viewers what happened with fraggle rock in the early 90s let s get back to the question of oil when i first started writing this i didn t have proof the american government wanted venezuela s oil it was just a hunch kinda like if you put a balloon in a room with a porcupine you have a hunch he ll pop the balloon but i didn t have a quote from a top trump administration official saying we d like to take their oil il for 20 years we ve been trying to destroy venezuela and our government always gives the standard line we want to help the people we care about their democracy they have a lot of inflation and that s why we need to drop our freedom bombs on their heads they ve trotted out that bulls brigade under bush obama and now trump the officials never just say yeah there s like tons of oil there and we want it yet here it is the disguise of neoliberal world domination has come off ironically the fake mustache was yanked off to reveal a much larger mustache also it s amazing how monotone and matter of fact bolton is as he speaks it s truly heartbreaking no matter which side you support hmmm possible death of a hundred thousand people that sounds good i ll have that this is all the more horrifying because these policies are decided by unelected maniacs like elliot abrams mike pompeo and john bolton trump just named abrams special envoy to venezuela despite the fact the guy has a resume that would make josef mengele blush worse yet even the wall street journal stated the us push to oust maduro is just the first shot in the oligarchy s plan to reshape latin america the venezuelan people deserve self determination no matter how you feel about the current government the absolute last thing they need is to be turned into a neocon neoliberal parking lot in which america rips all their resources out from under them while calling it freedom luckily there are already many signs this us created attempted coup is failing
tawanda musarurwa senior business reporter the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz will continue to help pension companies preserve the value of their funds in united states dollars the bank s governor dr john mangudya said on friday as at june 30 last year the pension industry had six life offices insuring 860 pension funds there have been growing concerns that pension savings would be eroded after central bank liberalised the exchange rate by introducing the inter bank market last week it is believed that removing the 1 1 peg of the us dollar to bond notes and rtgs would devalue some assets but the rbz has since moved in to ring fence pension values we have assisted some of the pension firms in this country to purchase what we call deposit receipts in foreign currency so as to preserve the value for their funds for the pensioners and that is at our expense not their expense said dr mangudya at a breakfast meeting on friday the issue of maintaining the value of pension funds is particularly relevant especially after concerns were raised on how pension companies converted pension benefits from the zimbabwe dollar to the united states dollar following the dollarisation of the economy in early 2009 numerous pensioners found their contributions eroded overnight as pension companies claimed that savings had been wiped out by hyperinflation in his contribution at friday s meeting economist dr gift mugano noted that floating the us dollar would have adverse effects on savings it is undeniable that the floating of the exchange rate will result in erosion of savings and pensions of the ordinary zimbabweans consider one who deposited 100 000 us dollars eight years ago and now bring in the hypothetical liberalised exchange of 1 4 into account one will see that the real value of the 100 000 today is now us 25 000 the same observation applies to pensioners this was again one of my reservations on floating this experience where economic agents have lost their pension twice in a 10 year period will discourage savings which are key for driving investment and economic growth said dr mugano while pensioners are being paid pittances pension companies seem to be in good health according to an insurance and pensions commission ipec second quarter report for last year the pension industry had an asset base of 4 4 billion as at 30 june 2018 reflecting a 5 3 percent increase from the 4 2 billion reported as at 31 march 2018 the growth in the asset base was mainly a result of an increase in the value of quoted equities from 1 4 billion as at 31 march 20 18 to 1 6 billion as at 30 june 2018 noted ipec the total assets translated to an industry average capital accumulation per member of 7 487 as at 30 june 2018 the average capital accumulation per member was 5 7 percent higher than the 7 081 per member reported as at 31 march 2018 the increase in the average capital accumulation was mainly due to the aforementioned increase in total assets meanwhile ipec is soon expected to announce a compensation framework to policyholders whose claims were eroded during the conversion of values from zimbabwe dollar to the us dollars during the february 2009 period this is after a commission of inquiry into the conversion process found that pensioners and policy holders suffered a significant loss of value and recommended compensation it also noted that values were not only lost during the conversion period but during the 1996 2014 period the commission s investigations covered the 18 year period to 2014 and looked into the operations of life insurance companies pension fund administrators stand alone pension funds funeral assurance companies the guardians fund government s pension system and the national social security authority

sunday september 6 2009 the minister of finance pravin gordhan and the deputy governor of the south african reserve bank dr renosi mokate attended the g20 finance ministers and central bank governors meeting at hm treasury in london on 4 and 5 september 2009 the meeting focused on preparations for the heads of states summit scheduled for 24 25 september in pittsburgh pennsylvania usa primarily the meeting focused on the state of the world economy and appropriate macro financial policies reforms of the world bank and the international monetary fund and the reshaping of the global financial system particularly the strengthening of financial regulation supervision and cooperation also received considerable attention the meeting noted that there are tentative signs of recovery in the global economy albeit uneven across countries and regions however the outlook remains cautious and it is too early to conclude that the recovery has gained traction in light of this the g20 countries committed to maintaining their current fiscal and monetary policy stimulus policies the g20 countries agreed that the approach on exit strategies and the shape that these will take depends on the sustainability of the economic recovery the precise nature and timing of the exit strategies will be governed by national conditions the meeting reviewed the latest data on the state of the world economy and concluded that stimulus packages should remain in place until recovery is secured the g20 countries remain committed to the formulation of a credible exit strategy which will be underpinned by effective coordination between fiscal and monetary authorities international cooperation and communication among countries regarding policy actions the imf has been called on to play a surveillance role ensuring that effective international coordination and cooperation takes place concern was raised about the need to ensure that countries work toward programmes that contribute to achieving balanced and sustainable growth given that many countries have had to increase their deficit and debt levels to unprecedented levels and implement unconventional and conventional monetary policies such programmes would include a rebalancing of global demand countries agreed to achieve balanced and sustainable growth in effect this means that high deficit countries would increase their savings and high surplus countries would increase domestic demand efforts to increase international trade effect structural reforms deepen financial markets and avoid protectionism would also be implemented the meetings of the g20 in november last year and april this year radically reshaped the architecture and rules governing the global financial system this meeting of the g20 reiterated the need for swift and full implementation of the commitments made at the washington and london summits countries have agreed on further necessary steps to strengthen the financial system coordinated by the financial stability board including clear and identifiable progress in 2009 on delivering a framework on corporate governance and compensation practices stronger regulation and oversight for systemically important firms rapid progress in developing stronger prudential regulation delivering an effective programme of peer review capacity building and counter measures to tackle non cooperative jurisdictions that fail to meet regulatory standards consistent and coordinated implementation of international standards and convergence towards a single set of high quality global independent accounting standards in support of the commitments made at the g20 to address the impact of the financial crisis south africa s fiscal and monetary authorities have like many other countries implemented counter cyclical policies the south african reserve bank has adopted an accommodative policy stance having reduced interest rates by 500 basis points since december 2008 south africa supports the decision to promptly implement the april 2008 quota reform package we also support further reforms to improve the quota share of emerging countries in both the imf and the world bank reform their executive boards and to increase the size of world board by one member to allow an additional african chair we support the move to a more open transparent and merit based approach to choose the heads of the world bank and imf south africa expressed its concern about the impact of the financial crisis on low income countries particularly those in africa the majority of african countries lack resources for substantial short or long term fiscal response to the crisis and this will impact on their ability to attain the mdgs and alleviate poverty south africa also supports the expansion of credit facilities including the introduction of the flexible credit line and a more flexible range of instruments for low income countries the challenge remains turning broad commitments for governance reform into action on reforms to the financial regulatory system south africa supports the initiatives of the financial stability board to improve the architecture of the financial regulatory system and mechanisms to improve collaboration and co ordination between countries in particular south africa supports initiatives to regulate bankers pay and bonuses in order to reduce and minimise excessive and reckless risk taking culture that has infected many banks the south african regulators have been effective in regulating such risk in our banking system and this remains an example to the rest of the world it is clear that the world economy still has a way to go toward complete recovery the g20 has reaffirmed that collective and coordinated efforts will be needed globally to ensure sustainable growth and to build a stronger and more effective international financial system issued by the national treasury 6 september 2009
by alasdair macleod via goldmoney com zerohedge com sat 02 23 2019 this article makes the obvious point that a return to a gold standard is the only way nations can contain the interest cost of servicing debt given the alternative is inflationist policies that can only lead to far higher interest rates and currency destruction the topic is timely given the self harm of american economic and geopolitical policies which are already leading america into a cyclical slump meanwhile american fears of asian domination of global economic monetary and political outcomes have come true the upcoming credit crisis is likely to kill off the welfare state model in the west by destroying their unbacked paper currencies while china russia and their asian allies have the means to prosper the fragility of state finances in my last goldmoney article i explained why the monetary policies of inflationist economists and policy makers would end up destroying fiat currencies the destruction will come from ordinary people who are forced by law to use the state s money for settling their day to day transactions ordinary people each one a trinity of production consumption and saving will eventually wake up to the fraud of monetary inflation and discard their government s medium of exchange as intrinsically worthless they always have eventually this has been proved by experience and should be uncontroversial for the issuer of a currency the risk of this happening heightens when credit markets become destabilised and confidence in the full faith and credit which is the only backing a fiat currency has begins to be questioned either by its users or foreigners or both and when it does a currency starts to rapidly lose purchasing power and the whole interest rate structure moves higher the state s finances are then ruined because by that time the state will have accumulated a lethal combination of existing unrepayable debt and escalating welfare liabilities today most governments including the us are already ensnared in this debt trap only the public has yet to realise the consequences and the planners are not about to tell them the difficulty for nearly all governments is the deterioration in their finances will eventually wipe out their currencies unless a solution is found there is a solution that if taken allows the state to survive it could be modelled on steve hanke s of john hopkins university preferred solution of a currency board that when strictly observed removes the state s ability to create money out of thin air he recommends this solution to currency debasement and the evils that come with it for venezuela and the like linking a distressed emerging market currency to the dollar but here we are considering stabilising the dollar itself and all the other currencies linked to it the currency board in this case can only be linked to gold which has always been the peoples money free of issuer risk in former times this was the basis of a gold exchange standard professor hanke s currency board is a rule based system designed to achieve the same thing once the system is in place every currency unit subsequently put into public circulation by the monetary authority must be physically backed by a defined weight of gold bullion this was the method of the gold exchange standard adopted by the bank of england under the terms of the bank charter act of 1844 a modern currency board consisting of digitised currency effectively works the same way a currency board system is not the best mechanism whereby currency is made exchangeable for gold its weakness is it relies on the state fulfilling its obligations so it would be better to use gold directly either in physical or digitised form america reneged on its gold exchange standard in 1933 34 when it first banned gold ownership and then devalued the dollar that was simply theft by the state from its citizens therefore other safeguards for a gold exchange standard must be in place a return to a credible gold exchange standard will then put a cap on interest rates and therefore government borrowing costs instead of nominal rates of 10 going on 20 and beyond a gold exchange standard will probably cap long term government borrowing rates in a two to five per cent range it also allows businesses with viable investment plans to progress as well not only is it an obvious solution but it is similar to that adopted in the uk following the napoleonic wars the rest here
warren buffett has long been a booster of american business and in his latest annual letter to berkshire hathaway brk a brk b shareholders published saturday buffett not only touts the united states economic track record but also takes a jab at the doomsayers he s met along the way including a younger version of himself on march 11th it will be 77 years since i first invested in an american business buffett writes the year was 1942 i was 11 and i went all in investing 114 75 i had begun accumulating at age six what i bought was three shares of cities service preferred stock i had become a capitalist and it felt good buffett notes that on that day in 1942 the united states prospects in world war ii appeared challenging but buffett writes that leaving aside congenital pessimists americans believed that their children and generations beyond would live far better lives than they themselves had led the nation expected post war growth a belief that proved to be well founded in fact the nation s achievements can best be described as breathtaking the amount buffett invested in those preferred shares of cities service 114 75 would have grown to 606 811 if invested in a no fee index fund tracking the s p 500 buffett writes a million dollars invested in the same instrument at the time would have grown to 5 3 billion of course there is no way to capture the exact returns of the s p 500 without incurring any costs but the point is well taken investing in common stocks of u s companies has been a good bet over the last 77 years during which american companies have enjoyed these stellar returns a lot has changed about the country and its financial standing the national debt for instance is now more than 22 trillion those worried most acutely about this debt load note that the overhang presents a challenge to future economic growth a financial burden for future generations and risks the status of the dollar as the world s reserve currency story continues gold wouldn t have saved you buffett knows that for many this debt burden makes investing in a hard asset like gold attractive one day the debt must be dealt with and that day will be a painful one for investors the thinking goes but to buffett it will be and has been far more painful for investors that try to anticipate that day of reckoning for the u s government while eschewing the american tailwind that has been so kind to him and many other investors those who regularly preach doom because of government budget deficits as i regularly did myself for many years might note that our country s national debt has increased roughly 400 fold during the last of my 77 year periods buffett writes that s 40 000 suppose you had foreseen this increase and panicked at the prospect of runaway deficits and a worthless currency to protect yourself you might have eschewed stocks and opted instead to buy ounces of gold with your 114 75 and what would that supposed protection have delivered you would now have an asset worth about 4 200 less than 1 of what would have been realized from a simple unmanaged investment in american business the magical metal was no match for the american mettle warren buffett chairman and ceo of berkshire hathaway gestures as he plays bridge outside berkshire owned borsheims jewelry store in omaha neb sunday may 6 2018 ap photo nati harnik in the long run buffett notes we re all dead anyway and along the way towards that inevitable end there are those who will believe they alone foresee how the collective story concludes perhaps it is with runaway inflation rioting in the streets a collapse of the modern economic system but in this year s shareholder letter as he has in recent editions buffett reminds readers of the financial calamities endured during his own investing career the reminder is not however to heed history s warnings but to recall that all difficult moments of this history eventually become history our country s almost unbelievable prosperity has been gained in a bipartisan manner buffett writes since 1942 we have had seven republican presidents and seven democrats in the years they served the country contended at various times with a long period of viral inflation a 21 prime rate several controversial and costly wars the resignation of a president a pervasive collapse in home values a paralyzing financial panic and a host of other problems all engendered scary headlines all are now history christopher wren architect of st paul s cathedral lies buried within that london church near his tomb are posted these words of description translated from latin if you would seek my monument look around you those skeptical of america s economic playbook should heed his message no one does it alone buffett also reminds readers that the story of america s economic success is a shared one in a country of self made success stories no one truly meets the definition charlie and i happily acknowledge that much of berkshire s success has simply been a product of what i think should be called the american tailwind buffett writes it is beyond arrogance for american businesses or individuals to boast that they have done it alone the tidy rows of simple white crosses at normandy should shame those who make such claims there are also many other countries around the world that have bright futures about that we should rejoice americans will be both more prosperous and safer if all nations thrive at berkshire we hope to invest significant sums across borders over the next 77 years however the major source of

by paul wiseman and kevin freking associated press washington u s and chinese negotiators agreed friday to extend high level trade talks through the weekend and president donald trump said he hoped to meet next month at his florida resort with president xi jinping to try to finalize an agreement the news followed two days of negotiations in washington aimed at resolving a trade war that has rattled financial markets and threatened global economic growth we re making a lot of progress trump told reporters at the white house i think there s a very good chance that a deal can be made treasury secretary steven mnuchin said the negotiations which had been scheduled to conclude friday afternoon would continue through sunday the chinese delegation is led by xi s special envoy vice premier liu he the american team by trade representative robert lighthizer trump had originally warned that he would escalate the tariffs he has imposed on 200 billion in chinese imports from 10 percent to 25 percent if the two sides failed to reach a deal by march 2 but in recent days and again on friday he raised the possibility of extending that deadline if negotiators were nearing an agreement the world s two biggest economies are sparring over u s allegations that beijing uses predatory tactics in a drive to make chinese companies world leaders in such advanced industries as robotics and driverless cars those tactics the trump administration argues include cyber theft unfair subsidies for state owned chinese companies the use of regulations to hobble china s foreign competitors and pressure on american companies to hand over technology in exchange for access to the chinese market the administration contends that beijing has repeatedly failed to live up to its past commitments to open its markets and to treat foreign companies more fairly the president has imposed 25 percent tariffs on 50 billion in chinese imports and 10 percent tariffs on 200 billion worth the latter grouping would face the 25 percent tariffs too if no agreement is reached beijing has lashed back with import taxes of its own on 110 billion in u s goods these tariffs are heavily aimed at soybeans and other agricultural products in an effort to pressure trump supporters in the u s farm belt on friday the president and his advisers provided few details on this week s negotiations trump did say the two sides had reached some agreement on currency manipulation but offered no specifics the administration has expressed concern that beijing would blunt the impact of trump s sanctions by manipulating its currency down to give chinese companies a competitive edge in international markets trump said both sides want to make this a real deal we want to make it a meaningful deal the president said not a deal that s done and doesn t mean anything we want to make this a deal that s going to last for many many years and a deal that s going to be good for both countries after trump appeared with liu at the white house the agriculture department announced that beijing had agreed to buy 10 million metric tons of american soybeans and tweeted hats off to potus for bringing china to the table china s soybean tariffs have squeezed many american farmers in the first 10 months of 2018 u s soybean exports to china dropped to 8 2 million metric tons from 21 4 million metric tons a year earlier a 62 percent freefall according to the agriculture department the u s china conflict has rattled markets it has also fanned uncertainty among businesses that must decide where to invest and whether trump s tariffs which raise the cost of imports on the target list will last long enough to justify replacing chinese suppliers with those from countries not subject to the tariffs the international monetary fund the world bank and the organization for economic cooperation and development have all downgraded their forecasts for the global economy citing the heightened trade tensions myron brilliant head of international affairs at the u s chamber of commerce said the two countries have yet to bridge their differences over nettlesome issues such as the forced technology transfer he said the chamber wants to see an end to the tariffs between washington and beijing but he also said american businesses are demanding a deal that would produce lasting improvement in chinese trade practices we simply can t go back to business as it was before brilliant said beijing he said has got to deliver the goods
president tariff man may be learning all the wrong lessons from his trade wars specifically that higher tariffs work u s and chinese officials are meeting in washington this week for another round of trade negotiations if recent reporting proves correct the talks look likely to result in a commitment to keep talking also possibly a series of vague unenforceable memorandums of understanding if that s what ends up happening markets are likely to celebrate not because this will represent progress necessarily mostly because it might signal a reprieve from a highly feared scenario that president trump would follow through with threats to ratchet up tariffs on 200 billion of chinese goods from his already destructive rate of 10 percent to a possibly disastrous 25 percent after march 1 to be fair it would be fabulous if these talks actually lead china to respect intellectual property rights end forced technology transfer cybertheft and huge market distorting subsidies and commit to enforcement mechanisms and accountability measures for all these objectives but this outcome seems highly unlikely at present not just because it would be challenging to oh map out a wholesale restructuring of the entire chinese economy within a few weeks also because there is serious opposition within china to some of these changes particularly when they re framed less as economic reforms and more as abject humiliating capitulation to a u s bully s demands which is exactly the narrative trump has been feeding then there s the problem of what trump cares most about extracting from china historically he has fixated on reducing our bilateral trade deficit and not these important but challenging structural issues trade balances as almost any economist could tell you are not really what matters they are determined by all sorts of complicated factors unrelated to whether countries are playing fair including savings and investment rates despite trump s claims we re not losing when we buy more stuff from china than china buys from us we re still getting stuff from china that u s consumers and businesses want given trump s interests however the most tangible win likely to come out of our nearly year long trade war might be a commitment from china to buy more u s products in particular agricultural goods needless to say there s a bit of cognitive dissonance in asking china both a to move away from centralized economic planning and b to make more state directed purchases of u s soybeans here s the bigger problem though trump may hold off on raising tariffs to 25 percent he also looks likely to keep his existing 10 percent tariffs in place which would still leave plenty of u s firms twisting in the wind most of the chinese products that trump has slapped tariffs on after all are inputs that u s companies must buy to manufacture their own products as syracuse university economist mary e lovely has noted in some cases alternative sourcing is not available especially not on short notice that means u s firms are facing higher costs and becoming less competitive some are contemplating moving production out of the united states to dodge trump s tariffs lots of other u s businesses are also suffering particularly as they face tit for tat tariffs that may or may not be alleviated in the weeks to come even if china were to decide for some reason to asymmetrically lift its retaliatory tariffs while we kept our 10 percent duties in place perhaps as part of a commitment to buy more u s goods in many cases the damage has already been done bankruptcies across the farm belt have soared to their highest levels in at least a decade but never mind all that trump wants a win and he s likely to claim he got one regardless of whether beijing ends up doing anything it had not already planned to do in the absence of this trade war and positive reinforcement from market participants relieved that things didn t get any worse may encourage him to repeat this whole process all over again that s the lesson he seems to have taken away from the nafta 2 0 negotiations even though those ended with virtually the same deal we could have expected to reach without first alienating some of our closest allies with unnecessary tariffs a repeat performance is no remote idle hypothetical this past sunday the commerce department handed trump its long awaited report on whether tariffs on autos and auto parts nearly universally opposed by the u s auto industry would be justified on national security grounds the report has not yet been released but trump told reporters wednesday that regardless of what it says and implicitly how much domestic damage the policy might cause he plans to use the threat of car tariffs as leverage in his negotiations with the european union so buckle up for another round some people never learn catherine rampell s email address is crampell washpost com follow her on twitter crampell c 2019 washington post writers group
all human beings have a right to healthcare but powerful forces remain dead set against it an interview with pnhp president dr adam gaffney by michael winship dr adam gaffney is the brand new president of physicians for a national health program pnhp the national medicare for all advocacy group of medical professionals and others committed to single payer universal healthcare provided equitably as a public service rather than bought and sold as a commodity in the announcement of his election dr gaffney said we ve been so successful in popularizing the idea of medicare for all that everybody wants in on the slogan even if they have something completely different in mind like a public option but tweaks won t solve the fundamental problems of american health care persistently high uninsurance rising underinsurance unaffordable drugs narrow provider networks and the growing corporate domination of health care that prioritizes profits over patients adam gaffney is a pulmonary specialist at cambridge health alliance in massachusetts who earned his bachelor s and medical degrees from new york university and a master s in public health from harvard he s been active in the single payer movement for several years writing numerous articles and research papers and co chairing a working group that developed pnhp s physicians proposal for single payer health care reform we spoke recently while he was in new york for a meeting of the commission on public policy and health in the trump era a group brought together by the medical journal the lancet our conversation has been edited for length and clarity talk a bit about your medical background and how it has made you such a strong medicare for all advocate i think that my politics preceded my medical career in college i was very progressive in 2000 when i was a freshman in college i supported ralph nader in that election i think that s when i first heard the term single payer although i certainly supported universal healthcare as a concept earlier than that back to my years in high school but i would say that everything i ve seen since embarking on my medical career has reinforced my feelings about why we need single payer and universal healthcare all the patients i ve seen who have gone without care because they couldn t afford it who have skipped inhalers for their emphysema because they couldn t afford the copay have shown up in the icu because of complications of illness that didn t get treated because they had gone without insurance or because their insurance had lapsed everything i ve seen since embarking on a medical career has definitely reinforced what i had thought before i started it people often say why do we need one public payer why can t we have a number of different insurance companies there are many downsides to that it s not just that fragmentation produces waste which it does it s not just the enormous burden of billing and administration that imposes on hospitals and doctors and that generates as much as 500 billion a year in wasted spending on administration it s also the fact that often people don t even know what s covered physicians won t even know what s covered people show up at the pharmacy and it turns out the drug they need isn t covered literally the last thing i would want a patient or family to have to think about are the financial consequences of their healthcare and they don t have to so you are completely convinced that single payer is the best way to go yes i am also completely convinced that imposing costs on patients at the time of healthcare use has no useful purpose that seems like a radical idea and even people on the liberal left side of the spectrum sometimes say well having a reasonable copay is not such a bad idea to ensure that healthcare is not used sort of frivolously i think some people think a system where you don t impose costs is pie in the sky and unrealistic it s of course not unrealistic considering that in the uk this already exists in the uk there are no copays for doctor s visits no deductibles no payments to hospitals in scotland you don t even pay for parking at the hospital if you re visiting a loved one it s clearly doable and i think it s a better system at the end of the day maybe people paying for healthcare only really affects working class and poor people because well off people are always going to be willing to pay a forty dollar copay right it really is just a way of punishing the sick and the poor when your presidency was announced you described it as an exciting but also dangerous moment in the history of single payer why exciting in that we re farther along than we ever have been single payer has made incredible strides in just the last few years from a position that was mostly on kind of the fringe of respectable politics to a position that s now very close to center that s being embraced by politicians running for president that was not the case in 2008 in 2008 basically all the major candidates had no interest in single payer they already had their minds made up that healthcare reform was going to be a sort of obamacare like proposal which it was that s not the case anymore i think it s part of a larger progressive swing in many ways our politics have become more regressive with the election of trump with the domination of congress by republicans but there has been a progressive swing with exciting new left wing candidates in the house of representatives the move of single payer to the center of the conversation is part of that but it s a dangerous moment as well think about this even while we get excited about the prospects of single payer republicans in congress are now pushing dangerous new programs states like arkansas are imposing work requirements on a medicaid program that s squeezing out of the program i think the latest figure was 18 000 people by creating bureaucratic barriers and paperwork there s obviously going to be an ongoing effort by the right to dismantle existing public healthcare systems whether that takes the form of another attempted repeal of the affordable care act seems unlikely given the change in congress in november in december the trump administration released a white paper that was mostly not noticed in the news but it was a wish list or manifesto for a conservative healthcare future it gives you a sense of what corporate opposition would do if it could further privatize the system or further privatize medicare it would increase high deductible health plans it would just take an overall laissez faire deregulatory approach to the health care system so there are both promises and dangers on the horizon let s talk about the 2020 elections in the pnhp announcement of your presidency it s said that medicare for all has become such a catchphrase that some candidates may be misusing it we ve had the idea for a long time but what happened was that the idea has become very popular something that everyone is rallying behind so i do think there s an effort to steal some of that thunder and use the branding on other types of healthcare proposals that fall well short of what we re talking about we re talking about a national health insurance program that covers everyone in the country these other proposals are not that some of them still might help many people but they re not what the country needs they wouldn t fix the fundamental problems of the us healthcare system there has been a long standing debate over whether calling this medicare for all is the right approach on the pro side medicare is a familiar system something that people understand a term people are familiar with historically the people who designed medicare first envisioned it as a national health care system it was the progeny of a national health insurance model the architects of national health insurance under the truman administration when that fell through they basically said all right let s at least make this into a program for seniors so in terms of the historical ideological lineage there is something to be said for calling single payer medicare for all the cons are that it can be confusing because we re not talking about replicating medicare in its current form we re talking about going beyond it medicare has copays this system will not medicare doesn t cover dental this system would medicare has somewhat privatized there s medicare advantage and medicare part d the drug benefit in contrast this would be a single solitary public plan so there are significant differences between medicare and what we re talking about would you say that bernie sanders medicare for all legislation in the senate or the house bill comes closest to your organization s position the house bill comes closest the sanders bill has a couple of areas for improvement that we d like to see they re mostly sort of wonky design issues that most people don t get too excited about but that we think are very important overall the sanders bill is a single payer bill it gets most of it right we would like to see a change in the way hospitals are financed so that they get global budgets that cover all their operating expenditures rather than replicating the current medicare payment system which incentivizes profit oriented activities we d like to see no copays on drugs the sanders bill has almost no copays but it has small residual copays for some drugs it s pretty minor but we d like to see that out we d like to see the inclusion of long term care which the sanders bill does not have it is a lot of money but we need to deal with long term care and make sure that s covered ryan grim had a piece in the interceptrecently reporting that nancy pelosi s top healthcare aide had met with representatives of blue cross blue shield and told them that the house would move on drug prices over single payer or changing the aca i think there s some truth that we re not going to pass single payer under the trump administration it isn t realistic to think that it s going to happen with this current government but it is disturbing that those assurances are being given to the industry it suggests that not all democrats are on the same page there s longstanding resistance among some in the establishment to sweeping ideas like medicare for all i talk about all the huge strides that have been made but there are still many obstacles ahead as you re probably aware there s a new corporate group funded by big pharma and the insurances companies that is spoiling for a fight sharpening its swords gearing up to tackle single payer the industry is not going to go down without a fight obviously they re going to pour money into washington they re going to pour money into lobbying they re going to pour money into candidates they re going to take out ads they re going to smear it left and right so our work is cut out for us senator sherrod brown a progressive on most things has said that he s for medicare for all but thinks it should be incremental starting by lowering the medicare age to 55 i understand those arguments but i think what s often not understood is that many of the savings that a single payer system would achieve really come from a systemic shift and not from the incremental let s say you create a public option that s one more option people can buy into as a choice of healthcare insurance that may achieve somewhat lower premiums by virtue of paying medicare rates instead of private insurance rates but it s actually not going to take the profit orientation out of the system it s not going to achieve the administrative savings that you get from a single payer system it s not going to allow us to reduce the armies of billers and coders that are employed by hospitals so i think that some of those arguments fail to realize the real policy issues you just mentioned this new corporate group that wants to come down hard on single payer because you re advocating for the complete elimination of private insurance there may be some small residual role for private coverage of cosmetic surgery or things like that that s basically how it is in canada in canada the system doesn t cover drugs or vision there are supplementary plans for those things but that s a weakness of their system not something we should emulate so there s really no need to have a private health insurance industry in this country you d have one public payer that covers everybody you re going up against a behemoth yes they ll need to find a new line of work laughs i don t know what to say the workers in those industries definitely need to be taken care of the sanders bill and the house bill both have provisions to take care of displaced workers it s not their fault that these industries don t really have value the ceo s i really don t care too much about but how do you go about buying out for profit hospitals and nursing homes how do you keep owners from simply converting hospitals and nursing facilities into apartments or hotels there s an ongoing debate about this among supporters of single payer pnhp s position is that we should have a plan for how to buy out for profit healthcare providers as we transition into single payer we think that you could take out a large bond use it to buy out for profit providers convert them to not for profit and that would be a way to ensure that for profit owners don t say to heck with this i m selling off all my dialysis machines to europe unions are a bulwark of the democratic party and i know that a lot of union members are going to say that my union healthcare plan is really good why would i give it up for single payer my response would be that you re never going to give it up for something that s not better we and our allies would never support a plan that replaced people s existing plans with something inferior if you look at the bills they have comprehensive benefits and no cost sharing that essentially beats every private plan out there and goes beyond them for at least the next two years the republicans will keep trying to destroy the affordable care act as you see it is there value in continuing to work to shore up obamacare until changes can be made i think we should join forces with everyone who s fighting to defend existing programs that help people i think you saw that during the 2017 repeal effort when single payer supporters linked arms with people who supported aca or supported other forms of universal coverage and we fought together to push back against the repeal of the affordable care act i don t think that doing that retards the advance of single payer and i don t think that fighting for single payer gives an opening for those who want to attack the aca so how do you pay for single payer there was a 200 page report on the economics of single payer that came out of the university of massachusetts amherst led by economist robert pollin they suggested a mix of taxes that would cover its costs it s by no means definitive there are other approaches to the problem their proposal includes redirecting all existing public health monies into the new system roughly two thirds of current public health dollars are already taxpayer financed so you divert those funds into the new system and for the remaining yes you need a mix of taxes they propose a modest sales tax on non essentials an employer side payroll tax and some new taxes on the very wealthy what you call truly progressive taxation which has the added benefit of doing something about soaring economic inequality which in itself is a cause of bad health so actually publicly financing our healthcare system has benefits by helping to confront the problem of inequality the other side screams socialized medicine just as they did when medicare and medicaid and obamacare began call it what you will laughs medicare and medicaid were historic advances as was the affordable care act improving people s lives but they have left big holes and for some people things actually are getting worse there just was a report from the commonwealth fundin which they looked at the inadequacy of insurance and they found that 45 percent of non elderly american adults are inadequately insured or underinsured people with insurance from their employers have seen their deductibles triple over the last decade and the portion of people who are underinsured continues to rise the affordable care act helped to reduce the uninsured by 20 million people but it obviously left huge holes you alluded to global budgets also known as global operating plans explain there are different ways to pay a hospital the existing way is per patient billing sometimes that means having to add up every single service they used or every single tylenol and so on which obviously is a huge waste so what are the downsides of that for one you need an enormous infrastructure of people adding up the costs on a per patient basis us hospitals spend a quarter of their revenue on administration and billing that is double the proportion that canada and scotland spend the other problem with existing hospital payment methods is that they incentivize a profit oriented approach focusing on the kinds of patients or the kinds of care i m not saying every hospital does this my hospital cambridge health alliance certainly does not overall it creates an incentive for hospitals writ large to engage in some profit oriented activities supplying services that generate the highest revenue neglecting those that do not this is something that pnhp co founders david himmelstein and steffie woolhandler have written a lot about even non profits are sort of beholden to this sort of system not only that but for hospitals to expand to build new infrastructure to get new machines new equipment they need to generate profits because the way that new healthcare infrastructure is funded in america is from profits for hospitals so the whole system is designed to encourage even non profits to engage in profitable activities because if they don t they ll go under they won t be able to buy the new equipment they won t be able to build the new wing they won t be able to attract patients and the patients will go elsewhere this is why we need to get away from a discussion that focuses on bad actors and start thinking about the way the system is designed the defects in the system what do we need to do to change that first we need global operating budgets himmselstein and woolhandler have rightly emphasized this it s a lump sum that a hospital gets to cover all its operating expenses this is how it works with the va this is how it works in europe in canada for the most part you get a lump sum and you can use it to take care of all your patients and then you re not trying to say well i ll do more invasive surgery that makes a lot more money instead i ll spend it where it s needed take care of patients in response to community needs at the same time what we propose and what is in the house bill is a system where the capital expenditures i mentioned are separately funded where hospitals don t have to try to seek a profit on their operating revenues in order to have money left over to build stuff capital expenditures are determined based on medical need when and where the structure is needed so you move away from this whole profit ethos toward one that s focused on community needs in the current system new hospitals get built where revenues are highest new wings get built where revenues exceed costs hospitals in rural areas are going under because it s hard to turn a profit in a rural what we call single payer incorporates things beyond just where the money comes from it envisions a reconfiguration a reformulation of the healthcare system away from profit oriented activities towards one that is oriented toward community and patient needs people ask questions like when do you see this happening how do you see this happening frankly i have no idea no one knows the reality is that when we achieve single payer there still are going to be areas for improvement we re not going to get it perfect the first time and there are always going to be efforts to dismantle it but i think the single payer system is particularly resilient against that you see that in europe even when there have been right wing governments try as they may they often stumble in their efforts to dismantle public systems of healthcare margaret thatcher her people certainly would have loved to have dismantled nhs but they knew they couldn t they tinkered with it they made it worse they added some market elements to it and then the conservative brexiteers lied and used as an argument that all the money saved from leaving the eu would be put into the nhs it does show how achieving real solid victories that help people on an everyday basis create the constituencies that support it that doesn t make it invincible i understand that but the nhs is socialism laughs talk a bit about pnhp s education efforts we have a sort of split focus both on the medical profession and on the general public our members do grand rounds at hospitals we speak to colleagues we give talks we disseminate materials we produce research we are one part of the single payer movement that does focus on the medical profession but the reality is that we don t just want doctors to be on board we need doctors to be on board there are some polls that show majority support for single payer among physicians a lot has changed from the late 1940 s when the american medical association was the main force that defeated truman s national health insurance plan for one thing there are more voices it s a more pluralistic profession than it was it s certainly a far more diverse profession than it was there are still elements in the medical profession that are opposed to single payer but there are elements like ours that powerfully support it there also have been changes in the political economy of healthcare relatively recently it was reported that a majority of physicians are now employees which is a tremendous shift in the political economy of healthcare traditionally physicians were essentially archetypal small business people typically businessmen there have been real downsides for physicians in terms of the quality of their work they spend more time on clerical activities on fighting with insurance companies on checking boxes interacting with the computer instead of interacting with the patients i think it has resulted in a lot of burnout with physicians and it has resulted in job dissatisfaction so i think there is a real desire among physicians to imagine a better world for their patients and for themselves i think that has created an opening within the medical profession to support single payer and about educating the general public our members do media write op eds give talks engage in debates and also some of our members engage in policy research that our organization helps to get out there drs himmelstein and woolhandler were the lead authors of single payer proposals that were published in the new england journal of medicine and jama that actually became the foundation for the house single payer bills they have done a lot of studies the statistic that the majority of bankruptcies are medical bankruptcies was their work just to give one example i m doing healthcare research for one project we re focusing on patients with lung disease at how deductibles affect people with copd we re also looking at how one of the big concerns with single payer is that it would create an enormous explosion in expense because people would use more healthcare because it was free we re not sure so we have done some research on the effects of the affordable care act an medicare in the 1960 s stay tuned on that i m going to continue the work that previous presidents have done if you look at some of these polls that sort of get cited where the bottom line is yes single payer polls really well but when you start asking people this or that the support is malleable it s true that many people don t understand all of the design aspects that it will be one public plan that covers everybody instead of an option so there is an enormous amount of education of the public that has to take place to make single payer a reality finally i wanted to ask you about immigration pnhp is calling for coverage of all undocumented and documented immigrants we are calling for coverage of all us residents i think that s important look everyone needs healthcare you re not going to deny people healthcare simply by virtue of the country they were born in nor should we healthcare is a human right that s imperative at the end of the day the reality is that unless you re willing to push people away from the doors of hospitals and call in the goons to throw them into the streets you need to take care of people right it s just common decency the irony is there s also some research that immigrants actually pay more into the healthcare system if that wasn t the case it wouldn t change my opinion but it is a funny irony the reason is pretty simple immigrants in general are younger and healthier they use less healthcare and they pay more into the system but that s not the motivation the motivation is to envision healthcare as a human right that everyone deserves by virtue of belonging to the human race this work is licensed under a creative commons attribution

there are three main ideas of the green new deal resolution introduced by congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez and senator ed markey the first is to decarbonize the us energy system that is to end the emissions of carbon dioxide co2 from burning coal oil and natural gas in order to stop global warming the second is to guarantee lower cost high quality health coverage for all the third is to ensure decent jobs and living standards for all americans in part by making colleges and vocational schools affordable for all the right wing and corporate lobbies are already hyperventilating it is unachievable it will bankrupt us it will make us into venezuela these claims are dead wrong the green new deal agenda is both feasible and affordable this will become clear as the agenda is turned into specific legislation for energy health care higher education and more the green new deal combines ideas across several parts of the economy because the ultimate goal is sustainable development that means an economy that delivers a package deal good incomes social fairness and environmental sustainability around the world governments are aiming for the same end a triple bottom line of economic social and environmental objectives the green new deal agenda is both feasible and affordable this will become clear as the agenda is turned into specific legislation for energy health care higher education and more in the us the economy is feeding the wealth of billionaires while leaving tens of millions of households with no financial cushion at all meanwhile the fossil fuel lobby continues to endanger the planet by promoting the use of fuels that contribute to climate change raising the risk of mega floods droughts hurricanes and heat waves claiming many lives and costing the us more than 450 billion during 2016 18 or more than 150 billion per year on average the key ideas of the green new deal decarbonization lower cost health care and decent living standards for the working class have been studied for years the green new deal resolution is the opportunity finally to put that vast knowledge into effect what is absolutely clear is that the green new deal is affordable the claims about the unaffordability of these goals are pure hype the detailed plans that will emerge in the coming months will expose the bluster decarbonizing energy consider the challenge of decarbonizing the energy system as noted in the green new deal resolution the recent report of the inter governmental panel on climate change calls for global decarbonization by 2050 an achievable goal that requires coherent and accelerated actions by the us and other nations the green new deal is the occasion to put america s utilities builders and automakers to the challenge of accelerating their technological overhauls to complete decarbonization by 2050 or earlier the resolution calls for a 10 year mobilization effort to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions but not for a precise timeline for completing decarbonization the timing will depend on the pace of new zero carbon investments and the phase out of existing fossil fuel based technologies decarbonization will include the following measures electricity generation will shift from coal and natural gas to wind solar hydro and other zero carbon technologies cars and trucks will shift from gasoline to electricity using batteries or fuel cells with hydrogen manufactured by electrolysis planes will use electricity for short flights and advanced zero carbon fuels for longer flights buildings will be heated by electricity such as heat pumps rather than boilers and furnaces the costs of renewable energy are plummeting making decarbonization eminently feasible detailed estimates put the costs of substantial decarbonization 80 or more by 2050 at around 1 of gdp per year or less see here for one recent study in many cases renewable energy is already at grid parity meaning that it is at a cost point comparable to fossil fuels most of the modest costs of decarbonization will never hit the federal budget as they will be absorbed by the utility industry the automobile producers and other parts of the private economy decarbonization is already underway in the us just not yet with the pace and scale required us utilities are no longer building coal fired power plants many are now scrapping plans for gas fired plants in favor of renewable energy investors and in house lawyers are warning companies not to invest in fossil fuels as these investments would be stranded in future years automobile companies are rapidly shifting to electric vehicles new buildings are going electric with tough efficiency codes these transformations are being driven mainly by environmental regulations integrated resource planning by utilities and market forces not by federal outlays medicare for all lower cost high quality health care for all for example through medicare for all is also within reach as with decarbonization the right wing and corporate lobbies are using scare tactics to hide the basic fact health care costs in the us can be cut considerably while improving services the us spends around 17 of its gross domestic product gdp on health care coverage while other countries spend 10 12 the main difference lies with the high prices of us health care for drugs hospital stays medical procedures and other goods and services rather than with greater utilization of health services these high prices have resulted in part from the rising concentration and market power of health care providers at the metropolitan level the result is outlandish salaries bloated administration heavy costs of advertising and other inefficiencies that result in high incomes for the health care industry and exorbitant costs for taxpayers and for workers paying for private health care plans the question is therefore not whether we can afford medicare for all but whether we will get there before the private health care industry bankrupts us the question is therefore not whether we can afford medicare for all but whether we will get there before the private health care industry bankrupts us as one approach the private insurance premiums now flowing to private health insurers could be re directed to a medicare account that would reimburse the health providers at medicare rates with much lower management salaries and administrative costs the nationwide cost savings of medicare for all hundreds of billions of dollars per year could be remitted to taxpayers or used to reduce the federal budget deficit college for all similar budget analyses demonstrate the feasibility of other parts of the green new deal can debt free higher education for all be achieved the other rich countries all accomplish it one proposal for college for all presented by senator bernie sanders would cost around one quarter of 1 of gdp a price point that is tiny compared with the burdens of a society weighed down by student debts that create lifelong anxieties until retirement years the green new deal proponents are absolutely correct on the merits decarbonization medicare for all debt free higher education and other social benefits are feasible affordable and smart they will deliver great savings in the case of health care environmental benefits in the case of decarbonization and renewed social mobility in the case of debt free higher education as a next step the green new deal ideas should be turned into legislation plans and budgets when the federal interstate highway system was being debated in 1955 every congressman received a booklet with detailed maps showing how their district would benefit from an interstate highway system it s now important to provide a roadmap of the green new deal showing for each part of the country how the green new deal package can be accomplished at low cost and with enormous economic social and environmental benefits
new york feb 22 2019 bss afp boosterish claims of progress in us china trade talks lifted global stocks on friday sending wall street to its longest winning streak in more than two decades asian and european markets likewise were mostly higher amid signals from chinese and american officials building expectations the two sides will successfully resolve their seven month trade war which as knocked equities prices sideways for much of the last year in washington us president donald trump said the latest round of trade talks had been extended by another two days as the two sides raced to strike a bargain ahead of a march 1 deadline to avoid sharp increases in us duties on chinese goods and he again said he might be willing to push back the deadline i think there is a very very good chance that a deal can be made trump told reporters at the white house in new york the blue chip dow jones industrial average closed higher marking its ninth straight weekly gain the longest such streak since may 1995 despite the dow s advance since december when the federal reserve all but announced a halt to its interest rate hikes the benchmark index is still below where it was in mid january of last year markets are responding to what seems like meaningful progress on the trade dispute between us and china and given the president remarks this afternoon it looks like a deal is very close alan skrainka of cornerstone wealth management told afp the economist intelligence unit eiu forecast that the two sides would make some progress but were unlikely to clinch any meaningful deal the likelihood that the us and china will make some progress in the ongoing trade talks has increased as a result of mounting domestic pressure in both economies noted eiu global economist cailin birch in a report nonetheless we do not expect a meaningful agreement as the us and china enter into a strategic competition for economic and particularly technological dominance the eiu added that any deal would therefore only provide temporary relief from trade tensions shares exposed to trade with china rose boeing which depends on the asian giant for much of its aircraft sales jumped 12 6 percent but construction equipment manufacturer caterpillar fell 0 1 percent details remained scant about any concrete progress in the trade war which has prompted stark warnings about the risks to the world economy although trump said there was a deal on currency manipulation meanwhile kraft heinz nosedived 27 4 percent a day after reporting a quarterly loss a 15 billion write down and disclosing that us securities regulators were investigating the company s procurement procedures europe s key equity markets were modestly higher at the close building on earlier asian gains key figures around 2130 gmt new york dow up 0 7 percent at 26 031 81 close new york s p 500 up 0 6 percent at 2 792 67 close new york nasdaq up 0 9 percent at 7 527 54 close london ftse 100 up 0 2 percent at 7 178 60 points close frankfurt dax 30 up 0 3 percent at 11 457 70 close paris cac 40 up 0 4 percent at 5 215 85 close euro stoxx 50 up 0 2 percent at 3 270 55 close tokyo nikkei 225 down 0 2 percent at 21 425 51 close hong kong hang seng up 0 7 percent at 28 816 30 close shanghai composite up 1 9 percent at 2 804 23 close euro dollar down at 1 1332 from 1 1336 at 2200 gmt pound dollar up at 1 3053 from 1 3043 euro pound down at 86 81 pence from 86 92 pence dollar yen up at 110 75 yen from 110 70 oil brent crude up 5 cents at 67 12 per barrel oil west texas intermediate up 30 cents at 57 26
staff writer the fayetteville observer president tariff man may be learning all the wrong lessons from his trade wars specifically that higher tariffs work u s and chinese officials met in washington last week for another round of trade negotiations if recent reporting proves correct the talks look likely to result in a commitment to keep talking also possibly a series of vague unenforceable memorandums of understanding if that s what ends up happening markets are likely to celebrate not because this will represent progress necessarily mostly because it might signal a reprieve from a highly feared scenario that president trump would follow through with threats to ratchet up tariffs on 200 billion of chinese goods from his already destructive rate of 10 percent to a possibly disastrous 25 percent after march 1 to be fair it would be fabulous if these talks actually lead china to respect intellectual property rights end forced technology transfer cybertheft and huge market distorting subsidies and commit to enforcement mechanisms and accountability measures for all these objectives but this outcome seems highly unlikely at present not just because it would be challenging to oh map out a wholesale restructuring of the entire chinese economy within a few weeks also because there is serious opposition within china to some of these changes particularly when they re framed less as economic reforms and more as abject humiliating capitulation to a u s bully s demands which is exactly the narrative trump has been feeding then there s the problem of what trump cares most about extracting from china historically he has fixated on reducing our bilateral trade deficit and not these important but challenging structural issues trade balances as almost any economist could tell you are not really what matters they are determined by all sorts of complicated factors unrelated to whether countries are playing fair including savings and investment rates despite trump s claims we re not losing when we buy more stuff from china than china buys from us we re still getting stuff from china that u s consumers and businesses want given trump s interests however the most tangible win likely to come out of our nearly year long trade war might be a commitment from china to buy more u s products in particular agricultural goods needless to say there s a bit of cognitive dissonance in asking china both a to move away from centralized economic planning and b to make more state directed purchases of u s soybeans here s the bigger problem though trump may hold off on raising tariffs to 25 percent he also looks likely to keep his existing 10 percent tariffs in place which would still leave plenty of u s firms twisting in the wind most of the chinese products that trump has slapped tariffs on after all are inputs that u s companies must buy to manufacture their own products as syracuse university economist mary e lovely has noted in some cases alternative sourcing is not available especially not on short notice that means u s firms are facing higher costs and becoming less competitive some are contemplating moving production out of the united states to dodge trump s tariffs lots of other u s businesses are also suffering particularly as they face tit for tat tariffs that may or may not be alleviated in the weeks to come even if china were to decide for some reason to asymmetrically lift its retaliatory tariffs while we kept our 10 percent duties in place perhaps as part of a commitment to buy more u s goods in many cases the damage has already been done bankruptcies across the farm belt have soared to their highest levels in at least a decade but never mind all that trump wants a win and he s likely to claim he got one regardless of whether beijing ends up doing anything it had not already planned to do in the absence of this trade war and positive reinforcement from market participants relieved that things didn t get any worse may encourage him to repeat this whole process all over again that s the lesson he seems to have taken away from the nafta 2 0 negotiations even though those ended with virtually the same deal we could have expected to reach without first alienating some of our closest allies with unnecessary tariffs a repeat performance is no remote idle hypothetical this past sunday the commerce department handed trump its long awaited report on whether tariffs on autos and auto parts nearly universally opposed by the u s auto industry would be justified on national security grounds the report has not yet been released but trump told reporters wednesday that regardless of what it says and implicitly how much domestic damage the policy might cause he plans to use the threat of car tariffs as leverage in his negotiations with the european union so buckle up for another round some people never learn washington post columnist catherine rampell s email address is crampell washpost com follow her on twitter crampell

the federal reserve said friday that in light of a slowing global economy and last year s financial market turmoil the central bank intends to remain patient in determining when to make future changes in its benchmark interest rate the fed s semi annual report to congress on monetary policy stood in contrast to its last report in july when it signaled that it was on track to keep raising rates at a gradual pace over the next two years the new report cites a range of risks to the economy that have developed over the last six months as well as continued muted inflation as reasons to slow further hikes many private economists believe the fed may raise rates at most only one more time late this year and some analysts are even forecasting that the next move will be a cut in rates as the fed confronts a slowing economy this year at its last meeting in january the fed left rates unchanged at a level of 2 25 percent to 2 5 percent and signaled a major pivot away from steadily raising rates by declaring that it intended to be patient in deciding when to raise rates again various fed officials including fed chairman jerome powell have emphasized that change in speeches since the jan 29 30 meeting powell will testify on the fed s monetary policy report before senate and house committees next tuesday and wednesday the report noted the turbulence that hit markets in the final three months of last year but unlike president donald trump who tied falling stock prices to the fed s rate hikes the central bank cited other factors including trump s trade policies financial market participants appetite for risk deteriorated markedly in the latter part of last year amid investor concerns about downside risks to the growth outlook and rising trade tensions between the united states and canada the monetary report said the fed s decision in january triggered a big rally in stock prices as investors grew less concerned that the fed could over do its tightening cycle and push the country into a recession the fed had raised rates four times in 2018 and signaled in december that it expected to hike rates another two times in 2019 among the highlights of the fed s monetary report economic growth was impacted by slower consumer spending and business investment in the second half of 2018 the housing market also weakened amid rising mortgage rates and higher material and labor costs a softening in consumer and business sentiment since the fall likely reflected financial market volatility and increased concerns about the global outlook the fed has been trimming its balance sheet by not reinvesting some treasury securities and mortgage backed bonds as they mature resulting in a drop in total fed assets of about 260 billion since the middle of last year the fed s balance sheet ended the year close to 4 trillion down from a high of 4 5 trillion before the fed began trimming the balance sheet in october 2007 the fed minutes from its january meeting indicated that the central bank is close to announcing a plan for drawing the balance sheet reduction to a close while unemployment has fallen close to a 50 year low not all areas of the country have benefited equally with rural areas lagging behind metropolitan areas the fed said broader economic trends such as the on going shift that has favored workers with more education has resulted in rural areas getting left behind

rer interviews mircea mig dobre senior research analyst diversified manufacturing machinery at robert w baird about long term growth in the housing industry prospects for the 2019 economy the importance of telematics and technology watching oil prices concerns over instability consolidation and why the millennial generation matters and more by michael roth rer there was some volatility in the economy in 2018 what kind of impact did it have dobre you can deal with rough times whenever they occur but what made the year so difficult was you couldn t quite pinpoint exactly what was causing the roughness and there s just so much volatility and uncertainty nowadays with our policy makers that it s been difficult to try to make a living in something as sensitive as the markets are when you have that level of uncertainty rer i imagine some people panic when the market takes a downturn right dobre there s a little bit of that but if you re also running a business and you have to make decisions and hire people and machines and capital and build things that uncertainty doesn t help you want to know that we re on a certain path and we re going to do certain things and have some clarity around that the whole back and forth that happening during the year i think it rattled a lot of folks so let s hope 2019 somehow ends up a little better than that rer from your research you seem very bullish long term on the residential construction market dobre i don t know if your readers are aware but we really have been under investing in residential construction they know that housing is not where it s been back in 2006 but i m not sure that many of them are as aware as they should be about some of the demographic trends coming down the pike that support that business i mean this is the kind of business where if i were in the rental industry i would really be putting my thinking cap on and wondering how do i capitalize for the next decade in regard to what i think is going to be a real trend for housing i think because we ve been so scarred from that 08 downturn and the recovery has been so slow that in many ways it s very easy to be cynical about housing and say it s a little bit of growth but boy the bubble really hurt us it s true but that s 12 years ago and things are changing not only in terms of the number of homes out there but they re changing at the population level the kids are moving out they re getting married they re starting families it could be because i m an analyst but i find the long distance perspective very compelling rer in terms of the quantity of millennials moving out from their families and starting households is it that large a demographic group dobre it s a huge opportunity if you look at the chart on the change in households in 2018 there were more households formed in 2018 than at any point in time since the late 1970s and look at what s going on with the u s population by age you see those two little mountains in there one of them is the baby boomers these folks turning 50 and 60 years old and what s going on right after is their kids the millennials and it s these millennials that are forming households at a clip that we haven t seen since 1977 they are finally getting married and look what s going on here with the u s home ownership rate you look at that and you say yeah sure but probably a lot of them are going to rent places which they do and that s why multi family housing had a few great years best since the 1980s but look at the number of households household formation owner occupied these are basically households that are forming and they re buying homes they are not renting now you look at that and you compare it with renters there s something happening here and this goes beyond china trade wars and tax policies and whatever the fed is doing with interest rates and all that what s happening here is demographically driven i did not end up marrying my wife because the fed cut interest rates by 25 basis points folks in the rental industry really need to internalize information like this as they plan for their businesses not for the next 12 months but the next 10 years a lot of professional investors are not aware of some of these statistics the folks out there busy doing real work i would suspect that they re not aware of this dynamic they might know about it because they have kids who are getting married and are moving out but to actually see the numbers you go holy smokes it s not just me this is happening at a national level rer the mortgage rates have been pretty high dobre yeah and you ll find something in there about mortgage rates as well that s been a bit of an issue the realtors will tell you it s a combination of things it s a combination of rising home prices and high mortgage rates that have resulted in more of a challenge for folks to pick up homes but the funny thing when we re talking to people in the industry we find out that there s a little more subtlety to it the demand is there but the problem is the supply is not there for the kind of demand that exists meaning a lot of these households are being formed in urban areas not rural ones and a lot of these households would like lower priced properties a couple of 24 year olds getting married and maybe living in the new york city metropolitan area they re not going to be able to afford a 2 million apartment or a 3 million home they need something that s 500 000 that they can actually get a mortgage on and that s where the problem is there s not a lot of supply of these dollar wise affordable homes for these folks to be able to move into and i think that s kind of what the industry needs to figure out at this point how do you match that supply with demand which is a challenge obviously rer overall in a nutshell what do you expect from the u s economy in 2019 dobre if i were to sum it up in just a few words i would say moderate growth we re still going to grow but we re going to grow at a slower clip than what we have seen in 2018 and i say that primarily because i do believe that financial conditions are tighter we have higher interest rates so we have a stronger dollar that usually acts as a bit of a brake on growth some of the positive effects that we saw initially from tax reform are not going to go away but we are lapping them in terms of comparisons right we have to deliver growth on top of that and the margins are going to be a little bit tougher but i think we re going to continue to grow and i will tell you that one of the very big risks as far as growth is concerned and this is kind of stating the obvious is what happens with trade policy not only in the final outcome which obviously if things escalate between the united states and china or between the united states and the european union that is very much going to be negative for growth so it s not just the final outcome but it s how we get there if we continue to have uncertainty and a back and forth and lack of resolution that hesitancy can potentially result in the fall of investment because people will just sit on their hands and wait until there s a conclusion they can plan around rer how do you see oil and gas and petrochemical dobre the critical price for oil seems to be around 50 if oil prices are below 50 i think we see an erosion in investment which will impact the rental industry obviously folks in texas in oklahoma in north dakota pennsylvania maybe are the ones that would be most impacted but really anything north of 50 in my mind should allow the industry to do well there will be volatility but you won t have what you had in 2015 rer how about construction residential and non residential dobre the way i m thinking about construction bucketing it in two areas residential and non residential residential is going to post very low growth if i were to forecast it right now i would say flat i think we re going to have a modest decline early in 2019 we ve already seen housing starts slow but we re going to start to see moderate growth in the back half of 2019 helped in part by lower interest rates on the non residential side i m a little more optimistic i see the private non residential component growing 3 to 4 percent and the public side potentially growing as much as 5 percent and when you look at what s really been growing on the public side we re actually seeing real good funding disbursement on the state level and even the federal government in the fiscal 2018 appropriations bill and that provided incremental funding for construction and that s coming through in a lot of transportation categories if you look at airport construction it has been tremendous and that s an area that s going to continue to grow and we really need it if you look at ports if you look at rail all these areas are seeing very good investment street and highway not so much this is a low growth area couple of percentage points probably at best it s really all these other transportation categories and on the private side we continue to see the institutional portion of the business grow nicely this is health care educational facilities universities schools things of that nature and also continued investment in warehousing that has been as you might be aware a big area of growth in great part because of e commerce and the growth of amazon and the like rer but you re saying if people understood the demographic changes they should invest more in housing dobre it s more of a longer term outlook and view i ve said this in prior interviews and i maintain the view for everyone who operates a rental business their first concern is maintaining a healthy balance sheet and making sure that they don t put themselves in a challenging position from a liquidity standpoint so you have to be mindful of the short term but when you re thinking about the long term i think you absolutely have to keep an eye on housing and some of your readers might be in the process of considering whether or not to acquire competitors and it s not just united rentals that is doing it others are as well if i was out there trying to invest i would be very keen on rental operators that have good exposure and good relationships with residential construction customers in good metropolitan areas not just cities but the larger suburbs are growing i think that s going to be a really good growth business over the next 10 years if you think of places like austin texas for example or dallas where you have a lot of growth in a broad metropolitan area even places on the east coast new york and such that to me will remain a very attractive good return business through the cycle rer any concerns about issues or events that could derail growth dobre well we already spoke about trade wars i m not sure anybody ever wins them and they are a real drag and there are two stages of them there is stage 2 which is the final conclusion and in terms of risk you can have really bad outcomes but there s also stage 1 which is where we re in right now which is we don t know what s happening we know that things are uncertain and as a result people might defer investment so that is a risk for the industry and unfortunately there is no expert or forecast and who knows because these things might change by tweet that s what makes life so difficult for folks in the financial industry to try to forecast these things rer are you optimistic about rental for 2019 what did you see in the survey of rental companies after the fourth quarter dobre trends are still good in rental but there are some signs of weaker momentum lots of equipment out there utilization eroded a bit pricing expected a little softer some participants calling for weaker construction later in the year the biggest deal from a forward outlook standpoint that we see and survey respondents do not yet is oil survey respondents react to actual changes in activity rig count changes and these are yet to come aerials and telehandlers are most at risk in my view cranes are second so if you have maybe slowing housing activity and then you get dealt this punch from oil and gas that could potentially impact things but we ll see it could prove to be temporary the good news is that oil jumped back up above 50 and i think that will help with sentiment but that s to be determined virtually all respondents expect continued construction market growth in 2019 55 percent expect solid growth 44 percent expect lower growth at this point only about 20 percent expect oil and gas to decline pipelines remain strong rer we know there are labor shortages will that shortage stimulate new technologies dobre new technologies will be there regardless of labor shortages and that s a real opportunity to improve the efficiencies of customers for rental companies and that is really the value proposition that a good rental operator would bring to the customer better asset utilization more efficient employees better profitability and the way you do that is through technology i believe that if we re really separating the winners from the losers over the next 10 years in the industry the winners are going to be companies that are able to employ the technology first and foremost in understanding their own asset utilization and asset deployment and there s a lot of investment that s happening in making sure that you have telematics and good ability to track and utilize the data that s generated from telematics so it s asset utilization and then the assets that you own those assets have to be technologically sound and have the ability to improve the end users performance and that s where there s an argument for an upgrade cycle that s where there s differentiation between the shop that has productive new equipment and the shop that operates older machines that simply don t have those advantages on labor shortages specifically everyone is seeing it and i mean it s acute in manufacturing because in many cases that labor is skilled labor and you need trained machinists you need welders there s a real competition for talent out there and there is no easy solution to it in the near term you re simply going to have to pay more for that talent and people are rer do you expect consolidation to continue in the rental industry dobre the short answer is yes i believe it will continue fluctuations in business and i m not talking about a downturn or a recession just fluctuation they only increase the drive for consolidation because you have operators maybe smaller operators who all of a sudden realize the cost pressures they have in their business and if you end up with two or three bad months even though it s temporary that might really get you to consider whether or not you should be selling your business and generate more efficiencies as part of a larger entity and group and the big public guys they remain very aggressive and i really don t expect that to abate the only thing that i think could bring this trend to a stop for a while would be either a recession or much higher cost of capital and i m really not seeing that coming

how do you win over a customer when your product is exactly similar in plenty and is going at the same price as that of your competitor mama wa quail does it by grabbing the hand of a woman walking towards an iron sheet shade at wangige market and tries to fend off other traders by claiming the customer saw her eggs first trays upon trays of eggs rise in columns among the women traders the customers that some few months ago would be trooping in droves to buy them have reduced drastically leaving a feeling of anxiety that borders on desperation among the traders i have some eggs that i bought on monday but they are yet to be bought said mama wa quail how she is commonly known at the market in kabete kiambu county when we visited her on thursday wangige is one of the largest eggs markets in kenya a tray of eggs was selling at sh200 over 20 per cent lower than it cost to buy 30 eggs six months ago a good number of farmers says mama wa quail have abandoned poultry farming altogether there are so many poultry farmers who have sold their chicken for meat egg sellers blame their woes on cheap imports from neighbouring uganda while we are hurting farmers in uganda are benefiting said the trader but what does she want the government to do we ask let them ugandans eat their eggs as we eat ours she replied but even after the traders poured into the streets calling on the government to stem the inflow of eggs the ministry of trade will not cave in instead the government has opted to uphold the tenets of free trade as articulated in the east african community s common market protocol trade principal secretary chris kiptoo says kenya is keen on staying true to the commitments it made to the world trade organisation wt0 and the east african community eac we re committed to promoting free trade within east africa so we can only stop goods that are coming to kenya if they violate the rules and regulations around safety he said recently in an interview with a local daily if we also find that there s an element of dumping meaning the cost of goods is higher than what they re selling at here then we have to come in he said insisting there was no evidence of that so far a lobby of poultry farmers added salt to injury by insisting that there was no proof of existence of imported eggs flooding the kenyan market although traders in wangige say the over supply which has lasted more than six months is unusual chairperson of the kenya poultry farmers association wairimu kariuki was reported by a local daily saying the price change has resulted from a glut as local production is currently up which is normally the trend in january balance shifted kenya s balance of trade with uganda has recently shifted in favour of the latter which mostly exports agricultural products to her neighbours according to data by kenya national bureau of statistics knbs imports from uganda rose 358 per cent from sh10 3 billion in 2011 to sh47 3 billion in 2011 however kenya s exports to uganda declined by 18 8 per cent to sh56 8 billion in 2018 from sh70 billion in 2011 once industrial novices kenya s neighbours can now also manufacture household goods such as cooking oil margarine cosmetics processed milk and sugar which used to be imported from kenya this has seen manufactured goods from kenya to her neighbours decline significantly a 2016 working paper by the world bank noted that china s foray into the region might have hurt kenya s exports into the four east african countries the paper deal or no deal strictly business for china in kenya it noted that kenya s exports to uganda and tanzania were falling chinese goods may have also hurt kenya s exports to its neighbours exports to tanzania and uganda are quite similar to china s compared to both countries exports to the united states or the uk read the report written by the world bank s lead economist for the russian federation apurva sanghi and dylan johnson consultant in the macroeconomics and fiscal management global practice in nairobi available figures do not show a remarkable jump in the quantity of imported eggs from kampala but the landing price in the last two years has at times been surprisingly low according to figures from knbs 100 000 kilogrammes of eggs were imported from uganda in december 2017 at a cost of sh1 5 million which translated to about sh1 for an egg in 2018 kenya imported 813 844 kilogrammes of fresh eggs from uganda in the year to november this was 11 per cent more compared to 730 834 kilogrammes imported in the same period in 2017 kenyan farmers insist that ugandans are flooding the local market with their cheaper eggs whose production has been subsidised by state interestingly media reports from uganda tell a different story an article by a ugandan local daily said the country s farmers were suffering losses from falling egg prices due to lost market opportunities in the region particularly kenya which consumes 60 per cent of the eggs produced in the country according to the article a tray of eggs was retailing at between ush6 000 sh163 8 and ush7 500 sh204 8 in january compared to between ush10 000 sh273 and ush12 000 sh327 7 in october 2018 approximately 60 per cent of the eggs produced in uganda are exported to kenya and now kenya is also producing eggs on a large scale said aga sekalala the executive director of ugachick a leading poultry breeder in uganda that leaves us with no market as demand is fixed that is why the egg prices had to be cut but things have not been any better for kenyan poultry breeders though consumers have rarely had it so good as retail prices of eggs free fall since august last year the price of eggs has dropped from sh260 to the sh200 a tray sending local farmers into major losses so much that some are quitting the trade this business used to be able to take our children to school but at this rate we cannot continue said a trader at wangige having failed to secure a market for their produce some have taken their grievance to social media hi guys so my dad is having a crisis at his farm in ngong due to reduced orders over the past few months we have a backlog of about 5 000 trays if you know anyone looking for clean high quality eggs kindly dm and retweet thanks in advance one monyakara tweeted on january 17 kenyan poultry breeders say their ugandan counterparts enjoy subsidies including lower input costs on feeds making their production costs significantly lower we could not verify these claims however some studies have shown that some government policies have also been detrimental to poultry farmers as far back as 2013 a study by tegemeo institute an agricultural policy think tank affiliated to egerton university found that a 16 per cent value added tax vat on poultry feed would increase the price of eggs indeed the new tax did contribute to increased cost of production with a tray of eggs retailing at sh262 this means at the current prices the farmers and traders are selling below cost of production on average a 50 kilogramme bag of layers mash retails at sh2 300 in kenya whereas in uganda the same size sells at about sh1 800 on the production side kenya also imports most of the feed manufacturing ingredients such as soya and sunflower from uganda and tanzania making them more expensive here than in the countries of origin but as eggs lacks differentiation they have crept in and mixed with the kenyan produce and iare now dictating the pricing early last year the government lifted a ban on poultry and poultry products from uganda bringing to a close a 15 month period when kenyan traders enjoyed an uncompetitive market the ban was imposed in january 2017 over an avian flu scare with only three ugandan firms hudani manji holdings sr afrochick and kukuchic being allowed to export their poultry products to kenya with the end of the embargo ugandan eggs just like chinese fish in kenya s leading fish market in kisumu are being sold right where most of kenya s eggs are produced wangige you cannot tell the difference there are many here who have the ugandan eggs they would not tell but we know said mama wa quail mama wa quail says that while a glut in the business is not uncommon the difference this time it has it lasted for several months with no end in sight unlike previous instances where the price corrected within a month east african community and regional development cabinet secretary adan mohamed says the farmers problem is not dissimilar from the government s he told weekend business that it is difficult to deal with the problem without strict enforcement of rules of origin at border points which has allowed the common external tariff to be abused mr adan said some products are imported into east african countries without duty then they are sneaked into the common market at a cheaper price distorting the market the eggs allegedly from south africa may come into eac through other countries without paying duty at the border how can we know which eggs have been hatched in uganda and which have been brought in how do you block he posed
macy s nyse m stock has gotten off to a rough start in 2019 due to the company reporting subpar holiday season sales results last month this forced macy s to reduce its full year earnings guidance dramatically and revived fears about the death of the department store among investors slowing economic growth the government shutdown and lower than expected tax refunds for many taxpayers have created additional headwinds for retailers like macy s in early 2019 on the other hand the stock market has bounced back and economists still expect healthy increases in consumer spending this year with all this in mind investors are sure to take a close look at macy s fourth quarter results due out on tuesday and especially its outlook for fiscal 2019 a disappointing end to a good year through the first three quarters of fiscal 2018 macy s posted a solid 2 7 comp sales increase adjusted earnings per share rocketed higher reaching 1 45 up from 0 93 in the first three quarters of fiscal 2017 some of that increase was driven by a lower tax rate the result of u s federal tax reform macy s faced a much tougher year over year comparison last quarter but as of november it still expected to end
