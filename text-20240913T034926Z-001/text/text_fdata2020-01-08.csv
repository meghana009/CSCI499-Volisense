investment risk is back with a vengeance iranian retaliation for the us killing of its military commander qassem suleimani has sent investors running for cover again just as they were starting to regain confidence following the initial drone killing geopolitical shocks like these may spook risk assets such as stock markets but everything does not crash at the same time rising tension also fuels demand for safe havens such as gold us bonds the japanese yen and swiss franc equities fell more than 10 per cent after the 9 11 terror attacks but within a month had regained their losses when the tension is in the middle east the oil price also spikes as investors rush to cash in on the surging price of crude so as well as threats there are opportunities few expect all out war right now with s p global ratings saying tension does not alter our base case assumption that any military action by either side will not lead to a fully fledged direct military confrontation so what should you be buying now oil brent crude jumped to more than 71 50 a barrel in early trading on wednesday after news of the iranian missile attacks broke before declining slightly however emirates nbd said other indicators are showing little sign of stress with the brent dubai exchange for futures and swaps little changed suggesting the underlying market fundamentals are as they were edward bell commodity analyst at emirates nbd says the us iran stand off makes for an intense start to 2020 but oil futures were already on the up rising in eight of the past nine weeks oil has been bolstered by optimism that the china us trade war would come to an end he said in a research note it is now receiving support from revived geopolitical risk as we saw after last year s drone attacks on saudi aramco oil processing facilities at abqaiq and khurais the impact on oil prices can be short lived unless markets foresee a serious threat to oil flows the big fear now is that either the us or iran raises the stakes with fresh retaliatory measures the oil price could head towards 100 and beyond if iran disrupts supplies flowing out of the gulf region or iraq either by blocking the strait of hormuz or cutting pipelines so should you rush to buy oil stocks george lagarias chief economist at mazars says the us is no longer a net importer of oil so is less sensitive to price spikes the market s knee jerk reaction to middle eastern tensions dates back to the 1970s when an oil embargo was largely blamed for a recession and runaway inflation today saudi arabia is best served by stable oil prices while iranian production has already been discounted due to us sanctions mr lagarias says loss of iraqi oil could put upward pressure on prices but saudis could balance that by turning on the taps in exchange for continued american pressure on arch enemy iran outlook as tensions ratchet upwards the oil price will surely follow yet in the long term fossil fuels will still remain under pressure amid climate change fears and the shift to renewables gold gold has been a store of value for thousands of years and true to form the precious metal hit a seven year high after the suleimani killing climbing 1 7 per cent to 1 579 60 an ounce by tuesday it had retreated to 1 570 22 but iran s missile attacks have sent it to a fresh high of 1 589 90 some 21 91 per cent higher than a year ago olivier konzeoue foreign exchange sales trader at saxo markets says the gold price was already climbing throughout the christmas holidays due to seasonal demand even before the rush to safety buying in the immediate aftermath of an attack can be risky though we expect gold to redeem some of its recent gains at the first signs of de escalation mr konzeoue adds ned naylor leyland manager of the merian gold silver fund for merian global investors says silver has been climbing as well but war talk is not the main driver the us federal reserve cut interest rates three times last year and markets anticipate further loose monetary and fiscal policy this year and this could do more to drive the gold and silver price higher than geopolitical risk gold does not pay any interest and is therefore more attractive when the rates on rival safe havens such as bonds and cash are near zero something else could make gold shine mr naylor leyland says institutional allocations are at their lowest relative to historic levels which means we are potentially on the cusp of an ongoing flood of liquidity gold is the zero risk instrument of choice for central banks the super rich and the asian public he adds 2020 could be the year the wider investment world returns to monetary ground zero in a major way vijay valecha chief investment officer at century financial says gold stocks are highly undervalued relative to gold gold miners have suffered a lacklustre few months and have plenty of room to mean revert higher he says negative eurozone interest rates and further rate cuts from the fed will help exchange traded fund vaneck vectors gold miners etf gdx is an ideal way to ride this trend outlook tension or no tension gold could shine this year as monetary policy loosens again gold benefits from the troubles in the middle east us government bonds us government bonds known as us treasuries are another renowned safe haven and prices rose both after the deadly drone strike and news of iranian retaliation bonds pay a fixed rate of interest so when prices rise yields fall and markus allenspach head of fixed income research at private bank julius baer says the renewed demand for safe assets cut the yield on a 10 year treasury from 1 94 per cent on wednesday last week to 1 78 per cent demand and bond prices then retreated with yields climbing to around 1 83 per cent only to fall on wednesday to nearly 1 7 per cent they have since rebounded to 1 79 per cent at time of writing expectations of further monetary and fiscal easing from the fed are also driving up bond prices and squeezing yields outlook bond prices could surge again following iran s retaliation to the us air strike a trader looks at a screen at the new york stock exchange the lesson from most geopolitical crises of the past is not to overreact reuters stocks after the initial shock global share prices were only going to go one way with uk european and asian stock markets all falling on monday tuesday was brighter though says fawad razaqzada technical analyst at global currency service forex com the downside has been limited by expectations that raised tensions will actually have minimal impact on global growth then came iranian retaliation with asian markets falling again and europe expected to follow rupert thompson chief investment officer at london wealth manager kingswood says 2019 was a stellar year for equity markets with global equities generating a total return of 27 per cent but do not expect a repeat returns are likely to be considerably lower this year as last year s gains were in part a rebound from the sharp sell off in late 2018 the lesson from most geopolitical crises of the past is not to overreact mr thompson says equities fell more than 10 per cent after the 9 11 terror attacks but within a month had regained their losses he says outlook expect a bumpy time for shares unless corporate earnings surprise by improving any short term correction could be a buying opportunity currencies traditional safe haven the japanese yen was the immediate beneficiary of the us drone attack and while the canadian dollar benefited from the rising oil price the us dollar fell mr bell says higher oil costs are bad news for india which relies heavily on imported energy and the rupee has come under pressure joshua mahony senior market analyst at online trading platform ig says the pound has enjoyed a sharp move higher off the back of a much better than expected uk services pmi data for december data improved after the election on december 12 suggesting services will enjoy a recovery as we move into 2020 there is a hope that the coming months will see traders focus more on the potential uk economic recovery outlook further middle east tension could revive the yen while the pound is still the one to watch cryptocurrencies bitcoin value is flying again after ending 2019 below 7 000 it has rapidly surged through the 8 000 barrier victor argonov analyst at financial broker exante says cryptocurrencies have several advantages over gold as a store of value they are easy to buy and sell can be freely traded across borders and their use as legal tender is increasingly common the big question is whether they can function as a protective asset retaining their value during crises they are volatile and prone to crashes which means your capital could halve in a month mr argonov says but as users grow volatility should decrease mr argonov says the only thing that can seriously undermine them is a complete ban by leading countries which seems unlikely every year more and more influential financial communities join the cryptocurrency market and they would not want to leave it outlook bitcoin is getting harder to dismiss it may have few practical uses but neither does gold
word war two as the death knell for colonial empires is a well trodden and essentially erroneous narrative empires relationships with their colonies were uprooted modified and given the gloss of independence but retained injustice and exploitation at their core in central africa neo colonialism is abundant in its forms this article will explore a particular system of neo imperial economic exploitation known as the cemac zone after world war two people throughout africa fought for national independence unable to quell the uprisings in their colonies france eventually accepted that the era of direct colonial stewardship had come to an end however reluctant to lose a fruitful source of labour and material president charles de gaulle sought to formulate a strategy that would benefit french military and business interests in africa throughout the modern era to achieve this france accepted independence but with certain conditions france would be allowed to station military units in their former colonies and would retain a monopoly on key industries france would also have control over her former colonies exports and imports finally all former colonies would continue to use the cfa franc franc of the french colonies of africa in the central african colonies this would be known as the central african cfa franc those countries comprising west africa would use the west african cfa franc since 1964 central african membership of this monetary union has taken place within the framework of the cemac the economic and monetary committee of central africa this article s focus is primarily on how this monetary committee problematizes economic development for its member states in particular it will draw on cameroon a useful case study for understanding exactly how colonial economic rule permeates all levels of society the cfa franc as a colonial weapon those countries comprising the cemac still use the cfa franc today this includes cameroon chad the central african republic equatorial guinea gabon and the republic of congo described by economist martial ze belinga as a predatory relationship it is a colonial economic system cloaked beneath a veil of co operation the cfa franc harms central african economies in two main ways firstly it denies these countries of their capacity for economic development and industrialisation secondly it eliminates the possibility of a sovereign monetary policy the cfa franc achieves these effects in two main ways firstly under the terms of the cemac african nations are obliged to place two thirds of their foreign exchange reserves in a special french treasury operating account foreign exchange reserves are a country s way of stockpiling foreign currency so that their own currency can remain competitive the benefits this incurs for france is clear by building up their foreign currency reserves paris is able to protect the value of the euro thereby ensuring that other countries remain accessible markets for french exports however this has a devastating impact on central african economies due to cemac stipulations two thirds of central african wealth sit in european banks this makes it very difficult for central african businesses to obtain the credit loans they need for further development every time they want to access their own money they must borrow it at crippling interest rates furthermore france holds a de facto veto on the boards of the two central banks within the cfa franc zone consequently central african nations can only invest in their own economy if france allows it france is a beneficiary of this economic stagnation without the industrial capacity to convert raw materials into valuable secondary commodities clothes televisions cars etc central african nations are forced to sell their primary products to france for desperately low prices france promotes this deeply unjust relationship another way by pegging the cfa to the euro this means that the conversion rate of euro to cfa is always kept within a certain range consequently the european central bank has de facto control of the cfa franc any economic policy devised in brussels will have a direct impact on the cfa the problem is that cemac nations have no representation in europe the people of central africa therefore find themselves at the mercy of european bureaucrats who devise monetary policy with no regard to central african interests the most notable example of this came in 1994 when the cfa franc was devalued overnight vital imports such as medication and sanitary products doubled leading to protests throughout the region moreover the competitiveness of cemac products is severely penalized exchange rates between the euro and cfa are structurally overvalued meaning that local producers pay an additional form of tax for the export of their products by pooling central african wealth and selling it back to them at extortionate rates france constrains the development of african enterprises thereby ensuring that it remains a fruitful producer of cheap raw materials for french business arguments in favour of the cfa franc in an article written for american express frances coppola a respected economic journalist comes out in favour of the cfa franc she summarizes that the nations of the cemac enjoy relative stability and low inflation economists also often claim that they benefit from close trade links with france unfortunately these claims are at best falsifications and at worst outright lies take for example the first statement countries in the cfa zone enjoy relative stability this initially seems like a fair statement according to the imf countries in the cemac tend to experience lower inflation rates than their non cemac neighbours in the last year no cemac member endured an annual inflation rate greater than 3 however a stable economy does not necessarily entail prosperity in fact the cemac region is a case study in how stagnation can be re packaged and marketed as stability by the logic of coppola low inflation is a self evidently positive thing if that was the case cameroonians who benefit from a low inflation rate of 2 1 should be experiencing far better standards of living than those living in sudan where the inflation rate is at 50 4 and has been above 10 since 2007 in reality according to the world bank in sudan 14 9 of people live beneath the poverty line while that figure is at 23 8 for cameroon this demonstrates that the stability of a currency is no guarantee of better living standards not only does cameroon s fantastically stable economy act as a fertile breeding ground for abject poverty but it also appears incapable of long term development in cameroon real per capita gdp is less than it was 40 years ago in fact during the last two decades the cemac s economic growth has been on average slower than that for the rest of sub saharan africa it s become increasingly unclear what exactly economic stability has achieved effects in cameroon i currently live in yaoundé the capital of cameroon i have therefore experienced the effects of this economic system first hand however for an expat like myself the impact is minimal for example buying a 700cfa 1 beer with even a 5000cfa 6 50 note is practically impossible because there simply isn t enough money in circulation to give out that much change an inconvenience but not a tragedy for the people of cameroon however the implications of the imperial stranglehold find themselves crudely etched into the lived reality of everyday life with such little domestic investment unemployment is rife the stated minimum wage in cameroon is 36 720cfa 47 per month but many people are forced to work for far less than that the work which is available tends to be extremely underpaid furthermore because cameroon is so reliant on agriculture much of the work is seasonal consequently countless families are forced to live by day hand to mouth for the majority vagrancy is the inescapable reality what does this inescapable reality look like well it looks like emaciated figures picking their way through seething piles of rubbish it looks likes skinny jaundiced young men huddled together in the darkness of derelict buildings it looks like children fetching water from malarial swamps when the shop next door sells it for 250cfa 35p per bottle we must be careful not to victimize these people too excessively cameroonians are breathtakingly industrious from the crack of dawn everyone from the twelve year old boy to the old woman is out on the streets hustling carrying and bartering there is an astonishing drive to better one s circumstances regardless of the adversity however one cannot help but feel that they re swimming against the tide why does it persist if cemac nations are so perilously aggrieved by this system why do they continue to participate in it the reasons pertinent to cameroon are the same throughout central africa for paul biya president of cameroon his support for this french dominated system hinges on two things his need for power and his fear of losing it let s first address the need for power the cameroonian government has long relied on french military assistance for legitimacy france provide the cameroonian army with both materiel and training and has done so since independence the vitality of french military assistance was evidenced when in 1984 they were instrumental in suppressing a coup against the cameroonian leadership although cameroon s military is relatively strong they rely on the french army as much as ever with ambazonian rebels in the west and al shabaab fighters in the north there is no shortage of threats to biya s position even as his reign enters its twilight years biya has proved that for him power is everything whether it means manipulating his nation s constitution sanctioning police atrocities or submitting his nation to a state of french economic vassalage he will do anything to remain in power french military assistance will only continue if the cemac system remains in place biya is thus unlikely to bite the hand that feeds lust for power isn t the only vice the french government seeks to exploit fear has proved an equally effective weapon france has a long and proud history of murdering leaders who don t toe the economic line in 1963 president of togo sylvanus olympio was assassinated after he had tried to set up a togolese currency in 1987 president of burkina faso thomas sankara met the same fate under similar circumstances the most recent victim of french power was laurent gbagbo president of ivory coast for years he had spoken out against the fallacy that was ivorian independence and after three decades of non violent struggle was elected president in 2000 france responded to this by bombing both the military barracks and the presidential palace for several days in april 2011 the french army station in abidjan launched a full scale assault against the ivorian army alassane ouattara was soon installed as france s puppet of choice france rules over central africa with the indignant insolence of a spoilt child but one which wields the power of an empire the leaders of central african nations know this all too well and behave appropriately in a toast to then president francois hollande biya reiterated the strong true friendship existing between france and cameroon in reality this is no declaration of affinity or co operation but rather the trembling utterances of a fearful subject conclusion recently macron said he was in favour of the gradual phasing out of the cfa franc suggesting that there is perhaps light at the end of this tunnel such declarations are however best taken with a substantial dose of salt macron is a master of the non concession concession recently to quell domestic unrest he said that he d give up his state pension of 600 per month bear in mind this man with an estimated net worth of 31 5 million the gesture is so hollow as to be almost laughable his talk of phasing out cfa franc is similarly vapid central africa is one of the world s most volatile regions consequently ruling regimes need french military assistance to exist and are thus willing to pay the crushing economic price macron knows this for the time being french colonial rule in central africa remains strong just as it has done for over one hundred years
budget 2020 will be presented in the shadow of one of the longest spells of slowdown six quarters so far in more than two decades that poses a host of challenges for finance minister nirmala sitharaman as slowing tax collections have left practically no leeway for fiscal stimulus out of the government s balance sheet on top of that exports have stagnated private investment has ground to a halt and consumption is still reeling under the effect of demonetisation gst lack of jobs and public sentiment just public expenditure seems to be driving the economy for now business today hosted a pre budget panel discussion to debate how to steady a wobbly economy the panelists were gopal krishna agarwal national spokesperson of bjp on economic affairs sumant sinha chairman and managing director renew power rahul garg senior partner tax and regulatory pwc india d k joshi chief economist crisil and dinesh kanabar founder and ceo dhruva advisors the discussion was moderated by rajeev dubey editor business today edited excerpts rajeev dubey how do you see the economy in 2020 we are in the middle of one of the longest spells of slowdown six quarters and counting sumant sinha the ongoing slowdown is partly cyclical and slightly structural several things have happened over the past one and a half years that hit economic growth but now when i look at metrics coming out my sense is that we are bottoming out in automobiles and power demand the rate of deceleration has decreased we ll see a pick up on the headline rate economic growth will be better in 2020 how much better only time will tell the government has taken several measures that are long term in nature it is not as concerned about short term results such as fiscal stimulus as it is to get the economy structurally back on track it will take time one key metric moving in the right direction is npas non performing assets it ll put more money in banks and with the decline in provisioning we will see more lending from banks this will have a big impact on the economy coupled with front loaded investment programmes the recent infrastructure announcement we should be looking at better economic growth going forward finally if global factors are supportive we ll see faster growth otherwise it will hover around 6 per cent gopal krishna agarwal challenges are always there in the economy the government handled legacy issues between 2014 and 2019 at present macroeconomic parameters are fine we are in a position to leap forward there are global issues too petroleum prices china us trade war for example the government is focussing more on domestic demand export oriented growth model may not work for us we have to preserve our domestic market the government has made structural reforms such as rera and gst we are moving fast on digital platforms also rupay bhim fastag i accept that there are some implementation challenges once these are tackled the economy will move ahead there are twin risks in the economy we have tackled the supply side of credit availability through bank reforms restructuring recapitalisation focus on repo rate but it is not sufficient there are risks from lenders point of view too the government is trying to meet consumer demand through infrastructure investment but investment zeal is required from the private sector too the economy cannot run on government investment alone borrowers and lenders both are risk averse we are working on decriminalising company law changing the insolvency and bankruptcy code ibc and bringing the frdi financial resolution and deposit insurance bill resolution mechanism on financial institutions negotiations on rcep regional comprehensive economic partnership and fta free trade agreements are going on the government is open to suggestions rahul garg economic indicators show that the growth is not as good as it could be for a country like india the growth rate may still be acceptable by some global standards but not by the standards that india aspires for its economy on a structural basis fundamental things have been done over the past six quarters so we shouldn t get impatient seeing a plant everyday doesn t make it grow any faster if you nurture it well it will become a strong tree a balance between long term and short term is needed the balance in the current regime is leaning towards long term there is a lag but with some supportive measures we should be able to create a strong base to catapult to the next level d k joshi let me point out three indicators which are turning a tad positive the pmi for manufacturing at 52 7 in december was the highest since july and the fact that food inflation has started rising itself is bad news from interest rate perspective but good for farmers the terms of trade for the farming community are becoming somewhat more favourable the third factor is that the pace of deceleration in auto sector and exports is slowing if you combine all these it gives a sense that things are somewhat improving but the picture on many other parameters remains hazy the pace of recovery in 2020 will be very weak i don t think it s going to test the levels of 7 per cent the trend rate of growth any time soon the financial sector is going through a clean up phase and the cost of that is slow growth we experienced that in the late 1990s and early 2000s the two key instruments for firing up the economy monetary and fiscal policies have little juice so there s little space for the government to spend its way out of the slowdown next year the monetary policy is not effective as transmission is weak and banks are not willing to lend the reason for that is weak sentiment and risk aversion unless these are sorted out a strong recovery is unlikely the 2019 20 gdp is expected to be around 5 1 per cent so the base is very weak that will give a statistical boost next year in the medium term there are three drivers that are emerging the corporate sector has deleveraged it will continue to do so and with the corporate tax rate cut whenever the cycle turns their ability to push investment would be better the second driver is the banking clean up the ability of the financial sector to lubricate the rest of the economy would improve and finally the reforms such as gst have not added to gdp so far once that is streamlined it can lead to efficiency led spurt in growth over the medium run dinesh kanabar there are two parts what the numbers such as gdp are talking about and the other is sentiment that is if the investment cycle is reviving recently i happened to converse with promoters of two large conglomerates who are in steel power coal etc they said they expect the next quarter to be better if there is definite improvement in sentiment i see hope while some companies are yet to take advantage of the corporate tax cut to 25 per cent they will soon move to the new regime it will release more funds besides the effective tax rate of 17 per cent for manufacturing companies is attractive enough for many us multinationals facing heat in china to move their manufacturing base to india through ibc a great platform cases such as essar and ruchi soya have put smiles on the faces of bank ceos dubey can we trigger growth through the four engines of the economy exports consumption private investment and public investment considering the first three are dysfunctional garg in exports the global economy will stay like this for some time but that does not mean that we cannot push exports further the reduction in the tax rate to 17 per cent hoping that american and other western companies would get attracted to do in india what they were doing in china is a good bet there can be state centre level coordination to create clusters that would not be short term it may be mid term and a good way of promoting exports because you have provided an economic playing field in the form of lower taxes if you are somehow able to offset the higher cost of doing business in india by clustering the place together you may be able to raise exports not necessarily those led by indian businesses but those led by investments in public investment we need to focus on where the multiplier is higher and keep the balance right be it agriculture tourism or construction but where are the funds for public investment relaxing frbm fiscal responsibility and budget management act could be considered in private investment what is the sentiment long term confidence is needed currently beyond the policies there are so many things on the ground where the confidence of business is shaken look at the recent announcement of the government on the corporatisation of ordnance factories the whole thing is such a mammoth exercise everybody in any industry can participate in the projects rolled out there is a good opportunity and market but the sentiment has to change so that people move into these with confidence india has a great consumption story having tackled many things from the supply side this budget will also look at things from the demand side you need to leave money with the people rather than with the government if ddt dividend distribution tax goes away you have 20 per cent more money with the people who are shareholders but private investment also depends on the rigour of implementation of the plans an area where india has great potential is to be a financial services or a services hub whether we are able to export the manufactured goods or not we can definitely export services we have the track record of it services we can do it for financial services and other services as well when the global services of a company are being rendered from india especially from the management side do those companies become liable to pay taxes in india making india a services hub for exports is a good bet we have an amazing number of programmes for start ups dubey are you suggesting a tax cut garg no not tax cut it is basically about leaving money in the hands of people change in tax slabs is one option at the time of paying tax a person should be able to exercise his option of making an investment in government bonds or paying taxes in indirect taxes we are not in a position to reduce the tax rate instead of multiple tax slabs look at combining some of them this month over april april december 2019 there has been an 11 per cent increase in numbers this is a great sign that even when tax collection has not increased the tax payer base for indirect taxes has increased some of this is partly fuelled by gst bringing in more transactions into the tax net agarwal on the export side we need to renegotiate many of the ftas they have definitely created certain problems for domestic industries small medium and large they have to be renegotiated we should look at the way chinese manufacturing is shifting so that our domestic industry can grow into the global and regional supply chain we have to develop clusters of industries which can integrate because now the industrial structure across the globe is more of a collection of various countries on public investment disinvestment has to be taken there is no alternative if you talk of air india the problem is not that it can go through ibc it has a debt of more than rs 50 000 crore the issue is who will take that cut if you remove debt from air india it has a full chance of being a viable running airline ibc is effective only if an entity is interested in running the business if ibc is seen as an instrument to recover money it will fail completely public investment will come through disinvestment and fiscal expansion on private investment company law needs immediate de criminalisation the company law committee has given its report with 46 recommendations the sentiment in the private sector is being hurt because white collar activities are being made into criminal activities the bond market is required because we don t have private capital only bank loans will not help the focus of the whole financial sector is only on equity markets globally financial markets have more vibrancy with bond markets private investment can come through a level playing field but land is an issue cost of land is too high in our projects 50 60 per cent of the cost is land joshi there are three sets of factors that are responsible for slowing exports one is the global environment which is becoming more inward looking and outside our control two we ve lost competitiveness three gst has also created hassles for exporters particularly because of the refund issue that hit hard because of the tight liquidity scenario part of it has got corrected but it needs to be streamlined further to be competitive you cannot have a closed mindset you will have to look at treaties like rcep that will allow you to be part of supply chains the fear from rcep is that it will flood us with imports that s because we lack competitiveness that needs to be addressed it s not something we can do in a day it requires reforms in land labour and many facilitations india ranks 163 in contract enforcement and that needs to be the focus of improving ease of doing business and promoting manufacturing and exports finally since the government has come out with such a large plan for infrastructure spending without the active role of private sector it will be very hard to deliver on that for the last four to five years the share of private sector in infrastructure has been sliding down that needs to be reversed by balancing the risk sharing mechanisms between government and private sector kanabar we don t need new initiatives what we need is implementing what s already on the table there is an issue with the bureaucracy there is more power with the bureaucracy than it has probably ever had in the past there is also reluctance on the part of bureaucracy to make decisions the 17 per cent tax rate for manufacturing companies is a great platform somehow as a nation we have understood that lowering the rate of tax is tax reform it s an important aspect but a tax reform is all about implementation and i still see a lot of gaps out there for example revenue officers are chasing targets in that process they make additions one of the reasons behind reluctance to make new investments is this inherent fear that everything we do is being challenged there is nobody to help in the process but everything is being questioned there was a committee set up for direct tax code how does one resolve tax disputes i will narrate a specific instance immediately after the corporate tax rate was lowered i met the global ceo and cfo of a fortune 500 company which has a huge manufacturing base in india i told the ceo that with reduction in rate of tax i was sure he would expand their manufacturing base in india he looked at the cfo with a smile and the cfo produced a paper with some 62 long standing tax litigations that they had if we are able to successfully implement this 17 per cent tax regime then people will use india for manufacturing the moment you do that you re creating employment capital investment and you re going to kick start the economy in the last budget we saw a 43 per cent rate of tax for corporates it was reduced to 17 but for individuals you ve gone all the way to 43 there is a particular point of time where people may start looking at ways and means of avoiding a higher rate of tax sinha one issue is of interest rates which is not in the hands of the government but of the rbi when we have inflation of 3 5 4 per cent we are supposed to have an accommodative interest rate policy yet our repo rate is 5 15 per cent why should we have a leverage of 2 per cent when we have a slowing economy if transmission is not happening then offer larger cuts we have had an interest rate reduction of only 1 35 per cent i can t understand that at this point we should have a repo rate of 2 3 per cent that will certainly drag down the cost of borrowing which is constraining both investment and consumption demand there has been a big improvement in corporate taxes there has to be further tinkering to revive consumption demand whether through higher fiscal deficit or some other way there has to be some sort of massive privatisation drive privatisation of a strategic nature takes time if you start something now it may be completed by the end of the fiscal the stock market is doing very well so we can also privatise through the stock market dubey taking cues from the past five and a half years of this government and the finance minister s recent moves what is likely to be the orientation of this budget agarwal some of the areas that are important with respect to the budget and which the finance minister will definitely focus on because everybody agrees that the government needs resources for the outreach and for the infrastructure investment focus include bond market reforms and debt management we don t have a vibrant debt market and the government needs it to supplement its own investment we have even been talking about fiscal expansion as a need of the current situation because of resource constraint reforms and disinvestment of psus is one major resource area which will see more focus whether it is air india bsnl or any other company the problem with private investment is seed capital requirement ibc and npa issues have deleveraged the corporate sector we need certain measures for capital formation in the private sector in sectoral initiatives first time on the party platform we have taken a big initiative to meet individual sectoral leaders and associations and we are compiling their requirements to find out the areas where policy decisions can be taken outside the budget some sunrise sectors such as pharma where india has a lot of potential are facing various issues which can be tackled by the government without facing any financial obligations even the automobile and real estate sectors can have sector specific reforms we have identified the sectors that we think have strong potential for growth we will compile those suggestions and send them to the finance minister and the government resource generation disinvestment bond market reforms debt management and fiscal expansion are also some of the issues that we are looking at along with some measures of private capital formation like reforms in the company law the government wants to bring changes to company law because we find there is a bottleneck in private capital formation the budget itself is not only about matching expenditure and revenue but is becoming more of a policy statement we will see a lot of new initiatives garg on the supply side there have been specific interventions on the demand side government spending would continue and perhaps get focused in areas where money is reaching the people everybody would get something because any class that gets something has a ripple effect on other classes as well a little bit of balancing will be required between rural economy versus agriculture versus investments which will be a higher multiplier for the economy as we know that not all infrastructure creates a similar multiplier effect so some attention has to be paid as to where the investment should go sinha i don t know if the fm has so much room in the budget the biggest action will be micro reforms across different sectors to make sure that the investment environment in those sectors improves those are the things that can be done and should be done outside of the budget the government is trying to do these but a lot more can be done in the power sector a lot can be done those dont require the budget but can unleash a large volume of new investments in the country in power and other sectors too like textiles tourism or automobiles the government needs to find a way of identifying issues and then making sure that those are resolved quickly and accurately in terms of fiscal deficit should the fm say look i m going to take 1 per cent extra this year as a deviation from the frbm and spend that the 1 per cent would be about 25 billion its not insignificant it can be used in multiple areas but it would have to be clearly articulated as being a one time exemption kanabar it is expected that over the next three months multiple committees will be set up specifically to focus on certain sectors steel cement power etc with participation from industry as well as bureaucrats who will take specific feedback it s a great initiative but we have to see how well we implement the strategy it is one thing for the finance minister to talk about projects worth rs 1 02 lakh crore being taken up for implementation but where are the resources to take those projects to a logical conclusion so rather than announcing a slew of new projects the government needs to focus on implementing many of the very good projects that have already been announced and taking them to fruition in taxation some very specific things can be done which will impact the economy and not be mere tinkering the first thing is long term capital gains for example if the ipo market were to revive you will see many companies accessing capital markets a few basic things need to be done to create the right environment for example there is a negative perspective among promoters looking at ipos because they don t get the grandfathering that other investors gets we have a very complex regime of long term capital gains we have multiple rates multiple years the finance minister has spoken at length about the need to do away with the ddt she said it was a regressive tax introduced by the predecessor government etc it should be looked at because it will give money back into the hands of corporates leave it to the recipient to pay tax to my mind this is a virtually revenue neutral measure but will ensure that money goes into investment joshi let me deglamourise the central budget a little bit what is going to happen outside of it is more important as the state governments spend more than the central government having said that there are some key areas that the budget can look into one is reviving demand which essentially means making pm kisan yojana more effective increasing the social safety net through mgnrega in rural areas and finally boosting the construction real estate activity which absorbs a lot of unskilled and semi skilled labour from the rural economy whether it is irrigation or housing or roads or rural infrastructure the kitty is limited so we need to create more revenue and in a slowing economy generating tax revenue is a tough job in the previous fiscal we did well in non tax revenue this fiscal we are lagging a focus on faster divestments will allow you to channelise the money towards these activities in the coming fiscal the budget can focus on some sort of a plan for de stressing the financial sector so that it can lubricate the economy it s going to be a very tough journey without de stressing the financial sector joe c mathew bt the budget is also about messaging what would you like to hear from the budget speech are more direct income transfer schemes possible garg the message in this budget is going to be about inviting businesses it will say look we are there with you please go ahead and play fully in this economy the key part of the messages would be to change the sentiment in the mind of private investment and private consumption and in terms of direct income transfers it will depend on if there is enough kitty available in my mind it is not there in terms of expanding the tax base the government already has very extensive programmes of using gst data and analytics it will take some time but you will have a much larger part of the economy formalised whether you recognise it or not the collection of direct tax is getting impacted by a larger formal economy coming in through the gst net sinha the messaging has to be very deep this government is very focused on economy it is their single biggest agenda point right now as the prime minister said in his red fort speech that wealth creation is not a bad thing it is essential for the country and the economy that wealth creators be celebrated rather than penalised agarwal i would say that hand holding is a message that the budget needs to convey that the government supports the private sector in every nook and corner the budget should also acknowledge some of the challenges in the economy instead of targeted tax collection the prime minister s focus on technological driven compliance is a message this budget can give i may not call fiscal expansion a reform but that is the need of the hour frdi should be a major reform at this point with labour reform the government may face resistance but it is needed kanabar one thing which worries me is the policy flip flop i was in singapore recently and was talking to the government there and the single largest negative was what happened in amravati andhra pradesh a total flip flop of policy we saw something similar in the bullet train project the maharashtra government is saying that it wants to take a relook at it so the message that the government needs to give out which will give confidence to foreign investors and revive investments is that there will be no flip flop on policy joshi i would agree that the passage of frdi bill is critical the issuers in the corporate bond market the financial institutions contribute almost 70 per cent of the subscription they also need a resolution process as far as the direct benefit transfer kind of schemes are concerned i would still prefer a targeted approach which is being done currently rather than a universal approach we are not ready for it as yet the third thing which we need to introspect on is what kind of fiscal targets we want to keep i have been hearing about 3 per cent of fiscal deficit of gdp for many years that target has only been met once in 25 years is it correct to keep chasing that maybe we need to rethink the fiscal deficit road map is proposed by the n k singh committee they are talking about looking at targeting overall debt levels if that is the case it should be something which is attainable dubey states would actually be spending more from hereon than the centre is spending how can resource generation and resource sharing be more synergetic agarwal the problem is coming from gst the higher commitment of 14 per cent growth every year should be linked to the economy or revenue growth across segments the issue is also about implementation of gst the whole cycle is getting out of the gst network therefore there is an issue of input tax credit a lot of demand on the credit side is coming where the audit trail is incomplete the industry demand is that if you delay the credit cycle there is a larger working capital requirement if the government goes for ad hoc credit allocation then the question will be who is ultimately responsible for the gap in the credit so the government needs to be more focused on establishing a complete audit trail the reconciliation of input tax credit cycle of credit and certain segments that want themselves out of the gst network is a challenge the efficiency of gst is based on everybody getting into the system then online credit allocation and other things can happen but the government has to focus more on gst network and that will support the transfer to states from the centre garg we shouldn t disturb the logic of the full chain being maintained to make life easier for those people whom we want to support let there be somebody on an outsourcing basis who does that joshi if you look at the revenue and the expenditure behaviour of the central government and the states the revenue position is bad for both for the state it s a double whammy as part of the taxes are shared if the central kitty reduces the share to states also comes down the central government has been maintaining its expenditure and has not cut capital expenditure according to october data but state governments have harder budget constraints they have cut capex and their revenue expenditure is sticky the slowdown has brought the centre state tax sharing issue to the front again the casualty is capital expenditure particularly at the state level and that accounts for the bulk of the capital expenditure from the government dubey what is a realistic fiscal deficit target joshi it is hard to say the government can always meet the target by cutting expenditure that is what happened in the last fiscal it can inch closer to 4 per cent for 2019 20 if the current expenditure momentum is maintained you can achieve the number or reduce the slippages by postponing expenditure or delaying payments or whatever there are various ways budgets have done that in the past maybe it is time now to look at how budgets are made bt_india

no not tax cut it is basically about leaving money in the hands of people change in tax slabs is one option at the time of paying tax a person should be able to exercise his option of making an investment in government bonds or paying taxes in indirect taxes we are not in a position to reduce the tax rate instead of multiple tax slabs look at combining some of them this month over april april december 2019 there has been an 11 per cent increase in numbers this is a great sign that even when tax collection has not increased the tax payer base for indirect taxes has increased some of this is partly fuelled by gst bringing in more transactions into the tax net agarwal on the export side we need to renegotiate many of the ftas they have definitely created certain problems for domestic industries small medium and large they have to be renegotiated we should look at the way chinese manufacturing is shifting so that our domestic industry can grow into the global and regional supply chain we have to develop clusters of industries which can integrate because now the industrial structure across the globe is more of a collection of various countries on public investment disinvestment has to be taken there is no alternative if you talk of air india the problem is not that it can go through ibc it has a debt of more than rs 50 000 crore the issue is who will take that cut if you remove debt from air india it has a full chance of being a viable running airline ibc is effective only if an entity is interested in running the business if ibc is seen as an instrument to recover money it will fail completely public investment will come through disinvestment and fiscal expansion on private investment company law needs immediate de criminalisation the company law committee has given its report with 46 recommendations the sentiment in the private sector is being hurt because white collar activities are being made into criminal activities the bond market is required because we don t have private capital only bank loans will not help the focus of the whole financial sector is only on equity markets globally financial markets have more vibrancy with bond markets private investment can come through a level playing field but land is an issue cost of land is too high in our projects 50 60 per cent of the cost is land joshi there are three sets of factors that are responsible for slowing exports one is the global environment which is becoming more inward looking and outside our control two we ve lost competitiveness three gst has also created hassles for exporters particularly because of the refund issue that hit hard because of the tight liquidity scenario part of it has got corrected but it needs to be streamlined further to be competitive you cannot have a closed mindset you will have to look at treaties like rcep that will allow you to be part of supply chains the fear from rcep is that it will flood us with imports that s because we lack competitiveness that needs to be addressed it s not something we can do in a day it requires reforms in land labour and many facilitations india ranks 163 in contract enforcement and that needs to be the focus of improving ease of doing business and promoting manufacturing and exports finally since the government has come out with such a large plan for infrastructure spending without the active role of private sector it will be very hard to deliver on that for the last four to five years the share of private sector in infrastructure has been sliding down that needs to be reversed by balancing the risk sharing mechanisms between government and private sector kanabar we don t need new initiatives what we need is implementing what s already on the table there is an issue with the bureaucracy there is more power with the bureaucracy than it has probably ever had in the past there is also reluctance on the part of bureaucracy to make decisions the 17 per cent tax rate for manufacturing companies is a great platform somehow as a nation we have understood that lowering the rate of tax is tax reform it s an important aspect but a tax reform is all about implementation and i still see a lot of gaps out there for example revenue officers are chasing targets in that process they make additions one of the reasons behind reluctance to make new investments is this inherent fear that everything we do is being challenged there is nobody to help in the process but everything is being questioned there was a committee set up for direct tax code how does one resolve tax disputes i will narrate a specific instance immediately after the corporate tax rate was lowered i met the global ceo and cfo of a fortune 500 company which has a huge manufacturing base in india i told the ceo that with reduction in rate of tax i was sure he would expand their manufacturing base in india he looked at the cfo with a smile and the cfo produced a paper with some 62 long standing tax litigations that they had if we are able to successfully implement this 17 per cent tax regime then people will use india for manufacturing the moment you do that you re creating employment capital investment and you re going to kick start the economy in the last budget we saw a 43 per cent rate of tax for corporates it was reduced to 17 but for individuals you ve gone all the way to 43 there is a particular point of time where people may start looking at ways and means of avoiding a higher rate of tax sinha one issue is of interest rates which is not in the hands of the government but of the rbi when we have inflation of 3 5 4 per cent we are supposed to have an accommodative interest rate policy yet our repo rate is 5 15 per cent why should we have a leverage of 2 per cent when we have a slowing economy if transmission is not happening then offer larger cuts we have had an interest rate reduction of only 1 35 per cent i can t understand that at this point we should have a repo rate of 2 3 per cent that will certainly drag down the cost of borrowing which is constraining both investment and consumption demand there has been a big improvement in corporate taxes there has to be further tinkering to revive consumption demand whether through higher fiscal deficit or some other way there has to be some sort of massive privatisation drive privatisation of a strategic nature takes time if you start something now it may be completed by the end of the fiscal the stock market is doing very well so we can also privatise through the stock market dubey taking cues from the past five and a half years of this government and the finance minister s recent moves what is likely to be the orientation of this budget agarwal some of the areas that are important with respect to the budget and which the finance minister will definitely focus on because everybody agrees that the government needs resources for the outreach and for the infrastructure investment focus include bond market reforms and debt management we don t have a vibrant debt market and the government needs it to supplement its own investment we have even been talking about fiscal expansion as a need of the current situation because of resource constraint reforms and disinvestment of psus is one major resource area which will see more focus whether it is air india bsnl or any other company the problem with private investment is seed capital requirement ibc and npa issues have deleveraged the corporate sector we need certain measures for capital formation in the private sector in sectoral initiatives first time on the party platform we have taken a big initiative to meet individual sectoral leaders and associations and we are compiling their requirements to find out the areas where policy decisions can be taken outside the budget some sunrise sectors such as pharma where india has a lot of potential are facing various issues which can be tackled by the government without facing any financial obligations even the automobile and real estate sectors can have sector specific reforms we have identified the sectors that we think have strong potential for growth we will compile those suggestions and send them to the finance minister and the government resource generation disinvestment bond market reforms debt management and fiscal expansion are also some of the issues that we are looking at along with some measures of private capital formation like reforms in the company law the government wants to bring changes to company law because we find there is a bottleneck in private capital formation the budget itself is not only about matching expenditure and revenue but is becoming more of a policy statement we will see a lot of new initiatives garg on the supply side there have been specific interventions on the demand side government spending would continue and perhaps get focused in areas where money is reaching the people everybody would get something because any class that gets something has a ripple effect on other classes as well a little bit of balancing will be required between rural economy versus agriculture versus investments which will be a higher multiplier for the economy as we know that not all infrastructure creates a similar multiplier effect so some attention has to be paid as to where the investment should go sinha i don t know if the fm has so much room in the budget the biggest action will be micro reforms across different sectors to make sure that the investment environment in those sectors improves those are the things that can be done and should be done outside of the budget the government is trying to do these but a lot more can be done in the power sector a lot can be done those dont require the budget but can unleash a large volume of new investments in the country in power and other sectors too like textiles tourism or automobiles the government needs to find a way of identifying issues and then making sure that those are resolved quickly and accurately in terms of fiscal deficit should the fm say look i m going to take 1 per cent extra this year as a deviation from the frbm and spend that the 1 per cent would be about 25 billion its not insignificant it can be used in multiple areas but it would have to be clearly articulated as being a one time exemption kanabar it is expected that over the next three months multiple committees will be set up specifically to focus on certain sectors steel cement power etc with participation from industry as well as bureaucrats who will take specific feedback it s a great initiative but we have to see how well we implement the strategy it is one thing for the finance minister to talk about projects worth rs 1 02 lakh crore being taken up for implementation but where are the resources to take those projects to a logical conclusion so rather than announcing a slew of new projects the government needs to focus on implementing many of the very good projects that have already been announced and taking them to fruition in taxation some very specific things can be done which will impact the economy and not be mere tinkering the first thing is long term capital gains for example if the ipo market were to revive you will see many companies accessing capital markets a few basic things need to be done to create the right environment for example there is a negative perspective among promoters looking at ipos because they don t get the grandfathering that other investors gets we have a very complex regime of long term capital gains we have multiple rates multiple years the finance minister has spoken at length about the need to do away with the ddt she said it was a regressive tax introduced by the predecessor government etc it should be looked at because it will give money back into the hands of corporates leave it to the recipient to pay tax to my mind this is a virtually revenue neutral measure but will ensure that money goes into investment joshi let me deglamourise the central budget a little bit what is going to happen outside of it is more important as the state governments spend more than the central government having said that there are some key areas that the budget can look into one is reviving demand which essentially means making pm kisan yojana more effective increasing the social safety net through mgnrega in rural areas and finally boosting the construction real estate activity which absorbs a lot of unskilled and semi skilled labour from the rural economy whether it is irrigation or housing or roads or rural infrastructure the kitty is limited so we need to create more revenue and in a slowing economy generating tax revenue is a tough job in the previous fiscal we did well in non tax revenue this fiscal we are lagging a focus on faster divestments will allow you to channelise the money towards these activities in the coming fiscal the budget can focus on some sort of a plan for de stressing the financial sector so that it can lubricate the economy it s going to be a very tough journey without de stressing the financial sector joe c mathew bt the budget is also about messaging what would you like to hear from the budget speech are more direct income transfer schemes possible garg the message in this budget is going to be about inviting businesses it will say look we are there with you please go ahead and play fully in this economy the key part of the messages would be to change the sentiment in the mind of private investment and private consumption and in terms of direct income transfers it will depend on if there is enough kitty available in my mind it is not there in terms of expanding the tax base the government already has very extensive programmes of using gst data and analytics it will take some time but you will have a much larger part of the economy formalised whether you recognise it or not the collection of direct tax is getting impacted by a larger formal economy coming in through the gst net sinha the messaging has to be very deep this government is very focused on economy it is their single biggest agenda point right now as the prime minister said in his red fort speech that wealth creation is not a bad thing it is essential for the country and the economy that wealth creators be celebrated rather than penalised agarwal i would say that hand holding is a message that the budget needs to convey that the government supports the private sector in every nook and corner the budget should also acknowledge some of the challenges in the economy instead of targeted tax collection the prime minister s focus on technological driven compliance is a message this budget can give i may not call fiscal expansion a reform but that is the need of the hour frdi should be a major reform at this point with labour reform the government may face resistance but it is needed kanabar one thing which worries me is the policy flip flop i was in singapore recently and was talking to the government there and the single largest negative was what happened in amravati andhra pradesh a total flip flop of policy we saw something similar in the bullet train project the maharashtra government is saying that it wants to take a relook at it so the message that the government needs to give out which will give confidence to foreign investors and revive investments is that there will be no flip flop on policy joshi i would agree that the passage of frdi bill is critical the issuers in the corporate bond market the financial institutions contribute almost 70 per cent of the subscription they also need a resolution process as far as the direct benefit transfer kind of schemes are concerned i would still prefer a targeted approach which is being done currently rather than a universal approach we are not ready for it as yet the third thing which we need to introspect on is what kind of fiscal targets we want to keep i have been hearing about 3 per cent of fiscal deficit of gdp for many years that target has only been met once in 25 years is it correct to keep chasing that maybe we need to rethink the fiscal deficit road map is proposed by the n k singh committee they are talking about looking at targeting overall debt levels if that is the case it should be something which is attainable dubey states would actually be spending more from hereon than the centre is spending how can resource generation and resource sharing be more synergetic agarwal the problem is coming from gst the higher commitment of 14 per cent growth every year should be linked to the economy or revenue growth across segments the issue is also about implementation of gst the whole cycle is getting out of the gst network therefore there is an issue of input tax credit a lot of demand on the credit side is coming where the audit trail is incomplete the industry demand is that if you delay the credit cycle there is a larger working capital requirement if the government goes for ad hoc credit allocation then the question will be who is ultimately responsible for the gap in the credit so the government needs to be more focused on establishing a complete audit trail the reconciliation of input tax credit cycle of credit and certain segments that want themselves out of the gst network is a challenge the efficiency of gst is based on everybody getting into the system then online credit allocation and other things can happen but the government has to focus more on gst network and that will support the transfer to states from the centre garg we shouldn t disturb the logic of the full chain being maintained to make life easier for those people whom we want to support let there be somebody on an outsourcing basis who does that joshi if you look at the revenue and the expenditure behaviour of the central government and the states the revenue position is bad for both for the state it s a double whammy as part of the taxes are shared if the central kitty reduces the share to states also comes down the central government has been maintaining its expenditure and has not cut capital expenditure according to october data but state governments have harder budget constraints they have cut capex and their revenue expenditure is sticky the slowdown has brought the centre state tax sharing issue to the front again the casualty is capital expenditure particularly at the state level and that accounts for the bulk of the capital expenditure from the government dubey what is a realistic fiscal deficit target joshi it is hard to say the government can always meet the target by cutting expenditure that is what happened in the last fiscal it can inch closer to 4 per cent for 2019 20 if the current expenditure momentum is maintained you can achieve the number or reduce the slippages by postponing expenditure or delaying payments or whatever there are various ways budgets have done that in the past maybe it is time now to look at how budgets are made bt_india
illustration luo xuan gt a prolonged bitter trade war between china and the us sent the yuan on a roller coaster ride in 2019 markets are now breathing a sigh of relief as the chinese currency had a stable finish in 2019 and continues to gain momentum in 2020 it rallied past the key threshold of 7 to the dollar last week and stood on solid ground in the first two trading days of the new year china s central bank set the yuan s midpoint rate at 6 9450 per dollar on wednesday its highest fix since august 5 when the yuan broke through the psychologically important mark of 7 to the greenback market observers attributed the yuan s stellar rise to bullish market sentiment boosted by positive signs from both china and the us indicating the imminent conclusion of a phase one trade deal which was announced by beijing and washington in december admittedly signs that the interim trade pact is on track to be hammered out have buoyed market confidence but with or without a trade deal one thing is for sure the yuan is poised to become a strong global currency in the medium term and the long term given china s resolve to promote a strong currency backed by solid economic fundamentals and the integration of its financial markets with the global market the yuan could become a prominent global reserve currency on par with the euro and the us dollar much quicker than most observers believe possible china s economy continues to grow at a speed triple that of the us and china s technological innovations are rapidly catching up to international peers china is highly motivated to pursue a stronger yuan as it continues to open its domestic financial markets to foreign capital and as chinese firms are expanding their footprints globally therefore it makes sense for china to promote its own yuan denominated assets as potential alternatives to dollar denominated ones indeed the yuan experienced some drama last year in august a sharp escalation of the bruising china us trade war sank the yuan under the key 7 per dollar level for the first time since the 2008 09 global financial crisis immediately following the currency s plunge the us treasury labeled china a currency manipulator the drama fanned a false narrative that china deliberately embraced a weaker yuan to cope with the trade war contrary to the us declaration the drop was a normal market reaction to the escalating trade tensions it was in china s best interests to stabilize the yuan preventing capital outflows and stabilizing the forex market as china continues to pivot its economy away from a reliance on exports its currency policy is no longer designed to boost exports instead its currency is increasingly driven by onshore and offshore market performances key factors that impact capital flows into china a country with strong capital account oversight include economic fundamentals interest rate spreads between china and other major economies the maturity of its capital market and the cost of cross border forex transactions calculating these factors it is easy to conclude that the yuan has huge potential to become a strong currency china s economic fundamentals will remain intact even if its growth shifts to a lower gear mainstream economists and institutions estimate china s annual gdp growth will be between 5 and 6 percent in the next five years even a 5 6 percent growth rate would be the envy of other major economies and would be sufficient to keep the yuan stable the same logic applies to interest rate spreads considering many major economies negative interest rates and below 2 percent annual growth the yield of yuan denominated assets stands out and thus its yield spread with assets denominated by other currencies a slew of structural reform measures to open china s financial and banking sectors to foreign investors has boosted market confidence and signaled the yuan s growing strength in september china scrapped quotas for the dollar denominated qualified foreign institutional investor qfii scheme and its yuan denominated sibling rqfii allowing overseas investors unfettered access to china s stock and bond markets it removed ownership limits for futures companies from january 1 limits on the foreign ownership of mutual fund management will be scrapped on april 1 of this year and similar limits for securities companies on december 1 further financial deregulation and opening measures are also in the pipeline as china continues to optimize its market structures a growing number of global index compilers including the ftse russell the bloomberg barclays us aggregate bond index and the msci have added chinese stocks and bonds to their benchmarks as yuan denominated assets are increasingly traded in global markets they will drive up the demand for the currency and its value will rise such a trend parallels a global de dollarization move the dollar s international standing has been undermined by the trade war the us launched against its trade partners and the sanctions it willfully imposes on others who do not yield to its bullying policies many countries have been prompted to double their efforts to create an alternative to the dollar for trade settlements and transfers the yuan is an ideal currency for diversification away from the dollar in may japan china south korea and asean members agreed to add the yuan and the japanese yen to their multilateral currency swap arrangement to reduce reliance on the dollar the share of global foreign reserves held in yuan has continued to rise hitting a record high of 2 01 percent equivalent to 219 6 billion at the end of september 2019 that is not to say that the yuan will replace the dollar as the world s dominant currency in the immediate future but as long as china keeps its financial reforms on track and continues to ease capital controls and remove barriers on foreign investment the pace of the yuan s liberalization and internationalization will increase there is no doubt that china s yuan will become a strong global currency the author is an editor with the global times bizopinion globaltimes com cn

its ability to rise relative to other major currencies and it s doing just that historically adds atlas pulse s charlie morris in a recent in depth report on gold s prospects for 2020 it has proved to be important that gold rises in all currencies and not just in us dollars this simple test ensures we don t mistake dollar bear markets for gold bull markets since 2000 the world s best currencies have been the swiss franc and the thai baht and gold recently broke higher in both that implies that gold is rising everywhere mark mobius mobius capital partners explains in a newsmax interview why he thinks investors should allocate at least 10 of their portfolios to gold the reason is that gold maintains its status as a currency a currency that has stood the test of time there is a growing realization that the supply of fiat money is growing at a rapid pace not only because of central bank activities to drive down interest rates by printing more money but also because of the rapid and inexorable rise of cryptocurrencies they are beginning to realize that fiat currencies like the u s dollar and euro really do not have anything behind them except the faith of the public and that to sum it up explains why gold has performed so admirably over the past year against the world s top currencies gold in various world currencies 2019 chart courtesy of tradingview com the djia

exuberance speculative enthusiasm and fear of missing out fomo we ve observed among investors in recent weeks and indeed in the past two years the fact is that a pullback of just 11 in the s p 500

that they go mad in herds while they only recover their senses slowly one by one at present we are experiencing a modern day version of that process at usagold we do not have a rush to buy gold and silver at the moment instead we are experiencing a steady stream of new and old clientele purchasing to hedge the extremes to which john hussman alludes above they are returning to gold one by one not

2013 nearly 7 years ago now gold has broken resistance near 1375 and is technically in a full fledged bull market the importance of this is the 7 year cycle and how the rotation in gold between the high near 1923 and the low near 1045 represent an 878 price range the upside expansion rally in gold may very well move in expanding fibonacci price structures just like it did in 2005 through 2012 if this is the case then we may expect to see an ultimate peak price in gold well above 3500 note we post this year s predictions survey with our usual caveat that what you have just read is opinion

cc by sa 3 0 www dragonoil com to support u s control of near eastern oil as a buttress of the u s dollar the balance of payments dimension in fact u s foreign military spending helped finance the domestic u s federal budget deficit the oil industry as buttress of the u s balance of payments and foreign diplomacy how a democratic nation can wage international war and terrorism iran s role as u s nemesis the counter strategy to u s oil and dollar and global warming diplomacy the mainstream media are carefully sidestepping the method behind america s seeming madness in assassinating islamic revolutionary guard general qassim suleimani to start the new year the logic behind the assassination was a long standing application of u s global policy not just a personality quirk of donald trump s impulsive action that remains the key to understanding this policy and why it is in the process of escalating not dying down i sat in on discussions of this policy as it was formulated nearly fifty years ago when i worked at the hudson institute and attended meetings at the white house met with generals at various armed forces think tanks and with diplomats at the united nations my role was as a balance of payments economist having specialized for a decade at chase manhattan arthur andersen and oil companies in the oil industry and military spending these were two of the three main dynamic of american foreign policy and diplomacy the third concern was how to wage war in a democracy where voters rejected the draft in the wake of the vietnam war the media and public discussion have diverted attention from this strategy by floundering speculation that president trump did it except to counter the non threat of impeachment with a wag the dog attack or to back israeli lebensraum drives or simply to surrender the white house to neocon hate iran syndrome the actual context for the neocon s action was the balance of payments and the role of oil and energy as a long term lever of american diplomacy the major deficit in the u s balance of payments has long been military spending abroad the entire payments deficit the effect of u s foreign military spending thus did not undercut the dollar s exchange rate and did not even force the treasury and federal reserve to raise interest rates to attract foreign exchange to offset the dollar outflows on military account to top matters of course what saudi arabia does not save in dollarized assets with its oil export earnings is spent on buying hundreds of billion of dollars of u s arms exports this locks them into dependence on u s supply o replacement parts and repairs and enables the united states to turn off saudi military hardware at any point of time in the event that the saudis may try to act independently of u s foreign policy so maintaining the dollar as the world s reserve currency became a mainstay of u s military spending foreign countries to not have to pay the pentagon directly for this spending they simply finance the u s treasury and u s banking system hillary and obama invaded grabbed their gold supplies we still have no idea who ended up with these billions of dollars worth of gold and destroyed libya s government its public education system its public infrastructure and other non neoliberal policies the great threat to this is dedollarization as china russia and other countries seek to avoid recycling dollars without the dollar s function as the vehicle for world saving in effect that is the same strategy that the u s has followed in syria and iraq iran was threatening this dollarization strategy and its buttress in u s oil diplomacy the trade balance is buttressed by oil and farm surpluses and as noted above opec countries have been told to keep their official reserves in the form of u s securities stocks and bonds as well as treasury ious but not direct purchase of u s companies being deemed economically important financially opec countries are client slates of the dollar area america s attempt to maintain this buttress explains u s opposition to any foreign governments steps to reverse global warming and the extreme weather caused by the world s u s sponsored dependence on oil any such moves by europe and other countries would reduce dependence on u s oil sales and hence on u s ability to control the global oil spigot as a means of control and coercion are viewed as hostile acts other countries can benefit in the way that saudi arabia has done by sending their surpluses to the u s economy but not to support their own economic growth and diplomacy control of oil thus implies support for continued global warming as an inherent part of u s strategy the corollary of this perception is that democracies have only two choices when it comes to military strategy willing to sabotage bomb assassinate blow up and otherwise fight any target designated as an enemy of islam the euphemism for saudi arabia acting as u s client state the united states needs the saudis to supply or finance wahabi crazies so in addition to playing a key role in the u s balance of payments by recycling its oil export earnings are into u s stocks bonds and other investments saudi arabia provides manpower by supporting the wahabi members of america s foreign legion isis and al nusra al qaeda terrorism has become the democratic mode of today u s military policy what makes america s oil war in the near east democratic is that this is the only kind of war a democracy can fight an air war followed by a vicious terrorist army that makes up for the fact that no democracy can field its own army in today s world the corollary is that terrorism has become the democratic mode of warfare from the u s vantage point what is a democracy in today s orwellian vocabulary it means any country supporting u s foreign policy bolivia and honduras have become democracies since their coups along with brazil chile under pinochet was a chicago style free market democracy so was iran under the shah and russia under yeltsin but not since it elected vladimir putin president any more than is china under president xi the antonym to democracy is terrorist that simply means a nation willing to fight to become independent from u s neoliberal democracy it does not include america s proxy armies what stands in the way of u s dollarization oil and military strategy obviously russia and china have been targeted as long term strategic enemies for seeking their own independent economic policies and diplomacy but next to them america s hatred of iran starts with its attempt to control its own oil production exports and earnings it goes back to 1953 when mossadegh was overthrown because he wanted domestic sovereignty over anglo persian oil the cia mi6 coup replaced him with the pliant shah who imposed a police state to prevent iranian independence from u s policy the united states came to terms with opec oil independence by 1974 but the antagonism toward iran extends to demographic and religious considerations america opposed general suleimani above all because he was fighting against isis and other u s backed terrorists in their attempt to break up syria and replace assad s regime with a set of u s compliant local leaders the old british divide and conquer ploy on occasion suleimani had cooperated with u s troops in fighting isis groups that got out of line meaning the u s party line but every indication is that he was in iraq to work with that government seeking to regain control of the oil fields that president trump has bragged so loudly about grabbing already in early 2018 president trump asked iraq to reimburse america for the cost of saving its democracy by bombing the remainder of saddam s economy the reimbursement was to take the form of iraqi oil more recently in 2019 president trump asked why not simply grab iraqi oil the giant oil field has become the prize of the bush cheney post 9 11 oil war it was a very run of the mill low key meeting in general a source who was in the room told axios and then right at the end trump says something to the effect of he gets a little smirk on his face and he says so what are we going to do about the oil trump s idea that america should get something out of its military expenditure in destroying the iraqi and syrian economies simply reflects u s policy in late october 2019 the new york times reported that in recent days mr trump has settled on syria s oil reserves as a new rationale for appearing to reverse course and deploy hundreds of additional troops to the war ravaged country he has declared that the united states has secured oil fields in the country s chaotic northeast and suggested that the seizure of the country s main natural resource justifies america further extending its military presence there we have taken it and secured it mr trump said of syria s oil during remarks at the white house on sunday after announcing the killing of the islamic state leader abu bakr al baghdadi a cia official reminded the journalist that taking iraq s oil was a trump campaign pledge that explains the invasion of iraq for oil in 2003 and again this year as president trump has said why don t we simply take their oil it also explains the obama hillary attack on libya not only for its oil but for its investing its foreign reserves in gold instead of recycling its oil surplus revenue to the u s treasury and of course for promoting a secular socialist state it explains whyand withstand the terrorist attacks supported by u s and saudi s on iraq that is what made his assassination an immediate drive american politicians have discredited themselves by starting off their condemnation of trump by saying as elizabeth warren did how bad a person suleimani was how he had killed u s troops by masterminding the iraqi defense of roadside bombing and other policies trying to repel the u s invasion to grab its oil she was simply parroting the u s media s depiction of suleimani as a monster this strategy will continue until foreign countries reject it if europe and other regions fail to do so they will suffer the consequences of this u s strategy in the form of a rising u s sponsored war via terrorism the flow of refugees and accelerated global warming and extreme weather russia china and its allies already have been leading the way to dedollarization as a means to contain the balance of payments buttress of u s global military policy but everyone now is speculating over what iran s response should be the pretense or more accurately the diversion by the u s news media over the weekend has been to depict the united states as being under imminent attack mayor de blasio has positioned policemen at conspicuous key intersections to let us know how imminent iranian terrorism is as if it were iran not saudi arabia that mounted 9 11 and as if iran in fact has taken any forceful action against the united states the media and talking heads on television have saturated the air waves with warnings of islamic terrorism television anchors are suggesting just where the attacks are most likely to occur the message is that the assassination of general soleimani was to protect us as donald trump and various military spokesmen have said he had killed americans and now they must be planning an enormous attack that will injure and kill many more innocent americans that stance has becomebut what is iran s actual interest if it is indeed to undercut u s dollar and oil strategy the first policy must be to get u s military forces out of the near east including u s occupation of its oil fields it turns out that president trump s rash act has acted as a catalyst bringing about just the opposite of what he wanted on january 5 the iraqi parliament met to insist that the united states leave general suleimani was an invited guest not an iranian invader it is u s troops that are in iraq in violation of international law beyond iraq looms saudi arabia it has become the great satan the supporter of wahabi extremism the terrorist legion of u s mercenary armies fighting to maintain control of near eastern oil and foreign exchange reserves the cause of the great exodus of refugees to turkey europe and wherever else it can flee from the arms and money provided by the u s backers of isis al qaeda in iraq and their allied saudi wahabi legions the logical ideal in principle would be to destroy saudi power that power lies in its oil fields they already have fallen under attack by modest yemeni bombs if u s neocons seriously threaten iran its response would be the wholesale bombing and destruction of saudi oil fields along with those of kuwait and allied near eastern oil sheikhdoms it would end the saudi support for wahabi terrorists as well as for the u s dollar such an act no doubt would be coordinated with a call for the palestinian and other foreign workers in saudi arabia to rise up and drive out the monarchy and its thousands of family retainers beyond saudi arabia iran and other advocates of a multilateral diplomatic break with u s neoliberal and neocon unilateralism should bring pressure on europe to withdraw from nato inasmuch as that organization functions mainly as a u s centric military tool of american dollar and oil diplomacy and hence opposing the climate change and military confrontation policies that threaten to make europe part of the u s maelstrom finally what can u s anti war opponents do to resist the neocon attempt to destroy any part of the world that resists u s neoliberal autocracy this has been the most disappointing response over the weekend they are flailing it has not been helpful for warren buttigieg and others to accuse trump of acting rashly without thinking through the consequences of his actions that approach shies away from recognizing that his action did indeed have a rationale to draw a line in the sand to say that yes america will go to war will fight iran will do anything at all to defend its control of near eastern oil and to dictate opec central bank policy to defend its isis legions as if any opposition to this policy is an attack on the united states itself i can understand the emotional response or yet new calls for impeachment of donald trump but that is an obvious non starter partly because it has been so obviously a partisan move by the democratic party more important is the false and self serving accusation that president trump has overstepped his constitutional limit by committing an act of war against iran by assassinating soleimani congress endorsed trump s assassination and is fully as guilty as he is for having approved the pentagon s budget with the senate s removal of the amendment to the 2019 national defense authorization act that bernie sanders tom udall and ro khanna inserted an amendment in the house of representatives version explicitly not authorizing the pentagon to wage war against iran or assassinate its officials when this budget was sent to the senate the white house and pentagon a k a the military industrial complex and neoconservatives removed that constraint that was a red flag announcing that the pentagon and white house did indeed intend to wage war against iran and or assassinate its officials congress lacked the courage to argue this point at the forefront of public discussion behind all this is the saudi inspired 9 11 act taking away congress s sole power to wage war its 2002 authorization for use of military force pulled out of the drawer ostensibly against al qaeda but actually the first step in america s long support of the very group that was responsible for 9 11 the saudi airplane hijackers the question is how to get the world s politicians u s european and asians to see how america s all or nothing policy is threatening new waves of war refugees disruption of the oil trade in the strait of hormuz and ultimately global warming and neoliberal dollarization imposed on all countries notes the article adds in the march meeting the iraqi prime minister replied what do you mean according to the source in the room and trump s like well we did a lot we did a lot over there we spent trillions over there and a lot of people have been talking about the oil michael crowly keep the oil trump revives charged slogan for new syria troop mission the new york times october 26 2019 the article adds i said keep the oil mr trump recounted if they are going into iraq keep the oil they never did they never did

five financial bubbles are looming and may burst in 2020 each one may have a different impact on the us dollar the direction of travel depends on the magnitude the highest market volatility happens when bubbles burst but which one will it be the froth in the housing market that led to the great recession is unlikely to return but five other bubbles loom over financial markets the reaction in the us dollar depends on the size of each market and the magnitude of the burst generally the deflating of a smaller domestic bubble may weigh on the us economy and weaken the dollar the federal reserve may cut interest rates to ease the local pain which is unlikely to leave american shores however when a more significant sector of the economy at home or abroad begins collapsing the greenback may rise amid safe haven flows it is essential to remember that the japanese yen tends to outperform the buck in times of trouble but the dollar has ample room to beat other currencies such as euro pound or commodity currencies here are the five bubbles that may burst in 2020 starting from the smallest to the largest one 1 student loans growing problem size 1 41 trillion in 2019 and an increase of 6 from 2018 and 33 since 2014 obtaining a worthy college or university degree is becoming more expensive while the payout the post studies salaries has diminished in 2018 the average student loan balance reached a record above 35k no less than 54 of students take on debt and 14 4 of adults have a student loan the delinquency rate measured at the amount of debt which is at least 90 days overdue stands at 10 8 student debt is already weighing on the economy as it limits disposable income and also delays family formation and home buying it is harder to get rid of this kind of debt a classic burst of this bubble has low chances in 2020 but the growing issue and the rise in delinquencies related to studies may adversely impact the economy if the issue worsens it could increase the chances that the federal reserve cuts rates weighing on the us dollar 2 auto loans easier bubble to burst size 1 18 trillion americans like shiny new cars the obama era program cash for clunkers has decimated the number of old autos on america s roads however new cars cost more and loans have grown substantially while the total debt for automobile loans is smaller than student loans it can burst at a quicker pace if more and more lenders default on their payments it could hurt the car industry which is already struggling amid fierce competition while sums of over a trillion seem large it is still small change in comparison to other asset classes such as housing debt a burst of this bubble may also trigger rate cuts to solve a local us problem thus weighing on the dollar without any global impact 3 tech stocks too much froth size 4 723 trillion is the market capitalization of stocks in the fang index these are facebook apple amazon netflix google alibaba baidu nvidia tesla and twitter the more limited group of faang stocks is up 700 from 2013 while the s p is only 100 higher while these businesses have grown rapidly are these valuations justified how large can a company grow share prices of recently listed companies have plunged examples include slack uber and lyft most notoriously wework was forced to shelve its ipo despite high multiples the large companies stocks have been shielded from massive sell offs but not from the ire of the public regulators and politicians the cambridge analytica scandal has put facebook s mark zuckerberg on the hot seat in congress and google has been coming under greater scrutiny in europe concerns about privacy in facebook s case and monopoly over search in google s case have dimmed these companies prospects some are worried about amazon s environmental and monopolistic damage in 2020 the heat may rise and hit a boiling point calls to regulate tech firms activities or break them up may rise as the us presidential elections become fiercer at some point share prices may take more significant hits if the techlash turns into a panicked sell off global markets could fall as well as tech stocks carry significant weight and impact broader markets a massive plunge may send traders to the safety of the us dollar as well as the japanese yen and gold 4 us corporate debt a global meltdown size around 10 trillion 47 of us gdp interest rates have been low for over a decade making lending cheaper some of the extra debt has gone into stock buybacks the international monetary fund has already warned that the high corporate leverage may lead to a shock deleveraging that may trigger a sell off depressing investment and rising joblessness the debt to assets ratio for all nonfinancial companies that are publicly traded has already hit its highest levels in two decades the most worrying part of corporate debt is those bonds that are rated bbb these are the lowest investment grade assets and if they are downgraded asset managers may be forced to sell them in order to meet obligations to stakeholders according to the fed the amount of such debt is approaching an all time high quick downgrades of bonds from investment grade to junk bonds may put high pressure on an already illiquid market moreover in the case of a recession 40 of total debt that is defined as at being at risk may rise to 19 trillion debt at risk is one held by corporations that are unable to cover interest expenses with their profits us corporate is already a systemic risk that would trigger a risk off reaction a stronger us dollar japanese yen and gold 5 chinese soe debt the biggest elephant but it can kept under control size around 19 trillion in 2018 state owned enterprises soes play a crucial role in the centrally managed chinese economy debt held by these companies that vary from firms fully owned by the state to ones that are publicly traded was been considered safe until a few years ago however authorities in beijing have become concerned about the moral hazard associated with the fact that these companies are shielded from defaults moreover some have turned into zombie corporations that extend their unproductive existence and hinder growth the search for dynamism has led the world s second largest economy to allow for defaults moreover the slowdown caused by the trade war with the us among other factors has also added pressure on indebted companies the process is likely to extend into 2020 with more soes defaulting on debt payments the 19 trillion question is will the process remain orderly or will it get out of control and trigger a broader sell off in chinese markets the worst case scenario is that significant defaults by soes causes capital outflows out of china wreaking havoc all over the world if chinese soe debt defaults are severe the global economy could suffer and the safe haven dollar yen and gold will have room to rise however the likelihood of such a devasting development is low the authorities have been able to engineer a soft landing of the economy and may continue doing so also in relation to soe debt overall this is the largest bubble but probably not the worse one to fear conclusion among the five bubbles the smaller american student and car debt loans may burst or deflate but the damage will likely be local weighing on the economy and the dollar an implosion of the tech stock or corporate debt bubbles could damage the global economy and trigger safe haven flows boosting the safe haven greenback finally chinese soe debt the largest of all may have an even worse effect on the world but is unlikely to deflate in a severe manner
following its weakest performance since the global financial crisis the world economy is poised for a modest rebound this year if everything goes just right hanging over this lethargic recovery are two other trends that raise questions about the course of economic growth the unprecedented runup in debt worldwide and the prolonged deceleration of productivity growth which needs to pick up to bolster standards of living and poverty eradication the world bank s semi annual global economic prospects forecasts advanced economies are expected to slow as a group to 1 4 from 1 6 mainly reflecting lingering weakness in manufacturing emerging market and developing economies will see growth accelerate to 4 1 from 3 5 last year however the pickup is anticipated to come largely from a small number of large emerging economies shaking off economic doldrums or stabilizing after recession or turbulence for many other economies growth is on track to decelerate as exports and investment remain weak a worrying aspect of the sluggish growth trend is that income growth would in fact be slowest in sub saharan africa the region where 56 percent of the world s poor live per capita income growth lags behind long term averages world bank group and even this modest rally could be disrupted by any number of threats trade disputes could re escalate a sharper than expected growth slowdown in major economies such as china the united states or the euro area would similarly reverberate widely a resurgence of financial stress in large emerging markets as was experienced in argentina and turkey in 2018 an escalation of geopolitical tensions or a series of extreme weather events could all have adverse effects on economic activity around the world debt wave one feature overshadowing the outlook is the largest fastest and most broad based wave of debt accumulation among emerging and developing economies in the last 50 years debt has also surged among low income countries after a sharp drop over 2000 2010 the current wave of debt differs from previous ones in that there has been an increase in the share of non resident holdings of emde government debt foreign currency denominated private emde debt and for low income countries borrowing from financial markets and non paris club bilateral creditors raising concerns about debt transparency and debt collateralization in emerging and developing economies over the last decade growth has slowed while debt has increased world bank group debt accumulation can also be appropriate in economic downturns as a way to stabilize economic activity however the three previous waves of debt accumulation have ended badly sovereign defaults in the early 1980s financial crises in the late 1990s the need for major debt relief in the 2000s and the global financial crisis in 2008 2009 and while currently low interest rates mitigate some of the risks high debt carries significant risks it can leave countries to vulnerable to external shocks it can limit the ability of governments to counter downturns with fiscal stimulus and it can dampen longer term growth by crowding out productivity enhancing private investment this means that governments need to take steps to minimize risks associated with debt buildups strong regulatory and supervisory regimes good corporate governance and common international standards can help contain risks ensure that debt is used productively and identify vulnerabilities early productivity slowdown yet another aspect of the disappointing pace of global growth is the broad based slowdown in productivity growth over the last ten years growth in productivity output per worker is essential to raising living standards and achieving development goals an extensive look at productivity trends in this edition of global economic prospects focuses on how the productivity slowdown has affected emerging and developing economies average output per worker in emerging and developing economies is less than one fifth that of a worker in an advanced economy and in low income economies that figure drops to 2 since the global financial crisis there has been a broad based slowdown in productivity in emerging and developing economies world bank group among emerging and developing economies which have a history of productivity growth surges and setbacks the slowdown from 6 6 in 2007 to a trough of 3 2 in 2015 has been the steepest longest and broadest on record the slowdown is due to weaker investment and efficiency gains dwindling gains from the reallocation of resources to more productive sectors and slowing improvements in the key drivers of productivity such as education and institutional quality how to rekindle productivity growth the outlook for productivity remains challenging therefore efforts are needed to stimulate private and public investment upgrade workforce skills to boost firm productivity help resources find the most productive sectors reinvigorate technology adoption and innovation and promote a growth friendly macroeconomic and institutional environment two other issues merit consideration in this edition of the outlook adverse consequences of price controls and inflation prospects in lics while price controls are sometimes considered a useful tool to smooth price fluctuations for good and services such as energy and food they can also dampen investment and growth worsen poverty outcomes and lead to heavier fiscal burdens replacing them with expanded and targeted social safety nets alongside the encouragement of competition and an effective regulatory environment can be beneficial both to poverty eradication and to growth and low inflation is associated with more stable output and employment higher investment and falling poverty rates however strengthening central bank independence making the monetary authority s objectives clear and cementing central bank credibility are essential to keep prices anchored if policy makers manage to mitigate tensions and clarify unsettled issues in a number of areas they could prove the forecast wrong by sending growth higher than anticipated
washington jan 8 2020 global economic growth is forecast to edge up to 2 5 in 2020 as investment and trade gradually recover from last year s significant weakness but downward risks persist the world bank says in its january 2020 global economic prospects growth among advanced economies as a group is anticipated to slip to 1 4 in 2020 in part due to continued softness in manufacturing growth in

this article first appeared in capital the edge malaysia weekly on december 30 2019 january 5 2020 the excitement has been elsewhere most years with not much joy at home this could be one way of describing the performance of the malaysian equity market in the decade that started in 2010 one saving grace for the fbm klci is that it climbed 26 8 between 2010 and 2019 as at dec 23 however this is a paltry increase compared with that of indices in other markets such as the dow jones industrial average djia fresh from a severe subprime loan crisis in 2008 us equity bulls picked up the pieces and marched ahead for 10 years the djia has more than doubled since recovering from the crisis while the standard poor s 500 index has rocketed 184 3 and the nasdaq has soared 295 and the equity bulls have not taken a break this christmas with the indices still moving upwards in the last few trading days of the year likewise the tip markets thailand indonesia and the philippines have seen their benchmark indices more than double of the three the philippine stock exchange has seen the highest increase soaring 157 9 over the past 10 years followed by indonesia s jakarta stock exchange 148 8 and the stock exchange of thailand 114 2 compared with their performance the fbm klci has had the worst performing decade since 1979 the local benchmark index saw a super bull run between 1980 and 1989 when it soared 173 5 the climb continued in the following decade when it gained 43 between 1990 and 1999 the decade when the asian financial crisis swept across the region and sparked a bloodbath in the stock markets in 1998 it continued to rise at an even stronger 58 gain the decade after despite the onset of the global financial crisis in late 2008 that originated from the subprime mortgage crisis which brought down lehman brothers a more than 150 year old us financial services firm another blow to the malaysian market in the past decade has been the sharp depreciation of the ringgit during the period the local currency lost 20 of its value against the greenback its worst performance since the 1998 asian financial crisis why have the bulls run elsewhere we list six factors 1 malaysia s own set of domestic problems crude oil oil revenue is a large contributor to the government s coffers strong crude oil prices would mean fuller coffers for the government which would have more to spend while being able to rein in its fiscal deficit the opposite would happen if oil prices were to fall crude oil prices were high at above us 80 per barrel between 2010 and 2014 at the time the ringgit regained its strength hovering between rm3 and rm3 20 against the greenback when oil prices lost ground in late 2014 so did the ringgit the local currency breached the rm4 level for the second time in 50 years and has remained weak since then given that oil prices have averaged at about us 60 per barrel in the last five years of the decade the price movements of two types of oil crude oil and crude palm oil have a significant impact on the local market given that oil and gas o g and plantation are the two major sectors on the local bourse when they are out of favour bursa malaysia would be less appealing to investors especially foreign investors this is more so since bursa is short of new economy stocks such as the likes of apple facebook and google fiscal health weak crude oil prices have raised concerns over the government s fiscal health and its ability to spend more to stimulate the domestic economy furthermore the goods and services tax was abolished and its replacement the sales and services tax does not seem to be the best substitute in terms of being able to replenish the government s coffers the high national debt that the current administration inherited from the previous government has also curbed the government s spending power when the economic outlook is patchy it does not augur well for corporate earnings prospects hence investors are shying away political uncertainties it might be too early to draw any conclusion on the performance of the pakatan harapan government however one of the main factors that has kept investors on the sidelines of the local stock market is the uncertainty over the planned handover of power from tun dr mahathir mohamad to datuk seri anwar ibrahim speculation on the transition aside investors prefer to wait for the dust to settle on the political front and for there to be certainty on policies before investing in the country malaysia has not really been a major beneficiary of macro factors in the last decade this is simply because we are not as competitive as other countries in some areas says geoffrey ng ching fung investment adviser and director of fortress capital asset management m sdn bhd we did not really benefit from the quantitative easing programmes i think in the first five years we did to some extent but since then our stock valuation has been rather toppish there are more bargains to be had outside malaysia because of the long drawn out political issues in our country foreign investors are not particularly keen on us 2 low interest rates it was the decade that interest rates stayed consistently low which in turn was a boon for economic growth and equity markets this could be seen from the us federal reserve s low rate and the record breaking performance on wall street in other words money always seeks better yields when interest rates stay low for this long people will continuously adjust their return expectations on equity against interest rates via both so called cost of capital calculation and dividend against interest rate says a foreign fund manager interest rates in developed economies such as the us eurozone and japan had been low during the decade for various domestic reasons and that encouraged the influx of investment money into equity markets the low interest rates also brought down borrowing costs a blessing for the corporate world and consumers the business community could borrow at low rates for expansion helping to sustain earnings growth while consumers could spend more as loans were cheaper the loose monetary policy had been the main fuel for global growth during the decade the fed kept interest rates low in the early part of the decade as the us economy needed the extra boost after the subprime mortgage crisis just when the central bank began talking about unwinding quantitative easing qe by raising interest rates and investors started to be fearful of a major correction in the us market followed by a ripple effect globally the us china trade war started this put the brakes on global growth prompting fed chairman jerome powell to cut interest rates three times in 2019 a move to keep the growth momentum going in the country meanwhile interest rates in the eurozone have been trimmed to zero since march 2016 to try to lift the bloc out of its economic doldrums a major problem that has been plaguing the region is the lack of cohesiveness in terms of the fiscal policy of individual member countries even though they have a common currency currently not all members are on an equally strong footing fiscally to be able to support the currency european central bank governing council member klaas knot has voiced his concerns about the prolonged low interest rate environment which could encourage unnecessary risk taking in investments klaas who is also the dutch central bank president commented that the current low rates lead to excessive risk taking among investors while the younger generations may feel that they have to increase their savings interest rates in malaysia had been hovering in a tight range of 3 to 3 25 for most of the decade after bank negara malaysia raised the overnight policy rate several times from 2 in 2010 to 3 in may 2011 economists concur that the central bank is unlikely to raise rates soon due to the high household debt and uncertainties over economic growth in the country 3 quantitative easing qe it is estimated that central banks in the us eurozone and japan have pumped in us 10 trillion through the purchase of financial assets such as treasury bills or debt paper since 2009 that move has in turn released more money into the financial systems which has flowed elsewhere globally seeking yield one destination has been equity markets to recap there was an influx of liquidity into asia the rare sweet spot of growth in the early part of the decade shortly after the global financial crisis thanks to the qe programmes consequently the region began to experience asset inflation massive qe programmes post 2008 global financial crisis flooded the global investment market with ample liquidity in the process of seeking a home for returns the liquidity has been responsible for the inflation in various asset classes including equities for the past 10 years says ta investment management bhd chief investment officer choo swee kee the qe programmes have helped grease the wheel of growth over the past decade particularly shortly after the onset of the global financial crisis that crippled the banking system in developed nations and led to liquidity drying up but some believe the programmes have had unfavourable effects on the world economy with doomsayers warning that the adverse consequences could outweigh the benefits the measure has brought indeed investors are aware of the risks when the us federal reserve started talking about unwinding its qe programme by selling financial assets it jolted equity markets particularly those in the us which have enjoyed one of the longest uninterrupted bull runs in history a correction is deemed long overdue i believe any time liquidity is pumped into the capital markets equity markets will benefit however policymakers need to strike a balance because too much liquidity for too long a period of time will inflate asset bubbles says a corporate adviser 4 trade war and trump perhaps only an astrologer could have observed the alignment of the stars 10 years ago and predicted that a future us president would start a war not with weapons but by attempting to derail another country s economic growth the protracted us china trade war which was arguably started by us president donald trump has had an impact on global economic growth and contributed to market volatility this is probably the worst situation the world has seen since the end of the cold war between the us and the then soviet union in 1991 recall that the us china trade tensions deepened when a 10 tariff was levied on us 200 billion worth of chinese imports in september 2018 china retaliated by levying tariffs on us 60 billion worth of us imports in may 2019 the us increased its tariffs on chinese imports which included semi conductors and integrated circuits from 10 to 25 one positive effect of a trade war is trade diversion malaysia was expected to be one of the beneficiaries but this has yet to be seen a fund manager who prefers to remain anonymous says the us presidential election is not just a major event for americans but also the world because when the us sneezes the world catches a cold trump who has been in the white house for about three years has certainly demonstrated the reach and influence of a superpower to the world the us is a big export market for many countries including china and this is the trump card of the us president trump promised to make america great again by starting a trade war with china and that has rocked markets worldwide any protectionism is bad for the global economy says the fund manager after mikhail gorbachev the last leader of the soviet union ended the cold war with the us global growth gathered pace in the 1990s because of more vibrant international trade on top of that deng xiaoping began to liberalise china and opened its doors to the world for foreign investments and that helped to drive global growth as well trump is now doing the opposite of that he says uncertainties arising from a trade war are always factors that add to the volatility in equity markets it is simple no trade and no exports means no earnings growth and highly trade oriented economies such as malaysia are the most affected the us china trade dispute could be a long drawn out affair and whether or not it will end may depend on the results of the next us presidential election thus maybank asset management malaysia says exports are unlikely to be a strong growth engine in the near future 5 the mighty rise of tech nearly 20 years after the dotcom bubble burst the shares of technology firms have become popular with investors again outperforming all other sectors to emerge as new economy stocks it is noteworthy that us tech companies have been dominating the global market since the internet was commercialised in the mid 1990s in fact the term gafam was coined to describe the top five us tech brands of google apple facebook inc amazon com inc and microsoft the acronym faang was later popularised to represent facebook amazon apple netflix inc and google chinese tech brands caught up quickly with huawei xiaomi oppo and vivo making an impact on our lives in the past decade chinese e commerce giants such as alibaba tencent and bytedance also transformed our shopping habits and social interaction through their platforms lazada shopee and tiktok respectively with these giants making their way onto the stock exchanges the rise of technology has not only provided interesting themes and trading ideas for investors but also changed investing behaviour phillip capital management sdn bhd chief strategist phua lee kerk says tech stocks and brands related to the digital economy generally performed well in the past decade following the dotcom bust he says there was a major correction or rather a re rating of the tech sector today we have companies such as amazon and google that survived the dotcom crash and newcomers like tencent and alibaba for example airbnb which is hurting the traditional hotel industry and uber and grab e hailing operators that are disrupting the traditional taxi industry the same goes for the banking and stockbroking sectors he tells the edge when we think about it most of them don t really have a totally new business model their concepts are not groundbreaking for instance p2p peer to peer is quite similar to moneylending in the chinese community while ecf equity crowdfunding is like borrowing money from family and relatives but with the help of technology there is wider reach and faster implementation of p2p and ecf he adds chris eng poh yoon chief strategy officer at etiqa the insurance and takaful arm of malayan banking bhd maybank opines that technology is the biggest factor that dictated stock market performance in 2010 to 2019 and will continue to do so in the coming decade when you have technology quantitative investing and artificial intelligence the behaviour of investors and fund managers will change the future of investment is not in the hands of fund managers but in the hands of programmers and ai he says the way people are investing has changed a lot in the last 10 years there were a lot of passive investments via etfs exchange traded funds and quantitative investments so brokerage fees have been squeezed franklin templeton emerging markets equity portfolio manager and research analyst ismar isqandar izhar notes that in the last 10 years the fbm klci s and the fbm emas market capitalisation has more than doubled the tech sector has seen significant improvement in market cap it has grown multiple times since 2010 due to an increase in technology adoption for smartphones and other consumer products higher demand from industrial and manufacturing automation has also contributed to the performance of the sector he says a fund manager says the likes of faang stocks have helped drive interest in the stock markets especially wall street if you look at microsoft and apple the market cap of the two stocks has exceeded us 1 trillion this says it all where the money has flowed over the decade yet as the industry grows it is leaving malaysia s stock market behind according to the fund manager there is still a lack of new economy stocks on bursa malaysia perhaps that explains why the malaysian market is still looking unattractive among the world s major markets because most of the stocks here are so called old economy stocks the saving grace is that there are semiconductor stocks for investors to ride the growth story on the tech theme as smartphones are getting smarter with advanced technology 6 glcs and corporate champions like it or not the change of government in may 2018 had an immediate impact on the corporate world especially government linked companies the crowding out effect brought about by the government has been ongoing for close to two decades seeing consolidation among the glcs for the private sector to come back in a big way and to be competitive and a major part of the economy again will take just as long geoffrey ng ching fung investment adviser and director at fortress capital asset management m sdn bhd recalls that the structural drivers of the past 10 years were essentially the products of government namely corporate champions mainly from the glc sector the glics government linked investment companies were the ones with all the capital and they structured these glcs in such a way that they would dominate the local marketplace that drove market performance the glcs whether tenaga nasional bhd malayan banking bhd maybank or cimb group holdings bhd are the ones that had access to cheap capital and they also own strategic assets in their respective industries he says on their part sovereign wealth fund khazanah nasional bhd and state owned fund permodalan nasional bhd turned many of the glcs into regional champions today axiata group bhd ihh healthcare bhd cimb maybank sime darby bhd and rhb bank bhd are regarded as corporate champions in their respective industries over the years especially the past decade these homegrown glcs have established a strong business presence in other countries in the region ng says entrepreneur driven companies also performed fairly well in the past decade companies like dialog group bhd and inari amertron bhd have taken their entrepreneurial spirit to the global marketplace that s how the market was shaped in the past decade or so he sees the private sector driving growth in the coming decade the malaysian stock market is going through a transitional phase the glcs were the driving force but they have become fairly muted nowadays that s why we see less momentum in the market we have not seen much earnings growth ng expects the local market to be an underperformer for the next few years at least it is not just malaysia s stock market but its entire corporate sector that is going through a transition the government is not as big a supporter of corporations anymore corporations and the private sector need to stand on their own two feet save by subscribing to us for your print and or digital copy

interview with christine lagarde president of the ecb by pierre henri de menthon and sabine syfuss arnaud you have described yourself as neither a dove nor a hawk but rather an owl why exactly this rather unusual type of bird owls are traditionally seen as birds of wisdom that can see well in the dark and have a wide range of vision however what i really wanted to highlight was my wish to ensure that discussions within the governing council take place in an efficient of course but also composed manner what in your view does 2020 have in store for us what is the greatest threat to the global economy we would anticipate a growth rate of around 1 1 in the euro area for 2020 which is slightly lower than in 2019 both within the euro area and globally the biggest threat is a downturn in trade resulting from a range of uncertainties primarily affecting manufacturing and hampering investment this range of uncertainties in addition to geopolitical risks and issues relating to climate change includes ongoing trade tensions and brexit will europe be weakened as a result of brexit following the recent elections in the united kingdom and the approval by the house of commons of the withdrawal agreement the uk is due to leave the european union on 31 january 2020 this means one less uncertainty which is good news for investors that said the biggest challenge is yet to come namely the issue of reaching a trade deal between london and the eu during the 11 month transition period the economic and financial impact of brexit will depend on the details of that agreement if indeed one can be reached during that short period of time however what we do know is that as a result of brexit the european union will lose a wealthy member state and one that is a powerful military force the eu will recover but will need to bolster its efforts to compensate for the uk s departure you have moved from washington to frankfurt can you explain the difference in growth between the united states and the euro area where germany s role as an engine of growth appears to be losing momentum the difference is largely due to economic policy choices the united states has seen a significant fiscal stimulus whereas europe has not the united states is less restricted fiscally speaking and enjoys the privilege of the us dollar s international position the us was also able to restore the health of its financial sector at an earlier stage following the crisis however the eu is still the most powerful economic and trading area in the world with enormous potential it has also shown that it was able to recover from the crisis and create new employment after two recessions particularly thanks to the measures taken by the ecb a concerted fiscal stimulus at the euro area level would help speed up growth which at 1 1 in 2020 and 1 4 in 2021 according to our latest projections remains below our potential at least for 2020 what do you mean when you refer to a new policy mix for europe it makes sense to use all of the tools at our disposal when it comes to increasing growth which will also result in inflation moving towards levels close to 2 there are three elements to this policy mix monetary policy which has continuously been used to maintain price stability fiscal policy which should be used more often in order to support monetary policy in member states where possible and structural reforms to increase the growth potential within our economies greater cooperation between competent authorities without infringing on the independence of their roles would make it possible to optimise the multiplier effects of their decisions the ecb s policy is pushing economic operators into debt french public debt is now in excess of 100 of gdp should we be worried although public debt is decreasing within the euro area in france it is increasing this is a cause for concern since it does reduce the room for fiscal manoeuvre in the event of a downturn in the economy france needs to take steps to reduce its deficit and debt while adopting a growth friendly fiscal policy other countries have managed to achieve this difficult task i am confident that the french government will also be able to do so particularly through structural reforms in your role as managing director of the imf you were often critical of germany s surpluses to what extent has this changed primarily in terms of current account surpluses but not just with regard to germany such high surpluses in relation to gdp result in imbalances particularly where a single currency is concerned given the major challenge posed by populism how can the ecb be brought closer to the citizens this is one of my priorities bringing the ecb closer to the people requires dialogue and explanations we need to engage with our fellow citizens and enter into dialogue with them we need to explain to them also through you what the ecb does and that we are committed to doing its work effectively we should bear in mind that three quarters of euro area citizens are in favour of the euro your mandate is to ensure price stability is this the main issue today doesn t asking the question imply an assumption that price stability has been maintained i would take that to be a compliment for the ecb indeed since the introduction of the euro annual inflation has averaged around 1 7 in the euro area however inflation currently stands at 1 and inflation projections are still low at some distance from the level of below but close to 2 that we would like to reach over the medium term the president of the european commission ursula von der leyen has presented her green deal how will it interact with ecb policy are you going to transform the ecb into a green bank i commend the determination of my friend ursula von der leyen and her commitment to the environment this battle is to our credit in europe with all of us acting within our remits in this i also include the european investment bank we will play our part within the framework of our mandate of maintaining price stability and of banking supervision what effects do climate related risks have on our growth and inflation projections what signals do we send through our bond purchases and what assets are held by the banks that we supervise the stakes are high enough to arouse a keen interest in these questions while pursuing our primary mission as regards monetary policy the review of our strategy will be the ideal time to address these questions given the low or even negative interest rates are savers right to be worried about their savings the measures taken aim to maintain stable prices in the medium to long term this ensures the best possible economic environment and the preservation of purchasing power for all whether savers or borrowers interest rates are instruments rather than objectives in themselves there have been times in europe when savers invested in money market funds that delivered high returns such as at the start of the 1990s but the monetary environment of that period penalised borrowers and the situation at that time resulted in a deep economic recession in a recession savers tend to reduce their savings in an effort to maintain their level of consumption in other words a recession is bad for savings negative interest rates aim to keep the economy on a balanced growth path and to avoid a recession isn t it a little shocking that banks could charge for holding deposits it would be shocking if the banks did not take full advantage of the historical monetary conditions that they are benefiting from to provide more funding to the real economy but negative interest rates have been useful and progress has been made in spring 2014 just before the rate on the deposit facility was reduced into negative territory lending to the real economy was declining with all that that entailed such as the risk of an economic downturn and deflation today it is growing at about 3 5 per year specifically it is not just countries but firms and households too that are living off credit are we witnessing the creation of bubbles in particular property bubbles overall not in the euro area as a whole although the work of the european systemic risk board which i chair and the ecb s latest financial stability review call for prudence and the implementation of targeted macroprudential measures which are sometimes necessary at the national level can the euro take advantage of the current turmoil to gain ground on the world stage i share the european commission s view that there is indeed room for the euro to further develop its international role in line with the economic and financial importance of the euro area but ultimately it s the economic agents who determine whether this takes place of course we will help strengthen the international role of the euro by being credible in what we do by making the euro area more robust by completing banking union and the capital markets union and by continuing to innovate in the field of payments is creating a cryptocurrency a legitimate task for the ecb innovation in the area of payments is racing ahead in response to the urgent demand for quicker and cheaper payments especially cross border ones the eurosystem in general and the ecb in particular want to play an active role in this field rather than just acting as observers of a changing world in 2018 the eurosystem launched an infrastructure to provide pan european instant payments with direct settlement in central bank money tips i e target instant payment settlement this enables banks to process payments between themselves in a matter of seconds 24 hours a day 365 days a year all over europe this caters not only to the preferences of younger generations who want to make round the clock payments with their smartphones but also to firms which want to optimise payment and supply chain processes in terms of the road ahead the ecb will continue to assess the costs and benefits of issuing a central bank digital currency cbdc that would ensure that the general public remains able to use central bank money even if the use of physical cash eventually declines however the prospect of central bank initiatives should neither discourage nor crowd out private market led solutions for fast and efficient retail payments in the euro area we are looking closely into the feasibility and merits of a cbdc also because it could have major implications for the financial sector and for the transmission of monetary policy at the end of 2019 we created an expert task force at the ecb that will work closely with the national central banks to study the feasibility of a euro area cbdc in various forms covering all the practical aspects including how to minimise possible unintended side effects you left france in 2011 do you miss it wherever i am france is always close to my heart
reuters reuters london reuters breakingviews not that long ago most economists condemned anything more than modest government borrowing in normal times they mostly did not trust governments and they had theories to show that official debts would squeeze out private investment spur inflation and depress economic sentiment now deficits are a ok and that s mostly good the old thinking is not dead it is an appealing intuition that the government is a sort of big national family which should not spend more than it takes in angela merkel the german chancellor characterized that as the wisdom of a swabian housewife this has led the euro zone to limit deficits of member governments to 3 of gross domestic product in normal times and inspired germany s so called debt brake which prohibits further borrowing when the annual deficit reaches 0 35 of gdp with some wiggle room for economic conditions a few mostly german politicians still think that large government deficits are simply a bad idea some well known economists agree for example christina romer former chair of the u s council of economic advisers said recently that sustained large fiscal deficits are not a recipe for being a strong healthy superpower economy according to bloomberg for the most part though judgements are changing the facts simply don t match the old theories consider the group of seven leading developed economies the united states japan germany france the uk italy and canada in 2007 their average fiscal deficit was 1 5 of gdp according to international monetary fund data canada and germany ran surpluses then came the global financial crisis the countries average deficit rose above 7 over the following three years and did not fall below 3 again until 2015 the borrowing binge did not obviously cut into growth it s true that the average annual growth in gdp per person in the g7 countries shifted downward between 2001 and 2007 the average annual increase was 1 4 between 2014 and 2019 the average rise in gdp per person has been 1 however the numbers in the earlier period were inflated by unsustainable financial activity and the more recent outcomes have been depressed by trade wars and slowing overall growth in developing countries as for inflation the g7 annual average peaked at 2 9 right as the global financial crisis hit in 2008 after falling to 0 3 the next year it rose all the way to 2 6 in 2011 and then dropped back the imf forecasts a 2019 average price increase of 1 4 no one really understands what does cause inflation but fiscal deficits don t seem to be on the list deficit haters can always find arguments for their thesis borrowing that seems harmless now may be storing up long term trouble or perhaps the mid crisis deficits were a special case this year s large u s fiscal deficit 5 6 of gdp or over 1 trillion by the imf s count could trigger the long expected bad effects the theoretical battle will rage but a practical worry has helped tip the balance of thinking central banks currently have little room to cut interest rates to respond to a recession they could resort to putting new money into the financial markets by buying bonds and other assets but that technique has not proved very effective so fiscal expansion looks more alluring the change should be welcomed on theoretical grounds too governments are actually not like large households they are the ultimate monetary authority responsible for ensuring that enough money is circulating to keep the economy going they subcontract most actual money creation work to banks but when private lenders fall short governments can and should lean in loans to government like all loans basically create new money so fiscal deficits are unlikely to take money away from private investments as the old theory assumed and any politically competent government that sells its debt domestically can support a high ratio of outstanding debt to gdp finally deficit spending which activates otherwise unused economic potential will push up output rather than stoking inflation voters and politicians can be even more enthusiastic than economists about a more relaxed approach to fiscal deficits additional government spending could help pay for helpful infrastructure alleviate poverty and create more and better jobs it could even delay the next recession and limit its depth no wonder that even german resistance seems to be softening u s president donald trump is already trying higher deficits and the uk under prime minister boris johnson is likely to follow his example italy and japan would be good candidates too although their high existing debt burden scares deficit friendly economists although in theory governments can create money without borrowing even proponents of modern monetary theory which is the most pro deficit approach around are reluctant to propose that however there is a risk while fiscal deficits are often good in moderation they can become dangerous unchecked money creation does eventually create runaway inflation think argentina and zimbabwe after four decades of disinflation in developed economies that sort of destabilising inflationary momentum is hard to imagine however politicians desperate to win elections and lacking any fiscal conscience to hold them back are the one group which might just manage that feat the views and

tope fasua continued from tuesday anyhow while all that was going on world wars were taking place europe received its first pounding between 1914 and 1918 in the first world war the usa was physically too removed to be drawn in with the available technology of that time ditto between 1939 and 1944 when the second gory global episode took place this relative advantage turned the usa into the world leader as she took the world war opportunity to sell loads of ammunition to the warring parties especially britain as the war drew to an end the usa called the meetings of bretton woods new hampshire and set up the world bank the imf and other subsidiaries the american dollar was announced as the global currency to which other currencies should be pegged while the dollar was backed by gold at 37 an ounce the british pound which was the former global currency took a shellacking losing 60 of its value overnight that was how the british empire collapsed the americans collapsed the empire and an american empire emerged these caucasians never forget anything the americans never forgot the oppression they suffered under the british crown they had to fight a revolutionary war to free themselves white on white that revolutionary war against the brits started in april 1775 caused the declaration of independence in 1776 and did not end until 1783 the decolonisation of african countries was the natural next stage in bottling up britain and by extension france spain portugal and whoever else had colonial territories the usa never took liberia or the philippines very seriously anyway at least not in the way britain and france made capital out of their colonies milking them for strength so there you have it let us tone down all the haughtiness and face the reality of our existence france was more reluctant to hand off its african colonies and its strategy was cruder than that of britain it made those colonies sign all sorts of things it even asked them to vote and guinea under sekou toure mali under modibbo keita and algeria under ahmed ben bella voted they didn t want colonisation for that the french destroyed everything substantial in guinea from charles de gaulle to pompidou giscard d estaing mitterand chirac sarkozy to the present young man emmanuel macron french leaders have often voiced racist ideas nigeria will be remiss to have anything to do with that country more so there are allegations that france has a hand in the destablisation of the region because most of the communication from boko haram come first from alliance france presse plus that country has never given any of the affected countries any intelligence on the movement of terrorists and ammunition in that region sarkozy for example is alleged to have given the order for gaddafi to be killed on the streets even though everybody knows the latter financed his election with tens of millions of euros that joint venture between these wise countries uk usa and france has led not only to the total destruction of libya but by extension the entire africa has not known peace since by all means the fall of gaddafi was the beginning of serious terrorism in nigeria i believe these three superpowers knew what they wanted to achieve by opening the route for ammunition when they took out gaddafi smooth talking barack obama says he regrets doing what he did but he should tell that to the thousands of children women and old people that the coalition of mass murderers killed and which mainstream media like aljazeera cnn and co have covered up till today macron in june 2017 said he believed that africa s problem was civlisational in response to a suggestion that a marshall plan type of solution be offered to africa by marshall plan is meant that the same type of massive bailout given to europe especially france and the uk by the usa after the second world war be given to africa to help her lift off not only did macron wave it off he rubbed insult to our injury he probably prefers black africa to be continually exploited for everything she has just like his predecessors by civilisational macron meant we were a retarded lot still living in a different distant civilisation short of calling us underevolved neanderthals to explain further he stated offhandedly how african women were having seven or eight children there was no one around to tell him that in most of africa you wouldn t find many of such practices and in europe until recently the same practice occurred a recent research though disputed showed that that index is only true for niger republic and some of their cousins in northern nigeria this is the background for the problem we have with the eco currency which france has jumped with the assistance of ouattara today i repeat we can never go into french slavery one slavery is enough for a lifetime countries like france will not even offer you any tangibles like the chinese but can the eco even work as a political currency it cannot we must give it a wide berth ghana may decide to go down that route because her management of the ghana cedi has been disastrous the convergence criterion that was set for the eco meaning the figures that countries must present in order to join has not been met by any country only togo seemed to be on course to have a single digit inflation a fiscal deficit not more than four per cent of gdp and tax revenue to be 20 of gdp etc nigeria is wide of the mark on most of the 10 criteria despite our large nominal gdp from the experience of the euro to which macron s eco has now been unfortunately tethered we saw how the currency almost unravelled but for germany s deep purse and determination that the currency is still surviving today is due to the fact that it serves germany s interests anyway when greece ireland portugal and spain cooked their books and carried too much external loans deficits and inflation the eurozone suddenly realised that there was no protocol to rein in a nation at default a nation is not a bank or corporate yet a debt default by a nation within a monetary union was a default by all and once the financial markets and indeed the man on the streets lose confidence the currency will tank and become worth less than the paper it is printed on a great lesson learnt in the euro saga was that germany had it all sown tight great economic indices flat wages which meant it produced at a discount compared to other countries in the union economic complexity which means it had more knowledge quotient embedded in every product it exported compared with the rest greece on the other extreme only sold tourism how can you match tourism with german machines both of them are not mates at all nigeria may have to stand strong with her naira in the event that every other west african nation foolishly joins the french eco that is if we cannot sue macron for damages and theft standing strong means we must become a serious producing nation and must figure economic complexity into what we do how much knowledge quotient can we muster this means a retraining of our youths to be producing machines that means an adherence to excellence in everything we do because we will meet with resistance and a counterstrategy from france we must produce what our neighbours cannot do without or resist we must brace ourselves and take strategic productive and operational charge of the afcfta beyond merely attending wasteful conferences we also must start by fulfilling our own people s needs just in case these countries will not accept any of our products this could even be a push back against the closure of our borders sometimes we need this punch upside the jaw so that our brains may reset perhaps macron and his predecessors are right about the black man we just need to brace ourselves wake up and understand that our burden is to be twice as clean twice as intelligent twice as smart twice as visionary than everybody else the burden will pay off in generations to come

tensions with iran are at highs not seen since the iran hostage crisis of 1979 1981 and the whole world is losing its nerve as we watch given the current extreme geopolitical tensions it is certainly a prudent time for investors to review the structure of the iranian economy for a better sense of its potential pressure points and strategies the united states might employ to choke it this could give investors clues as to the options the trump administration has in achieving leverage over iranâ s primarily oil based economy and in turn how that may affect commodities generally spoiler alert the world is in a very dangerous situation and one wrong move could send commodities skyrocketing higher history for historical context at the time of the iranian revolution in 1979 university students loyal to ayatollah khomeini took over the american embassy and held 52 american diplomats and workers hostage this is why president trump has threatened 52 iranian sites for attack even cultural sites which could regrettably vilify the trump administration in the eyes of the international community and isolate the united states the iranian offensive against the embassy was driven by bitterness over the united statesâ backing of the deposed iranian shah pahlavi at the time an operation ordered by then president jimmy carter ended in an embarrassing failure resulting in the accidental deaths of 8 american servicemen the hostages were eventually released through negotiations after 14 tense months perhaps history will rhyme and current tensions will be diffused through negotiations as before if not things could get really rocky in the markets iranian economic strength given us sanctions already in place against iran it is tempting to simply write off iranâ s economic power as already quite diminished but the most recent statistics available suggest otherwise true the latest round of us sanctions have cut iranian crude oil production by 45 since september 2018 true this is iranâ s lowest output in 40 years still the iranian economy while not exactly a dynamo is stronger than many would believe at first glance first consider the mitigation effect of rising oil prices on the fall in iranian crude production back in 2016 average crude oil production was about 3 7m barrels a day the average price that year was around 43 a barrel for daily income of around 160m with oil now at 63 if prices stay in this average range for the year and oil production has bottomed out then weâ re only talking about a 17 decline in daily oil revenues or around 20 or so adjusted for inflation thatâ s definitely a hit but itâ s not insurmountable the primary export destinations for iranian crude as of 2017 are china 28 india 22 and south korea 18 these three countries are also the primary trading partners with iran overall as seen below all three have been and still are victims of trump administration trade tariffs and threats president trump stripped india of its special trade status last may and has threatened steep tariffs on south korean cars besides aside from the ill will these moves have engendered they have also spurred china in particular into offering yuan denominated commodity futures this means that oil trade can theoretically be settled in yuan between iran and its largest trade partner bypassing us sanctions the european union as a whole accounts for another 23 of iranian crude oil exports a total of 9 eu countries including powerhouses france and germany have already set up a system to bypass american sanctions by skirting the swift bank routing systems the alternative known as the instrument in support of trade exchanges instex was just bolstered in november by 6 additional european countries that have since joined in total iranian exports in dollars are up 106 from 2016 until the latest available figures for q2 2018 granted this was before its oil production began to fall from the latest round of sanctions but oil prices are up 138 since 2016 while iranian oil production has fallen in comparison by only 38 considering the variables the crude oil portion of iranâ s economy is in much better shape now despite anemic production than it was in 2016 when production was much higher on the import side china is iranâ s biggest partner once again at 37 choking iranâ s imports then will require cooperation from china which does not seem too keen on helping out washington at the moment according to reuters there are signs that beijing is already back tracking on commitments to buy more american agriculture as agreed on in the phase one trade deal by refusing to alter import quotas keep in mind that the phase one trade deal has yet to be signed iranâ s labor market is the healthiest itâ s been since 2015 iranian unemployment stands at 10 9 as of the latest figures for 2019 the lowest since q4 2015 debt to gdp is a reasonable 44 2 ease of doing business in the country according to the world bank is 127 out of 190 countries not wonderful but much better than 2013 prior to the 2014 oil collapse when it was ranked a dismal 152 out of 190 iran has a consistent trade surplus that goes back to the 1970s which means it has a built up arsenal of foreign exchange to protect its currency currently pegged to the dollar so while iranâ s economy is not the greatest it is also not on the verge of collapse and has several strong points it wonâ t be easy for the trump administration to starve the country without drastic action and this is the disturbing part the upshot for oil and commodities what all this means is that in order to choke off iranâ s oil based economy sanctions and pressure on iranâ s trading partners may not be effective the trump administration may have to resort to attacking iranâ s oil infrastructure directly which could drive the iranian regime into an act of desperation such as attempting to take out saudi arabiaâ s oil infrastructure and that of other opec members allied with the united states such a move could send oil into the stratosphere and could be catastrophic for the global economy it is most likely this very fear that is driving oil prices higher now iran has already demonstrated it has the ability to exploit saudi arabian oil bottlenecks with two drone strikes by suspected iranian proxies in september an attack on opec oil would then reverberate into the rest of the commodity complex which is dependent on energy particularly oil for extraction and transport if central banks are indeed looking for higher consumer prices this unfortunate and dangerous slippery slope would certainly give them inflation in spades unless tensions are deescalated quickly the current situation could quickly devolve into something very bad for the global economy indeed

on december 20 1994 mexico suddenly devalued the peso against the us dollar leading to an international financial crisis and causing other currencies in latin america to decline as well the financial crisis is commonly referred to as the mexican peso crisis the effect of the mexican peso crisis is popularly known as the tequilla shock or the tequilla effect three years before the financial crisis mexico had maintained the peso within a well defined band against the us dollar in its exchange rate policy however during 1994 the exchange rate policy came under pressure as the government s account deficit increased to about 8 of the country s gdp 29 billion in response the peso was devalued by the central bank leading to a higher risk premium and capital flight breaking down the crisis with incumbent administration serving its final years in 1994 president carlos gortari picked luis colosio as his party s presidential candidate for the 1994 presidential election as was the tradition of the institutional revolutionary party irp during election years the president embarked on uncontrolled spending as a result the country s current account deficit grew by 8 of the gdp to try and correct the deficit the president allowed the treasury to issue more than 25 billion peso denominated short term debt indexed to the us dollars the treasury bills offered attractive returns to foreign investors however the rising political instability and the subsequent assassination of luis colosio led to higher risk premium on country s financial assets initially the high risk premium did not affect the peso because of the fixed exchange rate since banco de mexico had pegged the peso to the us dollar the currency depreciated or appreciated with a narrow margin against the dollar the crisis on december 20 1994 barely one month into the office president ernesto zedillo informed the public that the peso had been devalued by the mexican central bank by 13 to 15 although the bank had promised not to devalue the peso doing so led to investors panic with the majority losing confidence on the policymakers investors increased risk premium on local assets leading to downward market pressure on the peso and upward market pressure on the country s interest rates with a fear of further currency devaluation foreign investors withdrew sold off shares of stock and capital from mexican investment to reduce capital flight the central bank increased the interest rate to 32 two days later the peso was allowed to float freely leading to a further depreciation of 15 the crisis resulted in hyperinflation and severe recession the bailout in response to the mexican peso crisis president bill clinton sought a bailout from congress subsequently the mexican debt disclosure act was passed by the congress which president clinton enacted in april 1995 the law allowed the us to provide a 50 billion bailout package to mexico to be administered by the imf supported by the bank for international settlement and the g7 in return the government of mexico expected to put in place certain monetary policies and fiscal controls as well as maintaining their commitment to the existing policies of the nafta

at counterpunch michael hudson has penned an important article that outlines the important connections between us foreign policy oil and the us dollar in short us foreign policy is geared very much toward controlling oil resources as part of a larger strategy to prop up the us dollar hudson writes the assassination was intended to escalate america s presence in iraq to keep control of the region s oil reserves and to back saudi arabia s wahabi troops isis al quaeda in iraq al nusra and other divisions of what are actually america s foreign legion to support u s control of near eastern oil as a buttress of the u s dollar that remains the key to understanding this policy and why it is in the process of escalating not dying down the actual context for the neocon s action was the balance of payments and the role of oil and energy as a long term lever of american diplomacy basically the us s propensity for driving up massive budget deficits has created a need for immense amounts of deficit spending this can be handled through selling lots of government debt or through monetizing the debt but what if there isn t enough global demand for us debt that would mean the us would have to pay more interest on its debt or the us could monetize the debt through the central bank but that might cause the value of the dollar to crash so the us regime realized that it must find ways to prevent the glut of dollars and debt from actually destroying the value of the dollar fortunately for the regime this can be partly managed it turns out through foreign policy hudson continues the solution turned out to be to replace gold with u s treasury securities ious as the basis of foreign central bank reserves after 1971 foreign central banks had little option for what to do with their continuing dollar inflows except to recycle them to the u s economy by buying u s treasury securities the effect of u s foreign military spending thus did not undercut the dollar s exchange rate and did not even force the treasury and federal reserve to raise interest rates to attract foreign exchange to offset the dollar outflows on military account in fact u s foreign military spending helped finance the domestic u s federal budget deficit an important piece of this strategy has been a continued alliance with saudi arabia saudi arabia maintains the world s largest capacity for oil production and it was the largest single producer of crude for most of the period from the mid 1970s to 2018 when the us surpassed both saudi arabia and russia but saudi arabia remains under the us thumb what saudi arabia does not save in dollarized assets with its oil export earnings is spent on buying hundreds of billion of dollars of u s arms exports this locks them into dependence on u s supply replacement parts and repairs and enables the united states to turn off saudi military hardware at any point of time in the event that the saudis may try to act independently of u s foreign policy so maintaining the dollar as the world s reserve currency became a mainstay of u s military spending foreign countries do not have to pay the pentagon directly for this spending they simply finance the u s treasury and u s banking system however any move away from this status quo tends to be met with paranoia and intervention from the us fear of this development was a major reason why the united states moved against libya whose foreign reserves were held in gold not dollars and which was urging other african countries to follow suit in order to free themselves from dollar diplomacy hillary and obama invaded grabbed their gold supplies we still have no idea who ended up with these billions of dollars worth of gold and destroyed libya s government its public education system its public infrastructure but the role of oil producing states goes beyond merely churning dollars and us debt to keep the dollar afloat these countries also provide the foot soldiers for many us interventions in terms of terrorists and guerrilla fighters who can be used against us enemies hudson declares the vietnam war showed that modern democracies cannot field armies for any major military conflict because this would require a draft of its citizens that would lead any government attempting such a draft to be voted out of power and without troops it is not possible to invade a country to take it over the corollary of this perception is that democracies have only two choices when it comes to military strategy they can only wage airpower bombing opponents or they can create a foreign legion that is hire mercenaries or back foreign governments that provide this military service that is the us regime can certainly get away with lots of bombing operations and other low manpower operations but anything that might require conscription is a political nonstarter hudson notes that saudi arabia with its particularly rabid and extreme strain of islam is quite useful here once again saudi arabia plays a critical role through its control of wahabi sunnis turned into terrorist jihadis willing to sabotage bomb assassinate blow up and otherwise fight any target designated as an enemy of islam the euphemism for saudi arabia acting as u s client state religion really is not the key i know of no isis or similar wahabi attack on israeli targets the united states needs the saudis to supply or finance wahabi crazies so in addition to playing a key role in the u s balance of payments by recycling its oil export earnings into u s stocks bonds and other investments saudi arabia provides manpower by supporting the wahabi members of america s foreign legion isis and al nusra al qaeda terrorism has become the democratic mode of today s u s military policy hudson also notes that the term democracy when used in the context of foreign policy has very little to do with what a normal person would regard as democracy rather from the u s vantage point what is a democracy in today s orwellian vocabulary it means any country supporting u s foreign policy the antonym to democracy is terrorist that simply means a nation willing to fight to become independent from u s neoliberal democracy and this leads us to iran hudson explains america s hatred of iran starts with its attempt to control its own oil production exports and earnings it goes back to 1953 when mossadegh was overthrown because he wanted domestic sovereignty over anglo persian oil the cia mi6 coup replaced him with the pliant shah who imposed a police state to prevent iranian independence from u s policy the only physical places free from the police were the mosques that made the islamic republic the path of least resistance to overthrowing the shah and re asserting iranian sovereignty thus we got the islamic revolution of 1979 which has led to forty years of iran refusing to play ball in the us dollar maintenance regime that is demanded of other oil producing nations in the middle east the us is unlikely to let up on this effort so long as iran continues to refuse to take orders from dc on these matters it s true that the us can t do much about china and russia but iran unlike north korea which wisely secured nuclear arms for itself remains an easy target because of its lack of nuclear capability being a leftist hudson includes some unfortunate stuff about neoliberalism as if low taxes and freedom to trade were somehow driving global war hudson also concocts a theory about how this oil dollar policy is driving global warming that s a bit of a stretch but the connection between foreign policy and the us dollar that he identifies is a key factor that tends to be almost universally ignored by the mainstream media as china and russia work ever harder to undermine the dollar and its geopolitical position small countries like iran will become even more important in the us s drive to maintain the dollar s status quo but it remains to be seen how long the us can keep it going
the united states is the premier producer of safe assets that act as stores of value for the world s savers the demand for these assets has increased at a faster pace than the us can produce them changes in the regulation of financial institutions and markets since the 2008 financial crisis have increased the quantity of safe assets financial intermediaries are required to hold this increased demand helps explains why yields on us treasuries have been in low in recent years one way the excess demand for us dollar assets can be satisfied is through an appreciation in the us dollar exchange rate so these assets becomes more expensive for those outside the us the us dollar also appreciates in response to increased economic policy uncertainty menzie chinn has shown that a 1 per cent increase in the global economic policy uncertainty index raises the real value of the us dollar by 0 2 per cent controlling for relative interest rate inflation and economic growth differentials with the rest of the world the 60 per cent increase in policy uncertainty under trump has added around 12 per cent to the real value of the us dollar holding these other influences constant the appreciation exacerbates trade tensions by weighing on us export competitiveness advertisement contrary to popular myth the us dollar s role owes very little to its status as a so called reserve currency the fact that the us dollar makes up much of the world s official foreign currency assets held by central banks is a symptom not a cause of the us dollar s dominant role nor does the role of the us dollar depend on a strong dollar policy so long as the us enjoys a floating exchange rate and an independent federal reserve continues to target domestic inflation the us does not have a meaningful or effective exchange rate policy while trump has shifted us official rhetoric by signalling a preference for a weaker exchange rate to boost us export competitiveness this preference means little without backing from federal reserve monetary policy the us treasury with or without the support of the fed could intervene in foreign exchange markets with a view to influencing the value of the exchange rate however such intervention on its own would have little to no sustained effect and would do little to change us export competitiveness in the long run in principle the us dollar s role could be supplanted by other currencies but potential rivals are beset with problems for all the talk of currency wars exchange rates are difficult to weaponise advertisement in principle the us dollar s role could be supplanted by other currencies but the us dollar s nearest potential rivals are beset with problems the euro is part of a dysfunctional monetary union giving rise to political and diplomatic tensions that are tearing the european union apart there has been little net change in the euro s share of the international monetary system in the two decades since its launch despite the high hopes held for it in the late 1990s china s campaign to internationalise its renminbi from 2009 as part of an effort to leverage domestic reform efforts has failed china s leadership quickly backed away from reforms to make the rmb exchange rate more market based in 2015 viewing the associated volatility as a sign of disorder standard chartered s measure of rmb globalisation has flatlined since 2016 for all the concerns about the health of us domestic politics and the sustainability of its public finances the us dollar s dominant global role looks set to persist

i will ask james and alex to take us through the results in a little more detail james james kehoe executive vice president and global chief financial officer thank you stefano and good morning adjusted eps was 1 37 5 7 lower than prior year on a constant currency basis the year on year comparison was impacted by around 5 percentage points of adverse items including the year on year bonus impact in retail pharmacy usa strong cost management and improved retail comp sales were offset by lower gross margin retail pharmacy international continued to be negatively impacted by a challenging uk market and we saw continued strong performance from pharmaceutical wholesale our transformational cost management program is very much on track and we expect to achieve annual cost savings in excess of 1 8 billion by 2022 cash generation was very strong in the quarter with free cash flow of 674 million 684 million better than prior year and finally we are maintaining our guidance for fiscal year 20 of flat adjusted earnings per share on a constant currency basis with a range of plus or minus 3 looking forward we see improved core business trends with however some noise in the second quarter as we cycle through the timing of reimbursement payments and year on year bonus impacts in total these result in an expected eps headwind of around 13 but both of these items were budgeted in fiscal year 20 and have no impact on full year guidance let s now look in more detail on the results first quarter sales were up 1 6 including a currency headwind of 0 7 on a constant currency basis sales were up 2 3 adjusted operating income declined 15 4 on a constant currency basis reflecting lower gross margin in the us and a difficult uk market adjusted eps was 1 37 a constant currency decline of 5 7 our share repurchase program contributed 4 percentage points of growth and an additional 5 7 percentage points came from a favorable tax rate as we benefited from a number of discrete items the result included adverse items of over 5 percentage points including the year on year bonus impact mark to market adjustments and lapping prior year supplier funding gaap eps declined 19 8 to 0 95 and also reflected costs relating to the rite aid transaction and the implementation of the transformational cost management program now let s move to retail pharmacy usa sales increased 1 6 in the quarter with 2 9 growth in pharmacy partially offset by lower retail sales note that the sales growth includes a negative impact of 50 basis points due to our store optimization programs adjusted gross profit declined 4 9 due to lower pharmacy and retail gross profit adjusted sg a spend decreased 1 6 in the quarter and was 17 6 of sales an improvement of 0 6 percentage points versus prior year the decline in sg a clearly shows our strong execution against our transformational cost management program with savings more than offsetting incremental investments the impact of inflation and the year on year bonus impact adjusted operating income declined 16 2 as the sg a savings were not enough to offset the decline in gross profit and the adverse items i mentioned earlier in total these adverse items accounted for over 6 percentage points of the decline in operating income now let s look in more detail at pharmacy total pharmacy sales increased 2 9 versus prior year reflecting continued brand inflation and script volume growth central specialty sales continue to grow nicely up 9 3 versus prior year comp pharmacy sales were up 2 5 and comp scripts grew 2 8 while this was weaker than expected we have seen improved growth in recent weeks market share for the quarter was 20 9 down 55 basis points versus prior year including the impact from our store optimization program adjusted gross profit decreased mid single digit as the impact of procurement savings and script growth was more than offset by reimbursement pressure turning next to our us retail business total retail sales declined 2 2 in the quarter impacted by store optimization comp retail sales declined 0 5 and continued to show an improving trend excluding tobacco and e cigarettes comp sales were up 0 8 as you know we are exiting the sale of e cigarettes while this did not have a significant impact on comps this quarter it will have a bigger impact from the next quarter onwards and we continue to anticipate a full year eps impact of around 0 06 we saw a solid comp growth in our core categories with health and wellness up 3 3 and beauty up 2 5 we estimate a tailwind of around 80 basis points from cough cold flu retail adjusted gross profit declined low single digits due to lower sales including the impact of store optimization programs higher shrink and the timing of prior year supplier funding adjusted gross margin declined slightly however excluding the higher shrink and supplier funding timing underlying category margins were in line with prior year turning next to retail pharmacy international and as usual i will talk to constant currency numbers sales decreased 2 7 mainly due to the uk and chile boots uk comp pharmacy sales increased 0 9 in the quarter reflecting relatively higher nhs reimbursement levels and increased sales from services partly offset by lower script volume boots uk comp retail sales declined 2 9 as the uk high street continued to be very challenging however overall we held market share adjusted operating income was down 39 1 mainly due to lower uk retail sales volume and margin the results include an adverse impact of 13 percentage points from the year on year bonus impact and higher technology investments turning now to the pharmaceutical wholesale division which i ll also discuss in constant currency the pharmaceutical wholesale division delivered another strong quarter with sales up 8 3 led by emerging markets and the uk the change in the customer contract which i ve mentioned before helped our uk performance contributing 1 4 to the overall sales growth we have now lapped the impact of this contract change adjusted operating income increased 4 9 reflecting strong revenue performance and a higher contribution from amerisourcebergen this strategic joint venture with mckesson aims to drive sustainable profitable growth in the largest pharmaceutical drug market in europe by leveraging scale and improving efficiency mid term we expect the jv to be eps accretive and to accelerate our pharmaceutical wholesale profit growth turning next to cash flow operating cash flow was 1 1 billion up 601 million

cost management program in october we raised our annual cost savings target to in excess of 1 8 billion by fiscal 2022 we now have a very robust pipeline and our savings initiatives are gaining

our company through our partnership an extraordinary foundation on which to build the work that we are doing today is creating a strong and flexible engine of our growth in our businesses for many years to come thank you now we will take your questions questions and answers operator your first question comes from the line of robert jones from goldman sachs your line is open robert jones goldman sachs co analyst great thanks thanks for taking the question i know there s a lot of moving pieces and it s only the first quarter but if i just take a step back clear eps was down around 6 in the quarter below the full fiscal year guidance it sounds like james if i m hearing you correctly next quarter given some of the moving pieces it could see an even steeper decline in eps i guess if we think about the back half could you maybe just give us the building blocks or the things that you guys have visibility into that gives you confidence that the back half can get you into that flat plus or minus 3 eps for the year james kehoe executive vice president and global chief financial officer yeah that s an expected question obviously let me just give you a little bit of context on the first quarter however first i think the only real surprise we had in the first quarter was on the script volume it did come in weaker than we expected we were thinking of a number of around 4 and we come in at 2 8 that s the piece that and i want to be clear our internal budget was 1 37 and we came in over budget what we had was a favorability on tax offsetting script growth in q1 so that was the one thing we were disappointed on we had a lot of stuff we re very happy about so free cash flow was off the charts we beat our internal budget by hundreds of millions largely driven by programs we re implementing in the us as stefano said in his comments transformational cost management program and that s key to the answer to your question is i will classify it right now is well ahead of track particularly due to actions in the us and the u k another items i d highlight that shouldn t be lost on you we finally we have nailed one of the first steps in the kroger relationship we think it s extremely positive that we have started up a gpo and i think it will lead to many good things in the future and then finally a strategic deal in a problematic german wholesale market which we think will drive tremendous value longer term so we think there was a lot of good things that happened and script growth was the one that was more challenging let me give you a prospect of looking forward is and actually we re a little bit surprised as well we re seeing quite a strong momentum in the current month of december so we believe when we call out 5 percentage points of items in the first quarter we re probably under calling that that were clear shifts between call at the thanksgiving period christmas periods and i don t want to give the precise number but our script growth is in solid mid single digit growth in the month of december so we re clearly feeling that we re not really reading why the shifts are happening that well we know cough cold flu is driving some of the buoyancy in december so we are seeing signals but we are counting on to hit our full year guidance we do need or script growth to be in the 3 5 to 4 kind of maybe 4 5 depending on the quarter but right now in december we re seeing numbers in excess of that so script growth is the key one the other key one is that will drive increasing performance as we exit the year obviously as you take out costs the cost take out is over the course of the year so the savings roughly in the first quarter are around 15 so of the total goal of we haven t given the numbers a large number were less than 15 in q1 as we exit the year we will be up double the run rate of savings so overheads will become a much more significant driver in the second half and i do want to point out for that for a company of our size with the amount of overheads we have the total overheads were down 1 6 in the quarter in the context and i think it s important to have the context we did say that the combination of inflation and volume impacts is about 400 million you have the bonus year on year that s in the region of 350 million 400 million and we have incremental investments of 100 million to 150 million so it will give you some indication of the size of the cost management initiatives and i think we ll come back next quarter with probably more visibility on the potential further opportunity on the cost program but i just finished answering your question i think if you were to do your model again for the full year we will probably have a slight favorability in taxes so call it somewhat 0 6 0 7 on the full year and we will have more coming from overheads and probably slightly less coming from gross profit because we had a miss in the first quarter on scripts so that s why we feel it s basically the overheads and some tax opportunity that we feel we can offset the call of the script under delivery in q1 does that cover what you were looking for robert jones goldman sachs co analyst that s tremendously helpful and i guess just one other probably anticipated question again just around the prime relationship in the wake of the prime express cigna announcement just wanted to get any update on how you guys are viewing the prime relationship any impact of the alliance or ex jv just as we think about how that relationship played out for you this past year relative to your expectations or how it would contribute in 2020 would be helpful thank you alex gourlay co chief operating officer hi bob it s alex here yeah we have recontacted with prime in a direct relationship so prime is now working with express scripts as a pbm working with us in a direct relationship so we anticipate to hold our market share with prime and potentially grow as a prime model will be more competitive in a marketplace so our relationship with prime continues to be a very strong one and we continue to walk you very well with independent blues so we are happy with the situation in terms of the impact obviously we ve readjusted the margin of debts but it really was in forecast in budget so we had expected this impact and had planned for it on alliancerx side alliancerx actually is doing ok at the moment but again we have a great relationship with prime we are speaking to them how do we adopt to an ever changing specialty marketplace which is becoming even more important for both of us we expect to have conversations next year along these lines to improve that model further so all is good from our point of view and we wish prime success with their new model and in that work we feel very confident that we will benefit from that relationship in the future robert jones goldman sachs co analyst thank you operator your next question comes from the line of eric percher from nephron research your line is open eric percher nephron research llc analyst thank you and thanks for the commentary on the cadence with respect to volume and cost maybe to hit on one other item reimbursement and the impact on 1 1 20 i know you gave us a 13 number i think was reimbursement and bonus but can you provide a little bit more context on what the outlook is as we move from q1 into q2 on 1 1 20 james kehoe executive vice president and global chief financial officer yeah the 13 reference was to q2 and we re specifically highlighting two things in the quarter and i would say it s like 7 due to reimbursement timing and the other is 6 is due to bonus year on year and the reason we called out the q2 reimbursement is it really is a timing item it s a true up of prior year contracts that occurs typically in the april may june timeline of the year and as it happened in the prior year there was no true up so it s not really a reimbursement impact year on year in terms of increase in contract prices it s a contractual true up of the contract for prior year and it s quite a large number because it impacts 7 percentage points we didn t actually call out anything on q1 what we said about q1 is reimbursement was actually broadly in line with the plans we ve put together because if you recall when we gave guidance we said at the time that i think 58 or 60 of all of our contracts were already defined when we gave guidance so we had fairly decent line of sight to the full year reimbursement and we came within 20 million of the reimbursement estimate for the first quarter so we were actually quite pleased with that because it s quite difficult to forecast reimbursement and you know we have looked back on some of our prior guidance on the quarters and the reason for giving something on q2 just to highlight this exceptional reimbursement of timing true up right now as we sit we have no reason to call any different outlook on reimbursement for the full year we should presume that means plus or minus 50 million so it s we were pleasantly surprised with the q1 on that side and i reiterate our issue on pharmacy in q1 nothing to do with procurement nothing to do with reimbursement they were actually net probably slightly positive it was probably it was all script volume so it was just lighter than we would have planned it to be eric percher nephron research llc analyst that s really helpful and reimbursement in the uk it sounds like nhs funding did improve but we didn t see it in the revenue line was this simply the new contract or have you seen any makeover for the debt and the lack of payment last year alex gourlay co chief operating officer so again there is really two stories here hi it s alex here one is as you say there has been a stabilization of payment which is in the marketplace can be seen on the nhs site and secondly we have taken some actions to reduce loss making services that we have in the uk and to make them more profitable as a result of that we ve lost some volume not as much volume as we had expected to be honest but some volume and we re quite pleased that with the retention of customers with these actions and that s what s caused a slight further decrease in terms of our revenue in the uk it s not reimbursement it s actions we ve taken to reduce loss making services that we were offering eric percher nephron research llc analyst thank you operator your next question comes from the line of elizabeth anderson from evercore your line is open elizabeth anderson evercore isi analyst hi good morning guys a couple of times you mentioned or should have alluded to potentially a little bit of a change in competitive environment in the us pharmacy or perhaps some pressure on or versus your expectations in the quarter in terms of script growth could you comment more broadly on sort of what you re seeing there and sort of your thoughts on how that s progressing alex gourlay co chief operating officer hi elizabeth it s alex here i think as the consolidation in the market has really accelerated both vertically and horizontally and as for example the prime express deal is a good example of this the pbms are working more closely together that s clearly putting more pressure on the marketplace for better pricing and that s really what we are alluding to so we are working hard as james has said as we always have done to mitigate that pressure through cost programs and through driving volume as james is going to say very clearly we were disappointed with the volume growth in q1 part of that was timing as james has said and part of that is because the fact that we lost some access to some particular some medicaid networks during the summer that is rolling into this year and as we spoke to i think it was the last quarter we re working investigating obviously with advanced rx the opportunity for us to to become more efficient together and offer a new model in the medicaid business we recognize that we are under share there and we have to operate differently in that marketplace in medicare we continue to do very well with unitedhealthcare we re really pleased with the relationship and the new ma plan as we ve spoke to in the prepared comments has done well and we expect that will come through in the changes in january 1 obviously we are doing less well with the other a strong performer which is aetna insurance we have done really well and we are doing less well with them for maybe obvious reasons but in the whole we feel we are going to be there or thereabouts in medicare then in commercial already said and replied previously they will be very pleased to have renewed the contract with prime which again is a very important book of business for us in the commercial network so i think that s the picture from my point of view and i don t know if question elizabeth that s how we see it and all underpins the 3 5 to 4 volume growth that we expect to see in the full year elizabeth anderson evercore isi analyst okay perfect that s very helpful thank you operator your next question comes from the line of lisa gill from jpmorgan your line is open lisa gill jp morgan analyst thanks very much good morning i wanted to start with just some thoughts around branded inflation as well as generic procurement in the current market as we think about the gross margins and how this will impact it i m just wondering james first can you just talk about what s in your current expectation and guidance james kehoe executive vice president and global chief financial officer what we saw in i ll tell you what we ve seen in q1 we saw branded inflation of around 4 and we most of the market read seem to be the inflation and this is on a constant mix basis so like for like skus deflation of around 4 we would say that internally on generics sorry and maybe i ll ask alex to weigh in and then two is we would be outperforming versus that 4 will probably be in mid to high single digit and we generally are projecting that kind of number going forward somewhere in the mid to high single digit deflation mix adjustment which is it s probably quarters will change versus market but generally that s what we re seeing in the market and we re delivering slightly better in terms of cost reduction in the p l i don t know alex if you want to add alex gourlay co chief operating officer yeah i think the and we continue to feel very good about our global operation and we via attack delivering just slightly beyond reductions in cogs cost of goods so that s exactly what we are seeing james kehoe executive vice president and global chief financial officer yeah alex gourlay co chief operating officer yeah lisa gill jp morgan analyst and then alex you talked about a number of healthcare initiatives and updates a few of that you didn t touched on today would be labcorp and humana one on the labcorp side can you just talk about where you are today are you on track on the humana side any plans to expand can you talk about united on the medicare advantage side i m curious what you re doing with humana and then just more broadly speaking the strategic priority for expanding the role of pharmacy as you know i m a big believer in that as well but with the reimbursement pressure do you ever see that subsiding in any way where you can actually get ahead of that where you can start to change the paradigm and i know i ve asked this for multiple years but do you finally think that you can start to see that on the horizon as you start to have bigger and bigger relationships like north of 100 million lives now in the combination of prime and express you think about large relationships like united alex gourlay co chief operating officer so i think maybe start with the humana questions so we ve opened up preferred partners in primary care it looks very good and is operating really well and the relationship between the pharmacist and doctors is really close so we continue to feel really good about that very small but important test joint venture and of course we ve opened up two also with the clinical villagemd which i m sure you know down in houston will be five in total by the end of february and again we are very very pleased with how that s operating already we ve taken a small stake in that company villagemd as well which we re pleased to do and we see that partnership of the doctor and the pharmacist been fundamental to the future of community healthcare delivery going forward in core to our model on the lending lots about how we can do two things take cost out the system together and get customers to understand and do the medications better and change the lifestyles and so it s really interesting walk and it points to maybe your last question so that s on the humana on labcorp we re bang on track in terms of number of service centers opened i think we ll have well over 100 in the ground by the end of this quarter i think that s really bang on track and they are performing well we are seeing nps scores and the usage of the centers all in or above our expectations so we are very pleased with our program and we expect 600 and maybe more we don t know yet in the ground within the four years as we promised and role of pharmacist we are working really hard to get our new system in as james spoke to in prepared remarks we re going to be accelerating that system from the current pace that will be fundamental to be in the cloud the date will be in the cloud it will be fundamental to taking the work code out and freeing up our pharmacists to really drive that in future we re seeing increased payments from certain insurers and pbms particularly in medicare d we really like working with united because they are stretching to this in terms of getting the payment but the very clear on the goalposts that we have to hit to get the payment and we ve been successful in achieving that i do believe other insurance companies will follow their leads and the government eventually will also make sure that we have clear kpis going forward as well so yeah it s a longer play for sure but we are really committed to and we re making more progress and appears right now than our numbers on and we continue to keep on pushing this to fundamental to pharmacy and fundamental we believe to a more efficient healthcare system in the us lisa gill jp morgan analyst and then just for understanding that none of that is in your expectation for 2020 so i heard you say longer term a couple of times in this conversation so should we anticipate that this could potentially impact fiscal 2021 or 2022 how do we just think about it from a timing perspective alex gourlay co chief operating officer yeah we are already earning some money back as you know the famous well so we are earning more money back than we did previously and the amount of money available to us is growing and our ability to get that money grows as we get our systems in and of course we re also deploying pharmacy specific of pharmacists i think we have about 150 internet work who are specifically working to achieve these performance outcomes so i think this will start to affect 21 and 22 it s already given us some relief in 20 as well there is improved money in our forecast for performance networks lisa gill jp morgan analyst okay great thank you for the comments operator your next question comes from the line of soo romanoff from morningstar your line is open soo romanoff morningstar analyst thank you for taking the question the background you ve given on a lot of initiatives have been great perhaps maybe specialties become such a big component of your business i mean is that is that mix also impacting the margins as well james kehoe executive vice president and global chief financial officer yeah we called that out in the quarter it impact by about 50 basis points because it s growing at high single digit versus the pharmacy scripts of 2 8 so it s driving adverse mix of 50 basis points soo romanoff morningstar analyst and i guess that makes sense i mean do the initiatives that you re kind of putting in place help expand those margins or also provide kind of that long term wellness and part of the healthcare transformation alex gourlay co chief operating officer yeah absolutely soo i mean we strongly believe in having a community presence and as you know we have two models we have one which of course to the doctors who are practicing and specialty for example in oncology and then we have pharmacies inside of their hospitals and sort of healthcare systems we have 300 plus of these and we ve now got urac accreditation for them all so every single pharmacy that we run in the community which is very unusual i believe will be fast to achieve this has got that accreditation that means more attractive to the manufacturers because they know that we will take full care of the patient and more and more patients are living longer with diseases in communities so we believe the local model that will become important to the future of healthcare delivery and always be a central fill model i m sure but we believe the local model will become more and more important also we announced our relationship with shields shields as a variance i think platform that s working with healthcare systems and we have a lot of relationships with healthcare systems as you know to make sure as patients leave hospitals they maintain themselves on the drugs being dispensed primarily by the hospital pharmacy so again we are investing both in technology with shields and also as well in terms of data and tracking customers and low community pharmacies to make sure pharmacist can actually take care of these customers as it lifts and more often a home and we re also of course working closely with prime as we said already to make sure that we have a really efficient and effective central model and most importantly of all we have outstanding relationships with the manufacturers it s really driven both through our relationship with amerisourcebergen and also the ornella with her team at global level to make sure that we have the very best relationships so while these manufacturers are bringing these new and unique products to the markets and we feel as a global partner we can apply our capabilities for them in the us market through our relationship operator your next question comes from the line of eric coldwell from baird your line is open eric coldwell robert w baird co analyst thank you very much i know it s difficult to parse this out with the store closings in the uk as well as the shift to more services from volume perhaps but could you give us a clear sense on the impact of the nhs reimbursement scheme change either quarter over quarter or year over year and then how did that really stack up compared to your expectations it sounds ok but i d like to get a little more detail on that in terms of not only the quarter over quarter but also how that progresses through the next few quarters thank you alex gourlay co chief operating officer sure yeah i know it s alex here no it was exactly as we expected so the quarter for pharmacy both in volume as i said already were slightly below or on the market in terms of underlying business but we gave up some scripts because of some unprofitable services in terms of margin exactly as we had expected this tracking too as we expected so it s relatively easy to track this because the government resigned the five year contract with the industry through what s called the psnc which represents all pharmacies in the uk as a one contract so we can track this quite carefully it does vary sometimes from from quarter to quarter but it s trued up in a way which is transparent so we feel very confident that we ve got a good line of sight to this we feel very confident that we are working operationally very well in the uk and we have additional piece of work there which is called pharmacy of the future an idea really is to transform the operating model for pharmacy in the uk this will take some time of course we ve already marked that investment we are investing strongly in a new farm system we ve rolled out 1 400 which is well over half of the state and it s now present all the home countries including scotland most recently so again we are feeling pretty good about the visibility we re not feeling as good about the profitability of pharmacy we believe that that needs to improved further so that we can reinvest back in community pharmacy properly in the years ahead but we are very committed to getting that operating model understood and changed over time james kehoe executive vice president and global chief financial officer yeah if you want to characterize the euro of prior year it was a tough year for pharmacy where there were a lot of untime impacts coming from nhs funding and there will be a general euro recovery from that it was surprising we were within 500 000 of the gross profit targets for pharmacy in the uk it was bang on target we are looking at a fairly sizable improvement in gross profit in the business this year so as alex mentioned earlier in his comments we have some marginal profitability businesses on the sidelines and we re aggressively driving the improvement of those so don t be surprised if you see script volumes and market share going down slightly we re addressing the profitability of sub categories that we don t think are strategic to the company and we definitely don t want to be in marginal profitability positions so a bit of a shift in the orientation in the business slightly more to profitability so as your modeling is out don t get fixated by script declines because the core business is actually quite solid and solid in the quarter eric coldwell robert w baird co analyst yeah got it thank you very much james kehoe executive vice president and global chief financial officer and just one point on the uk though as we go through it we did have a rough quarter in retail and it really does come down to the market and our share of the whole share overall quite interestingly though we ve seen in the last couple of weeks and it s maybe a little bit important as you think through your modeling we had a rough quarter not 40 decline now there was a lot of one time items in there probably half of that was one time adverse items just generally but as you think through this we saw a very very strong christmas period there are huge phasing on mainly of our primary markets the whole december month started out extremely slow the second last week of the month was extremely strong with high single digit revenue growth and in the last week of the year we again have mid to high single digit growth across our key categories and we re still getting in on bisecting just what happened but december performance is quite a bit more positive than the quarter we just came out of and the double surprise was it was achieved with higher margins than the prior year so we re rebalancing the commercial approach in the uk and we re not chasing volume at any cost and surprisingly we re seeing better volumes and we re seeing better margins now it s only two weeks so it s too early to churn success but we ve seen a better performance across december across the entire the main two markets actually both businesses have done quite well in the christmas period very well actually operator your next question comes from the line of kevin caliendo from ubs your line is open kevin caliendo ubs investment bank analyst hi thanks for taking my call you mentioned you had 60 of your pbm contract set when you gave guidance and now you ve renewed prime what remains outstanding and how much variance is there really at this point could there be an reimbursements as we look out over the rest of the year alex gourlay co chief operating officer hi kevin it s alex here firstly i mean there ll be some small net works which can change mid year for sure but the vast majority now is contracted the vast majority i can t give a precise number but i will always give you an estimate it will over 90 because the consolidation market is very clear and yeah so that s where we are but so we feel we have good line of state in this fiscal year and again we will start negotiating the majority of the med d contracts as we move through the summer months but that will be before starting january 1st 2021 kevin caliendo ubs investment bank analyst and the renewal prime that takes you through is it more than a one year contract meaning like the express relationship won t have any impact on that at all going forward alex gourlay co chief operating officer that s right i mean we don t disclose the length of the contracts but this is a multi year deal typical of a longish commercial contract kevin caliendo ubs investment bank analyst got it and one last one have you guys looked at the oecd proposals around multinational corporation tax rules they are obviously still just proposals but wondering if they were implemented but will it any way impact walgreens or wbad or anything like that stefano pessina executive vice chairman and chief executive officer we have i would say quite expert tax group and they are extremely active they are all over this think you have to wait till dust settles on these things but we would obviously realign the corporate structure according to new legislation as it comes along we think that we that s in a it s in the right location it delivers attractive tax positions but it s all vetted and approved by all jurisdictions globally and it s in line with current policy as policies change globally we will adapt to the policies but we have an attractive tax rate compared to our peer set by quite a number of percentage points and we ll try and maintain that as much as possible but you can be sure the team is all over this and we don t see any short term risks kevin caliendo ubs investment bank analyst great thanks so much that s really helpful operator our last question comes from michael cherny from bank of america your line is open michael cherny bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks for squeezing me in here so i want to tie back i guess a big picture question at the beginning you talked about the broader strategy you re taking i know you mentioned the role of pharmacy going forward you ve highlighted a number of the various different partnerships i guess as you think about the next call or rest of this fiscal year two three years what are some of the checkpoints you re looking for relative to the partnership model relative to the strategy relative to the ebit contribution from all of these to essentially declare success or if some of them are going to kind of cut bait and how does that play into the broader on thought process around the organization and the role and where you sit in the market on a go forward basis given as well but you re also going through a pretty broad restructuring about the cost base and the store footprint alex gourlay co chief operating officer thanks michael yeah it s alex here so i think if we start with our key priorities and they know that they start with managing of the drug store and new retail offerings but probably more advanced with the kroger relationship and the reason why that s quite important is because it allows us to do two things allows us to walk with them on the convenience model which is really important to drive footfall into our physical stores and also really important from a consumer point of view the definition of convenience is such a big change in the marketplace so we are feeling really good about that i said in my prepared remarks we are seeing substantial sales growth both in the box itself and also in the categories that we are supporting we ve also launched our own products i think we ve got we re going to have them in the just over 15 16 17 kroger stores so that for this gives us an opportunity to put our health and beauty composition and private label on brands into their customers views as well and then lastly when you put together the two customer sets we serve together around about 20 million customers a day between us so we have a strong strong presence in american households and our ability therefore to work with them being the the genuine part of america and those being very very competent we believe in pharmacy health and to some extent beauty category as it relates to healthcare and wellness we believe that s going to be a strong opportunity the procurement structure allows us to earn money in the short to medium term and of course we will be working together on other issues in the supply chain and also in other issues on procurement we believe as well in the future so that s one area where i think we have made good progress both tactically and strategically with healthcare we are well into testing quality brands and quality offers in partnership with others sort of the acceleration of our lessons learned and optical is one example of it we are working with grandvision who are renowned as a quality optical retailer with access to insurance and the very best brands we really are delighted to get more opportunities to be doctors into our stores alongside pharmacists and we believe that well that will be a longer term model we know from experience in europe that that model can be really effective in delivering end to end primary care in communities and last but not least into the find care platform that we have built very quietly with an internal team has really grown and we believe that will be a digital marketplace that will become very important to us into the market in the future but will take time to grow so that s really where we are in terms of that measure so we expect some contribution over time in the retail side faster than the contribution maybe in the healthcare side but the healthcare side will come through the hill of scripts over time and the access to more james kehoe executive vice president and global chief financial officer and maybe one we didn t get this question but progress on digitalization in the quarter we ve just launched two major initiatives launched and funded i want to kind of go back to the previous guidance we gave we ve got 500 million of capital expenditures behind digital and development plus about 100 million to 150 million of expense this year and we launched two big initiatives in the last account one is on mass personalization and that s how do you use your marketing dollars more effectively to target a better connection with the consumer we believe we will significantly underpin particularly the retail revenue profile for a multi year period and these are not small investments they are in the 50 million to 100 million range and the second one is the the prescription journey and i use that one very generically but again it s a similar size of investment and it s on a two speed we re not waiting for the core systems to be upgraded it s on a parallel process and this is a 2 ish journey and what s it going to do what s going to connect the consumer much more closely with the prescription how they want to deliver how they want to pay for it the transparency of the cost of it and the options we give consumers and getting closer to consumers and the second thing it will do it will take friction out of the system which means it will reduce the cost to fill a prescription so we re working on initiatives that don t just boost take out costs but they actually boost revenue and the connectivity to patients and consumers longer term and some of that will be lost these investments are large and they re multi year and they will also drive long term revenue and sustainable growth michael cherny bank of america merrill lynch analyst and i guess just quickly how do you balance all of those investments in long term initiatives against some of the quarterly volatility and reimbursement risks and the moving pieces on the transformational cost program that you see stefano pessina executive vice chairman and chief executive officer it s tough alex gourlay co chief operating officer it s not easy but we have our program management approach we have got a lot of cable people but it s not easy in every but we are paying a lot of attention to the future and to today as you can tell by the comments that james have made james kehoe executive vice president and global chief financial officer a lot of these funds go through the transformational cost management program and alex myself and ornella and head of hr sit on it we are the four people on it so it s a small team takes decisions quickly and frankly some of these are tough trade offs and in some quarters you theoretically can t afford it but you have to do it or otherwise you re going to damage the long term future of the company stefano pessina executive vice chairman and chief executive officer and this is the problem it s stefano yes every strategy our strategy is as it has always been a medium long term strategy and we believe in the pharmacy we believe in the hold that the pharmacies will have in future of course the pharmacy will have to be able to satisfy the needs of the patients and the needs of the customers and we are working in that direction not all the pharmacies will provide in future not all the pharmacies will be important in the local economy of the city or the villages we try to be in pharmacy that can have a whole and of course we have to invest we had to invest now for the future if we work just for the next quarter maybe we will have a little better results but at the end we will probably create a problem over the long survival of our stores of our pharmacies and now you have to take a decision either you believe in the strategy which is focused on the long term or you just try to look at the next quarters and maybe you try to do deals just to let s say make easier over less evidence the problems that you have we have decided to work for the long term and i hope that at the end we would be right operator there are no further questions at this time i turn the call back over to the presenters gerald gradwell senior vice president of special projects and

competitive us pharmacy environment and soft trading conditions in the uk that said as you will hear there are a number of items affecting the year on year comparisons and given the initiatives that we have under way we are maintaining our full year guidance in the quarter we continued to make progress against all four of our core strategic priorities we are making progress in moving our data resources to a new and more flexible cloud based infrastructure with a significant benefits that brings we have also made a good progress with the development of new services to build on this new infrastructure to announce our customer experiences make our teams more efficient and effective and open new opportunities for our businesses clearly this work on the digitalization of our company must and are closely tie in with our work to modernize our retail offering and the shape and structure of our retail footprint at the same time we are working with partners to redefine the delivery of healthcare in the community and the important role of pharmacy in the immediate and longer term future and all of these is of course supported and fueled by our transformational cost management program which have made substantive progress during the quarter finally we have also continued to make progress on a number of significant partnerships both established a new to enhance our offering and efficiency and toward the value growth in our businesses in the quarter we entered into a procurement joint venture with kroger building on the already strong relationship that has been formed between kroger and walgreens and we announced a joint venture with mckesson to bring together our two businesses in germany improving our reach and scale with a focus on enhancing the efficiency and performance of whole combined wholesale operation in the significant german pharmaceutical wholesale market i will come back to make a few comments on the future at the end of our presentation but now i will ask james and alex to take us through the results in a little more detail james james kehoe executive vice president and global chief financial officer thank you stefano and good morning adjusted eps was 1 37 5 7 lower than prior year on a constant currency basis the year on year comparison was impacted by around 5 percentage points of adverse items including the year on year bonus impact in retail pharmacy usa strong cost management and improved retail comp sales were offset by lower gross margin retail pharmacy international continued to be negatively impacted by a challenging uk market and we saw continued strong performance from pharmaceutical wholesale our transformational cost management program is very much on track and we expect to achieve annual cost savings in excess of 1 8 billion by 2022 cash generation was very strong in the quarter with free cash flow of 674 million 684 million better than prior year and finally we are maintaining our guidance for fiscal year 20 of flat adjusted earnings per share on a constant currency basis with a range of plus or minus 3 looking forward we see improved core business trends with however some noise in the second quarter as we cycle through the timing of reimbursement payments and year on year bonus impacts in total these result in an expected eps headwind of around 13 but both of these items were budgeted in fiscal year 20 and have no impact on full year guidance let s now look in more detail on the results first quarter sales were up 1 6 including a currency headwind of 0 7 on a constant currency basis sales were up 2 3 adjusted operating income declined 15 4 on a constant currency basis reflecting lower gross margin in the us and a difficult uk market adjusted eps was 1 37 a constant currency decline of 5 7 our share repurchase program contributed 4 percentage points of growth and an additional 5 7 percentage points came from a favorable tax rate as we benefited from a number of discrete items the result included adverse items of over 5 percentage points including the year on year bonus impact mark to market adjustments and lapping prior year supplier funding gaap eps declined 19 8 to 0 95 and also reflected costs relating to the rite aid transaction and the implementation of the transformational cost management program now let s move to retail pharmacy usa sales increased 1 6 in the quarter with 2 9 growth in pharmacy partially offset by lower retail sales note that the sales growth includes a negative impact of 50 basis points due to our store optimization programs adjusted gross profit declined 4 9 due to lower pharmacy and retail gross profit adjusted sg a spend decreased 1 6 in the quarter and was 17 6 of sales an improvement of 0 6 percentage points versus prior year the decline in sg a clearly shows our strong execution against our transformational cost management program with savings more than offsetting incremental investments the impact of inflation and the year on year bonus impact adjusted operating income declined 16 2 as the sg a savings were not enough to offset the decline in gross profit and the adverse items i mentioned earlier in total these adverse items accounted for over 6 percentage points of the decline in operating income now let s look in more detail at pharmacy total pharmacy sales increased 2 9 versus prior year reflecting continued brand inflation and script volume growth central specialty sales continue to grow nicely up 9 3 versus prior year comp pharmacy sales were up 2 5 and comp scripts grew 2 8 while this was weaker than expected we have seen improved growth in recent weeks market share for the quarter was 20 9 down 55 basis points versus prior year including the impact from our store optimization program adjusted gross profit decreased mid single digit as the impact of procurement savings and script growth was more than offset by reimbursement pressure turning next to our us retail business total retail sales declined 2 2 in the quarter impacted by store optimization comp retail sales declined 0 5 and continued to show an improving trend excluding tobacco and e cigarettes comp sales were up 0 8 as you know we are exiting the sale of e cigarettes while this did not have a significant impact on comps this quarter it will have a bigger impact from the next quarter onwards and we continue to anticipate a full year eps impact of around 0 06 we saw a solid comp growth in our core categories with health and wellness up 3 3 and beauty up 2 5 we estimate a tailwind of around 80 basis points from cough cold flu retail adjusted gross profit declined low single digits due to lower sales including the impact of store optimization programs higher shrink and the timing of prior year supplier funding adjusted gross margin declined slightly however excluding the higher shrink and supplier funding timing underlying category margins were in line with prior year turning next to retail pharmacy international and as usual i will talk to constant currency numbers sales decreased 2 7 mainly due to the uk and chile boots uk comp pharmacy sales increased 0 9 in the quarter reflecting relatively higher nhs reimbursement levels and increased sales from services partly offset by lower script volume boots uk comp retail sales declined 2 9 as the uk high street continued to be very challenging however overall we held market share adjusted operating income was down 39 1 mainly due to lower uk retail sales volume and margin the results include an adverse impact of 13 percentage points from the year on year bonus impact and higher technology investments turning now to the pharmaceutical wholesale division which i ll also discuss in constant currency the pharmaceutical wholesale division delivered another strong quarter with sales up 8 3 led by emerging markets and the uk the change in the customer contract which i ve mentioned before helped our uk performance contributing 1 4 to the overall sales growth we have now lapped the impact of this contract change adjusted operating income increased 4 9 reflecting strong revenue performance and a higher contribution from amerisourcebergen this strategic joint venture with mckesson aims to drive sustainable profitable growth in the largest pharmaceutical drug market in europe by leveraging scale and improving efficiency mid term we expect the jv to be eps accretive and to accelerate our pharmaceutical wholesale profit growth turning next to cash flow operating cash flow was 1 1 billion up 601 million versus prior year free cash flow was strong at 674 million up 684 million on prior year our key working capital initiatives are on track we are removing excess inventory from the system and we have started to extend payment terms to industry leading levels and we have a strong pipeline of initiatives to fuel our cash flow generation over a multiyear period let s turn now to our transformational cost management program in october we raised our annual cost savings target to in excess of 1 8 billion by fiscal 2022 we now have a very robust pipeline and our savings initiatives are gaining momentum this gives us a much higher level of confidence that we can exceed 1 8 billion target importantly these savings will allow us to fund the investments needed to create new and innovative business models let me now give you some detail on our activities in the quarter on smart spend we are accelerating our energy management efficiency program and we see opportunities to ramp up our procurement activities in goods not for resale the energy management program is interesting uled lighting saves money is environmentally friendly and improves the store experience for consumers this is a perfect example of save to invest to grow on smart organization we re undertaking an end to end process review in boots uk covering all major business processes with the aim of transforming how we operate ultimately leading to a lean and effective operating model we are now actively planning the implementation of global business services and we have implemented the second wave of headquarter cost reductions in mexico chile and thailand on divisional optimization we have completed 114 of the 200 walgreens store closures and 28 of the 200 boots uk closures we continue to test new store formats in the us and we re now operating 23 small stores with encouraging results on it we have started implementation of a new operating model and our vendor optimization work is progressing well for example we recently selected tata consulting services as our new partner to accelerate the work on our critical pharmacy operating system on digitalization we have prioritized investments in mass personalization and reinventing the pharmacy prescription journey now i ll hand over to alex alex gourlay co chief operating officer thank you james i ll now update you in some of the actions we ve taken in the us during the quarter starting with a retail offering our strategic partnership with kroger is progressing well the initial kroger express pilot in northern kentucky has been running for just over one year and the pilot in knoxville tennessee for five months we ve seen very positive results so far with a strong sales list building on the success of these pilots we formed the group procurement office retail procurement alliance with kroger in december to purchase both of our private label goods we expect this joint venture to deliver cost savings encourage sourcing innovation and generate efficiencies across the supply chain our strategy of focusing on the higher margin health and wellness and beauty categories is delivering benefits and both delivered solid performances

skincare offering in over 900 stores which we expect to drive future performance moving on to healthcare we have opened the second of five villagemd primary care locations in houston our wellness partnership with jenny craig is progressing well and we are on track to open approximately 100 locations by the end of january we re also in the process of converting our optical pilots to the brand which offers improved insurance coverage and stronger consumer brands in specialty i m delighted to see that all 300 community based specialty pharmacies have received urac accreditation and we

partnership with unitedhealthcare we continue to create new opportunities for growth in medicare advantage we are very pleased with customer adoption of the new core branded medicare advantage product

customer journey and broaden access to healthcare we launched our online pharmacy in may 2019 which has made solid progress in the markets we have made further good progress on digitalization our online business boots com delivered strong growth with sales up 12 versus prior year in the quarter we also saw a record breaking black friday weekend with result in online sales up around 25 and finally we have agreed an exclusive partnership to offer omnichannel photo and personalized gifting services in the uk and ireland i ll now hand you back to stefano for his closing comments stefano pessina executive vice chairman and chief executive officer thank you alex as you have heard this year has opened with a number of challenges the main changes that are impacting the global healthcare sector are generating some difficult conditions for our businesses as said change always brings opportunity we must act to meet the challenges and ensure we make the most of the opportunities we see seeing these opportunities and mindful of the challenges side we are maintaining our full year guidance for the year we continuously review our group to ensure we have the right mix of businesses to maximize our performance in a dynamic sector pursuing our strategic priorities is having a real impact in driving our businesses the changes in our markets are obscuring some of the positive impacts we are having but these will not be the case forever i have said before and i will say again i strongly believe in an expanded role for pharmacy and in our company s ability to play a significant part in shaping how healthcare is delivered in the community going forward i believe these as much today as i ever have i believe we have true financial strength as a business as we have demonstrated this quarter we have an extraordinary ability to generate strong and sustainable cash flow and we have many opportunities to deploy this cash flow to create real value i remain convinced that we have in our company through our partnership an extraordinary foundation on which to build the work that we are doing today is creating a strong and flexible engine of our growth in our businesses for many years to come thank you now we will take your questions questions and answers operator your first question comes from the line of robert jones from goldman sachs your line is open robert jones goldman sachs co analyst great thanks thanks for taking the question i know there s a lot of moving pieces and it s only the first quarter but if i just take a step back clear eps was down around 6 in the quarter below the full fiscal year guidance it sounds like james if i m hearing you correctly next quarter given some of the moving pieces it could see an even steeper decline in eps i guess if we think about the back half could you maybe just give us the building blocks or the things that you guys have visibility into that gives you confidence that the back half can get you into that flat plus or minus 3 eps for the year james kehoe executive vice president and global chief financial officer yeah that s an expected question obviously let me just give you a little bit of context on the first quarter however first i think the only real surprise we had in the first quarter was on the script volume it did come in weaker than we expected we were thinking of a number of around 4 and we come in at 2 8 that s the piece that and i want to be clear our internal budget was 1 37 and we came in over budget what we had was a favorability on tax offsetting script growth in q1 so that was the one thing we were disappointed on we had a lot of stuff we re very happy about so free cash flow was off the charts we beat our internal budget by hundreds of millions largely driven by programs we re implementing in the us as stefano said in his comments transformational cost management program and that s key to the answer to your question is i will classify it right now is well ahead of track particularly due to actions in the us and the u k another items i d highlight that shouldn t be lost on you we finally we have nailed one of the first steps in the kroger relationship we think it s extremely positive that we have started up a gpo and i think it will lead to many good things in the future and then finally a strategic deal in a problematic german wholesale market which we think will drive tremendous value longer term so we think there was a lot of good things that happened and script growth was the one that was more challenging let me give you a prospect of looking forward is and actually we re a little bit surprised as well we re seeing quite a strong momentum in the current month of december so we believe when we call out 5 percentage points of items in the first quarter we re probably under calling that that were clear shifts between call at the thanksgiving period christmas periods and i don t want to give the precise number but our script growth is in solid mid single digit growth in the month of december so we re clearly feeling that we re not really reading why the shifts are happening that well we know cough cold flu is driving some of the buoyancy in december so we are seeing signals but we are counting on to hit our full year guidance we do need or script growth to be in the 3 5 to 4 kind of maybe 4 5 depending on the quarter but right now in december we re seeing numbers in excess of that so script growth is the key one the other key one is that will drive increasing performance as we exit the year obviously as you take out costs the cost take out is over the course of the year so the savings roughly in the first quarter are around 15 so of the total goal of we haven t given the numbers a large number were less than 15 in q1 as we exit the year we will be up double the run rate of savings so overheads will become a much more significant driver in the second half and i do want to point out for that for a company of our size with the amount of overheads we have the total overheads were down 1 6 in the quarter in the context and i think it s important to have the context we did say that the combination of inflation and volume impacts is about 400 million you have the bonus year on year that s in the region of 350 million 400 million and we have incremental investments of 100 million to 150 million so it will give you some indication of the size of the cost management initiatives and i think we ll come back next quarter with probably more visibility on the potential further opportunity on the cost program but i just finished answering your question i think if you were to do your model again for the full year we will probably have a slight favorability in taxes so call it somewhat 0 6 0 7 on the full year and we will have more coming from overheads and probably slightly less coming from gross profit because we had a miss in the first quarter on scripts so that s why we feel it s basically the overheads and some tax opportunity that we feel we can offset the call of the script under delivery in q1 does that cover what you were looking for robert jones goldman sachs co analyst that s tremendously helpful and i guess just one other probably anticipated question again just around the prime relationship in the wake of the prime express cigna announcement just wanted to get any update on how you guys are viewing the prime relationship any impact of the alliance or ex jv just as we think about how that relationship played out for you this past year relative to your expectations or how it would contribute in 2020 would be helpful thank you alex gourlay co chief operating officer hi bob it s alex here yeah we have recontacted with prime in a direct relationship so prime is now working with express scripts as a pbm working with us in a direct relationship so we anticipate to hold our market share with prime and potentially grow as a prime model will be more competitive in a marketplace so our relationship with prime continues to be a very strong one and we continue to walk you very well with independent blues so we are happy with the situation in terms of the impact obviously we ve readjusted the margin of debts but it really was in forecast in budget so we had expected this impact and had planned for it on alliancerx side alliancerx actually is doing ok at the moment but again we have a great relationship with prime we are speaking to them how do we adopt to an ever changing specialty marketplace which is becoming even more important for both of us we expect to have conversations next year along these lines to improve that model further so all is good from our point of view and we wish prime success with their new model and in that work we feel very confident that we will benefit from that relationship in the future robert jones goldman sachs co analyst thank you operator your next question comes from the line of eric percher from nephron research your line is open eric percher nephron research llc analyst thank you and thanks for the commentary on the cadence with respect to volume and cost maybe to hit on one other item reimbursement and the impact on 1 1 20 i know you gave us a 13 number i think was reimbursement and bonus but can you provide a little bit more context on what the outlook is as we move from q1 into q2 on 1 1 20 james kehoe executive vice president and global chief financial officer yeah the 13 reference was to q2 and we re specifically highlighting two things in the quarter and i would say it s like 7 due to reimbursement timing and the other is 6 is due to bonus year on year and the reason we called out the q2 reimbursement is it really is a timing item it s a true up of prior year contracts that occurs typically in the april may june timeline of the year and as it happened in the prior year there was no true up so it s not really a reimbursement impact year on year in terms of increase in contract prices it s a contractual true up of the contract for prior year and it s quite a large number because it impacts 7 percentage points we didn t actually call out anything on q1 what we said about q1 is reimbursement was actually broadly in line with the plans we ve put together because if you recall when we gave guidance we said at the time that i think 58 or 60 of all of our contracts were already defined when we gave guidance so we had fairly decent line of sight to the full year reimbursement and we came within 20 million of the reimbursement estimate for the first quarter so we were actually quite pleased with that because it s quite difficult to forecast reimbursement and you know we have looked back on some of our prior guidance on the quarters and the reason for giving something on q2 just to highlight this exceptional reimbursement of timing true up right now as we sit we have no reason to call any different outlook on reimbursement for the full year we should presume that means plus or minus 50 million so it s we were pleasantly surprised with the q1 on that side and i reiterate our issue on pharmacy in q1 nothing to do with procurement nothing to do with reimbursement they were actually net probably slightly positive it was probably it was all script volume so it was just lighter than we would have planned it to be eric percher nephron research llc analyst that s really helpful and reimbursement in the uk it sounds like nhs funding did improve but we didn t see it in the revenue line was this simply the new contract or have you seen any makeover for the debt and the lack of payment last year alex gourlay co chief operating officer so again there is really two stories here hi it s alex here one is as you say there has been a stabilization of payment which is in the marketplace can be seen on the nhs site and secondly we have taken some actions to reduce loss making services that we have in the uk and to make them more profitable as a result of that we ve lost some volume not as much volume as we had expected to be honest but some volume and we re quite pleased that with the retention of customers with these actions and that s what s caused a slight further decrease in terms of our revenue in the uk it s not reimbursement it s actions we ve taken to reduce loss making services that we were offering eric percher nephron research llc analyst thank you operator your next question comes from the line of elizabeth anderson from evercore your line is open elizabeth anderson evercore isi analyst hi good morning guys a couple of times you mentioned or should have alluded to potentially a little bit of a change in competitive environment in the us pharmacy or perhaps some pressure on or versus your expectations in the quarter in terms of script growth could you comment more broadly on sort of what you re seeing there and sort of your thoughts on how that s progressing alex gourlay co chief operating officer hi elizabeth it s alex here i think as the consolidation in the market has really accelerated both vertically and horizontally and as for example the prime express deal is a good example of this the pbms are working more closely together that s clearly putting more pressure on the marketplace for better pricing and that s really what we are alluding to so we are working hard as james has said as we always have done to mitigate that pressure through cost programs and through driving volume as james is going to say very clearly we were disappointed with the volume growth in q1 part of that was timing as james has said and part of that is because the fact that we lost some access to some particular some medicaid networks during the summer that is rolling into this year and as we spoke to i think it was the last quarter we re working investigating obviously with advanced rx the opportunity for us to to become more efficient together and offer a new model in the medicaid business we recognize that we are under share there and we have to operate differently in that marketplace in medicare we continue to do very well with unitedhealthcare we re really pleased with the relationship and the new ma plan as we ve spoke to in the prepared comments has done well and we expect that will come through in the changes in january 1 obviously we are doing less well with the other a strong performer which is aetna insurance we have done really well and we are doing less well with them for maybe obvious reasons but in the whole we feel we are going to be there or thereabouts in medicare then in commercial already said and replied previously they will be very pleased to have renewed the contract with prime which again is a very important book of business for us in the commercial network so i think that s the picture from my point of view and i don t know if question elizabeth that s how we see it and all underpins the 3 5 to 4 volume growth that we expect to see in the full year elizabeth anderson evercore isi analyst okay perfect that s very helpful thank you operator your next question comes from the line of lisa gill from jpmorgan your line is open lisa gill jp morgan analyst thanks very much good morning i wanted to start with just some thoughts around branded inflation as well as generic procurement in the current market as we think about the gross margins and how this will impact it i m just wondering james first can you just talk about what s in your current expectation and guidance james kehoe executive vice president and global chief financial officer what we saw in i ll tell you what we ve seen in q1 we saw branded inflation of around 4 and we most of the market read seem to be the inflation and this is on a constant mix basis so like for like skus deflation of around 4 we would say that internally on generics sorry and maybe i ll ask alex to weigh in and then two is we would be outperforming versus that 4 will probably be in mid to high single digit and we generally are projecting that kind of number going forward somewhere in the mid to high single digit deflation mix adjustment which is it s probably quarters will change versus market but generally that s what we re seeing in the market and we re delivering slightly better in terms of cost reduction in the p l i don t know alex if you want to add alex gourlay co chief operating officer yeah i think the and we continue to feel very good about our global operation and we via attack delivering just slightly beyond reductions in cogs cost of goods so that s exactly what we are seeing james kehoe executive vice president and global chief financial officer yeah alex gourlay co chief operating officer yeah lisa gill jp morgan analyst and then alex you talked about a number of healthcare initiatives and updates a few of that you didn t touched on today would be labcorp and humana one on the labcorp side can you just talk about where you are today are you on track on the humana side any plans to expand can you talk about united on the medicare advantage side i m curious what you re doing with humana and then just more broadly speaking the strategic priority for expanding the role of pharmacy as you know i m a big believer in that as well but with the reimbursement pressure do you ever see that subsiding in any way where you can actually get ahead of that where you can start to change the paradigm and i know i ve asked this for multiple years but do you finally think that you can start to see that on the horizon as you start to have bigger and bigger relationships like north of 100 million lives now in the combination of prime and express you think about large relationships like united alex gourlay co chief operating officer so i think maybe start with the humana questions so we ve opened up preferred partners in primary care it looks very good and is operating really well and the relationship between the pharmacist and doctors is really close so we continue to feel really good about that very small but important test joint venture and of course we ve opened up two also with the clinical villagemd which i m sure you know down in houston will be five in total by the end of february and again we are very very pleased with how that s operating already we ve taken a small stake in that company villagemd as well which we re pleased to do and we see that partnership of the doctor and the pharmacist been fundamental to the future of community healthcare delivery going forward in core to our model on the lending lots about how we can do two things take cost out the system together and get customers to understand and do the medications better and change the lifestyles and so it s really interesting walk and it points to maybe your last question so that s on the humana on labcorp we re bang on track in terms of number of service centers opened i think we ll have well over 100 in the ground by the end of this quarter i think that s really bang on track and they are performing well we are seeing nps scores and the usage of the centers all in or above our expectations so we are very pleased with our program and we expect 600 and maybe more we don t know yet in the ground within the four years as we promised and role of pharmacist we are working really hard to get our new system in as james spoke to in prepared remarks we re going to be accelerating that system from the current pace that will be fundamental to be in the cloud the date will be in the cloud it will be fundamental to taking the work code out and freeing up our pharmacists to really drive that in future we re seeing increased payments from certain insurers and pbms particularly in medicare d we really like working with united because they are stretching to this in terms of getting the payment but the very clear on the goalposts that we have to hit to get the payment and we ve been successful in achieving that i do believe other insurance companies will follow their leads and the government eventually will also make sure that we have clear kpis going forward as well so yeah it s a longer play for sure but we are really committed to and we re making more progress and appears right now than our numbers on and we continue to keep on pushing this to fundamental to pharmacy and fundamental we believe to a more efficient healthcare system in the us lisa gill jp morgan analyst and then just for understanding that none of that is in your expectation for 2020 so i heard you say longer term a couple of times in this conversation so should we anticipate that this could potentially impact fiscal 2021 or 2022 how do we just think about it from a timing perspective alex gourlay co chief operating officer yeah we are already earning some money back as you know the famous well so we are earning more money back than we did previously and the amount of money available to us is growing and our ability to get that money grows as we get our systems in and of course we re also deploying pharmacy specific of pharmacists i think we have about 150 internet work who are specifically working to achieve these performance outcomes so i think this will start to affect 21 and 22 it s already given us some relief in 20 as well there is improved money in our forecast for performance networks lisa gill jp morgan analyst okay great thank you for the comments operator your next question comes from the line of soo romanoff from morningstar your line is open soo romanoff morningstar analyst thank you for taking the question the background you ve given on a lot of initiatives have been great perhaps maybe specialties become such a big component of your business i mean is that is that mix also impacting the margins as well james kehoe executive vice president and global chief financial officer yeah we called that out in the quarter it impact by about 50 basis points because it s growing at high single digit versus the pharmacy scripts of 2 8 so it s driving adverse mix of 50 basis points soo romanoff morningstar analyst and i guess that makes sense i mean do the initiatives that you re kind of putting in place help expand those margins or also provide kind of that long term wellness and part of the healthcare transformation alex gourlay co chief operating officer yeah absolutely soo i mean we strongly believe in having a community presence and as you know we have two models we have one which of course to the doctors who are practicing and specialty for example in oncology and then we have pharmacies inside of their hospitals and sort of healthcare systems we have 300 plus of these and we ve now got urac accreditation for them all so every single pharmacy that we run in the community which is very unusual i believe will be fast to achieve this has got that accreditation that means more attractive to the manufacturers because they know that we will take full care of the patient and more and more patients are living longer with diseases in communities so we believe the local model that will become important to the future of healthcare delivery and always be a central fill model i m sure but we believe the local model will become more and more important also we announced our relationship with shields shields as a variance i think platform that s working with healthcare systems and we have a lot of relationships with healthcare systems as you know to make sure as patients leave hospitals they maintain themselves on the drugs being dispensed primarily by the hospital pharmacy so again we are investing both in technology with shields and also as well in terms of data and tracking customers and low community pharmacies to make sure pharmacist can actually take care of these customers as it lifts and more often a home and we re also of course working closely with prime as we said already to make sure that we have a really efficient and effective central model and most importantly of all we have outstanding relationships with the manufacturers it s really driven both through our relationship with amerisourcebergen and also the ornella with her team at global level to make sure that we have the very best relationships so while these manufacturers are bringing these new and unique products to the markets and we feel as a global partner we can apply our capabilities for them in the us market through our relationship operator your next question comes from the line of eric coldwell from baird your line is open eric coldwell robert w baird co analyst thank you very much i know it s difficult to parse this out with the store closings in the uk as well as the shift to more services from volume perhaps but could you give us a clear sense on the impact of the nhs reimbursement scheme change either quarter over quarter or year over year and then how did that really stack up compared to your expectations it sounds ok but i d like to get a little more detail on that in terms of not only the quarter over quarter but also how that progresses through the next few quarters thank you alex gourlay co chief operating officer sure yeah i know it s alex here no it was exactly as we expected so the quarter for pharmacy both in volume as i said already were slightly below or on the market in terms of underlying business but we gave up some scripts because of some unprofitable services in terms of margin exactly as we had expected this tracking too as we expected so it s relatively easy to track this because the government resigned the five year contract with the industry through what s called the psnc which represents all pharmacies in the uk as a one contract so we can track this quite carefully it does vary sometimes from from quarter to quarter but it s trued up in a way which is transparent so we feel very confident that we ve got a good line of sight to this we feel very confident that we are working operationally very well in the uk and we have additional piece of work there which is called pharmacy of the future an idea really is to transform the operating model for pharmacy in the uk this will take some time of course we ve already marked that investment we are investing strongly in a new farm system we ve rolled out 1 400 which is well over half of the state and it s now present all the home countries including scotland most recently so again we are feeling pretty good about the visibility we re not feeling as good about the profitability of pharmacy we believe that that needs to improved further so that we can reinvest back in community pharmacy properly in the years ahead but we are very committed to getting that operating model understood and changed over time james kehoe executive vice president and global chief financial officer yeah if you want to characterize the euro of prior year it was a tough year for pharmacy where there were a lot of untime impacts coming from nhs funding and there will be a general euro recovery from that it was surprising we were within 500 000 of the gross profit targets for pharmacy in the uk it was bang on target we are looking at a fairly sizable improvement in gross profit in the business this year so as alex mentioned earlier in his comments we have some marginal profitability businesses on the sidelines and we re aggressively driving the improvement of those so don t be surprised if you see script volumes and market share going down slightly we re addressing the profitability of sub categories that we don t think are strategic to the company and we definitely don t want to be in marginal profitability positions so a bit of a shift in the orientation in the business slightly more to profitability so as your modeling is out don t get fixated by script declines because the core business is actually quite solid and solid in the quarter eric coldwell robert w baird co analyst yeah got it thank you very much james kehoe executive vice president and global chief financial officer and just one point on the uk though as we go through it we did have a rough quarter in retail and it really does come down to the market and our share of the whole share overall quite interestingly though we ve seen in the last couple of weeks and it s maybe a little bit important as you think through your modeling we had a rough quarter not 40 decline now there was a lot of one time items in there probably half of that was one time adverse items just generally but as you think through this we saw a very very strong christmas period there are huge phasing on mainly of our primary markets the whole december month started out extremely slow the second last week of the month was extremely strong with high single digit revenue growth and in the last week of the year we again have mid to high single digit growth across our key categories and we re still getting in on bisecting just what happened but december performance is quite a bit more positive than the quarter we just came out of and the double surprise was it was achieved with higher margins than the prior year so we re rebalancing the commercial approach in the uk and we re not chasing volume at any cost and surprisingly we re seeing better volumes and we re seeing better margins now it s only two weeks so it s too early to churn success but we ve seen a better performance across december across the entire the main two markets actually both businesses have done quite well in the christmas period very well actually operator your next question comes from the line of kevin caliendo from ubs your line is open kevin caliendo ubs investment bank analyst hi thanks for taking my call you mentioned you had 60 of your pbm contract set when you gave guidance and now you ve renewed prime what remains outstanding and how much variance is there really at this point could there be an reimbursements as we look out over the rest of the year alex gourlay co chief operating officer hi kevin it s alex here firstly i mean there ll be some small net works which can change mid year for sure but the vast majority now is contracted the vast majority i can t give a precise number but i will always give you an estimate it will over 90 because the consolidation market is very clear and yeah so that s where we are but so we feel we have good line of state in this fiscal year and again we will start negotiating the majority of the med d contracts as we move through the summer months but that will be before starting january 1st 2021 kevin caliendo ubs investment bank analyst and the renewal prime that takes you through is it more than a one year contract meaning like the express relationship won t have any impact on that at all going forward alex gourlay co chief operating officer that s right i mean we don t disclose the length of the contracts but this is a multi year deal typical of a longish commercial contract kevin caliendo ubs investment bank analyst got it and one last one have you guys looked at the oecd proposals around multinational corporation tax rules they are obviously still just proposals but wondering if they were implemented but will it any way impact walgreens or wbad or anything like that stefano pessina executive vice chairman and chief executive officer we have i would say quite expert tax group and they are extremely active they are all over this think you have to wait till dust settles on these things but we would obviously realign the corporate structure according to new legislation as it comes along we think that we that s in a it s in the right location it delivers attractive tax positions but it s all vetted and approved by all jurisdictions globally and it s in line with current policy as policies change globally we will adapt to the policies but we have an attractive tax rate compared to our peer set by quite a number of percentage points and we ll try and maintain that as much as possible but you can be sure the team is all over this and we don t see any short term risks kevin caliendo ubs investment bank analyst great thanks so much that s really helpful operator our last question comes from michael cherny from bank of america your line is open michael cherny bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks for squeezing me in here so i want to tie back i guess a big picture question at the beginning you talked about the broader strategy you re taking i know you mentioned the role of pharmacy going forward you ve highlighted a number of the various different partnerships i guess as you think about the next call or rest of this fiscal year two three years what are some of the checkpoints you re looking for relative to the partnership model relative to the strategy relative to the ebit contribution from all of these to essentially declare success or if some of them are going to kind of cut bait and how does that play into the broader on thought process around the organization and the role and where you sit in the market on a go forward basis given as well but you re also going through a pretty broad restructuring about the cost base and the store footprint alex gourlay co chief operating officer thanks michael yeah it s alex here so i think if we start with our key priorities and they know that they start with managing of the drug store and new retail offerings but probably more advanced with the kroger relationship and the reason why that s quite important is because it allows us to do two things allows us to walk with them on the convenience model which is really important to drive footfall into our physical stores and also really important from a consumer point of view the definition of convenience is such a big change in the marketplace so we are feeling really good about that i said in my prepared remarks we are seeing substantial sales growth both in the box itself and also in the categories that we are supporting we ve also launched our own products i think we ve got we re going to have them in the just over 15 16 17 kroger stores so that for this gives us an opportunity to put our health and beauty composition and private label on brands into their customers views as well and then lastly when you put together the two customer sets we serve together around about 20 million customers a day between us so we have a strong strong presence in american households and our ability therefore to work with them being the the genuine part of america and those being very very competent we believe in pharmacy health and to some extent beauty category as it relates to healthcare and wellness we believe that s going to be a strong opportunity the procurement structure allows us to earn money in the short to medium term and of course we will be working together on other issues in the supply chain and also in other issues on procurement we believe as well in the future so that s one area where i think we have made good progress both tactically and strategically with healthcare we are well into testing quality brands and quality offers in partnership with others sort of the acceleration of our lessons learned and optical is one example of it we are working with grandvision who are renowned as a quality optical retailer with access to insurance and the very best brands we really are delighted to get more opportunities to be doctors into our stores alongside pharmacists and we believe that well that will be a longer term model we know from experience in europe that that model can be really effective in delivering end to end primary care in communities and last but not least into the find care platform that we have built very quietly with an internal team has really grown and we believe that will be a digital marketplace that will become very important to us into the market in the future but will take time to grow so that s really where we are in terms of that measure so we expect some contribution over time in the retail side faster than the contribution maybe in the healthcare side but the healthcare side will come through the hill of scripts over time and the access to more james kehoe executive vice president and global chief financial officer and maybe one we didn t get this question but progress on digitalization in the quarter we ve just launched two major initiatives launched and funded i want to kind of go back to the previous guidance we gave we ve got 500 million of capital expenditures behind digital and development plus about 100 million to 150 million of expense this year and we launched two big initiatives in the last account one is on mass personalization and that s how do you use your marketing dollars more effectively to target a better connection with the consumer we believe we will significantly underpin particularly the retail revenue profile for a multi year period and these are not small investments they are in the 50 million to 100 million range and the second one is the the prescription journey and i use that one very generically but again it s a similar size of investment and it s on a two speed we re not waiting for the core systems to be upgraded it s on a parallel process and this is a 2 ish journey and what s it going to do what s going to connect the consumer much more closely with the prescription how they want to deliver how they want to pay for it the transparency of the cost of it and the options we give consumers and getting closer to consumers and the second thing it will do it will take friction out of the system which means it will reduce the cost to fill a prescription so we re working on initiatives that don t just boost take out costs but they actually boost revenue and the connectivity to patients and consumers longer term and some of that will be lost these investments are large and they re multi year and they will also drive long term revenue and sustainable growth michael cherny bank of america merrill lynch analyst and i guess just quickly how do you balance all of those investments in long term initiatives against some of the quarterly volatility and reimbursement risks and the moving pieces on the transformational cost program that you see stefano pessina executive vice chairman and chief executive officer it s tough alex gourlay co chief operating officer it s not easy but we have our program management approach we have got a lot of cable people but it s not easy in every but we are paying a lot of attention to the future and to today as you can tell by the comments that james have made james kehoe executive vice president and global chief financial officer a lot of these funds go through the transformational cost management program and alex myself and ornella and head of hr sit on it we are the four people on it so it s a small team takes decisions quickly and frankly some of these are tough trade offs and in some quarters you theoretically can t afford it but you have to do it or otherwise you re going to damage the long term future of the company stefano pessina executive vice chairman and chief executive officer and this is the problem it s stefano yes every strategy our strategy is as it has always been a medium long term strategy and we believe in the pharmacy we believe in the hold that the pharmacies will have in future of course the pharmacy will have to be able to satisfy the needs of the patients and the needs of the customers and we are working in that direction not all the pharmacies will provide in future not all the pharmacies will be important in the local economy of the city or the villages we try to be in pharmacy that can have a whole and of course we have to invest we had to invest now for the future if we work just for the next quarter maybe we will have a little better results but at the end we will probably create a problem over the long survival of our stores of our pharmacies and now you have to take a decision either you believe in the strategy which is focused on the long term or you just try to look at the next quarters and maybe you try to do deals just to let s say make easier over less evidence the problems that you have we have decided to work for the long term and i hope that at the end we would be right operator there are no further questions at this time i turn the call back over to the presenters gerald gradwell senior vice president of special projects and

courtesy of guaranty trust bank this interview is part of the inside the mind of the ceo series which explores a wide range of critical decisions faced by chief executives around the world nigeria is widely viewed as coming late to the mobile money revolution that swept east africa in the 2010s but transferring money today in nigeria africa s largest economy could scarcely be easier shopkeepers tradespeople department stores satellite tv companies and nearly every other merchant accepts payment via mobile phone transfer that s in large part thanks to guaranty trust bank gtbank which under the leadership of segun agbaje helped popularize money transfers based on unstructured supplementary service data a communications protocol used for mobile financial services the industry has since moved into app based transfers and the nigerian central bank recently approved the first licenses for mobile wallets the latest step in a digital revolution transforming banking across the continent agbaje joined gtbank in 1991 the same year it commenced operations after training to be an accountant in the united states and he worked his way up as the bank grew in 2007 he led gtbank s listing on the london stock exchange which raised us 750 million and successfully placed nigeria s first private eurobond issuance four years later he was named chief executive officer today the bank has total assets of more than 9 7 billion under agbaje gtbank s retail clientele has grown ninefold to 18 million making it one of nigeria s biggest banks by customer base it has also created the continent s largest consumer focused fairs in food and fashion as a way to help develop sectors that agbaje believes are essential to promoting enterprise for indigenous small businesses and critical to boosting the country s sluggish economic growth agbaje recently sat down with strategy business in the bank s victoria island office to discuss global growth nigeria s vast potential the importance of small and medium sized enterprises smes and the rapidly changing competitive landscape for banks s b you ve spent nearly 30 years in banking today the nigerian landscape is changing quickly as startups begin to compete more seriously with the country s top banks how does that change affect how you think about the business agbaje banking now is probably more interesting and more challenging than it has been in a long time when i started in banking whenever we carried out competitor analysis all we would look at were banks today when you carry out a competitive analysis of banks you must look at fintechs telcos and anybody that would do fast moving consumables you would probably also look at betting companies basically anyone who has the potential to use mobile wallets and mobile technology is a potential competitor for example some online betting companies today have up to 25 million mobile wallets if you have 25 million mobile wallets you have 25 million potential customers for financial services i also suspect are using data analytics and artificial intelligence to target customers some of them might even have started finding ways to extend credit so i think that whatever the telcos believe they have today to compete in the financial services space the betting companies probably have just as much s b last year when pwc asked ceos about threats to business in its 22nd annual global ceo survey the top responses from african ceos were policy uncertainty availability of key skills overregulation increase of tax burden and exchange rate volatility what do you think are the biggest threats today agbaje i think that you can navigate many of those threats that you ve just mentioned the one that bothers me the most today is the changing competitive landscape you will always worry about regulation you will always worry about tax you will worry about losing staff to countries such as canada and australia however i think that you will be able to deal with these threats better than you will with the changing competitive landscape the process of change the acceleration of change and the threats it is actually quite scary how quickly it s happening three years ago we were talking about this like it was way way in the future it s here today and we re living it very quickly so while i hear all of the other threats i actually think they re easier to navigate than the threat of the changing competitive landscape everyone is doing digital technologies they re disrupting your business it s not like banks won t be around but will you be as relevant will you be as profitable because you re sharing a lot of your profit with these new entrants and you re sharing a lot of your customer base i think these are bigger threats if we have to pay a bit more tax it s no problem as long as we make the money other threats we can find ways around them but this one is more difficult to handle s b are you thinking about climate change at all agbaje yes i think about what will happen to economies that are dependent on natural resources going forward if for example oil goes away what happens to oil producing countries in 40 years i think about climate change very differently i look at it as the impact on the economies as a result of climate change as opposed to the environment for example if you re running nigeria today you should definitely have a plan for when oil goes away we re not planning enough nor are a lot of other countries you should have a real urgent plan if something happens in terms of climate will you be able to export cocoa if that s your major commodity will you be able to export rubber when countries think of climate change they should start thinking seriously about its economic impact on agriculture on food production i don t see any contingency plans to handle the impact s b where do you see the global economy going over the next year agbaje growth is coming down england s still struggling with brexit europe has its problems you still have china u s trade tensions so i m just not sure that things are very upbeat you are looking at stunted growth from a global perspective s b how do you see that playing out in sub saharan africa and then down in nigeria agbaje there are some economies in sub saharan africa that seem to be growing ghana seems to be growing the gdp growth figures for nigeria are around 2 percent over the next 12 months i can t see anything that would significantly change that s b is that enough for nigeria agbaje of course not if you look at our population growth for nigeria to achieve its full potential it probably needs to be growing at about 5 to 7 percent two percent is definitely not sufficient for nigeria s b are there certain policies that could be used to boost growth agbaje obviously as banks we have been told we have to lend more and yes that would help but i think we have some implicit subsidies that we need to deal with we need to look at our oil subsidy and the power subsidy if we address some of those things we may have better short term growth it would not take that long if we removed the subsidies and the banks did a bit more lending s b the world bank projects that in sub saharan africa the population is going to double by 2050 to more than 2 billion nigeria is expected to be home to over 400 million people by then making it the third most populous country in the world is that an opportunity or a potential threat agbaje it s definitely a little of both a large population that is a productive population and that is a young population is obviously an advantage pick up things very quickly it s potential growth for us it s similar to what happened in the 1960s you have a huge baby boomer population to sell to it s a disadvantage if you can t create jobs you don t have enough food so it s a blessing and a curse depending on how you deal with it if you re running nigeria today you should definitely have a plan for when oil goes away we re not planning enough nor are a lot of other countries i ve always felt that the most valuable resource in nigeria is not oil it s the population and that when you come into nigeria irrespective of what the data tells you and what the gdp per head is there is potential that is not captured in that number and even if we argue about the population figures is it 150 million is it 160 million is it 200 million there are very few places in africa that have that sort of critical mass and 50 percent of nigerians are young so basically that allows us to grow if we re able to tap into the potential of that population s b what challenges need to be addressed in order to harness that potential agbaje a lot of the problems in africa are leadership problems some people might be fans of kagame some might not be but we have business operations in rwanda so i have watched how the country has grown under what i would consider good leadership where you have good leadership in place you tend to be able to unlock potential in africa if we re able to have dynamic leadership we will be able to unlock the potential of the population s b there s a debate about whether resource dependent economies are growing productively or unproductively nigeria was an example of a country that didn t create many jobs or see the oil wealth trickle down to ordinary nigerians are there examples in africa of countries that have gotten productive growth right agbaje i think you ve got one rwanda when people talk about nigeria the reason you might call it unproductive growth is that a lot of what happens in the oil sector tends to happen outside the economy most of the money is banked outside the country you actually don t see or feel the full impact on the nigerian economy as opposed to if you agriculture or road construction or local sme type manufacturing all of which tend to be more productive for an economy than oil for you to see productive growth you have to drive it in a way that impacts your sme and your retail sectors s b nigeria finally signed on to the african continental free trade area agreement the continent wide free trade deal that aims at creating a 3 trillion market knocking out 90 percent of tariffs and bolstering intra africa trade how do you view the potential impacts agbaje i m in a wait and see mode we operate in 10 african countries and in terms of economic borders it s not that open because everybody wants to control their monetary and fiscal policy for you to benefit from the free trade agreement you re going to have to give up some of that control you re going to have to have a single currency for example you re going to have to break down a lot of the economic borders the full potential of the trade deal has yet to be seen s b are there specific implications for a pan african financial services company that are different than for other sectors agbaje if you re able to move both goods and services across borders you obviously then have a bigger market if you re a bank in nigeria and you have 18 million customers and all those borders went away you could start to look at your customer base much more broadly and then it probably even changes your thinking so as opposed to looking at your business and your strategy among 10 different countries you can start to look at it as one with one strategy s b corruption is a big issue in nigeria what do you think is the impact of corruption on the nigerian economy and what steps do you think businesses can take to mitigate it agbaje ultimately no matter what anybody says corruption is not good for an economy if you just how much we have lost to corruption in nigeria over the last 40 to 50 years it is obvious that it is not good for the system how do you decrease corruption my simple answer is to grow a private sector driven economy let the focus not be about government contracts or government parastatals as you do that i believe that naturally the level of corruption comes down s b mobile money has come late to nigeria especially compared to kenya do you think it s taken too long agbaje i am probably biased but i think it was worth the wait what has happened in kenya is that as much as everybody loves safaricom it is actually the largest bank in the country that not regulated and that is one of the biggest dangers for me this is a very scary thing it is better to have grown your mobile money more carefully and made sure that your regulator the central bank has more oversight as opposed to creating this entity which is not regulated but turns out to be your biggest financial institution s b what other service areas do you think gtbank could get into beyond banking given how rapidly the landscape is changing agbaje we are hoping that regulation will not shackle us and that we can keep going we created a single integrated payment platform called habari where customers can shop online listen to music stream videos and access a plethora of everyday services online basically we want to create a lifestyle platform which is very different i m not sure there s any bank that has what we have so far it s challenging it s difficult but i think it is an area that we can go into and we can do well in so far in one year we ve had nearly 400 000 downloads s b this is part of the aspirational brand you have said you re trying to build alongside gtbank fashion weekend and the gtbank food and drink festival why are these significant for the bank agbaje one of the things we believe nigeria needs to grow is a thriving sme sector and when we organize our consumer focused fairs for the food or fashion sectors we don t do it for multinationals or big businesses we do it for smes over the years people used to say that the reason banks were not lending to smes was that the smes didn t have security i disagree it s the cash flows that were not strong enough it is cash flow that pays back loans the whole idea of building free business platforms as we have done in food and fashion is to give smes the access to markets and networks they need to expose themselves and sell their goods with our events we bring 300 000 people sometimes more to interact with and patronize these small businesses usually this is the biggest exposure that these smes have ever had and we offer it to them completely free it helps them gain publicity people get to know about the smes and patronize them more often and this helps their business become more sustainable so it is all about promoting enterprise really and food and fashion are two sectors which we strongly believe that if nigeria gets right from an sme perspective can help drive shared and productive growth author profiles obioma ubah is pwc s diversity and corporate

chief executive officer thank you gerald and hello everyone as you will see from our figures it has been a slow start to the financial year with a competitive us pharmacy environment and soft trading conditions in the uk that said as you will hear there are a number of items affecting the year on year comparisons and given the initiatives that we have under way we are maintaining our full year guidance in the quarter we continued to make progress against all four of our core strategic priorities we are making progress in moving our data resources to a new and more flexible cloud based infrastructure with a significant benefits that brings we have also made a good progress with the development of new services to build on this new infrastructure to announce our customer experiences make our teams more efficient and effective and open new opportunities for our businesses clearly this work on the digitalization of our company must and are closely tie in with our work to modernize our retail offering and the shape and structure of our retail footprint at the same time we are working with partners to redefine the delivery of healthcare in the community and the important role of pharmacy in the immediate and longer term future and all of these is of course supported and fueled by our transformational cost management program which have made substantive progress during the quarter finally we have also continued to make progress on a number of significant partnerships both established a new to enhance our offering and efficiency and toward the value growth in our businesses in the quarter we entered into a procurement joint venture with kroger building on the already strong relationship that has been formed between kroger and walgreens and we announced a joint venture with mckesson to bring together our two businesses in germany improving our reach and scale with a focus on enhancing the efficiency and performance of whole combined wholesale operation in the significant german pharmaceutical wholesale market i will come back to make a few comments on the future at the end of our presentation but now i will ask james and alex to take us through the results in a little more detail james james kehoe executive vice president and global chief financial officer thank you stefano and good morning adjusted eps was 1 37 5 7 lower than prior year on a constant currency basis the year on year comparison was impacted by around 5 percentage points of adverse items including the year on year bonus impact in retail pharmacy usa strong cost management and improved retail comp sales were offset by lower gross margin retail pharmacy international continued to be negatively impacted by a challenging uk market and we saw continued strong performance from pharmaceutical wholesale our transformational cost management program is very much on track and we expect to achieve annual cost savings in excess of 1 8 billion by 2022 cash generation was very strong in the quarter with free cash flow of 674 million 684 million better than prior year and finally we are maintaining our guidance for fiscal year 20 of flat adjusted earnings per share on a constant currency basis with a range of plus or minus 3 looking forward we see improved core business trends with however some noise in the second quarter as we cycle through the timing of reimbursement payments and year on year bonus impacts in total these result in an expected eps headwind of around 13 but both of these items were budgeted in fiscal year 20 and have no impact on full year guidance let s now look in more detail on the results first quarter sales were up 1 6 including a currency headwind of 0 7 on a constant currency basis sales were up 2 3 adjusted operating income declined 15 4 on a constant currency basis reflecting lower gross margin in the us and a difficult uk market adjusted eps was 1 37 a constant currency decline of 5 7 our share repurchase program contributed 4 percentage points of growth and an additional 5 7 percentage points came from a favorable tax rate as we benefited from a number of discrete items the result included adverse items of over 5 percentage points including the year on year bonus impact mark to market adjustments and lapping prior year supplier funding gaap eps declined 19 8 to 0 95 and also reflected costs relating to the rite aid transaction and the implementation of the transformational cost management program now let s move to retail pharmacy usa sales increased 1 6 in the quarter with 2 9 growth in pharmacy partially offset by lower retail sales note that the sales growth includes a negative impact of 50 basis points due to our store optimization programs adjusted gross profit declined 4 9 due to lower pharmacy and retail gross profit adjusted sg a spend decreased 1 6 in the quarter and was 17 6 of sales an improvement of 0 6 percentage points versus prior year the decline in sg a clearly shows our strong execution against our transformational cost management program with savings more than offsetting incremental investments the impact of inflation and the year on year bonus impact adjusted operating income declined 16 2 as the sg a savings were not enough to offset the decline in gross profit and the adverse items i mentioned earlier in total these adverse items accounted for over 6 percentage points of the decline in operating income now let s look in more detail at pharmacy total pharmacy sales increased 2 9 versus prior year reflecting continued brand inflation and script volume growth central specialty sales continue to grow nicely up 9 3 versus prior year comp pharmacy sales were up 2 5 and comp scripts grew 2 8 while this was weaker than expected we have seen improved growth in recent weeks market share for the quarter was 20 9 down 55 basis points versus prior year including the impact from our store optimization program adjusted gross profit decreased mid single digit as the impact of procurement savings and script growth was more than offset by reimbursement pressure turning next to our us retail business total retail sales declined 2 2 in the quarter impacted by store optimization comp retail sales declined 0 5 and continued to show an improving trend excluding tobacco and e cigarettes comp sales were up 0 8 as you know we are exiting the sale of e cigarettes while this did not have a significant impact on comps this quarter it will have a bigger impact from the next quarter onwards and we continue to anticipate a full year eps impact of around 0 06 we saw a solid comp growth in our core categories with health and wellness up 3 3 and beauty up 2 5 we estimate a tailwind of around 80 basis points from cough cold flu retail adjusted gross profit declined low single digits due to lower sales including the impact of store optimization programs higher shrink and the timing of prior year supplier funding adjusted gross margin declined slightly however excluding the higher shrink and supplier funding timing underlying category margins were in line with prior year turning next to retail pharmacy international and as usual i will talk to constant currency numbers sales decreased 2 7 mainly due to the uk and chile boots uk comp pharmacy sales increased 0 9 in the quarter reflecting relatively higher nhs reimbursement levels and increased sales from services partly offset by lower script volume boots uk comp retail sales declined 2 9 as the uk high street continued to be very challenging however overall we held market share adjusted operating income was down 39 1 mainly due to lower uk retail sales volume and margin the results include an adverse impact of 13 percentage points from the year on year bonus impact and higher technology investments turning now to the pharmaceutical wholesale division which i ll also discuss in constant currency the pharmaceutical wholesale division delivered another strong quarter with sales up 8 3 led by emerging markets and the uk the change in the customer contract which i ve mentioned before helped our uk performance contributing 1 4 to the overall sales growth we have now lapped the impact of this contract change adjusted operating income increased 4 9 reflecting strong revenue performance and a higher contribution from amerisourcebergen this strategic joint venture with mckesson aims to drive sustainable profitable growth in the largest pharmaceutical drug market in europe by leveraging scale and improving efficiency mid term we expect the jv to be eps accretive and to accelerate our pharmaceutical wholesale profit growth turning next to cash flow operating cash flow was 1 1 billion up 601 million versus prior year free cash flow was strong at 674 million up 684 million on prior year our key working capital initiatives are on track we are removing excess inventory from the system and we have started to extend payment terms to industry leading levels and we have a strong pipeline of initiatives to fuel our cash flow generation over a multiyear period let s turn now to our transformational cost management program in october we raised our annual cost savings target to in excess of 1 8 billion by fiscal 2022 we now have a very robust pipeline and our savings initiatives are gaining momentum this gives us a much higher level of confidence that we can exceed 1 8 billion target importantly these savings will allow us to fund the investments needed to create new and innovative business models let me now give you some detail on our activities in the quarter on smart spend we are accelerating our energy management efficiency program and we see opportunities to ramp up our procurement activities in goods not for resale the energy management program is interesting uled lighting saves money is environmentally friendly and improves the store experience for consumers this is a perfect example of save to invest to grow on smart organization we re undertaking an end to end process review in boots uk covering all major business processes with the aim of transforming how we operate ultimately leading to a lean and effective operating model we are now actively planning the implementation of global business services and we have implemented the second wave of headquarter cost reductions in mexico chile and

tata consulting services as our new partner to accelerate the work on our critical pharmacy operating system on digitalization we have prioritized investments in mass personalization and reinventing the pharmacy prescription journey now i ll hand over to alex alex gourlay co chief operating officer thank you james i ll now update you in some of the actions we ve taken in the us during the quarter starting with a retail offering our strategic partnership with kroger is progressing well the initial kroger express pilot in northern kentucky has been running for just over one year and the pilot in knoxville tennessee for five months we ve seen very positive results so far with a strong sales list building on the success of these pilots we formed the group procurement office retail procurement alliance with kroger in december to purchase both of our private label goods we expect this joint venture to deliver cost savings encourage sourcing innovation and generate efficiencies across the supply chain our strategy of focusing on the higher margin health and wellness and beauty categories is delivering benefits and both delivered solid performances in the quarter our flagship no7 beauty

we expect to drive future performance moving on to healthcare we have opened the second of five villagemd primary care locations in houston our wellness partnership with jenny craig is progressing well and we are on track to open approximately 100 locations by the end of january we re also in the process of converting our optical pilots to the brand which offers improved insurance coverage and stronger consumer brands in specialty i m delighted to see that all 300 community based specialty pharmacies have received urac accreditation and we continue to believe that our strong community based

new opportunities for growth in medicare advantage we are very pleased with customer adoption of the new core branded medicare advantage product we started selling from october 15th 2019 and finally

beauty reinvention program to 26 of our flagship beauty hauls in the second half of last year i m pleased to report that we ve seen an improved performance in these stores in line with our

and over time a wider range of new pharmacy offerings and we continue to develop new healthcare services with diagnostics where our pharmacists now have the ability to write prescriptions for certain conditions i mentioned last quarter that we are developing new initiatives in digital healthcare with plans for expanding pharmacy services to improve the customer journey and broaden access to healthcare we launched our online pharmacy in may 2019 which has made solid progress in the markets we have made further good progress on digitalization our online business boots com delivered strong growth with sales up 12 versus prior year in the quarter we also saw a record breaking black friday weekend with result in online sales up around 25 and finally we have agreed an exclusive partnership to offer omnichannel photo and personalized gifting services in the uk and ireland i ll now hand you back to stefano for his closing comments stefano pessina executive vice chairman and chief executive officer thank you alex as you have heard this year has opened with a number of challenges the main changes that are impacting the global healthcare sector are generating some difficult conditions for our businesses as said change always brings opportunity we must act to meet the challenges and ensure we make the most of the opportunities we see seeing these opportunities and mindful of the challenges side we are maintaining our full year guidance for the year we continuously review our group to ensure we have the right mix of businesses to maximize our performance in a dynamic sector pursuing our strategic priorities is having a real impact in driving our businesses the changes in our markets are obscuring some of the positive impacts we are having but these will not be the case forever i have said before and i will say again i strongly believe in an expanded role for pharmacy and in our company s ability to play a significant part in shaping how healthcare is delivered in the community going forward i believe these as much today as i ever have i believe we have true financial strength as a business as we have demonstrated this quarter we have an extraordinary ability to generate strong and sustainable cash flow and we have many opportunities to deploy this cash flow to create real value i remain convinced that we have in our company through our partnership an extraordinary foundation on which to build the work that we are doing today is creating a strong and flexible engine of our growth in our businesses for many years to come thank you now we will take your questions questions and answers operator your first question comes from the line of robert jones from goldman sachs your line is open robert jones goldman sachs co analyst great thanks thanks for taking the question i know there s a lot of moving pieces and it s only the first quarter but if i just take a step back clear eps was down around 6 in the quarter below the full fiscal year guidance it sounds like james if i m hearing you correctly next quarter given some of the moving pieces it could see an even steeper decline in eps i guess if we think about the back half could you maybe just give us the building blocks or the things that you guys have visibility into that gives you confidence that the back half can get you into that flat plus or minus 3 eps for the year james kehoe executive vice president and global chief financial officer yeah that s an expected question obviously let me just give you a little bit of context on the first quarter however first i think the only real surprise we had in the first quarter was on the script volume it did come in weaker than we expected we were thinking of a number of around 4 and we come in at 2 8 that s the piece that and i want to be clear our internal budget was 1 37 and we came in over budget what we had was a favorability on tax offsetting script growth in q1 so that was the one thing we were disappointed on we had a lot of stuff we re very happy about so free cash flow was off the charts we beat our internal budget by hundreds of millions largely driven by programs we re implementing in the us as stefano said in his comments transformational cost management program and that s key to the answer to your question is i will classify it right now is well ahead of track particularly due to actions in the us and the u k another items i d highlight that shouldn t be lost on you we finally we have nailed one of the first steps in the kroger relationship we think it s extremely positive that we have started up a gpo and i think it will lead to many good things in the future and then finally a strategic deal in a problematic german wholesale market which we think will drive tremendous value longer term so we think there was a lot of good things that happened and script growth was the one that was more challenging let me give you a prospect of looking forward is and actually we re a little bit surprised as well we re seeing quite a strong momentum in the current month of december so we believe when we call out 5 percentage points of items in the first quarter we re probably under calling that that were clear shifts between call at the thanksgiving period christmas periods and i don t want to give the precise number but our script growth is in solid mid single digit growth in the month of december so we re clearly feeling that we re not really reading why the shifts are happening that well we know cough cold flu is driving some of the buoyancy in december so we are seeing signals but we are counting on to hit our full year guidance we do need or script growth to be in the 3 5 to 4 kind of maybe 4 5 depending on the quarter but right now in december we re seeing numbers in excess of that so script growth is the key one the other key one is that will drive increasing performance as we exit the year obviously as you take out costs the cost take out is over the course of the year so the savings roughly in the first quarter are around 15 so of the total goal of we haven t given the numbers a large number were less than 15 in q1 as we exit the year we will be up double the run rate of savings so overheads will become a much more significant driver in the second half and i do want to point out for that for a company of our size with the amount of overheads we have the total overheads were down 1 6 in the quarter in the context and i think it s important to have the context we did say that the combination of inflation and volume impacts is about 400 million you have the bonus year on year that s in the region of 350 million 400 million and we have incremental investments of 100 million to 150 million so it will give you some indication of the size of the cost management initiatives and i think we ll come back next quarter with probably more visibility on the potential further opportunity on the cost program but i just finished answering your question i think if you were to do your model again for the full year we will probably have a slight favorability in taxes so call it somewhat 0 6 0 7 on the full year and we will have more coming from overheads and probably slightly less coming from gross profit because we had a miss in the first quarter on scripts so that s why we feel it s basically the overheads and some tax opportunity that we feel we can offset the call of the script under delivery in q1 does that cover what you were looking for robert jones goldman sachs co analyst that s tremendously helpful and i guess just one other probably anticipated question again just around the prime relationship in the wake of the prime express cigna announcement just wanted to get any update on how you guys are viewing the prime relationship any impact of the alliance or ex jv just as we think about how that relationship played out for you this past year relative to your expectations or how it would contribute in 2020 would be helpful thank you alex gourlay co chief operating officer hi bob it s alex here yeah we have recontacted with prime in a direct relationship so prime is now working with express scripts as a pbm working with us in a direct relationship so we anticipate to hold our market share with prime and potentially grow as a prime model will be more competitive in a marketplace so our relationship with prime continues to be a very strong one and we continue to walk you very well with independent blues so we are happy with the situation in terms of the impact obviously we ve readjusted the margin of debts but it really was in forecast in budget so we had expected this impact and had planned for it on alliancerx side alliancerx actually is doing ok at the moment but again we have a great relationship with prime we are speaking to them how do we adopt to an ever changing specialty marketplace which is becoming even more important for both of us we expect to have conversations next year along these lines to improve that model further so all is good from our point of view and we wish prime success with their new model and in that work we feel very confident that we will benefit from that relationship in the future robert jones goldman sachs co analyst thank you operator your next question comes from the line of eric percher from nephron research your line is open eric percher nephron research llc analyst thank you and thanks for the commentary on the cadence with respect to volume and cost maybe to hit on one other item reimbursement and the impact on 1 1 20 i know you gave us a 13 number i think was reimbursement and bonus but can you provide a little bit more context on what the outlook is as we move from q1 into q2 on 1 1 20 james kehoe executive vice president and global chief financial officer yeah the 13 reference was to q2 and we re specifically highlighting two things in the quarter and i would say it s like 7 due to reimbursement timing and the other is 6 is due to bonus year on year and the reason we called out the q2 reimbursement is it really is a timing item it s a true up of prior year contracts that occurs typically in the april may june timeline of the year and as it happened in the prior year there was no true up so it s not really a reimbursement impact year on year in terms of increase in contract prices it s a contractual true up of the contract for prior year and it s quite a large number because it impacts 7 percentage points we didn t actually call out anything on q1 what we said about q1 is reimbursement was actually broadly in line with the plans we ve put together because if you recall when we gave guidance we said at the time that i think 58 or 60 of all of our contracts were already defined when we gave guidance so we had fairly decent line of sight to the full year reimbursement and we came within 20 million of the reimbursement estimate for the first quarter so we were actually quite pleased with that because it s quite difficult to forecast reimbursement and you know we have looked back on some of our prior guidance on the quarters and the reason for giving something on q2 just to highlight this exceptional reimbursement of timing true up right now as we sit we have no reason to call any different outlook on reimbursement for the full year we should presume that means plus or minus 50 million so it s we were pleasantly surprised with the q1 on that side and i reiterate our issue on pharmacy in q1 nothing to do with procurement nothing to do with reimbursement they were actually net probably slightly positive it was probably it was all script volume so it was just lighter than we would have planned it to be eric percher nephron research llc analyst that s really helpful and reimbursement in the uk it sounds like nhs funding did improve but we didn t see it in the revenue line was this simply the new contract or have you seen any makeover for the debt and the lack of payment last year alex gourlay co chief operating officer so again there is really two stories here hi it s alex here one is as you say there has been a stabilization of payment which is in the marketplace can be seen on the nhs site and secondly we have taken some actions to reduce loss making services that we have in the uk and to make them more profitable as a result of that we ve lost some volume not as much volume as we had expected to be honest but some volume and we re quite pleased that with the retention of customers with these actions and that s what s caused a slight further decrease in terms of our revenue in the uk it s not reimbursement it s actions we ve taken to reduce loss making services that we were offering eric percher nephron research llc analyst thank you operator your next question comes from the line of elizabeth anderson from evercore your line is open elizabeth anderson evercore isi analyst hi good morning guys a couple of times you mentioned or should have alluded to potentially a little bit of a change in competitive environment in the us pharmacy or perhaps some pressure on or versus your expectations in the quarter in terms of script growth could you comment more broadly on sort of what you re seeing there and sort of your thoughts on how that s progressing alex gourlay co chief operating officer hi elizabeth it s alex here i think as the consolidation in the market has really accelerated both vertically and horizontally and as for example the prime express deal is a good example of this the pbms are working more closely together that s clearly putting more pressure on the marketplace for better pricing and that s really what we are alluding to so we are working hard as james has said as we always have done to mitigate that pressure through cost programs and through driving volume as james is going to say very clearly we were disappointed with the volume growth in q1 part of that was timing as james has said and part of that is because the fact that we lost some access to some particular some medicaid networks during the summer that is rolling into this year and as we spoke to i think it was the last quarter we re working investigating obviously with advanced rx the opportunity for us to to become more efficient together and offer a new model in the medicaid business we recognize that we are under share there and we have to operate differently in that marketplace in medicare we continue to do very well with unitedhealthcare we re really pleased with the relationship and the new ma plan as we ve spoke to in the prepared comments has done well and we expect that will come through in the changes in january 1 obviously we are doing less well with the other a strong performer which is aetna insurance we have done really well and we are doing less well with them for maybe obvious reasons but in the whole we feel we are going to be there or thereabouts in medicare then in commercial already said and replied previously they will be very pleased to have renewed the contract with prime which again is a very important book of business for us in the commercial network so i think that s the picture from my point of view and i don t know if question elizabeth that s how we see it and all underpins the 3 5 to 4 volume growth that we expect to see in the full year elizabeth anderson evercore isi analyst okay perfect that s very helpful thank you operator your next question comes from the line of lisa gill from jpmorgan your line is open lisa gill jp morgan analyst thanks very much good morning i wanted to start with just some thoughts around branded inflation as well as generic procurement in the current market as we think about the gross margins and how this will impact it i m just wondering james first can you just talk about what s in your current expectation and guidance james kehoe executive vice president and global chief financial officer what we saw in i ll tell you what we ve seen in q1 we saw branded inflation of around 4 and we most of the market read seem to be the inflation and this is on a constant mix basis so like for like skus deflation of around 4 we would say that internally on generics sorry and maybe i ll ask alex to weigh in and then two is we would be outperforming versus that 4 will probably be in mid to high single digit and we generally are projecting that kind of number going forward somewhere in the mid to high single digit deflation mix adjustment which is it s probably quarters will change versus market but generally that s what we re seeing in the market and we re delivering slightly better in terms of cost reduction in the p l i don t know alex if you want to add alex gourlay co chief operating officer yeah i think the and we continue to feel very good about our global operation and we via attack delivering just slightly beyond reductions in cogs cost of goods so that s exactly what we are seeing james kehoe executive vice president and global chief financial officer yeah alex gourlay co chief operating officer yeah lisa gill jp morgan analyst and then alex you talked about a number of healthcare initiatives and updates a few of that you didn t touched on today would be labcorp and humana one on the labcorp side can you just talk about where you are today are you on track on the humana side any plans to expand can you talk about united on the medicare advantage side i m curious what you re doing with humana and then just more broadly speaking the strategic priority for expanding the role of pharmacy as you know i m a big believer in that as well but with the reimbursement pressure do you ever see that subsiding in any way where you can actually get ahead of that where you can start to change the paradigm and i know i ve asked this for multiple years but do you finally think that you can start to see that on the horizon as you start to have bigger and bigger relationships like north of 100 million lives now in the combination of prime and express you think about large relationships like united alex gourlay co chief operating officer so i think maybe start with the humana questions so we ve opened up preferred partners in primary care it looks very good and is operating really well and the relationship between the pharmacist and doctors is really close so we continue to feel really good about that very small but important test joint venture and of course we ve opened up two also with the clinical villagemd which i m sure you know down in houston will be five in total by the end of february and again we are very very pleased with how that s operating already we ve taken a small stake in that company villagemd as well which we re pleased to do and we see that partnership of the doctor and the pharmacist been fundamental to the future of community healthcare delivery going forward in core to our model on the lending lots about how we can do two things take cost out the system together and get customers to understand and do the medications better and change the lifestyles and so it s really interesting walk and it points to maybe your last question so that s on the humana on labcorp we re bang on track in terms of number of service centers opened i think we ll have well over 100 in the ground by the end of this quarter i think that s really bang on track and they are performing well we are seeing nps scores and the usage of the centers all in or above our expectations so we are very pleased with our program and we expect 600 and maybe more we don t know yet in the ground within the four years as we promised and role of pharmacist we are working really hard to get our new system in as james spoke to in prepared remarks we re going to be accelerating that system from the current pace that will be fundamental to be in the cloud the date will be in the cloud it will be fundamental to taking the work code out and freeing up our pharmacists to really drive that in future we re seeing increased payments from certain insurers and pbms particularly in medicare d we really like working with united because they are stretching to this in terms of getting the payment but the very clear on the goalposts that we have to hit to get the payment and we ve been successful in achieving that i do believe other insurance companies will follow their leads and the government eventually will also make sure that we have clear kpis going forward as well so yeah it s a longer play for sure but we are really committed to and we re making more progress and appears right now than our numbers on and we continue to keep on pushing this to fundamental to pharmacy and fundamental we believe to a more efficient healthcare system in the us lisa gill jp morgan analyst and then just for understanding that none of that is in your expectation for 2020 so i heard you say longer term a couple of times in this conversation so should we anticipate that this could potentially impact fiscal 2021 or 2022 how do we just think about it from a timing perspective alex gourlay co chief operating officer yeah we are already earning some money back as you know the famous well so we are earning more money back than we did previously and the amount of money available to us is growing and our ability to get that money grows as we get our systems in and of course we re also deploying pharmacy specific of pharmacists i think we have about 150 internet work who are specifically working to achieve these performance outcomes so i think this will start to affect 21 and 22 it s already given us some relief in 20 as well there is improved money in our forecast for performance networks lisa gill jp morgan analyst okay great thank you for the comments operator your next question comes from the line of soo romanoff from morningstar your line is open soo romanoff morningstar analyst thank you for taking the question the background you ve given on a lot of initiatives have been great perhaps maybe specialties become such a big component of your business i mean is that is that mix also impacting the margins as well james kehoe executive vice president and global chief financial officer yeah we called that out in the quarter it impact by about 50 basis points because it s growing at high single digit versus the pharmacy scripts of 2 8 so it s driving adverse mix of 50 basis points soo romanoff morningstar analyst and i guess that makes sense i mean do the initiatives that you re kind of putting in place help expand those margins or also provide kind of that long term wellness and part of the healthcare transformation alex gourlay co chief operating officer yeah absolutely soo i mean we strongly believe in having a community presence and as you know we have two models we have one which of course to the doctors who are practicing and specialty for example in oncology and then we have pharmacies inside of their hospitals and sort of healthcare systems we have 300 plus of these and we ve now got urac accreditation for them all so every single pharmacy that we run in the community which is very unusual i believe will be fast to achieve this has got that accreditation that means more attractive to the manufacturers because they know that we will take full care of the patient and more and more patients are living longer with diseases in communities so we believe the local model that will become important to the future of healthcare delivery and always be a central fill model i m sure but we believe the local model will become more and more important also we announced our relationship with shields shields as a variance i think platform that s working with healthcare systems and we have a lot of relationships with healthcare systems as you know to make sure as patients leave hospitals they maintain themselves on the drugs being dispensed primarily by the hospital pharmacy so again we are investing both in technology with shields and also as well in terms of data and tracking customers and low community pharmacies to make sure pharmacist can actually take care of these customers as it lifts and more often a home and we re also of course working closely with prime as we said already to make sure that we have a really efficient and effective central model and most importantly of all we have outstanding relationships with the manufacturers it s really driven both through our relationship with amerisourcebergen and also the ornella with her team at global level to make sure that we have the very best relationships so while these manufacturers are bringing these new and unique products to the markets and we feel as a global partner we can apply our capabilities for them in the us market through our relationship operator your next question comes from the line of eric coldwell from baird your line is open eric coldwell robert w baird co analyst thank you very much i know it s difficult to parse this out with the store closings in the uk as well as the shift to more services from volume perhaps but could you give us a clear sense on the impact of the nhs reimbursement scheme change either quarter over quarter or year over year and then how did that really stack up compared to your expectations it sounds ok but i d like to get a little more detail on that in terms of not only the quarter over quarter but also how that progresses through the next few quarters thank you alex gourlay co chief operating officer sure yeah i know it s alex here no it was exactly as we expected so the quarter for pharmacy both in volume as i said already were slightly below or on the market in terms of underlying business but we gave up some scripts because of some unprofitable services in terms of margin exactly as we had expected this tracking too as we expected so it s relatively easy to track this because the government resigned the five year contract with the industry through what s called the psnc which represents all pharmacies in the uk as a one contract so we can track this quite carefully it does vary sometimes from from quarter to quarter but it s trued up in a way which is transparent so we feel very confident that we ve got a good line of sight to this we feel very confident that we are working operationally very well in the uk and we have additional piece of work there which is called pharmacy of the future an idea really is to transform the operating model for pharmacy in the uk this will take some time of course we ve already marked that investment we are investing strongly in a new farm system we ve rolled out 1 400 which is well over half of the state and it s now present all the home countries including scotland most recently so again we are feeling pretty good about the visibility we re not feeling as good about the profitability of pharmacy we believe that that needs to improved further so that we can reinvest back in community pharmacy properly in the years ahead but we are very committed to getting that operating model understood and changed over time james kehoe executive vice president and global chief financial officer yeah if you want to characterize the euro of prior year it was a tough year for pharmacy where there were a lot of untime impacts coming from nhs funding and there will be a general euro recovery from that it was surprising we were within 500 000 of the gross profit targets for pharmacy in the uk it was bang on target we are looking at a fairly sizable improvement in gross profit in the business this year so as alex mentioned earlier in his comments we have some marginal profitability businesses on the sidelines and we re aggressively driving the improvement of those so don t be surprised if you see script volumes and market share going down slightly we re addressing the profitability of sub categories that we don t think are strategic to the company and we definitely don t want to be in marginal profitability positions so a bit of a shift in the orientation in the business slightly more to profitability so as your modeling is out don t get fixated by script declines because the core business is actually quite solid and solid in the quarter eric coldwell robert w baird co analyst yeah got it thank you very much james kehoe executive vice president and global chief financial officer and just one point on the uk though as we go through it we did have a rough quarter in retail and it really does come down to the market and our share of the whole share overall quite interestingly though we ve seen in the last couple of weeks and it s maybe a little bit important as you think through your modeling we had a rough quarter not 40 decline now there was a lot of one time items in there probably half of that was one time adverse items just generally but as you think through this we saw a very very strong christmas period there are huge phasing on mainly of our primary markets the whole december month started out extremely slow the second last week of the month was extremely strong with high single digit revenue growth and in the last week of the year we again have mid to high single digit growth across our key categories and we re still getting in on bisecting just what happened but december performance is quite a bit more positive than the quarter we just came out of and the double surprise was it was achieved with higher margins than the prior year so we re rebalancing the commercial approach in the uk and we re not chasing volume at any cost and surprisingly we re seeing better volumes and we re seeing better margins now it s only two weeks so it s too early to churn success but we ve seen a better performance across december across the entire the main two markets actually both businesses have done quite well in the christmas period very well actually operator your next question comes from the line of kevin caliendo from ubs your line is open kevin caliendo ubs investment bank analyst hi thanks for taking my call you mentioned you had 60 of your pbm contract set when you gave guidance and now you ve renewed prime what remains outstanding and how much variance is there really at this point could there be an reimbursements as we look out over the rest of the year alex gourlay co chief operating officer hi kevin it s alex here firstly i mean there ll be some small net works which can change mid year for sure but the vast majority now is contracted the vast majority i can t give a precise number but i will always give you an estimate it will over 90 because the consolidation market is very clear and yeah so that s where we are but so we feel we have good line of state in this fiscal year and again we will start negotiating the majority of the med d contracts as we move through the summer months but that will be before starting january 1st 2021 kevin caliendo ubs investment bank analyst and the renewal prime that takes you through is it more than a one year contract meaning like the express relationship won t have any impact on that at all going forward alex gourlay co chief operating officer that s right i mean we don t disclose the length of the contracts but this is a multi year deal typical of a longish commercial contract kevin caliendo ubs investment bank analyst got it and one last one have you guys looked at the oecd proposals around multinational corporation tax rules they are obviously still just proposals but wondering if they were implemented but will it any way impact walgreens or wbad or anything like that stefano pessina executive vice chairman and chief executive officer we have i would say quite expert tax group and they are extremely active they are all over this think you have to wait till dust settles on these things but we would obviously realign the corporate structure according to new legislation as it comes along we think that we that s in a it s in the right location it delivers attractive tax positions but it s all vetted and approved by all jurisdictions globally and it s in line with current policy as policies change globally we will adapt to the policies but we have an attractive tax rate compared to our peer set by quite a number of percentage points and we ll try and maintain that as much as possible but you can be sure the team is all over this and we don t see any short term risks kevin caliendo ubs investment bank analyst great thanks so much that s really helpful operator our last question comes from michael cherny from bank of america your line is open michael cherny bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks for squeezing me in here so i want to tie back i guess a big picture question at the beginning you talked about the broader strategy you re taking i know you mentioned the role of pharmacy going forward you ve highlighted a number of the various different partnerships i guess as you think about the next call or rest of this fiscal year two three years what are some of the checkpoints you re looking for relative to the partnership model relative to the strategy relative to the ebit contribution from all of these to essentially declare success or if some of them are going to kind of cut bait and how does that play into the broader on thought process around the organization and the role and where you sit in the market on a go forward basis given as well but you re also going through a pretty broad restructuring about the cost base and the store footprint alex gourlay co chief operating officer thanks michael yeah it s alex here so i think if we start with our key priorities and they know that they start with managing of the drug store and new retail offerings but probably more advanced with the kroger relationship and the reason why that s quite important is because it allows us to do two things allows us to walk with them on the convenience model which is really important to drive footfall into our physical stores and also really important from a consumer point of view the definition of convenience is such a big change in the marketplace so we are feeling really good about that i said in my prepared remarks we are seeing substantial sales growth both in the box itself and also in the categories that we are supporting we ve also launched our own products i think we ve got we re going to have them in the just over 15 16 17 kroger stores so that for this gives us an opportunity to put our health and beauty composition and private label on brands into their customers views as well and then lastly when you put together the two customer sets we serve together around about 20 million customers a day between us so we have a strong strong presence in american households and our ability therefore to work with them being the the genuine part of america and those being very very competent we believe in pharmacy health and to some extent beauty category as it relates to healthcare and wellness we believe that s going to be a strong opportunity the procurement structure allows us to earn money in the short to medium term and of course we will be working together on other issues in the supply chain and also in other issues on procurement we believe as well in the future so that s one area where i think we have made good progress both tactically and strategically with healthcare we are well into testing quality brands and quality offers in partnership with others sort of the acceleration of our lessons learned and optical is one example of it we are working with grandvision who are renowned as a quality optical retailer with access to insurance and the very best brands we really are delighted to get more opportunities to be doctors into our stores alongside pharmacists and we believe that well that will be a longer term model we know from experience in europe that that model can be really effective in delivering end to end primary care in communities and last but not least into the find care platform that we have built very quietly with an internal team has really grown and we believe that will be a digital marketplace that will become very important to us into the market in the future but will take time to grow so that s really where we are in terms of that measure so we expect some contribution over time in the retail side faster than the contribution maybe in the healthcare side but the healthcare side will come through the hill of scripts over time and the access to more james kehoe executive vice president and global chief financial officer and maybe one we didn t get this question but progress on digitalization in the quarter we ve just launched two major initiatives launched and funded i want to kind of go back to the previous guidance we gave we ve got 500 million of capital expenditures behind digital and development plus about 100 million to 150 million of expense this year and we launched two big initiatives in the last account one is on mass personalization and that s how do you use your marketing dollars more effectively to target a better connection with the consumer we believe we will significantly underpin particularly the retail revenue profile for a multi year period and these are not small investments they are in the 50 million to 100 million range and the second one is the the prescription journey and i use that one very generically but again it s a similar size of investment and it s on a two speed we re not waiting for the core systems to be upgraded it s on a parallel process and this is a 2 ish journey and what s it going to do what s going to connect the consumer much more closely with the prescription how they want to deliver how they want to pay for it the transparency of the cost of it and the options we give consumers and getting closer to consumers and the second thing it will do it will take friction out of the system which means it will reduce the cost to fill a prescription so we re working on initiatives that don t just boost take out costs but they actually boost revenue and the connectivity to patients and consumers longer term and some of that will be lost these investments are large and they re multi year and they will also drive long term revenue and sustainable growth michael cherny bank of america merrill lynch analyst and i guess just quickly how do you balance all of those investments in long term initiatives against some of the quarterly volatility and reimbursement risks and the moving pieces on the transformational cost program that you see stefano pessina executive vice chairman and chief executive officer it s tough alex gourlay co chief operating officer it s not easy but we have our program management approach we have got a lot of cable people but it s not easy in every but we are paying a lot of attention to the future and to today as you can tell by the comments that james have made james kehoe executive vice president and global chief financial officer a lot of these funds go through the transformational cost management program and alex myself and ornella and head of hr sit on it we are the four people on it so it s a small team takes decisions quickly and frankly some of these are tough trade offs and in some quarters you theoretically can t afford it but you have to do it or otherwise you re going to damage the long term future of the company stefano pessina executive vice chairman and chief executive officer and this is the problem it s stefano yes every strategy our strategy is as it has always been a medium long term strategy and we believe in the pharmacy we believe in the hold that the pharmacies will have in future of course the pharmacy will have to be able to satisfy the needs of the patients and the needs of the customers and we are working in that direction not all the pharmacies will provide in future not all the pharmacies will be important in the local economy of the city or the villages we try to be in pharmacy that can have a whole and of course we have to invest we had to invest now for the future if we work just for the next quarter maybe we will have a little better results but at the end we will probably create a problem over the long survival of our stores of our pharmacies and now you have to take a decision either you believe in the strategy which is focused on the long term or you just try to look at the next quarters and maybe you try to do deals just to let s say make easier over less evidence the problems that you have we have decided to work for the long term and i hope that at the end we would be right operator there are no further questions at this time i turn the call back over to the presenters gerald gradwell senior vice president of special projects and

indicating positive market sentiment sempraâ s beta is 0 43 the stock moves directionally with the overall market but not as sharply positive and negative risks serving the different geographic areas of california and texas does not ensure the economies of the regions will balance one another or move counter cyclically to one another they could reinforce one another by being strongly negative or strongly positive due to national rather than regional factors such as tax policy or interest rate changes still utility demand correlates well to economic growth southern california and especially the texas service area for oncor are experiencing good growth with a liability to asset ratio of 68 sempra like the utility sector generally is somewhat more exposed to interest rate increases than companies in other sectors finally the example of pg eâ s pcg wildfires electrical service interruption lawsuits bankruptcy and interactions with california regulators is negative moreover california is expressly reducing both direct use of inexpensive natural gas and the use of natural gas for electricity generation an increase in the cost of electricity could offset prior demand growth recommendations for sempra investors looking solely for dividends may find sempraâ s 2 6 yield less desirable than higher yields at other utilities while those looking for capital appreciation may regard the california regulatory and environmental risk to be too steep additionally the current stock price is near the 1 year target and the top of the 52 week price range nonetheless sempra has

let s face it 2019 is going to be a hard year to beat stocks and 401 k plans up more than 25 on average wage gains of 3 to 5 7 million surplus jobs and the lowest unemployment and inflation rates in nearly 50 years that s a lot to celebrate booms like this don t happen by accident the imperative is for republicans to connect the dots between this banner year for the middle class and tax cuts deregulation policies and pro america energy production initiatives so will 2020 continue the winning streak the only thing that we know for sure is that economists don t know for sure i ll include myself in that category the best i can do is provide reasons for optimism and reasons for pessimism the case for optimism no 1 america has scored two big wins on the trade front the biggest risk since president donald trump entered office was a freeze up of the global trading system because of trump tariffs now with the concluding of the trade deal with canada and mexico and a very positive outlook for a trade win in the tariff wars against china investors are bullish the china deal takes an escalation of tariffs off the table for 2020 no 2 the federal reserve is finally getting it right a year ago the fed torpedoed the economy and the stock market fell by 2 500 points while gdp growth and investment stalled out now rates are lower there is more dollar liquidity and we have price stability with very little risk of inflation no 3 trump tax cuts are working the tax cuts have been a spectacular success in terms of job creation wage hikes profits and gdp growth the chance of those tax cuts going away in 2020 is close to zero if anything we might see another small tax cut in sum the policy goals are turned toward growth no 4 washington will be paralyzed with partisan gridlock in 2020 good when things are going well less is more so what could go wrong here are four things to worry about no 1 the china trade deal could blow up beijing could back out they ve done it before or they could start cheating if either happens trump hammers them with more tariffs and we are back in a trade war no 2 elizabeth warren bernie sanders joe biden oh my if markets start anticipating that any of these anti growth candidates will win stocks will tumble if trump loses then we are talking green new deal medicare for all capital gains taxes wealth taxes and the end of the trump tax cuts to say this would be harmful to growth and stocks is a vast understatement and if trump loses to one of these candidates the market could collapse no 3 the global economy could stay flat it s been stalled out for the last year or two and if growth doesn t boost in europe and elsewhere it s going to negatively impact u s growth we can t keep carrying the world economy on our shoulders no 4 the housing bubble could burst again don t look now but fannie mae and freddie mac are up to their old tricks providing near 100 loan guarantees on 2 3 down payment loans if housing values fall defaults will soar as they did in 2008 and 2009 amazingly the government has learned none of the lessons from the last housing meltdown on balance i m with the bulls for 2020 just don t expect 25 gains again this year stephen moore is a senior fellow at the heritage foundation and an economic consultant with freedomworks
since the great recession and occupy wall street economists and left leaning politicians have been calling out the 1 the small number of people in the u s that hold most of the wealth french economist thomas piketty wrote that not since the gilded age of the 1920s immediately preceding the great depression have the american people experienced such a divide between the rich and poor wikimedia commons cacophony the mls currently lists only 28 properties in bend that would be considered affordable for a household with two full time workers making an average yearly salary of 63 680 each rent for a professionally managed two bedroom apartment in bend averages 1 735 a month according to the u s department of housing and urban development in his book capital in the twenty first century piketty argues that labor income inequality is probably higher than in any other society at any time in the past anywhere in the world including societies in which skill disparities were extremely large but how does this track out in bend at first glance it s hard to miss the juxtaposition between the multimillion dollar mansions on awbrey butte compared with the cars and tents on nearby bureau of land management land but are these just extreme examples are most people in the third fastest growing city in the u s living the prosperous middle class dream i dug into some local data to find out income spectrum comparing the incomes of bend s top 1 to the bottom 99 bend ranked 108th out of 916 cities for inequality according to the economic policy institute which used irs statistics of income data through 2015 the top 1 percent of people in bend then made 21 7 times more than average income of the bottom 99 using data from the u s census bureau from 2014 2018 revealed that in deschutes county 25 of households made over 100 000 a year while the bottom 25 made less than 35 000 the income poverty rate is currently 7 1 according to census data do people in bend make a lot of passive income through investments and rental property digging into the numbers from the u s bureau of economic analysis reveals that income in deschutes county is 8 5 higher than in the rest of the state this contrasts with the u s census estimates of median earnings in bend which are only 1 3 higher than the state s why is there a difference damon runberg a regional central oregon economist with the oregon employment department told the source that this is because the bea data is able to track some money earned beyond wages this passive income is often earned as a result of having more accumulated wealth owning property and stocks for example we have a higher share of income in deschutes county from dividends interest and rent runberg said much of that is the impact of a higher share of retirees but also people who have income from rental properties or stock sales we also had a notably higher share of personal income coming from the self employed zooming out to incomes in all of oregon runberg s colleague barbara peniston at the oed demonstrated that the wages of middle and lower class oregonians have risen slightly since 1990 while the 1 s income has grown by 52 the top 10th of the 1 s wages have more than doubled to a median of 1 million in 2018 meanwhile all wage earners in the bottom 80 have seen their share of wages decrease since 1990 with the largest losses experienced by the middle class according to the oregon center for public policy the median oregon income in 2016 was 35 600 only 1 850 higher than it was in 1980 after adjusting for inflation runberg s data shows an upward trend in wages in oregon between 2014 and 2017 driven by low unemployment these gains benefited workers across the income spectrum and increases in the minimum wage have been especially beneficial for those in the bottom 20 according to a wage growth study runberg published in 2018 wealth and housing outside of income wealth inequality paints a much starker picture on a national level the top 1 10th of 1 of americans own more wealth than the bottom 80 combined according to bloomberg businessweek wealth is defined as the sum total of everything a person owns minus what they owe this includes everything from a home or many homes to money in savings accounts investments in stocks and bonds and retirement accounts debts are a combination of student loans mortgages credit card balances and any other bills that need to be paid the bottom half of americans combined have negative net worth meaning their debts are greater than their assets according to wallethub com people in bend are highly leveraged bend ranked in the 94th percentile for unsustainable credit card debt meaning it will take bendites longer to pay off the debt and cost them more to do so this could be an indication that high costs of living are requiring some to go into debt to continue to live here sonia capece homesource director at neighborimpact explained how wealth and income inequality are connected to bend s affordable housing crisis the median income in bend is 63 680 so middle income housing would cost 318 400 for two full time wage earners using the house price to income ratio of 2 5 she said today an mls search produces 28 listings for sale in that price range and most of them are manufactured homes it is impossible to know whether much of bend s real estate has been purchased by wealthy people from outside of town over the last few decades but capece believes that as many people lost their homes during the great recession at least some of that real estate was bought as investment property or second homes by people who had higher incomes than the average bend worker a pattern that continues to drive prices beyond the reach of the local middle class those who can t afford homes are paying the price through rising rents capece said oregon employment departmen since 1990 the top 1 of oregon s wage earners has seen its slice of total wages increase by 40 while the middle class has seen its share shrink by 12 what caused wealth inequality there are dozens of interconnected reasons that inequality is on the rise but here are piketty s top hypotheses blue collar middle class jobs have moved overseas or have been automated the buying power of the minimum wage has decreased skyrocketing costs of healthcare and education union membership has dropped by more than a half combined with weaker labor protections changes in the tax code that have benefited the wealthy while some companies offshore profits tech giants like google amazon and apple concentrate prosperity in places where they re located antimonopoly policy degraded beginning in the 1970s contributing to the rise of walmart and amazon ceo salaries have skyrocketed according to piketty wealth inequality in the u s follows a chronological u shape peaking in 1930 dropping to historic lows in the 50s and 60s and then reaching the heights of the roaring 20s again today he writes that inequality declined in the mid 20th century because of the redistribution policies of president franklin roosevelt the high tax rates on the wealthy up to 70 and the strength of the labor movement the tides began to shift when president ronald reagan brought in a new era of anti tax legislation that benefited the wealthy in the 1980s nicknamed trickledown economics in 1999 president bill clinton deregulated the stock market and allowed some investment banks and savings banks to join together something outlawed since the great depression this essentially meant banks were again allowed to make risky investments with people s savings some economists would argue that this is what lead to the great recession and the government bailout of banks that had gambled with their customer s savings because most middle class americans accumulate wealth through home ownership the recession robbed millions of their only source of equity further exacerbating the wealth gap another popular hypothesis for inequality is shifting labor markets in the 1970s services began to replace manufacturing as factory jobs went overseas which reduced opportunities for the blue collar middle class and pushed profits towards finance insurance and real estate today s tech sector offers greater opportunity for those with education and skills while jobs in fast food retail and online shipping are low skill low wage jobs the stock market provides another place to start in the search to find the root causes of inequality only 10 of the population owns 84 of the stock market according to the new york times as housing health care and other costs of living increase middle and working class americans have less left to invest in their futures and therefore have little to gain from stock market growth gross domestic product growth often touted as good news which leads to job growth and wage gains may no longer translate into positive outcomes for working americans according to fortune this is because companies are getting better returns by using their profits to buy back their own stocks or invest in labor saving technology instead of hiring more workers or raising their wages president donald trump s 2017 tax cuts and jobs act continued the pattern of inequality by cutting the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 it made it easier for american and multinational corporations to avoid paying their share of taxes and it gives the top 20 a 2 9 tax cut according to bloomberg piketty s protégé gabriel zucman is another french economist who now works at the university of california at berkley he estimates that the richest people in the world are storing 7 6 trillion in offshore accounts hiding 80 of it from governments resulting in 200 billion in lost tax revenue per year according to his book the hidden wealth of nations possible solutions mansion tax the city of bend could tax an additional 1 or more on homes worth over 1 million this has been proposed in cities around the country many of which are up against similar state wide restraints like oregon measure 5 passed in 1990 capped property taxes at 1 5 it would take state level legislation to allow cities to levy a mansion tax but it could help raise funds for road repairs and workforce housing for example there are currently no states that do this but many have a transfer tax paid when a home is sold in washington state as of january this tax is progressively higher for homes worth more than 500 000 according to the center on budget and policy priorities raise the minimum wage deschutes county s minimum wage increased to 11 25 in july and will reach 13 50 by 2022 due to the passage of oregon senate bill 1532 federal minimum wage has been 7 25 since 2009 seattle petaluma california and new york state have raised the minimum wage to 15 with exceptions for small business inequality org estimates that if minimum wage kept pace with gdp and overall wage gains it would be 21 hour with the 2020 presidential elections approaching candidates such as massachusetts senator elizabeth warren and vermont senator bernie sanders are running on platforms that include a wealth tax and higher income taxes for the super rich meanwhile the cato institute a libertarian think tank funded by the koch brothers among others argues that wealth distribution is not the answer because just because some people are making more doesn t mean other people are making less instead there is just more money in the economy wealth distribution will reduce incentives to innovate according to a number of studies on cato org anand giridharadas journalist for the new york times and author of winners take all the elite charade of changing the world wrote that the election of trump was largely a response to the civil unrest of the working class that he believes have been left behind even as gdp and the stock market continues to grow and unemployment is at an all time low a successful society is a progress machine giridharadas wrote it takes in the raw material of innovations and produces broad human advancement america s machine is broken when the fruits of change have fallen on the united states in recent decades the very fortunate have basketed almost all of them
most americans are not aware that in the last four years portugal has buttressed its socialism programs abandoned economic austerity and improved its economy greatly sanders programs would do that as well we were at a meeting at occupy san miguel and watched the meryl streep film the laundromat then we had the usual post film discussion naturally everyone was somewhat depressed with the themes in the film which was money laundering but the negative discussion about where america is going under trump made me think of a recent and informative article about portugal not too long ago portugal stood on the brink of catastrophe harsh austerity policies and the erosion of labor rights pushed by the conservative government lead to significant rises in poverty and unemployment the economy dwindled due to the lack of peoples spending power today everything has changed it s been more than three years since the socialist party assumed the reins of government since then the skepticism of the early days has virtually vanished the entirety of europe seems impressed by the success story of antónio costa the portuguese economy has been booming for 4 years 2017 marked the largest national economic growth of the century the portuguese are not only showing the feasibility of socially conscious policies but demonstrating the significant potential for success hence the socialists raised the once slashed wages and pensions reintroduced paid vacations and retracted many tax raises all while raising wealth taxes which affect only the rich parts of the population furthermore the government introduced a property and real estate tax designed not to target the homes of average citizens costa s socialists also put an end to the catastrophic privatizations that were once instructed by the eu and resulted in selling state assets at absurdly low prices the remarkable economic growth of the past years is to be only the beginning under socialist rule the economy grew so significantly that the money made is now set to be invested and returned to the general population portugal s government plans to use the rising public sector revenue to transform the nation into a more just and modern one after the conservatives destabilized the infrastructure costa presented a nation wide investment proposal and surprised many once again 20 billion euros is considered an incredible amount of money for a country the size of portugal sixty percent of the funds is to go towards public transportation the remaining money will be invested in the energy sector and environmental projects the much used railway line connecting lisbon and porto is to be modernized urban subway networks are to be expanded and public transportation in rural areas is to be invested in this will generate new jobs revitalize the economy and lift public transportation onto a state of the art level furthermore portugal will become more eco sensitive in the process we can compare this story to what has happened recently in the united states costa s program and approach seem very much to be like the ones proposed by bernie sanders and completely counter to what has occurred under trump what portugal s experience has taught us is that abandoning austerity and so called conservative economic policies in favor of a socially minded approach can result in economic improvement the portuguese experience mimics what happened in the u s during the 1930 s and the second world war boosting the money paid to the lower and middle classes while taxing the rich results in increased spending and this results in economic expansion the taxing of the wealthy prevents economic instability and transferring money to the lower and middle classes increases spending doing the opposite and putting more money in the hands of the wealthy means that much of the wealth is unused the american myth of trickle down economics has been proven to be false if large portions of economic earnings are simply moved to the wealthy those earnings go unused which results in economic depression the fact that stock values may rise does little if real goods and services are not produced through an expansion of the economy the portuguese experience proves that a socialist economy does not mean a depressed economy rather it can mean an economy and a society that grows let s not forget that china operates under a government run economy and it has expanded greatly in the past 75 years what portugal has proved is that the economy can expand without the sort of rigid controls that the chinese used what bernie sanders is proposing for the united states is similar to what has happened in portugal in many respects the sanders program is not really socialism but more akin to the programs which fdr instituted in the 1930 s it may be recalled that in 1944 fdr proposed a second bill of rights which was essentially one of economic rights in addition to healthcare housing education and the right to a fair income sanders has added gun controls lgbtq equality empowering tribal nations wall street reform climate control and jobs for all among others he hasn t proposed nationalizing any industries although he has proposed federal funds for non private internet providers he has a broad and specific program in many areas such as public education combat racial discrimination and school segregation end the unaccountable profit motive of charter schools provide equitable funding for public schools give teachers a much deserved raise by setting a starting salary for teachers at no less than 60 000 expanding collective bargaining rights and teacher tenure and funding out of pocket expenses for classroom materials strengthens the individuals with disabilities education act idea by ensuring that the federal government provides at least 50 percent of the funding for special education and giving special education teachers the support they need provide year round free universal school meals and incentivizes locally sourced food make schools safe and inclusive by protecting the rights of all students from harassment discrimination and violence and enacting comprehensive gun violence prevention laws rebuild modernize and green our nation s schools during our post laundromat discussion one of the participants suggested that the democrats and particularly bernie sanders come up with a different term than socialism for what is being proposed green new deal was one of the terms and this has a positive linkage to fdr and to ecology the most important aspect of the sanders program is to guarantee certain fundamental aspects of economic life without significant personal cost to individuals who cannot afford them and to pay for the cost by raising taxes on the wealthy this will keep the u s financially stable instead of going more and more into public debt will boost the economy and will create an economically just society when compared with the unjust economy and governmental craziness that trump has imposed the result promises a much improved america and trump seems to promise us nothing but more wars and no protection against deteriorating ecology the sanders solution is fight climate change by drastically lowering military spending and moving towards peace as a foreign policy

call with me today are rusty gordon rpm s vice president and chief financial officer and matt ratajczak our vice president of global tax treasury and also in charge of our investor relations i ll kick off the call with some comments on our second quarter results and an update on our 2020 map to growth operating improvement plan then matt will review the second quarter numbers in more detail rusty will conclude our formal comments with our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2020 and then we ll take your questions for the third consecutive quarter our earnings were up significantly over the prior year and ahead of expectations our strong bottom line growth in the quarter was primarily driven by our 2020 map to growth program which is enabling us to grow earnings at a faster rate than our peers last year selling price increases coupled with moderating raw material inflation has also positively impacted results revenue was up 2 8 during the quarter organic sales growth were up 3 5 due to market share gains and some pricing activity we are pleased with this organic growth given the aggressive product line rationalization taking place at rpm along with the current macro environment in which we are operating in regard to our 2020 map to growth operating improvement plan the specific actions we have taken during the quarter included continuing to delayer management at different groups consolidating manufacturing and shedding low margin product lines to free up resources for more value added ebit accretive volume so far through 2020 map to growth program we have discontinued product lines on an annualized basis with revenues of approximately 60 million to 70 million we also announced the closure of 3 plants in the second quarter along with 1 more plant completed so far in the early part of the third quarter this brings our total to 19 out of a planned map to growth program 31 plant consolidations on a consolidated basis we realized 2020 map to growth savings in the second quarter totaling about 31 million 9 million of which came from manufacturing 10 million from procurement and 12 million from g a as you may recall we realized savings during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and the first quarter of fiscal 2020 of 21 million and 26 million respectively i point this out because these successive quarterly increases in 2020 map to growth operating improvement plan total savings demonstrate the strong momentum of earnings improvement that the program is generating in terms of our operating improvement plan we continue to make progress in our central led procurement function as we better leverage our spending through a consolidation of material spending across operating companies our strategic suppliers are finding opportunities as well so they can grow their business with rpm by capitalizing on this recent change in our approach also on the procurement side we continue to negotiate improved payment terms with the supplier base and have added some significant supplier financing programs that provide advantages for both rpm and our suppliers in manufacturing we are increasing productivity by closing underutilized plants while improving efficiency in the plants that we continue to operate allowing us to reduce costs and improve service to our customers we continue to invest in training our workforce and continuous improvement disciplines and we are seeing good progress in our plants through our focused improvement team efforts we are in the early innings of our accounting consolidation and expect to see the additional savings that it generates as well as savings from erp consolidations in wave 3 of our 2020 map to growth program i ll now turn the call over to matt ratajczak to review our results for the quarter matthew ratajczak thanks frank and good morning everyone please note that my comments will be about our financial results for this year s second quarter and will be on an as adjusted basis we achieved record consolidated net sales of 1 4 billion up 2 8 compared to the 1 36 billion reported during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 as frank stated organic sales growth was 3 5 or 47 7 million acquisitions contributed 0 6 to sales or 8 5 million while foreign exchange continued to be a headwind that reduced sales by 1 3 or 17 5 million as frank also mentioned our 2020 map to growth program generated significant earnings leverage to the bottom line also contributing to the bottom line was the margin improvement resulting from pricing and some moderating raw material costs ebit increased 22 to 153 7 million for an ebit margin of 11 versus last year s ebit margin of 9 2 diluted eps increased 31 to 0 76 per diluted share from 0 58 per diluted share a year ago share repurchases in the prior year s convertible bond retirement resulted in 0 02 per diluted share accretion for the quarter now looking at our performance on a segment basis sales in our construction products group was very strong and increased 6 9 to 499 5 million growth was largely organic at 7 4 or 34 5 million aided by a backlog from last quarter that resulted from exceptionally rainy weather that had slowed construction activity in addition we picked up market share in a somewhat lukewarm north american commercial construction market acquisitions contributed 1 2 or 5 8 million primarily from the recent nudura and schul transactions organic growth was offset by foreign currency translation which reduced sales by 1 7 or 8 1 million and also by product rationalization through which we are discontinuing product offerings that did not meet our more stringent margin or working capital standards from a geographic perspective european markets remained soft we re combating this by reducing overhead and proactively managing our product mix to simultaneously improve earnings and margins our latin american businesses generated good growth in constant currencies segment ebit increased 43 3 or 18 7 million to 61 9 million this improvement was largely attributed to volume growth 2020 map to growth savings pricing and the contribution from acquisitions sales in our performance coatings group were 292 7 million up a modest 0 3 from last year organic growth was 1 7 million or 4 8 million driven by our businesses providing corrosion control and fireproofing coatings as we noted last quarter the segment was reorganized under a global brand management structure which is beginning to bear fruit it s enabling us to pick up market share in europe and we experienced continued growth in north america particularly in our carboline product line impacting organic sales were strategic actions to exit soft international markets and low margin product lines acquisitions added 0 1 to sales while foreign exchange was 4 3 million or a 1 5 headwind segment ebit increased 12 6 to 37 million much like last quarter 2020 map to growth savings provided this segment with strong earnings leverage despite essentially flat sales growth operating improvement initiatives included workforce reductions and the exit from 2 margin dilutive businesses also contributing to the bottom line was pricing and improved product mix in the consumer group sales were strong increasing 6 to 450 9 million organic sales increased 6 4 or 27 1 million driven by new sealant and adhesive products that generated new accounts and market share gains this segment also benefited from pent up north american demand for exterior small project paints and coatings that was caused by the exceptionally wet weather during the spring and early summer sales in europe a large percentage of which are in the u k were soft due to the weak macroeconomic conditions in europe and also uncertainty surrounding brexit acquisitions contributed 0 6 or 2 5 million to sales while foreign currency translation reduced sales by 1 ebit in the consumer group was 54 7 million an increase of 26 8 over the prior year this improvement was a result of actions taken including the 2020 map to growth initiatives such as enhanced manufacturing disciplines and 2 plant closures plus the price increases from last year these programs are helping margins recover and trend higher towards historical levels the specialty products group top line was impacted by a difficult comparison to the prior year when demand was elevated due to natural disasters these included hurricane activity that boosted demand for our restoration equipment and more rampant wildfires that drove demand for our fluorescent pigments which are used in fire retardant tracer dies in order to accelerate growth in the segment s top line we have made recent management changes segment sales were 158 2 million organic sales decreased 10 5 and foreign currency translation reduced sales by 0 6 there was no impact from acquisitions ebit was 23 2 million during the quarter which was lower than the 28 8 million of ebit in the prior year we continue to implement operational improvements to reduce costs in this segment including the consolidation of the erp system to 1 platform and we also continue to invest in selective initiatives to revive growth going into fiscal 2021 we expect that the segment will see the benefits of these actions in the coming quarters lastly a comment on cash flow for the first half of fiscal 2020 cash from operations grew by 102 4 to 300 2 million compared to 148 3 million a year ago this increase of 151 9 million was due to initiatives to reduce working capital and improve margins i ll now turn the call over to rusty for details on our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2020 russell gordon thanks matt looking forward to our 2020 third quarter we expect to generate consolidated sales growth of 2 5 to 4 we anticipate leveraging this sales growth to the bottom line for an estimated 25 to 30 adjusted ebit growth resulting in adjusted diluted eps in the high teens to low 0 20 range historically our third quarter generates our most modest results each year because it falls during the winter months of december through february when painting and construction activity is slow due to cold and snowy weather additionally i should point out that based on history we expect roughly 20 of our annual consolidated sales to be generated during the third quarter and a proportionate amount of this fiscal year s 2020 map to growth savings will result during the period as well our fourth quarter results are typically the strongest as weather improves and work begins to accelerate on painting and construction projects based on our results for the first half and our expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year we are reaffirming the full year fiscal 2020 guidance we provided on july 22 2019 and maintained in our last earnings release in october our full year sales growth is anticipated to be on the low end of our previously disclosed range of 2 5 to 4 as previously disclosed we expect to leverage the positive momentum of the 2020 map to growth operating improvement plan to our bottom line and are maintaining our projected adjusted ebit growth in the 20 to 24 range we expect this will result in adjusted diluted eps between 3 30 and 3 42 for our full 2020 fiscal year this concludes our formal comments and we will now be pleased to take your questions question and answer session operator and from bmo capital markets we have john mcnulty john mcnulty congratulations with regard to the construction business and the pickup that you saw there and the strong volumes i guess when you look at the backlog of projects i guess how should we think about how much of that pent up demand from the wet weather has already worked itself through and how much may still remain for kind of the especially i guess the fourth quarter levels as they roll through the rest of the year frank sullivan sure in our roofing and waterproofing businesses our backlog remains pretty robust in the construction sealant business we have seen some slowing mostly around major projects our real strength is in broad distribution so that continues to be pretty good there and the last comment i ll make is whether it s admixtures or roofing or waterproofing we seem to be taking some market share because i think the growth that we re experiencing in north america is somewhat larger than what the market is delivering john mcnulty got it and then in the consumer business is there a way to figure out how much of the growth was tied to some of the channel filling that you may be doing at lowe s and ace where it is just normal demand and some of that again weather related pent up demand or is it tough to figure that one out frank sullivan no john it s the latter it was really good solid performance and good growth no channel filling in this quarter clearly we were the beneficiary of and the flip side has hurt in the first quarter of what was a really rainy and kind of bad weather start to the summer which not only impacted us but impacted others so some of the strength in the second quarter in consumer i think was projects that were delayed from the early part of the summer because of the weather into the back end of the summer and into the fall which impacted positively our first or our second quarter john mcnulty got it and then maybe just one last question just with regard to cash flow you re running at a pretty high level this year given some of the work that you ve done on the working capital front i guess as we think about the back half of the year and the uses for that cash going forward i guess how should we be thinking about that it looks like you took down the 450 million note i guess i m wondering how much may go toward buybacks as you re looking toward the back half frank sullivan sure as we communicated in the last couple of quarters we expected to execute our share repurchase program a little more slowly and deliberately than the fast start we got out as you ll recall on our 1 billion repurchase commitment we completed half of that inside of 9 months and so i think the balance of it will play out over the next couple of years you should expect to see a balance of free cash flow between share repurchases and debt repayment operator from g research we have rosemarie morbelli rosemarie morbelli could you frank could you talk about what matt sullivan has found since he joined the firm in terms of new opportunities and potentially any change in the focus from map and the expectation early expectation of 290 million of savings frank sullivan sure i think mike sullivan has been instrumental in helping to take over and really run the manufacturing and procurement side of our map to growth program in partnership with tim kinser and gordy hyde who are both part of rpm for a long time and really part of the team that architected the map to growth program with steve knoop we have exited the alixpartners relationship entirely and are utilizing some regional consultants such did our annualized spend in the early parts of the map to growth program weâ re in the 25 million range and now we re in the 5 million or 6 million range so i mentioned that as that gives you some sense of how we are internalizing some of the learnings that have come out of map to growth the work on the factory floor by our people is going really well and it s a real tribute to them and i think that the challenge that we face at the board level even is in the next 12 months figuring out what elements of map to growth are completed such that we wave the victory flag on plant consolidation and other elements and then when elements of our map to growth operating improvement initiative become permanent parts of how we operate rosemarie morbelli and no change in the 290 million worth of savings over the period frank sullivan no i think that as i ve commented before there are 2 assumptions we made upfront that in hindsight were a little bit incorrect we assumed sg a savings equally across the 3 waves in fact our biggest part of sg a savings were in wave 1 and as we get into the third and fourth quarter we ll be annualizing those and then the second part of sg a savings for all practical purposes has been or will be deferred to the point that we complete the erp implementations and some of the accounting consolidation that we re working on the other piece of it is the working capital there s more to come there again our original assumptions that we would get some of that early proved to be incorrect because by necessity we needed to get the plant consolidation and the continuous improvement elements initiated and completed such that we will really start to benefit so you ll see i think more in the next fiscal year and beyond in terms of working capital conversion to cash which we re excited about and as it relates to 290 million we are on target and i think post the original date of december 31 2020 we will see ultimately more than 290 million as we benefit from some of these new initiatives in subsequent years rosemarie morbelli and if i may ask one more question about you mentioned that acquisitions were doing well could you give us little more details on nudura schul and whoever else is doing better maybe than expected frank sullivan sure without getting into too much in the way of specifics in each case these were product lines particularly the nudura and schul acquisitions that we could integrate into our construction products group and bring the marketing and sales and distribution resources of our construction products group to bear on those good businesses and so the organic growth rates in those businesses are teens mid to high teens and it s pretty exciting i will tell you historically it was our 50 of revenue industrial segment that was the laggard at rpm in terms of margin performance and improvement having separated that into the construction products group and the performance coatings group we ve got 2 exceptional leadership teams they re very strategic about the reorganization that we ve affected and we are seeing that in our results and that s going to continue operator from bank of america we have steve byrne steve byrne it sounds like you see some potential upside to that 290 million cost target cost savings target when you rolled out that map to growth program you had also targeted an ebit margin of 16 or something around 500 basis points higher than where you were at the end of this quarter is that still seem realistic to you and do you see this 200 basis point year over year increases that you ve had these last couple of quarters is that likely to continue based on projects you have underway frank sullivan sure as we ve communicated the last couple of quarters principally related to growth the achievement of our absolute goals are probably 12 to 18 months further out than we had originally planned and the principal reason there is that as you ll recall in our november 2018 investor communication and based on our historic growth rates over the prior 5 and 20 years we assume the combination of organic growth and acquisition growth of about 5 6 compounded over that 3 year period the first half of this year consolidated results are up 1 8 and so it s that growth element that s not unique to us that has caused us to communicate in the last couple of quarters that our achievement of absolute goals both in terms of 1 billion of ebit and the margin goals are going to be pushed out a little bit but we are still making great progress and i think when you look at our results versus the prior year and what we hope will continue to be outperformance to many of our peers the map to growth program is working well and on track steve byrne and frank you indicated you re pulling in a lot of the resources internally to run this program has this have you revisited the scope of this restructuring program to determine whether there s any other levers to pull that you hadn t previously developed frank sullivan we are continuing to look to add elements to our pipeline and i don t know that i would add much more to that but it s an ongoing process obviously the bigger opportunities get done first but there continue to be opportunities in plant improvement areas that we continue to add and it s why we re very comfortable in the years following the december 31 2020 end date that we originally communicated we would expect to see map to growth savings that exceed the 290 million in total steve byrne and then just one quick one wanted to ask whether your fireproof coatings and or your fire retardant tracer dies are fluorinated compounds and if so do you see any potential human exposure pathways where you could get sucked into the pfas issues frank sullivan yes no that s a great question and the answer to that is no we did pursue an acquisition for many years of a private company that would have been a good part of rpm but they had some exposure there and that was the principal reason that we did not acquire that business it was subsequently acquired by a competitor and so as you might imagine given our past toward experience we re highly sensitive to those issues operator from fermium research we have frank mitsch frank mitsch looking at the 180 bps of margin improvement i imagine most of that is map to growth but can you expand upon the pricing versus raw materials interplay in terms of margin improvement and what your expectations are in the back half of your fiscal 2020 frank sullivan sure of that organic growth i think on a consolidated basis the way to think about it is an even split between unit volume and price obviously that varies differently between our segments and our business units we have greater challenges in our consumer segment relative to some of their unique raw materials metal cans and packaging seedlac a few other items and so there s been some more challenges there than there have been in our industrial businesses for instance and we begin to annualize the largest effect of our price increases at the end of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter and so you ll see the benefits of pure map to growth savings and what volume we can generate hit our bottom line as we annualize that price activity in the spring frank mitsch all right so that will start to moderate in the fiscal fourth quarter and you talked a little bit about some of the market share gains in admixtures et cetera how do we think about that into the back half of the year and in 21 frank sullivan it s hard to say i the economic activity is has been weak for a couple of years in europe and that continues i think there s been some slowing in certain areas in north america the good news is it seems like there is a decision on brexit and in our opinion almost regardless of the near term impact on the u k eliminating that uncertainty will be helpful it appears as if the usmca nafta revisited is going to get passed that will be helpful and so i think that we ve got really good momentum in terms of growth and market share gains in our construction products group in general we continue to have some real strong performance in our performance coatings group specifically our carboline corrosion control and fire proofing coatings and our stonhard flooring businesses we have the manufacturing challenges in consumer that we believe will be overcome by the fourth quarter or into the summer and then the biggest challenge that we have and we re tackling pretty hard is in our specialty products group where the i think underinvestment in some of these higher margin businesses has been a problem we ve had some leadership changes as matt alluded to and are investing selectively in some new initiatives and we would expect to see them return to positive sales and earnings growth in the new fiscal year frank mitsch that s very helpful can you just expand upon the manufacturing challenges in consumer frank sullivan sure we picked up a bunch of market share i think as folks know in certain areas interior wood stains and finishes we picked up some share gains in our primary small project paint area we had lost some share at one of our major home center customers and we ve regained all that back and we had some manufacturing issues that were of our own making we had some environmental equipment that shut us down in 1 plant for a couple of weeks that was a problem we are investing in a significant new aerosol capacity the installation of which caused some disruption in another major plant and so it s a cacophony of those types of items including capacity issues that we re now addressing that caused some disruptions for us and i wouldn t that s probably more information than you need to know but we worked hard to make sure that we could service our customers in light of those issues and now we re working hard to make sure that we get those efficiencies that will hit our bottom line operator from baird we have ghansham panjabi ghansham panjabi i guess just going back to the 3 5 core sales growth for the second quarter can you just give us a sense frank as to how it played out on a monthly basis you touched on some of the pent up demand et cetera how did that actually play out through the course of the quarter and then just give us an early read on what you saw in december as well if you don t mind frank sullivan sure i would tell you that we had a big september which was a and that was both in our construction products group and our consumer group and we feel that that was a little bit outsized in relationship to some of the weather impact in the first quarter and while not wanting to get into details month by month in the future when you look at things they re choppy we didn t have a particularly great october and we had a really strong november december looks good and i think we re on track for the forecast for the third quarter which is going to be another strong quarter with great leverage to the bottom line as i say that i m looking out my window and it s snowing in cleveland ohio and so our third quarter is always subject to weather impacts and other items given its relatively low seasonality ghansham panjabi okay that s helpful and then matt made a comment on i think a lukewarm north american commercial construction market can you just expand on that what do you see going into this year on a calendar year basis specific to north american commercial construction frank sullivan sure i think we see more of the same and i think we re hopeful that maybe some of the uncertainty around trade will revive industrial production activity in construction markets the biggest area of softness that we see are in big projects things like the apple headquarters we had a lot of success in canada around a very rapid build out on cannabis in the cannabis industry in terms of warehousing and production we had significant specification in the mexico the new mexico city airport which was canceled and so the if there s any disappointment or weakness it s in that area our broad distribution which really serves kind of the maintenance and repair and or low commercial construction continues to be pretty solid ghansham panjabi okay just one final one i mean you gave us some of the cadence of map to growth 4q i think was 21 million 1q 26 million and 31 million for 2q how should we think about that same those that same element for the back half of the year on a quarterly basis frank sullivan sure well yes there are two elements there number one we ve annualized most of our sg a savings and the next bank for sg a savings will come in wave 3 i commented on that earlier and so the manufacturing improvements the plant consolidation those flow through our p l with sales and so you ll see a lower impact in q3 because we have lower sales that s the flip side is you ll see the same or more leverage to the ebit line than we ve done in the past but it will be in relationship to the sales in the quarter and then you ll see that pick back up again in q4 because we have a higher sales volume typically in our fourth quarter and so it will follow that and we still have pretty good momentum and we ll be in a position to talk more about what we see for fiscal 21 in april and certainly in july but the next couple of quarters look solid and the map to growth program is on track and on the margin we re continuing to add items to it operator from rbc we have arun viswanathan arun viswanathan congratulations on the results and the continued progress on map i guess the first question is just on the top line when you think about the consumer business you mentioned some of the manufacturing issues would you be able to kind of size what that maybe costs to you and if you see that coming back in the coming quarters frank sullivan yes i don t know that we would get into the detail on the manufacturing issues there it was beyond the detail i provided on an earlier question it was a number of challenges around capacity and our efforts to address that with a few hiccups in the process and we would expect to begin to see that you ll see the better impact of that in q4 and then into the next fiscal year as q3 again given the seasonal low nature of it isn t going to show up very well there arun viswanathan and just to i guess dig a little deeper when you think about the consumer business i know that in the past you ve mentioned that there s been some headwind from low unemployment and weakness in the small project category is that continuing and how would you expect that to play out if we do see continued improvement on some of the building products and homebuilding numbers that we re seeing right now frank sullivan sure the last four months for us i guess kind of august through this quarter have been pretty solid in terms of consumer takeaway and project work and we don t see any particular weakness there a lot of the weakness that we had over the last 12 months we believe is weather related going back to last spring and the early parts of the summer and our for instance our performance in the wood stains and finishes category that we picked up at a major home center customers met or exceeded expectations in terms of what that would do so the performance there is very solid the manufacturing issues that you had asked about were part self inflicted and we ve addressed those arun viswanathan and then on construction products and performance coatings you had mentioned some weakness in europe last quarter i think that there was that was definitely called out i think you re continuing to see that i guess i just wanted to get your thoughts and you mentioned brexit as well is it your sense that europe i guess deteriorated incrementally through fiscal second quarter and would you expect that to continue in the next couple of months i m just curious just given maybe an easier comp at this part of the year frank sullivan sure i think the results that we ve been seeing from a market perspective in europe in the primary markets we serve there have been weak for 2 years and in particular as it relates to map to growth we have taken a very deliberate approach to looking to exit lower margin business and in some cases discontinue lower margin or in a few instances no margin product lines and so we ve had a better earnings performance in the european market for our construction products and performance coatings business than we ve had sales performance and it s very deliberate process of strategically engineering a higher margin business profile i d like to think with the brexit decision and a focus on europe that we ll see some activity in europe improving but we don t see that as we sit here today arun viswanathan and then just lastly if i may on price cost looks like your price gains have been in the kind of 100 to 200 basis point range for a little while assuming that continues for the next couple of quarters or do you expect that to continue i guess just given raw materials or potentially entering a period maybe over the next 2 quarters of raw material deflation are we thinking about that the right way that is raw material rise should continue to kind of trend lower over the next couple of quarters but you still hold on to price is that a fair characterization frank sullivan i think that s a fair characterization in a lot of categories the deflation that s happened in the last 12 or 18 months is ending we annualize our price increases depending on the business unit and the segment starting in february and through the spring so we won t have as much year over year price impact in q3 and we will have a little or no in q4 in a number of our businesses our margins are still not where they were 5 or 6 years ago so we ve got work to do operator from vertical research we have kevin mccarthy kevin mccarthy frank you spoke to market share gains at some length but i wanted to ask you to elaborate there in terms of where you re gaining share why that s happening and how sustainable you think that will be do you think for example you could grow at 1 to 2 above market over the next year or perhaps longer what sort of framework might we apply to that dynamic frank sullivan sure particularly in our construction products group i think that is about the right way to think of it and i think that s sustainable we have been the leader in roof restoration coatings and continue to pursue both better performing and from a raw material perspective more environmentally friendly bio based resin products and so that s going really well we ve had some significant market share gains in our carboline product lines our dap product lines and i think this spring we ll see a couple of other market share moves in our consumer segment that we can talk about once they ve happened so there s i think the thing that we re most pleased with and again it s a great credit to the associates of rpm is the ability to keep our sales and marketing and businesses focused on their customers at the same time we re going through a significant change on the factory floor and across organizations that was our goal and so far knock wood that s working and we re excited about it i also think we ve been the beneficiary in the construction products group of some major competitors who have been for sale reorganizing and we ve been very focused on growth and that s helped us kevin mccarthy okay and then with regard to raw materials obviously the energy complex has become more volatile and uncertain in recent weeks but maybe you could talk a little bit about how you see the basket trending and also what you re doing on a company specific basis in your prepared remarks i think your you mentioned your procurement folks are negotiating some improved terms so would you expect to benefit beyond what is transpiring at the market level in terms of raw material costs frank sullivan yes and i think our gross margin improvement have demonstrated that we have had gross margin expansion in excess of many of our peers and we ve had a combination of some impact of cost price mix between price and raw material costs but a significant portion of it has come through centralizing our procurement activities and we have gone in a number of categories where we ve not been very well organized to 2 or 3 suppliers from 8 or 10 and with some outside consulting help which is still involved we ve taken categories that are 50 million annual spend all the way down to 0 5 million annual spend and we re starting to see the benefits of that consolidation i think about half of our gross margin improvement if we were to disclose a prime margin and i say prime margin a big chunk of our gross margin improvement is on the factory floor in terms of plant consolidation and continuous improvement at the prime margin level i would think the rough way to think about it is 50 is from a cost price mix benefit that the whole industry is experiencing and 50 is from the benefits of centralizing our procurement activity and consolidating our supplier base operator from ubs we have josh spector joshua spector just on the ebit bridge year over year i mean you highlighted earlier 31 million in cost savings from the map to growth plan i mean if i exclude specialty and then look at the organic growth maybe in the low mid single digits it seems like there was a little bit less leverage to the bottom line than expected on that basis can you help maybe bridge what some of the factors would be to drive that year over year frank sullivan i m not sure i understand the question i mean if you exclude specialty relative to our consolidated results then i think you would come to the conclusion that we have higher leverage in some of the other businesses but i m not maybe you could repeat that joshua spector sure so i guess what i m looking at is your adjusted ebit for the quarter was 154 million it was 126 million a year ago the cost savings was 31 million so that bridges to around 159 million you ve lost 6 million in specialty so i m looking at kind of that bridge as being roughly flat despite organic growth being 3 5 plus and i understand some of the manufacturing issues which might have been a factor just wondering if there s any other things that you would call out that might have led to like a lower year over year growth as a result of that russell gordon sure josh it s rusty here in terms of the map savings we disclosed of 31 million that s really total savings that is not an incremental year over year savings so that s maybe part of the confusion and when i look at specialty just to focus on that i see the sales were down 20 million and the ebit in specialty was down about a little more than 5 million so i think that s the normal drop down we d see from a revenue loss so did that help or can i answer some joshua spector yes no that helps yes i didn t realize it was cumulative versus just what was realized in the quarter so that s helpful russell gordon yes that would be the wave 1 and the small portion of wave 2 savings which we talked about last summer in our year end earnings release and as we discussed much of wave 2 is deferred to the back half of this fiscal year frank sullivan and you would have to net that 31 million against the disclosed map savings this time last year in the quarter russell gordon yes and what we disclosed last year with that in year end first 3 quarters we disclosed 32 million savings joshua spector okay great no that s helpful and then secondly just on the performance coatings business i was wondering if you can give some color on perhaps the backlog within the different parts of that business so you noted strength in energy curious how you re seeing that kind of pan out with some lower capex potential for next year and then maybe on the flooring side as well frank sullivan sure we don t see any change in the market outlook for either of those the deferment or cutting of kind of the capital spending budgets in the energy markets of a couple of years ago when oil prices plunged have stabilized and those that spend seems to be back to a normal level our energy activity is pretty broad as well it s everything from pipelines to windmill blades to transmission to different refineries one of the areas that used to be strong for us and it s been overcome by other parts of the market was offshore oil not a lot of activity there but it s been a real strong area of growth for us and quite candidly it s been like the one exception in the european marketplace where those product lines both through the normal spends and some market share gains have actually shown year over year solid growth in the european marketplace about the only business unit or product lines that we ve seen some solid growth in europe operator from morgan stanley we have vincent andrews steven haynes this is actually steve on for vincent i guess just two kind of quick ones on the third quarter ebit growth it was a bit lower maybe than expectations so considering that it is a smaller quarter for you guys but is there anything in there that is like notable to call out that could be maybe bridging that gap russell gordon yes in terms of some confusion i think you re talking steve about the third quarter and not the second quarter right steven haynes correct yes the 3q guidance russell gordon yes as we tried to convey through our outlook it s a seasonally low quarter so we typically do roughly 20 of our sales in the third quarter and if you re looking at map savings and i ll make this up let s say there s 100 million of map savings we would expect evenly throughout the year you would not get 25 of those savings in the third quarter because sales volume is down our cost of sales is down as a percent of the total year so that might be some of the confusion in terms of the third quarter outlook frank sullivan yes as i mentioned in my prepared remarks the sg a savings have been annualized so there s no year over year map savings in sg a the next wave for us will be wave 3 what has been continuing to grow is the plant consolidation and continuous improvement activity and the procurement activity all of that gets capitalized into inventory and then it gets realized as we sell products and on a lower revenue month you re going to have lower income and a lower impact having said that a 25 to 30 ebit growth year over year is actually an improvement over the ebit growth that we just experienced in 2q and so we re well on track in terms of where we are and we re on track in terms of our internal forecast relative to what we expect in the third quarter and it continues to be solid ebit growth on what appears to be continuing relative modest sales growth somewhere in the 2 to 4 range steven haynes okay that s helpful and then just a follow up on specialty i think maybe last quarter you mentioned that you d kind of see some of the initiatives underway starting to kind of work its way through by the fourth quarter and kind of starting in the beginning of fiscal 2021 is that still the time line or are things maybe a bit pushed out like how long should we expect weakness to kind of last frank sullivan no that s the time line i think that s correct and that s what we see you ll see them being a positive contributor to sales and earnings growth towards the back half of this fiscal year and into fiscal 21 so i think that s exactly the time line that we see operator from seaport research we have mike harrison michael harrison i also had a quick one on the specialty segment you had guided last quarter that the full year fiscal 20 would be see sales flat to down slightly and now this quarter is coming in down 10 5 organically can you just help us frame up whether that was worse or better than you had expected and should we still be using flat to down slightly number for the full year sales assumption frank sullivan yes i think that the performance in the second quarter was slightly below our expectations in the specialty segment and it s principally around some major product categories the legend brands business had and the impact of weather related events for that business was very modest and then with our day glo business i think rusty commented on this a major product category for them in the past has been dyes and pigments used in fire spotting chemicals retardants and it was a very moderate fire season compared to the past seasons notwithstanding the publicity of the fires around los angeles and so that was a slower area both of those are high margin businesses that had lower than expected revenues and that negatively impacted the segment for the balance of the year i think they ll be back on track but they will not recover the somewhat lower than expected sales results in q2 michael harrison the fluorescent tracer dies for fire retardants are those being used in australia right now or is that not a market that you sell into frank sullivan yes i don t believe so but i actually don t know the answer to that question we can certainly find out and get back to you offline michael harrison okay and then last question is more on the consumer side of the business can you talk about what you re seeing in terms sell through and point of sales data at your big box retail customers any sense of where those customers stand on inventory levels as we start to move into this slower seasonal period is that relatively normal inventory levels or are they running a little bit high frank sullivan no i think consumer takeaway has been pretty solid it was choppy as we commented earlier relative to slow in the summer or slower than expected and pretty solid in the fall we were negatively impacted by some significant inventory adjustments by some of our major customers last year i think inventory levels are lower and we don t expect the same impact this year that we had last year from some significant inventory adjustments by our big box customers so that i think year over year will be a positive operator from jpmorgan we have jeff zekauskas jeffrey zekauskas at the beginning of the call frank you characterized a lot of the operating profit progress is coming from the map to growth program but i was a little bit puzzled by the results because if your prices were up i don t know 1 7 that would be about 24 million and if your raw materials were down 1 that would be another 8 million or 9 million and so the combination of raw materials and price increases would account for all of the operating profit growth so what s wrong with that analysis in other words how is the map to growth program really influencing things given those two considerations frank sullivan yes a couple of things jeff number one i would look at our margin expansion versus our peers and for the last couple of quarters we have had some meaningful margin points of expansion better than a number of our peers so that should be 1 touch point because we re all benefiting from cost price mix secondly across rpm your assumption on raw material savings is mixed so that s been true in our construction products group and in our performance coatings group the old industrial segment it has not been true yet in our consumer segment because of some of the categories that i talked about principally packaging and the fact that we re on fifo accounting so some of the benefits that you see finally some breaks some final breaks in packaging that hit this fall will show up in our results in the coming quarters and we are like everybody suffering some meaningful increases in labor costs and other items and so i think that the simplest way to compare our results and whether map to growth is working is to continue to look at our gross margin and our ebit margin expansion versus our peers and if it s equal to or less than than i would suggest that your comments are correct but if we continue to put up some pretty good numbers you re seeing the benefits here the last thing i can tell you is we re closing plants our headcount is down by 600 or 700 people and we are instituting successfully lean manufacturing disciplines in plants where it didn t exist before and it s hitting our bottom line jeffrey zekauskas okay maybe a final quick question for rusty what s the adjusted cost of goods sold in the quarter russell gordon yes we don t disclose that if you go to our website you ll see that we do have some reconciliation slides that give you jeffrey zekauskas right but that doesn t reconcile to the cost of goods sold number because you don t break out the individual items and how frank sullivan correct and i don t think for any number of competitive reasons that we or any of our competitors break out specifics of their cost of goods sold operator from wells fargo we have michael sison unidentified analyst this is richard on for mike just a quick question on m a how much are you assuming for your 2 5 to 4 revenue growth range and have you seen any change to the environment right now how does the pipeline look and which segments do you think you ll have opportunities frank sullivan so i don t think you ll see much in the way of impact in q3 from m a and we did announce profile foods which is part of our specialty products group a relatively small business i think there s some good manufacturing synergies there but the m a pipeline has been a little skinny for us and i do think as i commented earlier i think we re really pleased with the focus of our businesses on their customers and on the marketplace and you can see that in our results if there s one area through map to growth that s been a little bit disappointing it s the revenue from acquisitions and it s a combination i think of 2 things number one price expectations on sizable deals are such that we can put that capital to better use with better returns on share repurchases and other investments and i do think that separately the organization has been focused on executing map to growth to a certain extent in a way that has negatively impacted our focus on acquisition activity and we re working to change that unidentified analyst great and just on capex i know last quarter you d guided 180 million of the year looks a little light so far in the first half do you expect that to step up in the second half or frank sullivan yes i think that s our current target we could fall short of that just because of the ability to execute on the things that we have planned but that s still the target for the year operator and from bloomberg we have christopher perrella christopher perrella a question i guess on the pull forward from the first quarter into the second quarter and touching on the backlog do you expect any of that backlog or the backlogs discussed earlier to continue into the third quarter or you re caught up at this point with your customers frank sullivan i think that we re at kind of normal rates we did see a bump let s say between our first quarter and the beginning of our second quarter in consumer and construction products but the backlog as i mentioned earlier in our roofing and waterproofing businesses is very solid and the revenue growth we re experiencing in corrosion control coatings and industrial flooring seem to be pretty good and as long as we don t get whipsawed by weather from one quarter or another i think we ve got some pretty solid expectations for growth for the second half of the year in our consumer segment christopher perrella all right and a follow up so you should see a larger working capital release with the seasonally strong fourth quarter compared to last year frank sullivan no in fact you ll see a little bit of the opposite i think the biggest working capital improvement you ll start to see in fiscal 21 of the 150 million of improvement year over year in cash flow and the impact of working capital on that i think about 70 million to 80 million of that is a timing difference year over year as we have negotiated new payment terms with major suppliers and quite candidly focused businesses on cash flow every day as opposed to cash flow at quarter end and so we did have some timing differences particularly in consumer and so about 150 million of year over year cash flow improvement from our operations really solid number 70 million to 80 million of that was timing the balance of it was higher earnings and better working capital performance that s more permanent so the fourth quarter back to your question i think the fourth quarter cash flow will not show much improvement if any because of that timing difference triggered last year but then as we get into fiscal 21 you ll see continued strength in our cash flow generation operator we ll now turn it back to frank sullivan for closing comments frank sullivan i d like to commend our associates worldwide for their continued hard work and dedication as they simultaneously focus on growing their business and execute on our 2020 map to growth operating improvement plan by combining our entrepreneurial growth oriented culture with the continuous improvement in operational excellence that is resulting from our operating improvement programs we are positioning rpm for sustained growth that will provide tremendous

president trump may shrug off iran s missile attack providing tentative calm in some assets a vow to retaliate may trigger a full risk off reaction an offer to talk may trigger a market rally it took iran five days to the minute to retaliate to the us killing of qassem suleimani a top iranian general official tehran fired missiles on two us bases in iraq claiming that 80 people were killed however the pentagon did not report any casualties and president donald trump tweeted all is well markets have bounced back from the initial fall but tension remains elevated as the president is set to address the nation on recent mid east developments here are three scenarios for trump s statement and how it may impact currencies and gold 1 shrugging off iran s response the president may follow through on his tweet announcing that the damage was minimal and mocking iran s capabilities that would imply that the us has no plans to hit back and allow for some calm in markets trump previously vowed to finish the endless wars in the middle east and faces a tough reelection battle he also measures his success via stock markets the safe haven dollar and yen would retreat in this scenario while stocks and commodity currencies would have room to rise however uncertainty about the next developments in the region may allow gold bulls to keep the precious metal bid it is essential to note that xau usd has been enjoying a steady uptrend well before the iran inspired rally the probability is high according to the current knowledge of minimal damage 2 vowing to hit iran hard trump also promised to inflict damage on iran including on cultural sites in case it responds to suleimani s killing and may feel obliged to follow through if us servicemen were killed a pledge of fire and fury may lead to speculation of a troop surge and rising chances of outright war in this scenario the safe haven dollar yen and perhaps also the swiss franc may find demand gold would have room to rally well beyond the 1 600 mark and oil prices could enter a more consistent uptrend than the recent back and worth moves the losers would be stock markets and also the australian and new zealand dollars the c may gain with petrol prices the probability is medium and it depends on the damage 3 time to talk iran said it does not seek war nor escalation and trump also fears the middle eastern quagmire both sides may claim to their domestic audiences that they won this round and ready to talk the president already tore down the north american free trade agreement nafta only to reconstruct a similar accord but with a new name the us mexico canada agreement after ripping up the iran nuclear deal the jcpoa he may take ownership of a new process with tehran beginning a new round of negotiations iran may even achieve its goal of kicking the us out of the region while trump declares victory and an end to needless wars if the message is somewhat conciliatory stock markets may rally and safe haven assets will be sold off that includes the dollar yen and also gold oil prices could also settle at lower ground the probability is low as trump may find it hard to offer an olive branch conclusion the most likely scenario is for trump to dismiss iran s attack allowing for a relief rally but no sell off in gold another option is a pledge to fight back triggering an all out risk off rally the president may also call it even and suggest new talks and trigger a massive rally but chances are slim
dalton the stock market kicked off the new year in record high territory looking as if it shook off the summer s recession scares embracing some newfound economic momentum i m even shaking off some of my own 2020 recession concerns and thinking that we might have another year or so of breathing room before any stock market crash not that we re expecting anything gangbusters for the economy but 2 gdp growth which has been the norm for this expansion may very well continue for a bit longer that level of growth should create enough jobs so that the unemployment rate will stay about where it is and inflation should stay close to the fed s top line target of 2 while that is not extraordinary it s enough of a green light for me to stay invested however valuations are overstretched and the stock market is looking for a reason to pull back queue the iran story if you take the value of all publicly traded stocks as measured by the wilshire 5000 index compared to all corporate earnings you get a price to earnings ratio of 15 the average of the last 40 years the period for which we have data is only nine the all time high was at the height of the tech bubble 20 years ago at 17 5 valuations are high right now we re going to need more than not extraordinary out of the economy to propel stock prices substantially higher the economy is ok but if corporations struggle with profit margins you re going to see an ok economy and a not so ok stock market the consensus year over year earnings growth rate is about 9 for 2020 the stock market will be vulnerable to punk earnings growth and those reasons abound for example interest rates next move is likely higher not lower so there is some room for profit margin compression if corporations don t clear their variable debt burden also corporations could pull back on spending due to uncertainty over the presidential elections and the outcome of any potential new legislation especially if democrats are voted in and there could be anywhere from a 90 to 180 degree turn on economic policy the election will cause a slowdown in decision making and if that shows up in declining activity and weak productivity growth the stock market will want to adjust to that new reality that s not to say that it s clear sailing if the trump administration retakes the white house because trump will go right back to his playbook and while that s good news for the economy and the stock market in some ways lower taxes deregulated industries the resumption of the u s china trade war is going to ramp up again as will stock market volatility political prognostications aside the economy must struggle with the here and now on friday the media focus was on the u s drone strike in iraq that killed iranian gen qassem soleimani as wwiii trended on twitter the december 2019 institute of supply management survey drew little attention but it should have the ism is an indicator of recent u s economic activity based on a survey of purchasing managers it monitors changes in corporate production levels from month to month it was expected to increase from 48 1 to 49 0 anything below 50 is contraction instead it declined to 47 2 its fifth straight monthly decrease and the lowest level since june 2009 when the u s was exiting recession commentary from the managers from almost every subsector was negative manufacturing is only 11 65 of u s gross domestic product however i ve previously seen weakness in manufacturing be enough to cause an earnings recession where the aggregate earnings of corporations stagnate for a couple quarters or more this happened when oil prices collapsed from 2014 to 2016 and the decrease in capital spending in the oil sector was greater than the boost consumers received from cheaper gasoline and heating oil the stock market can hold a high multiple like it is now if there is growth to support it but multiples contract if investors can t look forward to ever higher earnings i may be less confident today in predicting a 2020 recession than say prior to aug 1 just before the fed cut interest rates three times but that doesn t make me confident that the economy is strong enough to support current stock market valuations the u s vs iran if you re like me you don t know much about gen qassem soleimani now and you never even heard of him before midnight on thursday to help clarify the magnitude of the u s drone strike killing the general i ll cite a quotation from roman schweizer the aerospace and defense director of cowen washington research group this is the equivalent of iran killing the u s chairman of the joint chiefs of staff or the director of the central intelligence agency and then taking credit for it in other words it s kind of a big deal i am going to be talking a lot about politics in this column but only so far as it connects your money it won t do us much good to talk about how bad this dude may have been his operations within iraq have been responsible for the deaths of 600 americans or if some other tactic should have been employed the fact is it s done and now we need to think about your money well i guess it ain t done we also must consider the potential fallout former cia acting director john mclaughlin doesn t believe there will be a rapid de escalation between the u s and iran as he says it will require sophisticated diplomacy and a fine touch strategy that neither side has shown to keep this from escalating into broad violence in the middle east so we may not be out of the woods just yet but since we can t figure out what s going to happen in the future let s look at what s happened in the past thanks to cnbc for doing the heavy lifting by way of kensho see graph above aside from a temporary knee jerk spike in oil crisis events in the middle east don t seem to have much impact on trades including the stock market as measured by the s p 500 over the following month and three months even the spike in oil prices is likely to be less subdued in this and future events as the u s becomes less reliant on foreign oil inventory the u s produces about 13 million barrels per day and consumes 21 million so higher oil prices could depress economic growth but i m not worried about that yet not only would there need to be a sustained and significant jump in oil prices to become troublesome something closer to 75 per barrel of west intermediate or wti crude oil or a 20 rise which is greater than the 9 1 average three month gain that is possible especially if iran were to fire missiles at oil fields in the arabian peninsula which it reminded us is an option as well as other options such as using economic tools and cyber attacks however we ve seen recently that consumers can handle higher oil prices earlier i referenced the 2014 16 earnings recession caused by low oil prices reducing capital expenditures wti went from 30 in 2016 to 50 in four months and then to 75 a bit more than two years after that after a jump in prices on friday and monday after news of the assassination in the middle east wti was trading at about 64 its highest price since april consumers and their spending comprise 68 of the u s gdp higher oil prices won t necessarily be enough to derail the u s consumer don t get me wrong if oil prices are high enough long enough it could be enough but historically regional geopolitical events are not what ends either business or market cycles to clarify the economy is not immune to higher oil prices spikes in oil prices have been precursors to recessions for the last three recessions 1990 2000 and 2008 oil increase in prices nearly doubled 135 100 and 96 respectively oil crated in price in december 2018 to 45 33 per barrel of wti a doubling of that number still has some cushion so that s comforting but as i said earlier if wti sticks around 75 per barrel that could be troublesome this market melt up is nearly done we could get a few more percentage points of gains into january some mild pullback to the market s 50 day moving average so about a 5 drop but wouldn t rule out 7 or 8 and then a rebound investors have been conditioned to buy the dip with the u s china trade war they ve also been conditioned not to extrapolate geopolitical shocks as that strategy has made them a lot of money recently i d expect some buying if stocks fell if that happens that rebound will be telling we ll dissect the internals and the fundamentals when and if that happens to assess if it s just going to be the typical wavering of stock prices as investors determine who may be the next leader of the free world or if it s going to be something more substantial the stock market is overbought and overloved and vulnerable to a pullback at any time and while the targeted killing of gen soleimani may not fit the textbook reason of why the stock market should sell off according to the average returns following middle east crises i wouldn t be surprised if a correction started right about now and that the media narrative would be that it s occurring because of growing fears about unrest in the middle east as if that s news i mean the week prior u s airstrikes killed 25 members of an iranian backed iraqi shiite paramilitary group responsible for rocket attacks that killed a u s contractor and 26 u s allies in late december the week before that members of that same group kataeb hezbollah attacked the u s embassy in baghdad as they chanted quassem soleimani is our leader the region had been unsettled prior to this assassination and while it s likely to get worse any significant pullback in stocks right now would more likely be correlated to the assassination but not necessarily caused by it i am betting that it s ok to stay in stocks a bit longer contrary to twitter trends the stock market won t expect a full scale war and if there is then the fed will intervene i take that back the fed has already intervened in the last four months the federal reserve has expanded its balance sheet by 600 billion by making large scale asset purchases that s a lot the fed isn t calling it quantitative easing but its impact on asset prices like stocks is similar to qe i can t call it quits on the market just yet but i m keeping my finger on the trigger because a lot can go wrong in the next few months allen harris the author of build it sell it profit taking

published wednesday 8 january 2020 print disqus craig hemke tf metals the year 2019 unfolded just about as we predicted in our annual look ahead post entitled 2010 9 and that s nice but it s all for naught if we fail to correctly forecast where we go from here with that in mind here s a first look at what to expect in 2020 these annual forecasts are risky business get it wrong and you create a paper trail for trolls to poach for years to come get it right and you get a few backslaps while being told that anyone could have foreseen the predicted events so get over yourself which leads me to wonder why i started making these forecasts in the first place but here we go again first a recap as 2017 began we were told that the election of trump would crash gold prices due to a soaring dollar a surging u s economy and a bursting of the bond bubble this narrative seemed ridiculous at the time and we were right it was and we wrote about it on january 17 2017 the following year even more supposed experts were calling for triple digit gold prices and a resumption of the bear market they were proven wrong at tfmr we expected prices to be steady and rising instead as three themes would support prices this was posted on january 4 2018 and last year at this time all of the eight figure wall street economists were insisting that gold would crash as the fed hiked rates as many as four times in 2019 these same clowns expected the yield on the u s 10 year note to rise to 5 this was utterly ridiculous for reasons we ve discussed here for the past decade so instead we figured that 2019 would play out a lot like 2010 and forecasted the best annual gains since 2010 in this post dated january 14 2019 ok so what are all of the mainstream experts forecasting for 2020 it s as if they never learn the consensus is again for stable to higher interest rates a rising dollar a growing u s economy and flat to falling precious metal prices as you might expect i disagree let s start with that interest rate forecast back in december chief goon powell attempted to convince everyone that the fed s preemptive easing cycle had run its course and that interest rates would remain unchanged for the balance of 2020 he also claimed that the repo crisis was under control and that his current debt monetization scheme of 60b month in t bill purchases was definitely not qe all of this is simple garbage and spin instead the year 2020 will see a continued slowing of the u s and global economies and the new geo political worries will only worsen the decline the fed will be forced to resume their fed funds rate cut policy and as the u s must fund a minimum budget deficit of 1 2t they will also begin monetizing longer term treasury notes in case you missed it the fomc openly admitted this in the minutes of their december meeting see below it s not just the repo liquidity crisis that will cause the rate cuts and expansion of qe it s the faltering u s economy too led by the manufacturing sector the u s economy is stumbling into contraction and recession just as it did in 2010 2011 see this reuters link from that summary check this excerpt so will these pmis drop to near 40 in the months ahead check this deutsche bank chart from last october given how accurate this has been in the ninety days since i d say the chances are pretty high so the global economy is faltering and the central banks will soon be forced into more rate cuts and debt monetization the only other piece of the puzzle is the forex market specifically the u s dollar while not a direct correlation to dollar gold prices a rising or falling dollar can provide either a headwind or a tailwind check the chart below with the dollar index breaking down along with a bearish death cross of its key moving averages does it appear that those dollar winds will be in our face or at our back in 2020 so there s your macro forecast for 2020 a slowing economy and surging fiscal deficit leads to more qe lower interest rates negative real inflation adjusted rates and a falling dollar but let s get to the heart of the matter the prospects in 2020 for gold silver and the mining shares at this critical time no forecast of pm prices should begin without first noting the extreme all time high levels of contract open interest on the comex in desperate protection of their established and now deeply underwater short positions the banks in 2019 increased the total supply of comex gold contracts by 329 806 contracts or about 73 as an example of the criminally fraudulent nature of this exchange be sure to note that 329 806 contracts is the equivalent of 32 980 600 pretend gold ounces and that year end total open interest was 786 166 contracts for 78 616 600 pretend ounces for reference total global mine supply for 2019 will likely be around 90 000 000 actual physical ounces prices rallied regardless but the change in bank commercial positioning is significant on the cftc issued commitment of traders report the commercials began 2019 with a net short position of 92 700 gold contracts as of the most recent report these same commercials now hold a new all time high net short position of 366 500 contracts specific to the banks the cftc also issues a monthly bank participation report as 2019 began the banks reported a net short position of 88 265 contracts by early december it was 205 224 contracts so again any guesses as to the prospects for additional gains in comex gold prices must be tempered due to the extreme positioning of these market dominating banks however this does not mean that prices can t go higher in 2020 given the macroeconomic forces discussed earlier in this post they almost certainly will however it s not going to be easy and the banks will fight against every uptick the old all time high for comex gold open interest was seen in 2016 near 660 000 contracts we re now near 800 000 and the banks will not hesitate to take it to 900 000 or even 1 000 000 in 2020 this continued dilution will impact price you can be certain of that regardless i expect higher gold prices in 2020 how high the first key level to watch will be a weekly close above 1550 last friday january 3 saw our first close above that level but that was primarily due to the current geopolitical concerns what will be needed is a sustained move above this key level and why is 1550 so important for nearly nineteen months following the price peak in september of 2011 the area around 1550 held as important support now on the way back up this area acts as significant resistance i think the breakout above 1550 comes in q1 of this year and once that s accomplished the next target is near 1650 if we finished the year there comex gold would register an annual gain of about 8 5 while nothing to sneeze at that seems a little light given all that we ve laid out above so an aggressive target for 2020 is actually 1800 or so that would be a 25 gain on the year can we get there again given the already bloated oi and cot positioning it s not going to be easy but it s certainly possible turning to comex silver it too has seen its open interest and bank positioning increase greatly in 2019 but not nearly to the extreme as comex gold therefore the fight for gains will be challenging but not insurmountable in our 2010 9 forecast last year i thought comex silver could reach all the way to 20 and maybe even 22 as you know it reached 19 75 in early september before sliding backward to finish the year at 17 90 for 2020 eclipsing 18 50 on a weekly closing basis will be the first step followed by a trip to 20 once above there the clear and obvious target is 22 just getting to 22 would signify a 23 gain and that would seem to be an appropriate expectation however if things can really get rolling then the all important and critical resistance of 26 will come into view can we get there in 2020 we ll just have to see how bad the macro picture gets in the meantime even a move to 22 will be sufficient to spark the mining shares even higher and let s conclude with the mining shares because if you want to make some old fashioned fiat currency trading profits in 2020 this will be where the action is why as grant williams and rick rule have noted total global asset allocation to the entire precious metal sector remains below 1 the highest it has ever been was in 1980 when it reached 8 while the long term median is closer to 2 5 so let s just say that all of the macro factors listed above come to pass let s also assume that precious metals prices continue with just a gradual incline this year taken together these two factors will have a significant impact on the viability and profitability of the mining companies and large institutions think hedge mutual and pension funds will take notice with gold prices remaining above 1500 the q4 2019 earnings reports for the major producers due in late january and early february will again show 3 5x growth over q4 of 2018 as metal prices continue higher the reports for q1 2020 will be even better this will get the attention of global money managers seeking alpha and precious metal exposure so what happens if that global asset allocation percentage moves back to the long term median of 2 5 where will that cash go sector exposure will be sought and demand for precious metal in all its forms will grow this means that a huge flow of funds will be looking for a home but there are very limited opportunities thus a crowding in of investment dollars will very likely spark outsized gains for the mining shares in 2020 just how outsized at present the gdx is moving up toward significant resistance at 31 32 once above there and this flow of funds will make it happen the target becomes 40 and then 50 a move from the current 29 to the expected 50 would be a gain of 72 that certainly qualifies as outsized however if comex gold can stretch toward 1800 and or if comex silver can stretch above 22 then the gains in the juniors and explorers will be even better at present the gdxj etf is trading near 42 once above 55 first 70 and then even 100 share come into view in summary you should expect a continuation of this renewed bull market in 2020 as the macroeconomic forces that drove demand for precious metal in 2019 extend and worsen however and as always these gains will not come easy as the banks will fight us every step of the way in dollar terms precious metal prices will see another year of strong gains so prepare and stack accordingly however if you can withstand the volatility and you want to have some fun there will be sizable fiat profits to be booked from the mining shares and this sector will likely receive some additional focus here at tfmr in 2020 thus now is the time to join us at tfmr not only

operations tamara lundgren president and chief executive officer thank you michael good morning everyone and happy new year thank you all for joining us on our first quarter fiscal 2020 conference call we appreciate your interest in our company and we look forward to sharing our results with you this morning on our call today i ll review our quarterly financial results and the market and macroeconomic trends affecting our businesses i ll also provide an update on the strategic initiatives and capital projects we have under way richard will then provide more detail on our segment performance our capex investments and our capital structure i ll wrap up and then we ll take your questions but before we get started on this review i d like to make two comments first as many of you know there were several significant earthquakes in puerto rico over the last 48 hours while parts of the island have been seriously impacted we are very grateful that all our employees are safe our yards and equipment have not had any damage and the shredder and power plant are functioning our thoughts are with the people of puerto rico second i d like to highlight the safety performance of our team due to the concerted efforts of our employees across the company fiscal 2019 was the safest year recorded in our company s history i m pleased to report that this trend has continued our total recordable injury rate in q1 was over 30 better than last year s first quarter much of this success can be attributed to our significant progress in better anticipating and preventing potential hazards i m very proud of our teammates throughout the company you are delivering on our commitment to create a safe work environment and a sustainable safety culture let s turn now to slide 4 to discuss a related report that we released just a few weeks ago in mid december we issued our sixth sustainability report entitled recycling today for a sustainable tomorrow sustainability has been at the core of what we do and how we operate since our founding in 1906 and our sustainable business model has never been more important and more relevant than it is today our fiscal 2019 sustainability report contains our first set of multi year sustainability goals and it highlights how we help conserve resources how we innovate to use less water and energy and to generate less waste how we create a safe ethical engaging and inclusive workplace and how we give back to the communities where we operate we believe that our goals will continue to place us at the forefront of positive change in our industry and i encourage you to visit our website to view our latest sustainability report now let s turn to slide 5 earlier this morning we announced our fiscal 20 first quarter financial results we reported an adjusted loss per share of 0 17 which included an adverse impact from average inventory accounting of approximately 0 11 and a charge of 0 05 related to resolution of an environmental matter our q1 results were impacted by a very challenging market environment for both amr and css that was partially offset by benefits from our productivity improvement initiatives which we implemented last year in amr volumes and margins were impacted by the sharp decline in selling prices during most of the quarter both ferrous and certain non ferrous prices dropped to multi year lows not surprisingly supply flows tightened as a result leading to reduced volumes for both ferrous and non ferrous sales the rise in ferrous prices in november led to an easing in supply flows but contributed to margin compression for sales contracted earlier in the quarter css first quarter results were also impacted by declining prices for finished steel products driven by lower sales volumes due to customer destocking and a reduced contribution from recycling operations and from a consolidated perspective we delivered 11 million of positive operating cash flow this quarter compared to negative operating cash flow of 12 million in q1 of last year we also returned capital to our shareholders through our 103rd consecutive quarterly dividend for most of calendar year 2019 the weakness in global manufacturing was exacerbated by the inevitable inventory destocking that companies undertook in response to the weak demand conditions this lower demand and slower growth were reflected in the scrap and steel manufacturing sectors as we enter 2020 however we are seeing signs of an improvement so now let s turn to slide 6 for a more detailed review of these market trends as you can see in the upper left hand chart ferrous scrap prices declined sharply during the first two months of the quarter and began to recover in november and december current reports regarding january domestic pricing reflect further strengthening placing domestic and export markets basically at parity but still at pricing levels approximately 10 below their 10 year historical average looking at the export market scrap import prices into turkey have risen considerably since reaching a low point in october during the first 10 months of 2019 steel consumption in turkey slumped by over 20 year over year largely driven by weak demand from the domestic construction industry and a slowdown in infrastructure projects since then prices have rebounded driven primarily by low scrap inventories at turkish mills and higher turkish domestic steel demand export prices to asia off the west coast also strengthened toward the latter part of the first quarter and into december and january driven by constrained supply flows and improved demand conditions now turning to non ferrous prices as you can see in the lower left hand chart zorba prices fell sharply during q1 reaching levels last seen during 2009 prices have been impacted by trade and regulatory actions in china including tariffs import quotas and higher metal content requirements as well as by declining global auto sales in key markets however similar to the ferrous market the extended period of historically low prices led to a significant reduction in scrap flows we are now seeing some positive momentum as zorba and non ferrous pricing has begun to strengthen before we move on to the next slide let s look at the upper right hand chart as you can see rebar and wire rod prices both trended down during the first quarter although west coast market demand continues to show resiliency in construction spending and has the potential to benefit longer term from increased state level support for infrastructure projects the lower rebar and wire rod prices during q1 reflected the decline in the cost of steel making raw materials including scrap and other consumables and the impact on demand of extended customer destocking let s turn now to slide 7 to discuss some of the longer term trends underlying demand for scrap the structural tailwinds for recycled metals are positive as global trends continue to support the growth of lower carbon based industries and activities a low carbon economy is widely acknowledged as more metal intensive with the rising use of wind solar and batteries for power generation demand for dozens of metals is expected to increase across a wide spectrum of industries in addition to steel aluminum copper and nickel are among the metals expected to be in highest demand looking at steel manufacturing we can see how the use of recycled scrap metal is continuing to increase as the chart in the upper left hand corner of this slide shows by 2022 eaf steel production is estimated to increase to 75 of all us steel production using recycled materials in metal production can dramatically reduce carbon intensity a trend recognized by steelmakers in the us and increasingly around the globe for example the chart on the bottom of this slide shows that both the use of scrap in china s steelmaking and the share of china s steel production from electric arc furnaces also continue to grow in the first nine months of 2019 china s ferrous scrap usage was up by almost 10 reaching 240 million tons along with more scrap consumption china s eaf capacity has also risen and now accounts for 12 of china s total crude steel capacity in 2020 china is projected to commission an additional 19 million tons of new eaf capacity all of these indicators point to a long term and high demand environment for recycled metals underpinning the importance of the strategic actions we have under way to enhance and to expand our platform so now let s turn to slide 8 to review these actions productivity improvements investments in advanced metal recovery technologies and volume growth these actions underpin the strategic initiatives that we have under way to leverage our industry s positive long term trends and to offset the cyclical and structural changes affecting our business let s focus first on what we are doing to offset the cyclical headwinds our productivity improvement program is centered on delivering benefits from production and functional cost efficiencies improved asset management and logistics in october we announced an additional 15 million of productivity initiatives to be realized in fiscal 20 on top of the initiatives that we implemented in fiscal 19 second as we have highlighted previously and that richard will discuss in more detail we are investing in advanced metal recovery technologies that will enable us to produce a wider range of furnace ready products we believe that the benefits from these investments will deliver at least 8 per ton once fully operational offsetting in part the margin compression caused by the structural decline in zorba prices the benefits come from three sources first increasing our throughput and extracting more materials from our shredding process second improving the efficiency of our processes to enable us to meet global metal content and quality requirements on a cost effective basis and third creating product optionality and additional furnace ready materials that can be marketed globally importantly these investments will also support our sustainability objectives of increasing recycling and reducing waste and the third leg of our strategic growth initiatives is focused on increasing our ferrous volumes and broadening our customer base profitable growth in our ferrous sales volumes has been a successful multi year strategic focus for our company our volume initiative targets additional growth of 700 000 tons to reach 5 million tons annually based on our retained capacity and assuming supportive market conditions we expect this growth to create operating leverage equal to approximately 7 per ton on overall margins the timing and trajectory of this goal could of course be impacted by political economic and regulatory uncertainties together our productivity technology investment and volume growth initiatives should enable us to significantly improve our margins and to continue generating strong operating cash flow through the cycle once complete and assuming a stable to positively trending market environment we expect these initiatives to benefit our margins in the range of 15 to 20 per ton now let me turn it over to richard for a more detailed review of our segment performance and our strategic capex investments richard peach senior vice president chief financial officer and chief of corporate operations thank you tamara and good morning i ll begin with a review of our ferrous volumes in the first quarter the lower price environment led to a tightening of supply flows and as a result our total ferrous volumes were 10 lower year over year in these challenging markets we continue to put strong focus on optimizing our global sales reach and delivering our products to customers using a variety of conveyances including ship barge truck and rail we also use our flexible platform to diversify sales between economically advantageous markets in the first quarter we made sales to customers in turkey across asia south america and in the domestic market now let s turn to slide 10 for an update on non ferrous over the past year we have seen changing demand patterns and flows for our non ferrous products in addition to the retaliatory tariffs on recycled scrap the chinese government has also put in place increasingly restrictive quotas for chinese scrap importers we ve adapted to these changing patterns in the following ways first we have significantly diversified our sales and reduced our exposure to the chinese market and in the first quarter we shipped 88 of our non ferrous products to countries other than china second we ve expanded our customer base and in the first quarter we sold our non ferrous products to 15 countries including india japan south korea malaysia taiwan and thailand third we continue to sell a balanced mix of non ferrous products of our total non ferrous volumes zorba represents around one third with the remainder consisting of purer higher value products including copper aluminum and other furnace ready metals china has been developing new quality standards for imported scrap which we understand will include new product definitions and create a distinction between non ferrous classified as raw material or as solid waste the new regulations are still in draft but our understanding is they could be implemented during this calendar year thereafter our understanding is non ferrous products that meet the new definition of raw material and comply with the new quality standards may be eligible for imports into china without quota limits in contrast we expect that metal products which do not meet these quality standards will be classified as solid waste under the new regulations could continue to be restricted and may eventually be subject to a complete chinese ban on import these structural changes reinforce the importance of our sales diversification and our major investments in advanced metal recovery technology which i ll discuss in more detail later in this presentation now let s turn to slide 11 to discuss the operating trends at amr in the first quarter amr s adjusted operating loss of 1 per ton included an adverse impact of 5 per ton from average inventory accounting and 2 per ton related to resolution of an environmental matter the average inventory effect was slightly better than our outlook expectation due to the impact on scrap purchase prices from the market improvement in november the sequential decrease in operating income per ton compared to the 22 reached in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 was primarily due to the following three factors first the sharp price decline was responsible for around half of the drop in amr s performance net selling prices for our ferrous shipments decreased sequentially by 18 and our realized zorba prices also fell to a multi year low second lower volumes contributed approximately a quarter of the sequential decrease in amr s operating income driven by tighter scrap flows amr s ferrous and non ferrous sales volumes decreased by 10 and 14 respectively year over year and third the remaining portion of amr s sequential profit decline came primarily from the adverse impact from average inventory accounting of 5 per ton however the market trend changed positively in the last month of the quarter and has continued through january prices have rebounded back to pre august levels and looking ahead to amr s second quarter we anticipate the improved market conditions will benefit supply flows and lead to ferrous sales volumes to increase sequentially and to be in line year over year non ferrous sales volumes are expected to be in line sequentially the improvement in ferrous prices is expected to lead to an expansion in metal spreads which together with the reversal of the q1 average inventory accounting impact and new productivity improvements is expected to lead to a significant sequential improvement in performance our second quarter operating income per ton is expected to be in the range of 20 per ton now let s move to slide 12 and discuss the operating trends in css css first quarter operating income was 4 million in a lower price environment for finished steel and recycled metal products sequential performance was adversely impacted by margin compression due to the decrease in average net selling prices which outpaced the decrease in the purchase cost of raw materials lower finished steel sales volumes and a reduced contribution from recycling operations also contributed to the lower sequential results even though these were partially offset by productivity initiatives average net selling prices for finished steel were down sequentially by 5 and lower by 14 year over year primarily reflecting lower input costs including for scrap and other consumables finished steel sales volumes were 5 lower year over year and rolling mill utilization was 85 in the first quarter looking ahead to the second quarter of fiscal 20 we expect steel demand in our west coast markets to remain steady and for css finished steel sales volumes to approximate the first quarter of fiscal 20 we expect css operating income for the second quarter to be lower by 1 million sequentially due to planned downtime including maintenance costs now let s turn to slide 13 to review our capital structure and corporate items operating cash flow in the first quarter was 11 million which compared favorably with last year s first quarter outflow our net debt at the end of the first quarter was 119 million our balance sheet remains strong with net leverage of only 15 and our ratio of net debt to adjusted ebitda of 1x we have an existing credit facility of 700 million with a 2023 maturity which provides us with financial flexibility as we pursue our strategies for growth capital expenditures in the first quarter totaled 24 million of which 9 million was for capital investments in growth and the remainder spend on maintaining the business in fiscal 20 we expect to spend a total of up to 125 million including 60 million on growth projects and the balance of 65 million on maintaining the business including 15 million on environmental improvement projects corporate costs in the first quarter were 8 million on an adjusted basis down by 2 million sequentially and 4 million less than the same quarter of the prior year looking ahead to the second quarter of fiscal 20 we expect corporate costs to be slightly higher compared to the first quarter our effective tax rate in the first quarter was a benefit of 28 we expect our tax rate on adjusted results for the second quarter to be an expense of 25 which is also more in line with our expectation for the remainder of the fiscal year note that our actual tax rate will be subject to our level of financial performance and other relevant factors in connection with our new round of productivity initiatives we expect to incur restructuring charges and other exit related costs of 4 million we expect to record the majority of this amount in our fiscal second quarter within our gaap results consistent with previous practice these restructuring charges and exit related costs will be excluded from our adjusted eps now turning to the next slide i d like to talk in more detail about our advanced metal recovery and product enhancement technology strategy as i mentioned earlier we are currently undertaking a major capital investment program to replace upgrade and add to our non ferrous metal recovery technologies our plan is comprehensive and includes new wet and dry processing technologies enhanced zorba separation capabilities more advanced sorting equipment and a further rollout of our clean copper recovery program the new equipment will be installed in our major facilities on both the east and west coast of the united states once implemented these new technologies are expected to enable us to produce more furnace ready products and to allow us to convert zorba to twitch copper brass zinc stainless steel and other saleable metals subject to receiving applicable permits our installations will take place over the second half of fiscal 20 and first half of fiscal 21 there will be three phases as follows first clean copper recovery installations on both the east and west coasts second a rollout of advanced metal recovery equipment in four of our major export facilities and third new heavy media zorba separation plants in both the east and west of the us we expect our aggregate capital investment to be in the range of 75 million to 85 million with 10 million already spent in fiscal 19 approximately 50 million to be spent in fiscal 20 and the balance of the total in the first half of fiscal 21 once the new non ferrous technology is fully implemented we expect the benefit to operating income to be at least 8 per ferrous ton in fiscal 20 we expect to achieve a run rate of around half that amount by the end of the fourth quarter and the full run rate by the end of the first half of fiscal 21 in terms of contributions to operating income once the new equipment is fully installed we expect an annual benefit of approximately 40 million assuming we achieve our target ferrous volumes of 5 million tons by fiscal 21 the return on investment is expected to be significantly in excess of our cost of capital with an average payback of less than three years once we commence full operations with the new equipment installed and in service i ll now turn the presentation back over to tamara tamara lundgren president and chief executive officer thank you richard the demand for recycled metals is underpinned by multiple positive trends and the outlook for our business is strong while near term market conditions have been challenging we have in place strategic initiatives to deliver growth we expect our expanded productivity improvement program to deliver savings beginning in the second quarter and our advanced metal recovery investments to deliver benefits beginning in the second half of fiscal 2020 these initiatives should advance our competitiveness by improving our through the cycle margins and cash flow providing us with additional opportunities to grow return capital to our shareholders and create sustainable value for our employees customers suppliers and the communities in which we operate in closing i d like to thank our employees many of whom i know are listening to our call this morning each of you continues to meet our opportunities and challenges with dedication and commitment while remaining steadfast in your focus on safety sustainability and integrity my thanks go to each of you as you ve truly demonstrated why we continue to be a leader in our communities and the recycling industry now operator let s open up the call for questions questions and answers operator thank you and our first question comes from matthew korn from goldman sachs your line is open matthew korn goldman sachs analyst hi good morning tamara richard happy new year and thanks for taking my questions tamara lundgren president and chief executive officer good morning happy new year matthew korn goldman sachs analyst so on the scrap markets you pointed out in your charts and then in your guidance for the second quarter the tailwind that s emerging from the improvement in the pricing there effectively did the scrap markets reached a low enough price this past fall that we finally saw inelasticity of supply kick in and then how much in your view has improved export pricing been a factor in also pulling up the domestic ferrous prices in your view tamara lundgren president and chief executive officer well you re right prices did reach a level where we saw the supply flows materially dry up and the reversal that we ve seen has been driven by a couple of factors there s several factors there has been a reversal of destocking that we ve seen we re seeing the mill outages come to a close we re seeing stronger export demand easing of trade tensions and all of this is reducing the overhang of scrap that resulted from the significant decline in prices matthew korn goldman sachs analyst got it so it sounds like you feel fairly enthusiastic that this is something where we re returning to more of a normalized level in the scrap market as opposed to the depressed levels we ve been seeing tamara lundgren president and chief executive officer we are certainly trending that way and as i noted current prices are hovering about 10 below 10 year historical averages and that s a significant improvement from where we were when we last held our earnings call in october matthew korn goldman sachs analyst right okay the second one i have is this domestic steel markets here the main theme these last couple of years has been the buildout of new eaf capacity which you ve cited many times over the course of your in your presentations the projection that though this is going to be a stronger draw on scrap would be good for schnitzer it does seem though is that over these last couple of months you ve heard some these integrated steelmakers that kind of want to get on the action you got this new hbi plant coming others have raised the prospects of morphing pig iron into the supply chain how much of a challenge do you think this could be for your core scrap business if at all tamara lundgren president and chief executive officer well i think that scrap will always find a competitive level and i think that is the unique aspect of scrap versus other raw materials is that it is a product where we see value and obviously consumers see value but the intrinsic cost is about collection and processing but it s a cost that is much more variable than what you see for mined materials so i think if you look historically it s a product that will find a competitive level matthew korn goldman sachs analyst got it thank you very much tamara lundgren president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from phil gibbs from keybanc capital markets your line is open phil gibbs keybanc capital markets analyst hey good morning tamara lundgren president and chief executive officer good morning phil happy new year phil gibbs keybanc capital markets analyst happy new year i was going to say the same so on the side of just the first quarter results here can you describe what that environmental headwind was for amr and was that something just to be sure here was in the results because i think you pointed that out early in the presser richard peach senior vice president chief financial officer and chief of corporate operations hi phil it s richard yes that environmental headwind was in the adjusted results it was impacted us by 0 05 or 2 per ton in amr and it related to the resolution of an air emissions matter at one of our california facilities phil gibbs keybanc capital markets analyst okay so presumably that s not going to recur in the second quarter partly helping out the results are you going to have given the run in pricing here in the last 90 days are you going to have inventory accounting benefits is that at all thought about in the numbers in the guidance you ve provided richard peach senior vice president chief financial officer and chief of corporate operations yes we see the adverse effect that impacted the first quarter we see that reversing in the second quarter and that s built into our outlook guidance of 20 per ton expected operating income per ton for amr for the second quarter phil gibbs keybanc capital markets analyst reversing i mean you re not going to have it but i mean does it move to a positive i guess are you expecting a gain richard peach senior vice president chief financial officer and chief of corporate operations yes a small gain a small gain phil gibbs keybanc capital markets analyst okay okay and then you went in pretty exhaustive detail around the non ferrous investments which was great and i took away from it that you re putting this in very consciously in stages and then you re starting to reap some of the reward by the end of this fiscal year can you just give us a little bit more context because many of us don t know what these things actually are and what they do just to be a little bit more concrete in terms of where you re starting and how you re getting the benefit maybe this year and then what s really to come as you get to that full 8 a ton richard peach senior vice president chief financial officer and chief of corporate operations yes it s a comprehensive plan that has three different aspects the first phase is clean copper recovery and we will be putting in systems on the east and the west coast and that s really about taking a lower grade copper and aluminum products and converting it into a more furnace ready material where we can get a higher price for it and that s how we get the value the second phase is the advanced metal recovery systems now these are replacements and upgrades to our existing non ferrous recovery technology in our major export facilities and we get a benefit there in three different ways one is we will increase our processing capacity coming out the back of the shredding process for recovery of non ferrous metals then in addition we will increase the amount of separation of non ferrous metals so that we get more pure metals out of that separation process and then thirdly because there s more automation there is a productivity improvement associated with that so that s in our major export facilities in the east and the west coast and then the fourth phase which is really our it s a heavy media plant we are putting in the east and west of the us and that s all about conversion that s all about the ability to convert our zorba into purer into more furnace ready products such as twitch and copper and aluminum and other products so you ve got these that s why it s comprehensive you ve got these three aspects the conversion of a lower grade product meaning the clean copper the additional recovery of non ferrous from the shredding process and all the additional separation and then thirdly the ability to convert zorba into furnace ready materials and that is essential because it plays into these structural changes in the industry that we ve been talking about and we think we re very well placed from a competitive position here because of the comprehensive nature of our technology together with our volume improvement plan and our global reach of our sales network we ve calculated that we expect once the technology is fully installed a benefit of at least 8 per ton now we ve initially calculated that on our existing run rate of tons which as you know in fiscal 19 was 4 3 million tons but when we achieve our 5 million ton target in fiscal 21 where we expect to achieve it that would mean an incremental benefit to operating income of at least 40 million tons per year and i think as i said in my remarks that will provide an overall return significantly in excess of our cost of capital and we do expect a payback from these investments which are between 75 million and 85 million a payback of less than three years phil gibbs keybanc capital markets analyst got it got it and so the one that you re outlining this year in terms of the 4 a ton benefit that s predominantly the clean copper recovery and then mixing effectively mixing up that product to get a better price so that s really what you re baking in this year and the next year is the advanced metal recovery and the heavy media richard peach senior vice president chief financial officer and chief of corporate operations well so this year you re correct the clean copper recovery technologies will be implemented but also in the second half of this fiscal year we will have already begun a rollout of the advanced metal recovery systems so at one or more export facilities we ll have that new technology under our plan and the combination of these two factors lead us to believe that by the end of the fourth quarter we can get to around a 4 per ton benefit over the end of the fiscal year and then when we get into the next fiscal year in the first half of the fiscal year we have the remaining rollout of the advanced metal recovery systems to our other export facilities and in addition the heavy media plants on both sides of the country so it s a rollout that lasts during that second half of this fiscal year and then into the first half of the next phil gibbs keybanc capital markets analyst very good thanks very much best of luck richard peach senior vice president chief financial officer and chief of corporate operations thank you tamara lundgren president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you and i am showing no further questions from our phone lines and i d like to turn the conference back over to tamara lundgren for any closing remarks tamara lundgren president and chief executive officer thank you operator and thank you all for joining us on our call today and for your interest in our company we look forward to speaking with you again in april when we report our second quarter fiscal 20 results thank you operator duration 44 minutes

the world s central banks are shouting from the rooftops they re becoming increasingly more vocal about their market outlooks and policies talking about lower interest rates more asset purchases and rounds of quantitative easing not a week goes by without a market moving message from at least one of the world s central banks i m sure you can hear what they re saying but what are they actually trying to tell us today and tomorrow i ll discuss what central banks are doing and the hidden meaning behind it that could decide the fate of this bull market central banks including the u s federal reserve are all publicly making the same argument the state of the economy requires more accommodative monetary policy to help stimulate inflation and growth both of which are below desired levels this of course means that already low interest rates are going lower currently more than 10 trillion in government debt around the world provides a negative interest rate this means for example that if you invest 100 in a german bund at current prices it will be worth only 93 in 30 years yet investors are lining up in droves for this and banks are essentially telling us we should expect these huge piles of negative yielding debt to be the norm for years to come but the overt statements by the fed and others are just part of the story what s more important to the markets today is actually what the banks are implying do you see the hidden meaning behind their aggressive quantitative easing i believe that i do and i want to share the decoded message with you because it provides a road map for how we should invest going forward if you agree and if i m right you should be able to continue generating solid investment returns while the rest of the world sheepishly waffles let s start by taking a look at two interesting data points economist david rosenberg highlighted the first data point back in august with this tweet we now have had three months of a 3 mo 10 yr yield curve inversion the track record this has had in predicting recessions 100 other famous economists have also flagged this data point one went on to say that this inversion will soon put the market into a death spiral the clock is still ticking we re now at five months since this yield curve inverted clearly this first data point is decidedly bearish for the market but just one day after rosenberg s tweet c scott garliss our own market expert and head of stansberry newswire pointed out a different type of inflection point the dividend yield on the s p 500 index is now higher than the yield offered by investing in 30 year u s treasurys 1 97 versus 1 94 the last time this happened was in march 2009 since that time the s p 500 has rallied more than 300 in other words when stocks yield more than bonds it s historically a great time to be invested in equities and that s even before you consider the longer term earnings and dividend growth you ll enjoy with stocks that you won t get with bonds clearly this second data point is decidedly bullish for the market and we certainly enjoyed a strong rally to close out 2019 so which data point will take over from here which way will the market go next my answer is simple as long as we are not about to enter a recession stocks will continue to push higher i hope longtime readers are getting used to this message stock prices can bounce around in the short term but they only really drop in a big way when the economy is in a recession otherwise they continue to grind higher so are we on the brink of a recession my view continues to be no and here is where decoding central bankers implied messages becomes so important you see i believe when you read between the lines these monetary authorities are telling us no recession allowed in the past the world s central banks waited until after a recession began to roll out aggressive economic stimulus programs but this time they want to get out ahead of a slowdown and press the stimulus pedal down now they are willing to go to extraordinary measures to keep the global economy moving upward they re driving savings rates to zero or lower to push more dollars into riskier more productive assets they re making debt financing rates dirt cheap to encourage more growth and capital expenditures they ll use their entire monetary tool kit to keep the economy rolling on august 23

president trump may shrug off iran s missile attack providing tentative calm in some assets a vow to retaliate may trigger a full risk off reaction an offer to talk may trigger a market rally it took iran five days to the minute to retaliate to the us killing of qassem suleimani a top iranian general official tehran fired missiles on two us bases in iraq claiming that 80 people were killed however the pentagon did not report any casualties and president donald trump tweeted all is well markets have bounced back from the initial fall but tension remains elevated as the president is set to address the nation on recent mid east developments here are three scenarios for trump s statement and how it may impact currencies and gold 1 shrugging off iran s response the president may follow through on his tweet announcing that the damage was minimal and mocking iran s capabilities that would imply that the us has no plans to hit back and allow for some calm in markets trump previously vowed to finish the endless wars in the middle east and faces a tough reelection battle he also measures his success via stock markets the safe haven dollar and yen would retreat in this scenario while stocks and commodity currencies would have room to rise however uncertainty about the next developments in the region may allow gold bulls to keep the precious metal bid it is essential to note that xau usd has been enjoying a steady uptrend well before the iran inspired rally the probability is high according to the current knowledge of minimal damage 2 vowing to hit iran hard trump also promised to inflict damage on iran including on cultural sites in case it responds to suleimani s killing and may feel obliged to follow through if us servicemen were killed a pledge of fire and fury may lead to speculation of a troop surge and rising chances of outright war in this scenario the safe haven dollar yen and perhaps also the swiss franc may find demand gold would have room to rally well beyond the 1 600 mark and oil prices could enter a more consistent uptrend than the recent back and worth moves the losers would be stock markets and also the australian and new zealand dollars the c may gain with petrol prices the probability is medium and it depends on the damage 3 time to talk iran said it does not seek war nor escalation and trump also fears the middle eastern quagmire both sides may claim to their domestic audiences that they won this round and ready to talk the president already tore down the north american free trade agreement nafta only to reconstruct a similar accord but with a new name the us mexico canada agreement after ripping up the iran nuclear deal the jcpoa he may take ownership of a new process with tehran beginning a new round of negotiations iran may even achieve its goal of kicking the us out of the region while trump declares victory and an end to needless wars if the message is somewhat conciliatory stock markets may rally and safe haven assets will be sold off that includes the dollar yen and also gold oil prices could also settle at lower ground the probability is low as trump may find it hard to offer an olive branch conclusion the most likely scenario is for trump to dismiss iran s attack allowing for a relief rally but no sell off in gold another option is a pledge to fight back triggering an all out risk off rally the president may also call it even and suggest new talks and trigger a massive rally but chances are slim
overview in the next few years pennsylvania and philadelphia must determine whether a state agency should continue to oversee the city government s finances as it has for nearly three decades since 1992 philadelphia s finances have been overseen by the pennsylvania intergovernmental cooperation authority pica a state agency created in response to a fiscal crisis that left philadelphia unable to borrow money in its first several years pica issued bonds to fund the city s accumulated operating deficit and in every year since its creation it has required the city to submit a five year financial plan pica has monitored city finances through two recessions and four mayoral administrations and its oversight is backed by substantial enforcement power the agency can withhold up to 500 million in local wage tax revenue if the city fails to create a five year plan that pica approves for philadelphia the pica oversight era has consisted of nearly three decades of relative financial stability the city s credit rating has risen and its general fund has ended the fiscal year with a surplus in 23 of the past 26 years however pica could soon disappear under the law that created it the authority will sunset no more than a year after the last of its bonds are paid off unless the state legislature renews it and the bonds will be paid off in 2023 as a result state and local policymakers will soon face a choice they can reauthorize pica possibly with additional bonding authority or other changes to its mission or powers or they can allow the agency to go out of business returning full responsibility for budgetary stability to the city philadelphia officials would then have to decide whether to retain five year financial planning and quarterly reporting on revenue and expenditures practices that have been required under the pica statute and whether to create a new locally governed fiscal oversight body this decision point raises several related questions how important a role has pica played in the city s fiscal stability since 1992 what is the value of the independent oversight that the authority has provided would pica s disappearance increase the risk that the city s fiscal health might deteriorate in this report the pew charitable trusts examines these questions with a view toward informing the policy debate over pica s impending expiration the research is based on a review of official documents and interviews with state and local officials who have been involved with city finances over the past three decades how pica came into being in fall 1990 the city of philadelphia faced severe fiscal problems despite years of personnel reductions service cuts and tax increases the city was unable to balance its budget it had ended fiscal year 1990 with a general fund deficit of 73 million and it anticipated an additional deficit of 136 million for fiscal 1991 1 it could no longer access the bond market for working capital or long term borrowing and it faced a cash crisis by january 1991 the city s only option was to borrow money from local banks and city and state pension funds at an effective annual interest rate exceeding 24 percent 2 in spring 1991 at philadelphia s request the state legislature created pica to help the city address these problems the act that created pica stated three broad goals to help philadelphia eliminate budget deficits to enable it to access capital markets and to facilitate sound financial planning and budget practices 3 the specific provisions of the act were pica would be governed by a board consisting of five voting members each a private citizen experienced in finance or management and appointed for a two year term concurrent with the terms of members of the state house of representatives 4 each of five state officials the governor the president pro tempore of the senate the senate minority leader the speaker of the house of representatives and the house minority leader would name a member the board also included two nonvoting ex officio members the city finance director and the state budget secretary each of five state officials the governor the president pro tempore of the senate the senate minority leader the speaker of the house of representatives and the house minority leader would name a member the board also included two nonvoting ex officio members the city finance director and the state budget secretary pica was empowered to issue bonds and grant the proceeds to philadelphia to fund its operating deficits and capital projects and to refinance city debt the bonds were to be secured by revenue from a tax designated by the city exclusively for pica s use ultimately city officials converted into the pica tax the first 1 5 percent of the wage tax that city residents paid the authority uses this revenue which now amounts to nearly 550 million per year to pay debt service on its outstanding bonds then transfers the remainder to philadelphia the debt service peaked at 107 million per year from fiscal 1997 through 2002 and has since gradually declined in fiscal 2020 it is projected at only 47 million meaning that roughly 500 million of pica tax revenue will be passed on to the city 5 for as long as the bonds were being paid off pica was to oversee city finances through a five year financial plan that philadelphia would prepare and pica would approve each plan was to project balanced budgets for five years based on reasonable assumptions and by reducing expenditures increasing revenue or boosting productivity if the city failed to comply with five year financial plan requirements at any time pica was authorized to withhold the proceeds of the pica tax and some state grants philadelphia would be required to submit to pica quarterly reports of actual revenue and expenditures when awarding wages and benefits to uniformed employees labor arbitrators were required to consider the five year financial plan and the city s ability to pay for wage and benefit increases without raising tax rates or adversely affecting service levels as long as pica had outstanding debt philadelphia could not file for bankruptcy protection under chapter 9 of the federal code the city was authorized to levy a 1 percent local sales tax to garner additional funds to help balance its budget pica s first move was to work with then mayor w wilson goode sr and members of city council to develop an intergovernmental cooperation agreement that would lay out roles and responsibilities the pact took effect in january 1992 after newly elected mayor edward g rendell took office rendell and his staff began working on the city s first five year financial plan which pica approved the plan represented a roadmap to fiscal stability based on over 100 potential initiatives to reduce costs and increase revenue its proposed changes included management efficiencies improved tax collections and modifications to union contracts notably a wage freeze reductions in monthly payments to union health benefit funds disability program reforms and fewer paid holidays pica issued its first series of bonds for 475 million in june 1992 including 153 5 million to fund the city s accumulated general fund deficit through fiscal 1991 6 the authority issued three additional series of bonds before its long term bonding authority expired in december 1994 the additional bonds brought pica s total bond issuance to over 1 billion by implementing the plan initiatives and negotiating new municipal union contracts the city restored fiscal balance relatively quickly it achieved a general fund surplus for fiscal 1993 and regained its investment grade credit ratings from moody s and standard poor s in spring 1995 in december 1995 philadelphia successfully issued long term debt for the first time since the crisis how pica has performed for the most part city government in philadelphia has achieved fiscal stability since the early 1990s during that period the local economy has strengthened particularly in the past decade and the city has had a succession of mayors who have recognized the importance of sound fiscal policy but the stakeholders interviewed for this study largely agree that pica act requirements have played a role as well in helping the city access capital markets eliminate budget deficits and adopt sound financial planning and budgeting processes as the pica act envisioned accessing capital markets in 1992 when pica began operating the city government s financial situation was so dire that no one would lend it any money thanks to pica s initial bond issues philadelphia was able to borrow money three years later in addition pica s very existence has had a positive impact on philadelphia s bond ratings with rating agencies consistently citing the five year financial plan and pica oversight in their reports on the city s fiscal situation according to lisa schroeer senior director at s p global ratings pica s oversight provides some additional comfort on the financial planning for the city it s one more layer to double check and to question assumptions it gives some added support to the numbers we re looking at knowing that a third party has also questioned the projections 7 in the view of most of the officials and other stakeholders interviewed for this study pica s oversight resulted in higher credit ratings and lower borrowing costs than would have been the case without pica still philadelphia s credit ratings remain relatively low compared with those of other large cities moody s investors service assigns philadelphia a long term rating of a2 among the 25 largest u s cities only chicago and detroit have lower ratings see table 1 according to moody s the city s credit rating is limited by high poverty reliance on relatively volatile revenue sources limited financial reserves an above average debt burden in relation to the tax base and a high unfunded pension liability 8 eliminating budget deficits another pica act goal was to eliminate city budget deficits as shown in figure 1 philadelphia s general fund has ended the year with a surplus in 23 of the 26 years since fiscal 1992 at least in part because of the fiscal discipline imposed by the pica process including the five year financial plan quarterly reporting and pica oversight fostering sound financial planning and budgetary practices the five year financial plan and quarterly reporting required by pica have become established features of philadelphia s budget process in conjunction with the measures mandated by the city charter these procedures have helped the city maintain fiscal discipline in several ways external validation of estimates the pica act requires that the revenue and expenditure projections inthe five year financial plan be based on reasonable and appropriate assumptions and methods of estimation 9 pica staff in reviewing the plan focus on assumptions such as projected tax base growth employee wage and benefit costs revenue from new tax sources and expenditures on new programs pica s independent fiscal scorekeeping is valued by city officials pica staff in reviewing the plan focus on assumptions such as projected tax base growth employee wage and benefit costs revenue from new tax sources and expenditures on new programs pica s independent fiscal scorekeeping is valued by city officials long term perspective because the financial plan must project balanced budgets for five years the plan process compels city officials to take a long term view of budgetary decisions any decisions to alter tax rates or other revenue streams create new programs modify labor contracts or issue debt are viewed through the lens of the five year plan one benefit of this perspective is that it discourages reliance on temporary revenue sources as the city s finance director rob dubow explained the plan process means you can t just balance for one year and do one timers because that will then show in the outyears of the plan 10 the plan requirement also affects decisions about implementing new programs city councilman derek s green said that when council members are negotiating with city officials about new budgetary initiatives the five year plan is important because the administration will say well it snot just this year it s about the five year plan which we ve got to balance 11 the plan requirement also affects decisions about implementing new programs city councilman derek s green said that when council members are negotiating with city officials about new budgetary initiatives the five year plan is important because the administration will say well it snot just this year it s about the five year plan which we ve got to balance ongoing monitoring the pica act also requires the city to report quarterly to pica on actual or current estimates of revenues and expenditures compared to budgeted revenues and expenditures 12 philadelphia meets this requirement through its quarterly city managers report which tracks fiscal performance in relation to budget explains deviations and provides information on personnel levels leave usage cash flow and agency performance pica staff also monitor city finances throughout the year and publish analyses of both the quarterly city managers report and tax revenue trends estimating revenue a cornerstone of the five year plan process is revenue estimation on which the city typically works closely with pica for the most part the estimates have been reasonably accurate and generally conservative in the decade before pica oversight fiscal 1983 through 1992 actual general fund tax revenue came in below the budget estimate in six of the 10 years since then revenue has exceeded the budget estimates in 18 of 26 years see figure 2 revenue came in below estimates during the recession and in its aftermath from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2011 before the proposed five year plan is released each year the philadelphia city budget office working with consultants develops five year projections of tax base growth for each of the city s major tax sources external experts and city officials review these projections at a meeting convened by pica modifying them if necessary ongoing monitoring of tax collections by city officials also results in their periodically revising the projections anna adams a former city budget director said that the pica process makes revenue estimates more reliable because it takes away from any potential political interference in forecasting as the forecasts are known to be reviewed by staff of the pica board 13 other pica act provisions the pica act includes other provisions not directly related to the authority s operations with fiscal benefits for the city labor contracts the pica act requires that the arbitrators who determine labor contracts between the city and its uniformed employees take into account the five year plan and the city s ability to pay for higher wages and benefits without raising tax rates or negatively affecting service levels although it is impossible to know what contract terms would have been like in the absence of the act many of the people interviewed said this requirement has played a major role in keeping labor costs manageable and this requirement is significant for city finances because employee wage and benefit costs represent 64 percent of the fiscal 2020 general fund budget david l cohen chief of staff to then mayor rendell said the pica act provisions related to arbitration were the most central element of the turnaround of the early 1990s had the city not been able to reduce labor costs he said the rendell administration would have been forced to implement service cuts that would have destroyed the quality of life in the city 14 bankruptcy prohibition the pica act prevents the city from declaring bankruptcy under chapter 9 of the federal code for as long as pica has outstanding debt and its oversight powers are in force this provision according to katherine clupper a city financial adviser has been important to investors because it is a guarantee against philadelphia defaulting on its debts 15 the act also states that once pica s oversight ends the city may file for bankruptcy only with the governor s approval 16 pica s limitations pica has generally succeeded at the broad goals outlined for it in the pica act but the scope of its actions has sometimes fallen short of what critics and some board members would have liked authority over city policy state financial oversight boards are often said to be undemocratic substituting their judgment for that of local elected officials 17 the pica act however prohibits the authority from making policy decisions regarding the allocation of public funds pica has enforced fiscal discipline but has not sought to evaluate the city s financial plans from a policy perspective ron henry pica s first executive director said it s not our job to tell you what to do it s our job to evaluate what you re doing 18 current executive director harvey rice noted we do not establish policy we allow the elected representatives to put in the programs they think are best our job is to make sure they have the money to fund them 19 the statute permits pica to make recommendations to philadelphia officials regarding the city s budgetary and fiscal affairs and to the governor and legislature regarding state policies that influence municipal finances 20 the authority has performed this advisory role periodically through staff reports board resolutions and testimony the impact of this work is difficult to assess some of the authority s recommendations on pensions employee health benefits budget stabilization and property assessment have been implemented by the city enforcement options pica has never formally rejected a five year financial plan one reason has to do with the consequences if the authority rejects a plan it must withhold pica taxes and other state grants that would otherwise be due to the city in the view of some current and former pica board members the severity of this penalty the pica tax alone generates approximately 500 million for the city treasury has made it all but unusable diminishing the authority s ability to negotiate changes to the plan in exchange for approving it drew crompton chief of staff to senate president pro tempore joseph b scarnati iii said i don t get the sense that pica has any real play in the budgetary process any real seat at the table is nullified to a point because of this all or nothing paradigm that is set up in the statute 21 there have been several cases in which pica has made an impact on city budgets in the early 1990s for instance the authority persuaded philadelphia to alter revenue estimates in the five year plan and pica s oversight and enforcement power played a key role during the 2007 09 recession the time during the authority s history when city finances were the most precarious in summer 2009 philadelphia s five year plan projection was based on passage of state legislation to increase the local sales tax and defer required pension payments which had not happened when pica received the plan from the city pica did not reject the plan but refused to approve it the potential that the authority would reject the plan increased the pressure on the legislature to act james eisenhower who was board chair at the time said he believes that the prospect of pica using its hammer and withholding hundreds of millions of dollars from the city played a significant role in breaking that logjam in harrisburg 22 ultimately the legislature acted and the plan was approved labor cost projections in the five year plan departmental personnel cost projections include only costs associated with union contracts in force at the time of the plan s adoption so if one of those contracts expires after year two of the five year period the plan assumes no increase in wages and no changes in health benefit costs in years three four and five as a result any future labor contracts often result in costs higher than the plan projection city officials say that including any assumption about wage or benefit cost increases beyond current contracts would be counterproductive because the unions would assume they would get at least that much and bargain for more in recent plans the city at pica s urging has been including a financial reserve for future labor costs and pica staff analyze the potential impact of future labor contracts in their own reports on the plan policy options policymakers at the state level will soon be faced with the issue of whether to keep pica in existence in addition city officials must decide whether to ask that the authority s life be extended and if so whether its role or mission should be modified in any way if pica is not continued local officials will need to consider whether to institutionalize the processes that will expire with pica particularly the five year financial plan and quarterly reporting and whether additional local institutions should be created to promote fiscal stability here are some options that key stakeholders have been discussing maintaining pica dubow the city finance director and other members of mayor jim kenney s administration have expressed support for keeping pica in some form and many of the stakeholders interviewed for this report agreed citing the benefits to philadelphia in terms of fiscal management labor cost controls and credit enhancement those who recommend continuing pica point to the way in which its existence has brought fiscal discipline to the city via the five year financial plan and the authority s ability to enforce compliance they also say that the requirement that labor arbitrators take the city s finances into account has helped produce contracts with workers that are consistent with fiscal health and stability citing philadelphia s poverty rate high wage tax and need to fund both city and county services cohen rendell s former chief of staff said we are still a city at risk and i believe it would be unwise for us to give up any tool that helps the mayor and the city council to produce balanced and responsible budgets on a going forward basis continuation of the pica ecosystem including the authority and the collective bargaining principles is in the strong best interest of the city of philadelphia 23 henry pica s first executive director said the authority s existence has worked as both a sword and a shield for city officials concerned about the optics of fiscal responsibility it s a sword that could make them do something they wanted to do but didn t have the political support to do and a shield in the sense that it gives the mayor and council the opportunity to say well we were going to put on another 300 cops but they told us we couldn t afford it 24 former pennsylvania lieutenant governor jim cawley a pica board member said the authority s existence helps moderate the perennial strains between the city and state governments there is a constant competition for a finite amount of resources if there is even a modicum of assurance that someone is keeping an eye on the money that s being spent i think that helps to create a better relationship between the two entities 25 and dubow cited the authority s impact on philadelphia s bond ratings if pica sunsets he said one of the issues for us will be the loss of an entity that rating agencies and markets have come to rely on and it s seen as a credit positive 26 modifying pica if pica is renewed it will have to be modified its current existence is tied to paying off bonds that will have been paid off and the justification for the pica tax used to finance those bonds will have disappeared other changes might be considered as well one proposal being discussed by some local officials is to renew pica s authorization to borrow and use it for school construction or other long term civic priorities pica s bonding authority after all is a powerful tool tied as it is to a dedicated tax its bonds are highly rated by the three major bond rating agencies giving it the ability to borrow at low interest rates another potential modification has to do with pica s enforcement power pica board member cawley for one suggested that the board needs an option aside from rejecting the entire five year financial plan and depriving philadelphia of millions of dollars if we had the ability to be perhaps more surgical in the way we could bring attention to certain areas i think that would only aid in helping the city to get better financially 27 even without the bonding authority and the tax pica could retain the power to withhold some state grant funds from the city as a financial sanction for noncompliance 28 the penalty would be more limited and potentially more usable reflecting the financial progress that philadelphia has made over the past three decades a reauthorized pica could be given an explicit mandate to examine goals beyond balanced budgets former pica executive director uri monson would like to see the five year plan used as a blueprint for improving government s internal operations and service delivery 29 or as councilman green put it pica could be required to conduct fiscal analysis of policy proposals to help evaluate different ideas and suggestions that come from either the executive or legislative branch 30 another issue likely to be raised is the board s makeup in terms of both how members are named and what qualifications they must have former board chair sam katz said board members should be politically independent and free of conflicts of interest currently all members are named by state elected officials 31 more fundamental changes also are possible for instance new york city has a state oversight agency the new york state financial control board that was established in 1975 to deal with a financial emergency it continues to exist but its oversight powers were placed on hold in 1986 and will remain there as long as the city maintains a balanced budget and meets other fiscal benchmarks 32 under this model the city retains fiscal autonomy but there s a mechanism in place if needed to prevent another crisis eliminating pica the original justification for pica was that philadelphia s fiscal crisis threatened the city s ability to provide basic services because such a crisis no longer exists some city leaders question whether pica is still needed city controller rebecca rhynhart favors allowing the authority to sunset governments across the country do five year financial planning and quarterly financial reporting without being required by state law she said it s about self control self rule and doing the right thing 33 rendell the former mayor and governor agrees we ve demonstrated our ability as a city to manage ourselves and to make sure that we don t spend more money than we have coming in 34 another concern among some stakeholders is the risk that a reauthorized pica could become overtly politicized and thus less effective an additional consideration is the cost of pica operations which would disappear if the authority were not reauthorized in the most recent fiscal year the authority s general fund operating cost totaled 1 25 million 35 if pica expires though the pica tax will expire as well the wage tax on city residents would decline by 1 5 percentage points policymakers would have to decide whether to increase the wage tax by that amount an action that would mean no change for city residents who pay the wage tax or to find other revenue to make up all or part of the difference maintaining pica functions even if pica is not reauthorized philadelphia could seek to retain the fiscal management practices and other aspects of the pica act long term financial planning and quarterly financial reporting could be mandated by a city ordinance charter amendment or state legislation so too could the city s practice of seeking external advice as part of its revenue estimation process in developing the five year financial plan or philadelphia could create a new local agency charged with reviewing the city s finances and serving as an independent source of fiscal information and analysis such a body would not have pica s enforcement power and the challenge would be to ensure its political independence but it could offer independent verification of the city s fiscal projections and perhaps play a broader role in providing fiscal analysis of legislation and other key issues other cities have created such agencies 36 conclusion city and state policymakers face an important decision about how to respond to pica s expiration in 2023 or 2024 the pica act brought about important changes to philadelphia s fiscal governance that have facilitated an era of fiscal stability but the city still faces major fiscal challenges that will require continued discipline and creativity extending state oversight may play an important part in ensuring that philadelphia is able to address these challenges alternatively local institutions could fill the gap when pica expires ultimately the lesson of three decades of pica oversight is that institutions matter greatly to fiscal management and provide the structure within which sound policies are made endnotes

analytics in west chester pennsylvania the commerce department said the trade deficit decreased 8 2 to 43 1 billion in november the smallest since october 2016 the trade gap narrowed 0 7 through november and is on track to record its first annual decline since 2013 though the shrinking trade bill should be a boost to gross domestic product in the fourth quarter falling consumer and capital goods imports also suggest a cooling in domestic demand economists polled by reuters had forecast the trade shortfall tightening to 43 8 billion in november the goods trade deficit with china the focus of the white house s america first agenda tumbled 15 7 to 26 4 billion with imports dropping 9 2 and exports jumping 13 7 the goods trade deficit with the european union fell 20 2 to 13 1 billion the united states and china are embroiled in a bruising trade war and the white house has also tussled with other trading partners including the european union brazil and argentina accusing them of devaluing their currencies at the expense of u s manufacturers though washington and beijing in december hammered out a phase 1 trade deal considerable confusion remains about the details of the agreement president donald trump said last tuesday that the partial deal would be signed on jan 15 at the white house the 18 month long us china trade war has undermined business investment which together with slowing growth overseas have led to a recession in manufacturing economists expect manufacturing to continue to struggle without a complete rolling back of tariffs manufacturing s troubles do not appear to have significantly spilled over to the services industries in a separate report on tuesday the institute for supply management ism said its non manufacturing activity index rose to a reading of 55 0 last month from 53 9 in november a reading above 50 indicates expansion in the services sector which accounts for more than two thirds of u s economic activity but services industries reported a moderation in growth in new orders and hiring the report came on the heels of a survey from the ism last week showing its measure of national factory activity dropping in december to its lowest level since june 2009 and contracting for a fifth straight month the dollar rose against a basket of currencies us treasury yields were steady while stocks on wall street fell growth boost when adjusted for inflation the goods trade deficit decreased 3 7 billion to 75 3 billion in november the smallest since march 2017 the so called real trade deficit so far in the fourth quarter is below the average for the july september period economists expect trade will add at least 1 5 percentage points to gdp growth in the fourth quarter after being a drag for two straight quarters the boost from trade is however expected to be partially offset by a moderation in the pace of inventory accumulation the atlanta fed is forecasting gdp increasing at a 2 3 annualized rate in the fourth quarter the economy grew at a 2 1 pace in the third quarter in november goods imports dropped 1 4 to 201 1 billion declining for a third straight month consumer goods imports fell 1 0 billion pulled down by declines in cellphones and other household items and artwork and other collectables economists believe consumer goods imports were depressed by a 15 tariff on 110 billion worth of chinese goods that came into effect on sept 1 they also say anticipation that the phase 1 trade agreement would roll back the tariffs could have encouraged companies to hold off on imports a rebound in imports is expected if as we expect the recent decline in imports is due to importers pulling forward demand to get ahead of consumer focused tariffs it may be set to reverse and be a drag on gdp in coming quarters said tim quinlan a senior economist at wells fargo securities in charlotte north carolina the drop in consumer goods imports points to a slower pace of consumer spending in the october december quarter after two straight quarters of brisk growth capital goods imports dropped 1 2 billion in november reflecting decreases in civilian aircraft and computers and suggesting continued weakness in business investment crude oil imports tumbled to 166 4 million barrels the lowest since february 1992 from 188 3 million barrels in october that contributed to a record petroleum surplus goods exports rose 0 7 to 137 2 billion in november they were boosted by a 0 6 billion increase in shipments of capital goods consumer goods exports advanced 0 5 billion
there was never any question that the headlines in 2020 would be dominated by the presidential campaign no one ever expected 2020 to be a year of the economy stupid chairman mao s dictum put politics in command seems more to the point writing those lines the morning after iran s missile strike on u s bases in iraq i cannot put out of my mind the way possible political twists could affect the economy for months analysts have pondered whether the announcement of a u s china trade deal would raise economic spirits in 2020 now we have the prospects of military conflict in the middle east perhaps with rising oil prices and patriotic fervor on all sides to think about prognosticating about the impact of political events on the economy seems both doomed to failure and thankless having acknowledged that politics will dominate this year allow me to turn to the somewhat more tractable field of the state of the economy and its short term prospects in the second and third quarters of 2019 u s economic growth moved into a lower gear real gdp grew at just about 2 percent in both quarters buoyed by steady growth in consumer spending increasingly consumers have been isolated in pushing the economy forward their only supporting partner has been government but the push from the 2017 tax bill has largely run out of steam on the negative side business investment in new equipment factories and structures actually fell while construction of homes and apartments grew feebly investment the most volatile part of gdp is the one that usually drives expansions and recessions for example the last recession was triggered by the collapse of home prices and the near cessation of residential construction this 2 percent pace is reasonably healthy with unemployment still very low and inflation a touch below the federal reserve s 2 percent target the economy is fairly healthy as federal reserve chairman jerome powell has repeatedly emphasized overall wages are growing a bit faster but not fast enough to create concerns about rising inflation the 64 000 question is whether all of this can last the u s economy has officially been in an expansion for more than a decade setting a post world war ii record for the longest expansion period the word roaring will not come to anyone s lips but fans of slow and steady go tortoise will have a chance to make their point the fed s two rate cuts in 2019 should provide support for interest sensitive sectors of the economy such as housing and consumer durables as mortgages and car loans become a bit more attractive u s financial markets mainly seem to be thriving especially the stock market but there was a bit of a stir over yield curve inversion in the fall with one year interest rates higher than the 10 year rates in the past this has been a leading indicator of a recession reflecting expectations that economic activity would fall in the next year or two but dramatic changes in the structure of the u s financial system with banks losing much of their central role as deposit takers to money market mutual funds and their central role as lenders to bond issuance and non bank lenders cast some doubt on the reliability of this signal there are some pockets of stress in the financial markets most of all increased signs of companies having difficulties repaying leveraged loans a category of risky loans so far however nothing more concrete has emerged although caution requires me to note that financial risks are not always detected in advance looking beyond the u s world economic growth has been slowing the usually reserved international monetary fund used dramatic language when it said that the outlook remains precarious in its last world economic outlook published on october 15 with both europe and japan in a weak state china s gdp growth also seems to have slowed partly from the effects of the trade war and partly from long standing growth challenges usually u s recessions are made in america not abroad the weakness beyond our shores probably would not be enough to plunge the u s into recession but if u s consumers do become more cautious or a significant problem emerges in the financial sector a recession could very well be on the horizon often economists speculate about soft landings and continued expansion recessions tend to be global events these days and they usually hit the major economies at more or less the same time by professional training and personal disposition i am a bit of a pessimist i always expect that the next recession will hit us my only question is when 2020 might not be the year of the next recession but then again it might but what are the chances that we will even notice the economy above the din of political news evan kraft is the economist in residence for the economics department at american university he served as director of the research department and adviser to the governor of the croatian national bank
e arly in its trade dispute with china america declared that chinese industrial policy was a form of economic aggression america s negotiators hoped to rein it in no such luck the very week in december that america and china announced a mini deal on trade china s president xi jinping vowed that the chinese government would do more in 2020 to support strategic sectors ranging from robotics to biomedicine having seen its vulnerability to american export controls china is more determined to build up its domestic abilities than it was before the trade war began listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element this raises an obvious question does industrial policy work since at least jean baptiste colbert france s finance minister under louis xiv in the 17th century governments have used taxes tariffs and subsidies to cultivate national champions colbert worried about the dominance of venetian glassmakers mr xi worries about the dominance of american chipmakers in principle industrial policy looks attractive when markets are highly imperfect a fact of life in developing countries governments can use their muscle to stimulate activities that would otherwise be unthinkable for private entrepreneurs when such policies succeed the targeted sectors flourish as south korea s chemicals industry did in the 1970s that in turn can lead to technological advances and productivity gains for the wider economy but in practice industrial policy is hard to get right helping companies is as likely to promote laziness as competitiveness moreover officials may be no better and perhaps much worse than businesspeople in choosing which industries to support although china is far from alone in deploying industrial policy it stands out for the sheer scale of its efforts since the 1980s it has produced dozens of plans and lavished public spending on sectors from solar power to film making one industry has been a big unintended beneficiary the academic study of industrial policy a large and growing economic literature considers china s record a recent volume edited by loren brandt of the university of toronto and thomas rawski of the university of pittsburgh examines the electricity and telecommunications sectors these are natural candidates for government intervention given the high cost of building power grids and phone networks plus the benefits to society but china has done more than build basic systems it has also tried to reach the frontier of global innovation it has had some success state grid corporation of china is a world leader in ultra high voltage transmission china has gone the authors say from pygmy to emerging giant in civilian nuclear power but elsewhere it has come up short despite decades of support its semiconductor firms are laggards it has also failed to challenge airbus and boeing or to produce any truly international car companies see technology quarterly one tentative conclusion is that china s industrial policy works better when natural monopolies are involved there is a clear role for a central authority with strong organising power to develop a power transmission system or a high speed rail network yet that same authority can stifle competition in sectors that need it alternatively as often occurs in china if lots of provincial governments try to foster their own champions nominally in pursuit of national objectives the outcome is extreme over capacity which undermines the targeted sector china s shipbuilding industry provides a textbook example panle jia barwick and nahim bin zahur both of cornell university and myrto kalouptsidi of harvard university estimate in a recent paper that between 2006 and 2013 the government directed policy support worth 550bn yuan roughly 80bn at the time to shipbuilders most went as subsidies for entrants to the sector attracting subpar firms china became the world s biggest producer of ships but the increase in net profits was just a fifth of the subsidies even the electricity sector an ostensible success is plagued by excess a well run power network should have back up generating capacity equivalent to about 15 of peak load the average among china s provinces is more than 90 that though is not the end of the story ultimately the value of industrial policy is in its wider economic impact in a separate paper ernest liu of princeton university argues that state support is most effective when it targets those sectors that make the most essential inputs for others generally these are upstream turning raw materials into products used in a range of industries subsidies for them even via state firms can raise overall efficiency as it happens china has focused its support on the right sectors in mr liu s calculations such as steelmaking and machinery china put bluntly might never have become the economic power that it is today without ambitious industrial policy l industrie c est moi mr liu s model does not indicate when subsidies are too high nor does it set out how best to design policies there is evidence that china s heavy handed intervention is becoming increasingly ineffective total factor productivity growth in china in recent years has been a third of what it was before the 2008 global financial crisis see chart productivity has also slowed in other countries but the world bank in a recent book about chinese innovation notes that china s slowdown has been unusually sharp after conducting extensive case studies of the vehicle and renewable energy sectors among others the bank ascribes some of the blame to chinese industrial policies that undermine fair competition it argues that rather than targeting support at specific firms china should shift to more market oriented policies even handed regulations and incentives which treat state firms no differently from private companies or foreign investors would do more than lavish subsidies to promote entrepreneurship such a shift would have the convenient side effect of dealing with america s concern that china s mammoth subsidies undercut competitors globally industrial policy is always contentious but it now looks like that rarest of things an issue on which chinese and american interests are aligned whether their leaders see it that way is another matter
the narrative landlords cannot be allowed to raise rents to whatever they want whenever they want we need national rent control bernie sanders rent control is one of many tools that local jurisdictions can use to promote access to affordable housing pete buttigieg it s time that we stop commodifying the housing market because it is not a speculative investment it is a basic right for all americans alexandria ocasio cortez reality rent control is not the way to increase the amount of affordable housing nor is it a solution to poverty inequality or segregation instead it acts to restrict the supply of housing transferring wealth to current tenants at the expense of future and market rate tenants insiders those living in rent protected units generally win at the expense of outsiders in an effort to resist gentrification rent control leads to the decay of the buildings as owners have less revenue to spend on maintenance and improvements regulating rents in short does more harm than good overall key findings rent control makes it harder to find an apartment cities that implement rent control see substantial declines in the availability of rental housing locking people in to existing rental units leaves many renters in apartments much larger or much smaller than they would prefer in some cities waitlists for rent controlled housing are decades long rent control does not increase diversity rent control benefits incumbent tenants at the expense of migrants hoping to relocate to a city in new york city white tenants have disproportionately benefited relative to black or hispanic tenants and landlords give preference to older and childless households many of rent control s benefits typically flow to higher income households even as rent control drives up rents for everyone else rent control degrades the quality of its beneficiaries housing rent control reduces investment in a property s quality and causes a city s housing stock to decay by suppressing property values rent control also reduces tax revenue to municipalities hindering their ability to provide essential services on the record rent control is best understood as an attempt at providing a welfare program for lower income residents who might otherwise be unable to afford their housing but it is one of the worst welfare benefits ever conceived sending most of its benefits to the wrong people actively harming others who are equally in need all while reducing access to rental housing citywide michael hendrix director state and local policy manhattan institute next to bombing rent control seems in many cases to be the most efficient technique so far known for destroying cities so noted the socialist economist assar lindbeck in 1977 in a 2012 survey of leading economists a mere 2 thought that price controls on rent improved the availability and quality of affordable housing then why hasn t rent control destroyed the cities where it has been implemented because of the easing of these price controls since their adoption in the mid 20th century that is until now new york state recently strengthened and extended its rent regulations indefinitely california lawmakers limited annual rent increases statewide to 5 plus inflation and oregon has approved an anti rent gouging law that limits annual rent increases to 7 plus inflation now senator bernie sanders i vt along with representative alexandria ocasio cortez d n y is calling for a nationwide universal 3 cap on rents there s a simple reason that rent control is in vogue america s housing market is increasingly unaffordable since 1970 real housing prices have doubled in new york city and los angeles and tripled in san francisco about 25 of renters nationwide spend over half their income on housing and their ranks are growing the reason for skyrocketing prices is straightforward demand is outstripping supply by 370 000 housing units a year nationwide because of rising regulatory costs such as from local zoning limits on lot size or building height and labor shortages reaching postrecession highs housing supply restrictions are keeping people from moving to more desirable cities rent control is meant to create or preserve housing units with below market rents without direct government subsidies to tenants it is presented as a solution to greedy landlords taking advantage of pinched renters in static housing markets its proponents argue for lowering a landlord s profits by limiting rents in order to ration a constrained housing supply the problem with rent control is that it addresses a problem rooted in regulations with more regulations housing cannot become more affordable without becoming more available rent regulations solve america s affordability crisis for a few people for a short time at great cost to everyone else tenants in controlled units do often see lower rents but those who are not in controlled units experience higher costs as the available housing supply shrinks the result is a tale of two cities divided between the rent controlled and the non rent controlled the housing winners and the housing losers ultimately rent control s restrictions on housing harm low income minority and immigrant americans most of all rent control makes it harder to find an apartment after san francisco s 1994 rent control initiative controlled buildings experienced a 15 decline in tenants and a 25 decline in those living in controlled units property owners were converting rental apartments into condominiums and replacing structures with new buildings resulting in a decline in housing supply and making rent increases likelier over the long run true to form rental housing overall shrank by 6 resulting in a 5 1 increase in rents across san francisco a study of new york city s 1968 rental market found that rents in noncontrolled units were 22 25 higher than they would have been without the presence of price controls meanwhile two years after the adoption of rent control in los angeles noncontrolled rents were rising at three times the rate of controlled units because of limits in housing supply and rent control s basic market distortions even for rent controlled units landlords could set initial rents for vacant apartments higher than market rates to compensate for lower future earnings meaning that these units could become pricey rent control tends to discourage the construction of new rental housing even if price controls do not apply to new developments property investors may fear future policy changes that would diminish their financial incentive to build edward glaeser a senior fellow at the manhattan institute noticed this effect in 2002 when comparing non rent controlled chicago with new york city chicago s lakefront is dotted with apartment buildings built after world war ii for rental purposes new york s upper east side is filled with one time rental buildings that were gradually turned into cooperatives and lacks new rental buildings despite the fact that technically these buildings would be free from rent control following the removal of rent control in cambridge massachusetts in 1995 building permits rose by 20 and construction spending doubled moreover the motivation to demolish buildings legally or illegally grows over time as a means to decontrol units and if property owners find it difficult to build rehab upgrade or demolish their units there s always abandonment rent control discourages new units from being brought to the market it also encourages owners of rent controlled housing to convert their units to for sale condominiums which are not subject to price controls and thus have greater profit potential these condo conversions further contract the housing supply and put upward pressure on noncontrolled rents all while pushing out renters in favor of homeowners usually with higher incomes when rent control was expanded in cambridge massachusetts in 1970 some 10 of the city s rent controlled units were converted to condominiums leading to an overall shrinkage in the available housing stock across the boston area in san francisco controlled units were 8 more likely to become condos than noncontrolled units renters who snag available controlled units often end up in the wrong ones since price no longer sorts scarce housing stock based on varying household composition or earnings empty nesters whose children have moved have a strong incentive to remain in unnecessarily large apartments the rents are too good to give up others in smaller units may end up overcrowded as children are born or relatives move in simultaneously wealthier long term tenants may pay below market rents for spacious units while lower income families find them unavailable one study found that 21 of all new york city renters in 1990 were living in far larger or far smaller apartments than they otherwise would in similar non rent controlled cities inefficient allocation according to another study may cost consumers all the surplus gains they receive from a lower price and more at the end of the day if there are not enough apartments many people will be left out in the cold rent control doesn t meet their needs it merely rations access through waitlists rather than prices rent control may restrict rents on some units as compared with market rate units but this comparison fails to account for the costs of waitlists high search costs and even bribes for example the average wait time for a rent controlled apartment in stockholm is nine years the wait runs north of 30 years for the most in demand neighborhoods when a single apartment opens in the city thousands compete for the privilege to live there the result is a thriving black market bribes run about 10 000 for a single room obtaining a full contract on an apartment may cost by one estimate some 20 of the unit s total market value rent control harms disadvantaged groups san franciscans in rent controlled apartments saved 2 9 billion from 1995 to 2012 meanwhile current residents and future renters paid 2 9 billion more for housing because of higher rents in noncontrolled units offsetting those savings in cambridge massachusetts rent control depressed property values citywide once the controls were lifted in 1994 property values increased by 2 billion over the next decade and more than half of the capitalized cost of rent control was borne by owners of never controlled properties while rent control ostensibly acts as a transfer from landlord to renter even that process is markedly inefficient the costs to landlords exceed the benefits to renters by roughly 75 whatever benefits do exist from rent control are poorly targeted often missing people in need in new york city the wealth transfer from rent controlled landlords to tenants was disproportionately claimed by white economically advantaged renters white renters in 2017 claimed a 36 discount on market rate rents in new york city because of rent control compared with 17 for hispanic renters and 16 for black renters affluent renters received a 39 discount the city s rent control and rent stabilization laws have apparently induced landlords to favor older tenants and smaller households primarily those without children and rent control s benefits are similarly biased against young people and larger families does rent control preserve or increase a city s socioeconomic diversity not according to the evidence while it existed rent control in cambridge modestly increased the share of minority residents in the city but economic segregation rose as the share of very low income residents fell poor residents can benefit from rent control but so can higher income households especially in the absence of income targeting as is the case in new york city where a renter s offspring can inherit a rent controlled apartment regardless of income nearly a third of rent controlled units in metro boston were found to be occupied by tenants in the top half of earners further navigating lengthy waiting lists and murky black markets requires long wait times and personal connections that means that newcomers and recent immigrants are often shut out of more affordable housing options increasing economic social and racial segregation rent control degrades the quality of tenant housing rent control leaves owners with a limited ability to recoup operational costs and investments through rents or an appreciation of their building s value as a result the quality of rent controlled housing generally decays through a lack of investment in maintenance and improvements until it reaches a level supported by the below market rents rent controlled buildings in cambridge massachusetts were found to be older in worse condition and more in need of very essential repairs controlled properties were shown to lower the amenity value and desirability of their surrounding neighborhoods but the overall value of cambridge s housing stock increased dramatically in the decade after rent control was abolished in 2004 property investments dollars that flowed through neighborhoods both wealthy and modest rose 20 over what would have been the case under rent control and led to major improvements in housing quality rent control also reduces a city s tax revenue because price controls limit investment return and building quality the assessed value of rent controlled properties tends to decline and lower property tax revenue and since these effects also lower the market value on non rent controlled properties the local property tax impact is magnified even more costing up to 20 of the annual property tax revenue in 1980s cambridge and in new york city more than double its spending on parks and recreation during the same era income tax revenue may also decline as landlords receive less rental income offset only by fewer expenses because of a lack of property investment in a less valuable real estate market as rent control suppresses housing construction and maintenance its effects ripple outward to suppress economic activity and job creation from the construction and rehabilitation trades endnotes

government to function without such an absolute majority i know it by experience the slfp will carry out its campaign as an alliance partner to ensure him a two thirds majority at the general election q there is a dispute over the symbol what is your view we discussed it before the presidential elections it will be discussed by the party leaders in the future i don t see them asserious issues q how do you view the performance of the president for the last one and half months in office it is a short period for any president to show substantial progress in terms of his performance any government needs at least two years to achieve results on the ground to develop economy is the main task which i see that is to achieve growth while servicing debt we need growth in the export sector we need to work according to a broad development agenda in compliance with home grown thinking we have to cooperate with the new president for such a programme of work to be implemented q the president has initiated some action so far what is your view the steps taken so far are commendable q the president stressed the need for constitutional changes in his maiden speech and in his interaction with the heads of media organisations there was reference to the 19th amendment to the constitution introduced during your time with your blessings what do you think about it it was done not only with my blessings but with the blessings of prime minister mahinda rajapaksa that is how 215 mps raised their hands in support of it at that time the united national party unp had only 47 mps then the slfp led united people s freedom alliance upfa had 142 mps i was the newly elected president at that moment i see it as an extension of support to me you asked about the 19th amendment i talked about it two years ago then i came under harsh criticism by the media i was slandered i told that any president could not discharge duties under the 19th amendment then i came under serious assault by the media and people alike today president gotabaya has also affirmed the same in his interaction with the press i am proven correct it means q does it mean that you will support to change it i have repeatedly said it during the past two years then i was only humiliated critics did not see shortcomings of the 19th president hampering the president s work they saw it as my weakness i was dubbed a spineless leader now you can see that anyone with a backbone cannot also function as long as the 19th amendment remains in this form q why were you unable to foresee such a predicament when it was drafted initially you have to direct that question not only at me but also at 215 mps who voted for it q were you hoodwinked by someone in enacting this piece of legislation absolutely it is a conspiracy hatched by some foreign funded ngos and implemented through then prime minister ranil wickremesinghe q apart from the 19th amendment what are the other changes to the constitution you advocate the electoral system has to be changed i also tried to do it but there was no support for it we did not have the two thirds in the house with much effort we brought about a change in the system for elections to the local authorities we should go for a model based on the first past the post system for other elections we should do away with preferential voting it is our long standing policy q the victory margin of president gotabaya in the polonnaruwa district was not that high compared with other sinhala majority districts some slpp mps say that you discreetly supported mp sajith premadasa in the district what is your response some brainless idiots raise such doubts they don t have any understanding about the ethnic composition of the vote base of the district there are 32 000 tamil and muslim votes in the district and at least 25 000 of them are polled in 2015 they all voted for me this time tamils and muslims did not vote for president goatabaya all over the country that is what happened in polonnaruwa as well q how do you view polarisation of voting pattern on ethnic lines this time it does not bode well for the future q what is the reason for such polarisation as you see it has to be discussed broadly we have to look how it originated some people were sarcastic about the concept of national harmony and reconciliation national harmony and reconciliation are absolutely needed to build the future of this country it should be achieved without compromising or weakening the rights of the sinhala buddhists as the majority community while upholding their rights all the other communities in this country should co exist in harmony it is a topic debated in this country for 50 60 years it is all the more important to build mutual trust among different ethnic groups q there is a crisis over rice prices in the market you hail from one of the largest rice growing districts in the country you also worked as the agriculture minister besides your brother is one of the largest rice millers what is the reason for this crisis in this respect some people talk as if they have been reborn all of a sudden it is not a new crisis every government had to grapple with it at times it is sometimes triggered by factors such as production drop and adverse weather conditions all the governments faced it in 1952 rubber rice pact was signed with china the paddy marketing board was created to avert such a crisis yet it is utterly corrupt if it operates without corruption a solution can be found whenever such a crisis was there every government imported rice that is it it is a crisis that cropped at time during the last 40 years q you mean to say that rice should be imported yes every government had done so when mr mahinda rajapaksa was the president his government did it q if rice is imported won t it affect paddy growers in selling their produce in a month or two those are typical arguments put forward every time we should not indulge in such arguments instead we should focus on bringing down the cost of living if prices are high some stocks should be imported q the present government relaxed regulation on transportation of sand and earth you introduced such regulations what do you feel now i really regret it as the then president i was also in charge of the environment i deployed the three forces to contain such unlawful activities q there is a sand mafia in polonnaruwa who is responsible sand mafia is there everywhere in the country it is controlled by underworld criminals despite the cancellation of permits required for transporting sand and earth prices of such materials did not drop only the underworld decides on it q why can t a government with law enforcement authorities contain such crimes i did everything possible during my time q you are harshly criticised for giving a presidential pardon for royal park murder convict jude shramantha jayamaha what is the reason for you to take such a decision it is a good question first critics of my decision should look at the lists of prisoners released by successive presidents in the past as for jude shramantha his family members along with mp ven athuraliye ratana thera made constant requests to me they presented their case by saying that he had been in jail for 15 years and completed his degree while being a prisoner after that he had been enrolled for a post graduate course i was requested to give him a pardon on account of such achievements by him as a prisoner i did not pardon a death row prisoner his death sentence had been commuted to life four years ago because of his good conduct in prison it had been done by the prison authorities in that context i have not released a death row prisoner there is a committee at the justice ministry working on pardons for prisoners and their welfare activities the ministry secretary the commissioner general of prison professors of criminology and retired judges are there in it a panel of seven of them made recommendations in this regard besides former mp ven baddegama samitha thera requested it catholic priests and other organizations also did the same i took into account all of them i looked at the international charters on prisoners rights prisoners are human too considering all these aspects i granted him presidential pardon a lot of people have forgotten that i as the president released the ltte member convicted of plotting to assassinate me he had been sentenced to life at that time royal park murder case is a serious offence jude had committed a horrendous crime it is only one aspect yet it is not the duty of the leaders to keep the prisons crowded with inmates i have released the highest number of prisoners it is my policy if there were others having completed their degrees in prison i would have released them too i released as many as 2000 prisoners no other president has done so there is an allegation i received cash inducements in this instance i am not a politician bankrupt to the extent of getting inducements to release prisoners i considered his good conduct educational achievements and ven rathana thera s requests in giving him a pardon q in retrospect how do you look at your performance as the then president i contested the elections in 2015 since i had a vision for my country during my tenure i did a lot for my country whatever anyone might say i strengthened our foreign relations after prime minister the late sirimavo bandaranaike after her i befriended the leaders of the countries both in the east and the west they became my personal friends they are vladimir putin of russia china s xi jinping barack obama of the united states india s narendra modi germany s chancellor angela merkel and so on i did it in the greater interests of my country i wanted to develop my country i did a lot but i could not do a lot more because then prime minister ranil wickremesinghe behaved as if he was the president he forgot that he was only the prime minister there was a clear policy contrast between the two he is a right wing liberalist whereas i am a social democrat it is a conflict of two political ideologies i am opposed to corruption i stood against the central bank bond scam i was against the free trade agreement with singapore but i was a loner i did not have parliament or the cabinet under my control presidency without parliamentary power is like a toothless mouth i did not have either parliament or the cabinet only mr ranil wickremesinghe had control over them so he worked as if he was the president it led to policy clashes therefore i could not perform a lot of tasks which i had in my mind however the ranil faction of the government did a lot of things that should not have been done they learnt a lesson for it at the elections q you are a senior politician with a proper understanding of the unp as a political force of this country when you entered into an electoral understating with the unp didn t you anticipate such a situation the unp s political culture under leaders such as d s senanayake and dudleysenanayake is not something bad it is a political culture that built this country q what about the unp about under late presidents j r jayewardene and r premadasa when i took over presidency i thought i would be able to implement my vision for the country but ranil wickremesinghe stood in my way q there is controversy over the leakage of telephone conversations by unp mp ranjan ramanayake you have also been implicated in these conversations over some litigation was judiciary influenced at that time as revealed by these telephone conversations what ranjan ramanayake has done is unlawful and utterly disgraceful that is what i have to say
iran s missile attack on u s army bases in iraq overnight sent gold blasting above us 1 600 an ounce boosted the japanese yen by almost 1 per cent and oil by us 3 a barrel but it took just hours for that safe haven dash to fade and for world equities to resume their climb it was the second volte face in less than a week after a similar pattern of events after the u s killing of top iranian commander general qassem soleimani on friday and that mirrored a superfast roundtrip on markets after iran backed rebels attacked saudi oil facilities in september welcome to the brave new world where it appears that little short of full fledged world war between nuclear armed powers would be required to have a durable impact on financial markets and even then some begin to wonder by the european close on wednesday brent crude oil prices had returned to below levels seen before gen soleimani s death on friday and wall street s s p500 equity index rallied to new record highs at its most basic level investors appear to believe that tehran and washington will avert a broader conflagration regionally contained military blowups and bursts of conflict have proven in recent years not to have a durable impact on either oil supplies and prices nor global economic activity even september s attacks on saudi oil installations had no lasting effect on crude prices and beyond the gulf years of north korean nuclear tests and missile launches have not yet escalated nor affected international investment patterns for any significant length of time so traders and investors are betting as much on repeated patterns of behaviour rather than on amateur geopolitical reasoning the market has taken a view based on a decade s worth of experience that this is not going to escalate out of control said société générale strategist kit juckes it s the same with the economy we ve had an economic cycle with minicycles since 2008 but no recession we ve had trade wars that haven t really turned into real trade wars but keep getting postponed and investors who stuck with equities and looked past euro debt crises north korean missile tests arab spring revolts trade wars middle east turmoil and unconventional economic policies have reaped rich returns world stocks have added more than us 25 trillion in value since 2010 a geopolitical risk index compiled by u s federal reserve board researchers dario caldara and matteo iacoviello rates the saudi attacks at a relatively high 185 points but well below the 2003 u s invasion of iraq that scored 545 points oil clout for decades the energy price impact has been the main transmission mechanism from major conflicts particularly in the gulf to the wider economy and world markets the threat of oil supply disruption has been a shadow on the global economy ever since a quadrupling of oil prices during the 1973 opec oil embargo and a 30 per cent jump in 1990 but oil spikes these days tend to be briefer that partly reflects the changing nature of energy usage and geographical sources of supplies u s shale oil producers can now step up to offset price spikes stemming from gulf supply disruptions regardless of local politics or action by the organization of petroleum exporting countries while the rise of renewable energy sources amid fears of climate change is happening at a rapid pace paul donovan of ubs wealth says technology developments mean far less oil is needed to produce a dollar of global gross domestic product today mr donovan also highlighted that back in 1973 energy producing countries squirrelled away extra oil earnings as savings causing a net shock to global economic demand as that money drained from oil buyers pockets in 2020 oil sellers spend that money with abandon and so a higher oil price does not mean a big drop or potentially any sort of drop in economic demand learning from the past of course wars and invasions have driven big market shifts in the past causing minipanics and safe asset buying on fears for business confidence trade and energy prices but the experience over recent decades has been that all things equal markets tend to recover quickly and portfolio managers with the stomach to see through short term lurches do well even without expensive hedging a recent schroders report identified the 1990 gulf war the 2001 9 11 attacks on new york and the 2003 iraq invasion as the most monumental geopolitical risk events of the past 30 years in 2003 yields on german government bonds among the world s most trustworthy assets tumbled almost 70 basis points one basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point between march and june they fell a similar amount in 1990 when you look at the last few decades of history whenever a prolonged war is the more likely outcome that s when the rush to government bonds takes place said rabbani wahhab senior portfolio manager at london and capital schroders noted that during periods of extreme risk a portfolio of safe assets comprising bonds and gold usually outperformed riskier equities however it also found that in all these instances shares recovered within months suggesting that if investors are willing or able to ignore volatility then investing in the risky portfolio represents a better strategy than a safe portfolio all change in markets the market context itself has also changed over the decades most prominently by years of near zero interest rates and central bank money printing that have inflated prices of high quality bonds reduced benchmark borrowing costs and cut what s available to investors shares meanwhile have been pumped up by buybacks and abundant private funding that have steadily reduced equity supply over the years with jpmorgan predicting equity supply to decline by a further us 200 billion this year many investors have come to view sell offs as a buying opportunity the demand supply nature of markets has completely changed said salman ahmed chief investment strategist at lombard odier central banks have reduced the supply of safe assets and that s rippled out to risky assets it s a very powerful force

currencies fall back as the dollar rebounds gold soars with the eagles but gets grounded with the turkeys good day and a wonderful wednesday to you my travel day yesterday went along ok until my stomach began to revolt on me ugh but we made it here to s florida to our 2nd home and i ll be here until april i was a happy camper again once we got outside here and it was sunny and 75 i love warm weather well gold soared briefly yesterday as the iranian retaliated for the airstrike on them last week not that i want to see war escalating but this is one of the reasons you own gold so more on that today and talk about what happened to the short lived currency rally so pull up a chair grab a cup of joe and let s go the local st louis band mama s pride greets me this morning with their song blue mist ok first things first the war trigger fingers are getting itchy folks i do not want to see the u s in another war unless of course god forbid we are attacked first but late yesterday news came across that the iranians has retaliated and fired some land to air missiles at a base in iraq that housed american soldiers as i went to bed last night i had not heard of any loss of american lives but one would have to think that to be tenuous bottom line to all this saber rattling is the price of gold has seen some wild and crazy trading at one point yesterday i checked the prices and gold was 1 604 but that didn t last as i m sure the jpmorgan s etal were there to make sure that they threw up a roadblock and gold ended the day up 10 and not the 28 it had briefly touched on as i said above this is one of the reasons why you own gold geopolitical problems i said on monday this week that i thought this saber rattling would continue and that it would keep the bid constant and rising for the price of gold and silver was not chopped liver these past few days too and closed yesterday at 18 35 after venturing higher on the day to 18 55 so the price manipulators are attempting to stop a runaway train i have this feeling they re going to be run over but then that s just me there was an article monday about how gold was overbought and i thought well that may be but the figures they were using were based on a belief by them that mom and pops here in the u s are all in on gold buying when the actual truth is that many don t even know that gold exists as an investment option the gata folks think that 95 of the number is incorrect and i would agree and while the precious metals moved down the rally tracks at a steady speed the currencies gave back their gains from last week the plunge protection team ppt had to choose their battles and they chose to battle the falling dollar the euro which was 1 1205 on monday morning has seen its recent mini rally falter and when the big dog falters the rest of the currencies the little dogs can t get out of their own way the price of oil slipped a little yesterday which didn t do the petrol currencies any favors as they were waiting for either the euro to gain or the price of oil to gain and since neither happened the petrol currencies that include rubles krone real loonies pesos and others got sold on the day ugh in the u s data cupboard on monday was the markit ism manufacturing index the markit folks say there s nothing contracting in manufacturing but the ism did say that not only was the manufacturing sector contracting it had contracted more than the previous month where s the disconnect here i mean do the markit people now get their numbers from the bls ha because the bls sure knows how to massage the numbers each month so more and more sheeple go to market and buy stocks don t they and now the markit report on manufacturing says everything is hunky dory and the real ism report says not so fast their markit boys so anyway the thing is simply that one s telling the truth and other is telling the not so truth and i ll bet a shiny quarter that you know which one is which in my book yesterday in the data cupboard we saw november factory orders which placed the odds of a good 4th qtr gdp here in the u s very low as factory orders were negative 0 7 along with the negative print in durable good orders and the baltic dry index and cass freight indexes both dropping like rocks from a cliff the picture that s being painted for 4th qtr gdp is not a pretty one folks i m just saying the data cupboard today has the adp jobs report for december the adp report forecast is for only 67 000 jobs to have been created in december last month we had a low number on the adp report only to see the bls blow that out of the water two days later so i guess i ll have to wait n see what the bls has up its sleeve on friday eh before i head to the big finish today i want to talk a bit about the russian economy i read last week that they had a bumper crop in 2019 their year end is in july and that they are fully expecting a repeat if not a better than 2019 for 2020 the economic sanctions continue to hold a grip on the russian economy folks but so far they are doing everything possible to ignore them and move ahead i know and realize that i spend a lot of time and words talking about russia and ruble but longtime readers know that there are times when countries go front and center and need to be talked about in the early 2000 s it was the euro then the aussie and kiwi dollars and then the dollar and now it s rubles the ruble is so weak compared to where it was before the conflict with ukraine began and that s another reason i think it needs to be looked at for shouldn t it return to its previous level i believe so and so to recap i know shorter than usual today just getting my bearings adjusted that s all ok well all the euphoria in the currencies and metals have been brought back to earth as the saber rattling notched higher yesterday and then faded the markit and ism reports on manufacturing seem to have a disconnect are the markit folks getting their numbers from the bls ha gold soared with the eagles for a while yesterday but ended the day grounded with the turkeys ugh oh well can t move too fast upward or there will be a correction or here s your snippet resident donald trump s tariffs were supposed to make american factories great again instead a new federal reserve study says they ve harmed american manufacturing destroyed jobs and raised prices for consumers moreover the damage won t be undone by the president s phase one trade deal with china the 25 tariffs he imposed in 2018 on a wide range of components and other manufacturing inputs will remain in place aaron flaaen and justin pierce say their study provides the first comprehensive look at how the tariffs affect u s manufacturers that s important because tariff advocates sometimes argue that any pain caused to consumers financial markets or even the economy as a whole is necessary to maintain a robust manufacturing sector trouble is the tariffs clearly are hurting the sector they were supposed to help chuck again well here s one that i ll slap myself on the back for you see when the tariffs were first talked about i told you dear reader that the economy would suffer i m just saying i can hear you now yeah chuck even a blind squirrel can find an acorn ha currencies today 1 8 20 american style a 6870 kiwi 6647 c 7686 euro 1 1130 sterling 1 3107 swiss 1 0290

regularly scheduled programming next week i heading south this morning for a breakfast meeting with my good friend rick who s down here for a conference the last time i met someone for breakfast while down here was a couple of years ago when i met my former marketing person suzanne for breakfast back then i was having problems with the tumor in my mouth and during breakfast i began to bleed and so i rushed off to the bathroom where i stayed for the next 1 2 hour attempting to get it stopped poor suzanne well that was a bad memory but no more robert plant takes us to the finish line today with

tensions between the us and iran as well as allies on either side of this equation have heightened with concerns about the shape and form of the violent retribution promised by tehran for the assassination of major general qassem soleimani the popular leader of iran s quds force of the islamic republican guard corps the middle east is wracked by conflict while iran s revenge for the donald trump approved killings could easily be played out elsewhere south africa seems far from the baghdad airport where us drones took out soleimani and his associates designated as terrorists for their alleged roles in killing us military personnel and destabilising the region as the world rung in 2020 but the fall out from the us iran stand off is likely to contaminate the global economy with worrying implications for south african efforts to boost growth econometrix chief economist dr azar jammine examines possible scenarios and what might be in store for the country jackie cameron by azar jammine key points the implications for the south african economy of the latest stand off between the united states and iran following the us assassination of iranian army general qassem soleimani is unclear in part this is because it is difficult to determine what the repercussions of this event will be on the global economy theoretically if this leads to a surge in international oil prices this could have negative implications for global economic activity and through this for the demand for south africa s raw materials on the other hand increased tensions have been causing precious metals prices to rise helping to neutralise the negative impact of the increased cost of oil imports domestically the uncertainty surrounding the implications of the latest global tensions is manifested in the volatility of the rand and precious metals prices in the last few days there is clearly still significant support for financial markets and risk appetite for higher yielding emerging market assets and their currencies seems to be continuing however given the uncertainty surrounding which way the latest stand off will pan out it is fair to suggest that it could lead to significant volatility in financial markets and the rand in coming months the latter may still not be ready to depreciate immediately but there is a meaningful risk of a significant sell off in the rand in coming months in the event of global risk appetite souring the latest stand off between us and iran does have the potential to escalate the implications of the latest stand off between the us and iran following the elimination by the us of iranian army general qassem soleimani and some of his team is unclear the conventional view of likely repercussions is that iran will retaliate in some fashion and the us will respond by attacking key iranian installations this does have the potential to escalate into a more serious conflict bearing in mind that iran has now said that it is pulling back from respecting a deal reached two years ago between itself and western powers to cease development of nuclear research and potential development of nuclear weapons iran is the major shia muslim power in the middle east whereas its principal foe namely saudi arabia is the leading sunni muslim power and is supported by the united states on the other hand iran tends to be supported by russia and has cited israel as its principal enemy the principal concern about the economic implications of the latest stand off is that it is seen as threatening to cause international oil prices to surge which could have a dampening effect on global economic activity iran has the potential to produce up to 3 5m barrels of oil per day equivalent to 3 5 of global demand and around 12 of opec supply worse still to the extent that it could threaten to close the straits of hormuz through which oil traffic from the gulf region travels it could disrupt up to 20 of global oil traffic impact on south africa s economy likely to be indirect south africa s direct trade relations with iran are nowadays fairly limited the country used to be a key source of oil supplies to south africa but following the decision four years ago by the us to impose sanctions on any country dealing with iran south africa ceased purchasing its oil from iran and switched to other sources such as nigeria which has become the country s fifth largest source of imports it is therefore more in indirect ways that the repercussions of the latest tensions could reverberate onto the south african economy if global economic activity is negatively implications for sa economy of stand off between the us and iran indirect and not clear cut makes for a scenario of volatility affected this can result in the demand for commodities declining to the extent that south africa depends for more than half of its exports on commodities a decline in commodity prices especially of minerals would have a negative impact on south africa s balance of trade especially considering the fact that the one commodity whose price could escalate is that of oil which is also the one commodity which south africa imports in large quantities however the situation is complicated by the fact that precious metals prices could benefit from these events by virtue of precious metals being seen as a safe haven at times of turmoil in the past few days this has become abundantly clear with the surge in the price of gold to its highest level in seven years and a rise in the price of palladium to record levels with platinum following a similar upward trend nonetheless even here the outlook is clouded by the fact that if the ultimate impact of an escalation of conflict in the region leads to lower global economic growth the industrial demand for precious metals could fall off to such an extent as to outweigh the increase in demand for investment purposes thus far since the us attack on the iranian convoy the benefit potentially for the value of precious metals exports derived from higher precious metals prices has exceeded the increased cost of oil imports south africa s precious metals exports as a whole amount to around 40 of south africa s exports whereas oil accounts for 30 of imports impact on the rand also fairly volatile it was also fairly interesting to note last week how the rand dollar exchange rate which had appreciated to its best level in five months suddenly lost 2 1 2 of its value in next to no time following the us attack this was because of heightened risk aversion associated with increased uncertainty regarding the implications of the global conflict immediately investors who had bought into risky emerging market assets such as south african government bonds felt compelled to sell out of some of these assets and to move into the safety of the dollar and gold however one notes that the rand has regained around half of its losses in the past day or two as the tensions surrounding the recent events have subsided somewhat it is of course early days and the uncertainty surrounding the final outcome remains the only conclusion that one can draw fairly definitively is that one is likely to see bouts of significant volatility in financial markets including the rand and the price of gold in coming months in the wake of statements made and actions taken by parties involved in the dispute with regard to how they intend dealing with each other essentially it creates a new source of uncertainty in the world economy just at the time when some of the uncertainty surrounding international trade relations especially between the us and china seems to be dampening somewhat in expectation of the signing of a trade deal between the world s superpowers on 15th january there still appears to be a proclivity towards a positive mood for global financial markets driven by the abundance of liquidity being created by leading central banks to ward off any slowdown in global economic activity more recently china reduced the bank reserve requirements in the country to encourage banks to lend out money more easily new dynamic in oil market is us shale oil it is also worth mentioning that there is a significant new dynamic in the international oil market at present which did not exist during previous oil crises this is the rise in the importance of the us shale oil industry this has ironically generated an era of stability in oil price expectations from a longer term point of view it has been shown that as soon as oil prices rise rapidly the us shale oil industry which is able to ramp up and down oil production from its facilities much more rapidly than is the case with traditional crude oil production tends to be increased to such an extent as to limit the potential rise in oil prices even so it is also worth remembering that the price of brent crude has risen by 20 in the past three months in dollar terms whereas the rand has risen over this period by no more than 7 this means that the underlying rent price of crude oil has indeed been in an upward trend in recent months and there is no evidence yet of that trend being reversed all we are suggesting is that it would be misleading to be dogmatic about the likelihood that oil prices might double or treble in the manner that they have done in previous oil crises equity markets have

unifirst corp nyse unf q1 2020 earnings call 9 00 a m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks operator greetings and welcome to the first quarter earnings call afterwards we will conduct a question and answer session i would now like to turn the conference over to mr steven sintros unifirst s president and chief executive officer please go ahead sir steven s sintros president and chief executive officer thank you and good morning i m steven sintros unifirst s president and chief executive officer joining me today is shane o connor senior vice president and chief financial officer we d like to welcome you to unifirst corporation s conference call to review our first quarter results for fiscal year 2020 and to discuss our expectations going forward this call will be on a listen only mode until we complete our prepared remarks but first a brief disclaimer this conference call may contain forward looking statements that reflect the company s current views with respect to future events and financial performance these forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties the words anticipate optimistic believe estimate expect intend and similar expressions that indicate future events and trends identify forward looking statements actual future results may differ materially from those anticipated depending on a variety of risk factors for more information please refer to the discussion of these risk factors in our most recent 10 k filing with the securities and exchange commission i m happy to report that unifirst s first quarter of fiscal year 2020 produced solid results for the company relative to both our top and bottom line shane will go into the details shortly but i wanted to first take a moment to step back and recap the quarter s results for the first quarter of 2020 unifirst set record highs for both revenues and profits consolidated first quarter revenues were 465 4 million an increase of 6 1 over the same quarter a year ago meanwhile operating income and net income were 60 1 million and 48 2 million respectively representing increases of 19 2 and 25 9 when compared to the first quarter of last year as always i d like to acknowledge that we do not achieve our company s successes alone that said i want to take this opportunity to thank those who are so critical to unifirst day to day accomplishments our 14 000 plus employee team partners throughout north and central america and in europe who work so hard week in and week out to take care of our customers each other and our company our strong first quarter results were primarily influenced by our core laundry operations which make up approximately 90 of our overall revenues and operating income with respect to the primary growth drivers of this segment the quarterly results were largely positive but there were some areas of caution to be noted as we look over the remainder of the year during the first quarter new account sales exceeded the strong first quarter sales we achieved in fiscal year 2019 however december activity combined with future sales projections have our second quarter new sales expectation softening when compared to the first quarter in prior year s activities in addition our additions versus reductions metric which measures wearer levels within existing accounts trended negatively compared to the prior year both of these trends are partially due to reduced business activity in the energy dependent markets that we service we ve used this term energy dependent markets in the past to describe those geographies in the united states and canada that have a significant portion of their economic activities tied to the oil and gas industries of course as always an ever changing macroeconomic environment makes it difficult to predict exactly how long and to what extent this trend may persist in addition overall customer retention slipped some in the first quarter partially related to select large accounts where we made the economic decision not to renew our service agreements we expect these developments to make more difficult top line comparisons for the remainder of the year when comparing to what was a strong fiscal year performance in 2019 for new account sales and customer retention in the meantime we ll continue to focus on executing on our strategic plan which includes defined goals for improving customer service and retention sales organization effectiveness and retention of our employee team partners as far as our other business segments go specialty garments which provide specialized work wear and niche services for nuclear and clean room industries and our first date and safety division both contributed positively to our overall results of the first quarter looking forward we remain committed to maximizing our results and delivering long term value to our shareholders and our team partners we ll achieve these ends with a continued focus on strengthening customer loyalties and growing our base through excellence in personalized business services and continued investments in our service production and sales teams our customer focus philosophy remains at the core of our company s success today our strong balance sheet healthy cash position and ongoing cash flows allow us to continue making solid investments and all principal areas of our business as well as to be competitively pursue business acquisitions that make business sense all helping us to meet our primary long term corporate objective to be universally recognized as the best service provider in our industry and with that i d like to turn the call back over to shane who ll provide the details of our results for the first quarter and our outlook over the remainder of fiscal year 2020 shane o connor senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks steve as steve summarized in our first quarter of 2020 consolidated revenues were 465 4 million up 6 1 from 438 6 million a year ago and consolidated operating income increased to 60 1 million from 50 4 million or 19 2 net income for the quarter increased to 48 2 million or 2 52 per diluted share from 38 3 million or 1 99 per diluted share our core laundry operations revenues for the quarter were 416 3 million up 6 6 from the first quarter of 2019 core laundry organic growth which adjust for the estimated effect of acquisitions as well as fluctuations in the canadian dollar was 6 during the quarter our organic growth continued to benefit from the solid new account sales and improved customer retention in fiscal 2019 as well as the improved collection of merchandise recovery charges in addition our core laundry revenues in the quarter benefited by approximately 0 7 from the impact of certain revenue adjustments related to our credit reserves as well as the timing of revenues around the thanksgiving holiday both of these timing items resulted in a benefit to our first quarter revenues but are expected to have very little impact on our performance for the full fiscal year core laundry and operating income was 53 8 million for the quarter up from 44 8 million in the prior year and the segment s operating margin increased to 12 9 compared to 11 5 in prior year this increase was primarily due to lower energy selling payroll and depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenues as well as the impact of the revenue adjustments i discussed earlier in addition several other costs trended favorably as a percentage of revenues due to the strong revenue growth in the quarter these benefits were partially offset by an unfavorable comparison with prior year due to a 3 million pre tax gain from the settlement of environmental litigation recognized in the first quarter of 2019 which equated to 0 11 per diluted share energy costs decreased to 3 9 of revenues in the first quarter of 2020 down from 4 2 a year ago revenues from our specialty garment segment which deliver specialized nuclear decontamination and cleanroom products and services decreased by 3 to 33 4 million in the first quarter this decrease was primarily due to decreased outage activity in the us and canadian nuclear operations which was partially offset by strong growth in our cleanroom operations this segment s operating margin increased to 14 6 from 4 9 million or 4 9 million from 13 or 4 5 million in the year ago period this increase was primarily due to lower merchandise and production payroll cost as a percentage of revenues which were partially offset by higher casualty claims expense as we ve mentioned in the past this segment s results can vary significantly from period to period due to seasonality and the timing of new nuclear reactor outages and projects that require our specialized services our first aid segments revenues increased by 15 2 to 15 7 million and it s operating income increased by 19 9 to 1 4 million these increases were primarily due to a strong quarterly performance in the segment s wholesale distribution business as well as the company s initiative to expand its first aid band business into new geographies we continue to maintain a solid balance sheet and financial position with no long term debt and cash cash equivalents and short term investments totaling 356 6 million at the end of our first quarter of fiscal 2020 cash provided by operating activities for the first three months of the year was 52 4 million an increase of 20 2 million from the first three months of fiscal 2019 this increase was primarily due to our strong operating performance in the quarter as well as lower working capital needs of the business in addition the quarterly comparison benefited from the payout of a 7 2 million one time bonus to our employees in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 for the first three months of fiscal 2020 capital expenditures totaled 29 0 million as we continue to invest in our future with new facility additions expansions updates and automation systems that will help us meet our long term strategic objectives during the quarter we capitalized 3 4 million related to our ongoing crm project which consisted of license fees third party consulting costs and capitalized internal labor costs as of the end of our first fiscal quarter we had capitalized a total of 14 1 million related to the crm project at this time we still anticipate that sometime in the second half of this fiscal year we will be begin piloting at several test locations and that we do not expect to incur any depreciation expense related to this project in fiscal 2020 we continue to look for and aggressively pursue additional targets as acquisitions remain an integral part of our overall growth strategy as we mentioned in our october webcast in september 2019 we completed an acquisition in kansas city missouri which significantly increases our presence in that market and is anticipated to contribute approximately 12 5 million in additional revenue to fiscal 2020 during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 we repurchased 50 600 common shares for a total of 10 million under our previously announced stock repurchase program as of november 30th 2020 the company had repurchased a total of 247 750 common shares at an average price of 163 43 for 40 5 million under the program i d like to take this opportunity to provide an update on our outlook for fiscal 2020 we now expect that our fiscal 2020 revenues will be between 1 860 billion and 1 872 billion this guidance has more modest expectations at the high end of the range than previously communicated due to the trends that steve discussed previously and the related impact on our expectations for the remainder of the year we now also expect our full year diluted earnings per share will be between 7 60 and 7 92 this revised eps guidance continues to assume an operating margin at the midpoint of the range of 10 3 however our forecast now includes our revised revenue expectations slightly improved assumptions for interest income as well as a lower tax rate for the year of 24 5 as a reminder our guidance for fiscal 2020 includes one less week of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter compared to fiscal 2019 due to the timing of our fiscal calendar and assumes our current level of outstanding common shares this concludes our prepared remarks and we would now be happy to answer any questions that you might have questions and answers operator thank you our first question comes from the line of andrew steinerman with j p morgan you may proceed with your question andrew steinerman j p morgan analyst hi could you jump a little bit more into the assumptions around the energy end market and so i definitely understand you re saying it s a more challenging environment for energy companies could you be a little more specific if it is like tied to number of rigs and is there any assumption made by the fact that as you well know oil price is very recently have actually have picked up steven s sintros president and chief executive officer sure andrew what we re seeing in terms of some of it is rig counts some of it is simply and you ve read the articles in the paper like i have these companies have a lot of debt coming due and they re trying to trim their operations to where they can take advantage of some of those higher prices to pay down debt and we re seeing it in management of the heads within some of those companies and so over the last couple of years after the big dip in energy activity and say 2016 we had seen some strong recovery in west texas primarily but now we re seeing softness in really all the energy markets in terms of reducing heads and we don t want to overstate the impact of it you know as you saw we trim the top end of our range and some of that really is in some of those markets last year at this time we were positive in add reductions in this year in some of those markets were negative and so we re seeing some of that activity right the recent developments around potentially spiking oil prices may or may not change that but we really haven t had enough time to see what the impact of that might be whether they will take that additional profit and pay down debt or start reinvesting again is probably going to play out over several months andrew steinerman j p morgan analyst and could you just remind us what your exposure is to the energy end market steven s sintros president and chief executive officer so we ve talked about over time that oil and gas exploration you know depending on what year you were talking about was anywhere from 5 to 10 of our business but really that s not as much the relevant number as the overall geographic exposure that we have to markets that you know are dependent on oil and gas activity in all the support businesses as well i wouldn t say we re seeing at this point that depth of an impact down to all the support businesses but we re seeing the early stages of slowdowns andrew steinerman j p morgan analyst okay thank you operator our next question comes from the line of andrew wittmann with baird you may proceed with your question andrew wittmann r w baird analyst hey great i just wanted to dig a little bit more into that last question from andrew and just ask have you lost specific contracts with these customers or steve is this really just a reflection of where levels add stops that you re seeing steven s sintros president and chief executive officer yes i would say andy that it s a little bit of all of the above but when you look at our growth drivers and you say new account sales adds reductions and lost accounts and again i think i made the comment to say that they were partially due to the oil and gas we ve seen impact in all when we look at new account activity year over year this time this year versus last year there were more energy accounts being sold last year at this time certainly i just mentioned the adds reduction metric i wouldn t say as much of it is in the lost account number although there is some we are seeing some smaller smaller customers failing andrew wittmann r w baird analyst got it i mean i guess when i do the math here i kind of it looks like you re somewhere implying for the rest of the year somewhere in the high around 2 to 2 5 total growth in your organic outlook if energy is 5 to 10 call it 7 i mean from the current rates of underlying organic growth you d have to see that business get cut in half so it sounds like it feels like there is more there and you did mention that you lost one large or maybe several large accounts are non economic basis so i guess can you talk more broadly beyond the energy paths which you re seeing and specifically on the large account if you could help us understand the size of that so that can help us understand the deceleration implied in your revenue guidance steven s sintros president and chief executive officer so i think taking a step back i think the revenue guidance we have at the beginning of the year that assumed organic growth for the year of around 4 we re basically saying that we re coming off that a little bit for the trends we re seeing but we were always assuming some deceleration of organic growth partially due to the tougher comps in a number of areas partially related to the strong account sales in 19 but also the higher merchandise recovery charges so we always sort of had the model assuming some deceleration of organic growth that put us at about that 4 mark for the year now over the remainder of the year right now our numbers are a little closer to about 3 organic which obviously assume some deceleration there is a number of pieces impacting that the slowdown in energy is a piece on the adds reduction side i talked about on the lost account side last year we had as good of a retention years we ve really had over the last decade through the first quarter we re taking a little higher than that for sure part of it being some of you know a couple of these accounts that we made the decision to move away from yes i hate to get into too much of the details but those probably make up a few million dollars of revenue so it s another item around the edges but as we always talk about our different growth drivers it s an area you know we felt worth mentioning that retention had slipped some on the new sales side i will say that i made the comment that activity had slowed some in december and through the holidays and that s having our outlook for q2 new sales being a little soft last year at this time we really blew through the holidays with very strong activity on the new account side which really helped fuel a full year new sales result that was by far a record of new account sales and we re seeing a little bit of slowing right now again i made the comment partially due to energy but probably not fully due to energy so the combination of some of those factors combined with the originally built in assumption that there was going to be some tougher year over year comps as the year went along is kind of getting us to the results in the guidance that we re putting forth at this point andrew wittmann r w baird analyst that s great context thank you i think it s probably also worth noting here that your margins were really quite good and i wanted to dig into that a little bit here as well i mean you did mention that there is 0 7 of the growth rate was from this accounting item of a release and some other stuff there as well timing i mean even if are we to assume that even if we re going to take that 0 7 or about 3 million i mean that basically does that come through is like basically pure profit and even if it does i mean your margins are still up a lot is that the right way to think about what you re calling out there in that 0 7 shane o connor senior vice president and chief financial officer yes this is shane yes that 0 7 a fair amount of that drops to our operating margin line when you take a look at the operating margin impact of those those equate to about 50 basis points on our margin so clearly the lion s share of that is translating into profit because there s no costs associated with some of those reserve adjustments andrew wittmann r w baird analyst okay and then my last question for now it s just i ve never heard the timing of thanksgiving being a factor in organic growth and so i was just wondering the mechanics behind that why is that the case here steven s sintros president and chief executive officer yes i figured that would probably be a question so again this sort of relates to our fiscal calendar and actually where thanksgiving falls this year in the actual calendar so at the end of our first quarter thanksgiving is always the last two days of our quarter and in some cases we re not able to run the routes related to those two days and we have to run those routes some of those routes we ve run before the holiday some of them we run subsequent to the quarter in the subsequent week which falls into our second quarter historically we ve always deferred the revenue related to those routes because we say that the delivery is important enough for revenue recognition because thanksgiving is a week later this year and it s actually closer to christmas we ran more of those routes before the holiday which results in that revenue being recognized in the first quarter where normally it would be deferred into the second quarter so again that s a timing item where the revenue got recognized in our first quarter normally it would be in the second quarter so it will actually be a headwind to the comparison in the second quarter because not as much as deferred there andrew wittmann r w baird analyst thank you very much operator our next question comes from the line of tim mulrooney with blair with william blair you may proceed with your question timothy mulrooney william blair analyst good morning steven s sintros president and chief executive officer good morning shane o connor senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning timothy mulrooney william blair analyst i had a couple of questions here so on the margin side for your core laundry business correct me if i m wrong but i think you were calling for an operating margin of 10 3 at the midpoint for the full year is that correct shane o connor senior vice president and chief financial officer that s correct timothy mulrooney william blair analyst okay but with the first quarter being so strong here i think actually up like 140 basis points year over year do you have updated expectations for that segment or are you still expecting 10 3 midpoint for the full year shane o connor senior vice president and chief financial officer yes i had mentioned that in some of my prepared remarks that the expectations for the remainder or for the full year still have the midpoint being 10 3 and the first quarter it was a very strong profit quarter for us but it often times is first quarter is usually very strong some of the cost escalations that we see just seasonally are in the second half of the year and i guess i ll take the opportunity to speak to a couple of those first and foremost would be we have set annual salary increases that take place in january obviously with payrolls being the lion s share of our costs our first fiscal quarter is benefiting from a lot of the revenue growth during the year but those salary increases don t hit until those last three quarters our second quarter has certain seasonal cost that caused it to almost always be down from an operating margin perspective and i think historically we ve talked about some of these things they are normal in operating but the unemployed or the resetting of unemployment taxes we have a disproportionate amount of real estate taxes that actually get expensed during that quarter and we also have a large payout of unused sick time that takes place in that some of the other things that are resulting and the margin being reduced in those last three quarters are we have mentioned the fact that we were forecasting in some additional costs related to our crm project and we expect those to be heavier in the final quarters as we move toward pilot and eventually we start to ramp up for deployment and then of course there s going to be an impact related to the modest revenue growth in the second half the more modest revenue growth in the second half of the year i guess the last item timothy mulrooney william blair analyst okay shane o connor senior vice president and chief financial officer the last item i ll talk about just because coming into the year we had commented on the fact that we had some expectations around healthcare costs starting at the beginning of our fiscal year we actually redid all our healthcare plans to our employees so our employees were introduced to those new plans and right now we have one quarter s worth of experience related to those new plan but there does remain a significant amount of uncertainty around it i guess the claims experience related to those plan and the second half of our year is also maintaining caution as it relates to the costs that are going to be associated with those timothy mulrooney william blair analyst got it okay shane yes thanks for all that extra color that s really helpful maybe one or two more from me so i mean sticking on your guidance you pulled up the low end of your eps guidance range for the full year i think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that was primarily due to a lower tax rate and maybe a more favorable interest expense than you were initially anticipating does that make up the majority of why you re pulling that up shane o connor senior vice president and chief financial officer it does it does timothy mulrooney william blair analyst okay and lastly from me could you just comment on the pricing environment is it still pretty favorable and could you also comment on your merchandise recovery charges are you still seeing a benefit there was that more of a 2019 phenomenon thank you steven s sintros president and chief executive officer sure i think the price environment is relatively stable i think it s i ve made the comment before that you know there is still a fair amount of aggressiveness in our industry in terms of new accounts in the sales process with respect to merchandise recovery charges the first quarter we still pretty strong the growth in that area was higher than the organic growth was overall so it was a contributor and i think we re starting to get to the point where we re annualizing some increases there that also leads to the caution of the second half of the year or the last nine months in terms of tougher comps timothy mulrooney william blair analyst understood thank you gentlemen shane o connor senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator there are no further questions at this time i will now turn the call back to you steven s sintros president and chief executive officer okay i d like to thank everyone for joining us today to review our first quarter results for fiscal year 2020 we look forward to speaking with everyone again in march when we expect to be reporting our second quarter and mid year performances for the year as well as our expectations for the remainder of fiscal 2020 thank you and have a great day operator ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the conference call for today we thank you for your participation

who was theodore w schultz theodore w schultz who went by the name ted schultz was born on april 30 1902 and died on feb 26 1998 he was an american nobel prize recipient an economist and the chair of economics at the university of chicago he is most famous for developing the human capital theory of economic recovery from disaster key takeaways theodore schultz was an agricultural economist and the chair of the department of economics at the university of chicago schultz made significant contributions to the economics of rural and agricultural development and the theory of human capital he was awarded the nobel prize in economics in 1991 life and career theodore w schultz was born on a farm in south dakota he attended school until the eighth grade when he left to work on his family s farm due to labor shortages during world war i later motivated by the persistent financial troubles he saw around him in the agricultural sector schultz would enroll in a special farm oriented agricultural and economic studies program at south dakota state he finally earned a degree in agriculture and economics in 1928 at the age of 26 two years later in 1930 he married esther werth who was the editor of all of schultz s works until her death in 1991 schultz was a professor at iowa state university from 1930 to 1943 in 1943 a controversy about oleomargarine erupted with the question of whose interests economic policies should serve consumers or producers after the school suppressed research favorable toward oleomargarine under pressure from dairy producers schultz left his position at the university schultz went to the university of chicago where he would serve the remainder of his career when he wasn t traveling internationally for research he was made chair of the economics department in 1946 and served in that capacity until 1961 he attracted his friend and former student david gale johnson to chicago and together the pair made substantial contributions to doctrinal ideological and analytical economics which attracted the support of several wealthy donors and charitable foundations most notably the rockefeller foundation he became the president of the american economic association in 1960 in 1979 he was awarded the nobel prize for economics for his research on the role of human capital in economic development contributions throughout his career schultz made a number of contributions to the advancement of economic science these include his work on the agricultural economics of poor and developing nations and his human capital theory of economic development in the course of his research schultz actually traveled to numerous nations to meet with local farmers village leaders and workers agriculture in developing countries schultz extended his early applied work in agricultural economics to a global focus on the development of agricultural regions in relatively poor countries he argued that economic stagnation across poor rural agricultural areas was largely due to government policies that favored richer urban areas over the interests of agriculture policies that restrain food and agricultural commodity prices disproportionate taxation of crops and agricultural land and the failure of many governments to support research and extension services all suppress rural entrepreneurship and reduce the incentive and ability of farmers to engage in innovation and investment in agriculture according to schultz human capital and economic recovery schultz noted the remarkable speed with which the post war economies of japan and west germany rebounded from the complete devastation resulting from world war ii especially in comparison to the relatively intact economic infrastructure of the united kingdom which suffered a severe economic depression for several years after the war schultz determined that foreign aid from the marshall plan was actually damaging local economies in europe because while aid was distributed for free local economies were distorted and smothered because free and subsidized aid suppressed prices leaving local farmers unable to compete schultz concluded that the root cause of germany s and japan s success was the healthy and educated populations of the two nations a conclusion which eventually became the basis of human capital theory this led him to emphasize the quality of the population as a key factor in economic growth and development over the quality or quantity of land or other natural resource endowments this led to a major shift in the funding of education and health promotion programs by international institutions such as the international monetary fund and the world bank

putin s stagnant year economic headwinds challenge kremlin ambitions in 2020 and beyond by mike eckel january 07 2020 for 45 years ivan shadryn has waited for the bridge over siberia s mighty lena river to be built in the winter it s not so bad subarctic temperatures freeze the lena enabling long haul truckers like shadryn to drive across the ice making the journey to bring say construction goods from his native city of yakutsk to the pacific port of magadan 2 000 kilometers to the east easier in the summer the river crossing is worse it takes up to two hours to cross by ferry and cargo truck traffic in and out of yakutsk the largest city in russia s far north slows dramatically and the shoulder seasons of late spring and early winter mean there is no cross river truck traffic at all for about 150 days of the year president vladimir putin has now given a green light to the 83 billion ruble 1 3 billion plan to finally build the lena river bridge it is scheduled to be completed in 2025 according to the business daily kommersant no question it ll make everything easier shadryn who retired from driving last year told rfe rl not just for truckers it ll make life easier for everyone in yakutsk the city has changed a lot already but this will be something entirely new if yakutsk is hoping the new bridge will change the city the kremlin is hoping a series of similarly ambitious plans labeled national projects will transform the economy once and for all from resource dependent and hydrocarbon fueled to technology driven and powered by the country s vast and underutilized scientific and academic potential whether that can really happen is an open question the six year 400 billion national projects effort which targets areas including education health care science roads and infrastructure comes at a time when a growing number of economists and researchers have been sounding the alarm saying that russia s economy is in danger of slipping into stagnation some warn that the way the national projects are being implemented may only exacerbate the problem there s all this talk about national projects being needed to facilitate growth said laura solanko a specialist on the russian economy at the bank of finland s institute for economies in transition but the main problem is that private firms are not investing because they have little to gain she suggested the growth isn t lack of public spending solanko said the real constraining factor is the overall business climate in russia who are they supposed to help what are they supposed to achieve jakub kluge a senior researcher at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin said of the national projects they are trying to motivate the bureaucracy to set some clear goals but it will not be much help the general trends underlying russia s economic development point to economic stagnation with significant risks to the downside he said economic paradox one of the paradoxes of russia s economic situation analysts say is that fiscally the government is one of the strongest in the world budget surplus huge reserves conservative budgeting targets in 2019 russia for the first time succeeded in having its public debt fully covered by public savings something that no other emerging economy has managed to do at a meeting november 12 in brazil putin touted his government s economic policies highlighting what he called a responsible approach to public finances maintaining the stability of the banking and credit markets and striving to help strengthen key sectors of the economy of course we do not believe that the current gdp growth rate is sufficient so we are trying to create the most supportive conditions for new investments he said yet the economy continues to grind along at a subpar pace and average russians are increasingly the ones suffering disposable incomes are falling when adjusted for inflation the average amount of money russians bring home is less than it was in 2014 the year that western countries punished moscow with sanctions for its seizure of ukraine s crimean peninsula in the first half of 2019 the world bank found real disposable incomes fell by 1 3 percent from the previous year public opinion surveys from the independent polling agency levada center show that around 65 percent of russian households have no savings whatsoever bankruptcies are on the rise with a 50 percent increase in russians filing for bankruptcy between 2016 and 2018 according to government statistics and they were on track to be still higher in 2019 state statistics also show that overall poverty has increased from the beginning of 2018 rising to 14 3 percent or about 20 3 million people after growing by 2 3 percent in 2018 the economy looked set to grow by 1 percent in 2019 the world bank forecast well below the targets the kremlin and government officials have set add to this the fact that pensions have been effectively cut for coming years as the government raised the age when russians can start receiving the pensions a highly controversial step that was met with widespread protests and taxes were hiked with a 2 percentage point increase in the national value added tax vat that officials project will generate revenue 600 billion rubles 9 4 billion to pay for the national projects the national projects were announced in 2018 and launched in 2019 more than a year in figures from the audit chamber showed that less than one third of the funds allocated for them in 2019 had been used as of the end of june that has perplexed analysts and frustrated government planners said ivan tkachyov the economics editor at the russian business newspaper rbk the government faces such chronic problems as poor management tons of paperwork and bureaucracy and the additional layer of multiple clearances and approvals when you allocate money from the federal budget to the regions tkachyov told rfe rl but for the sake of objectivity a positive aspect is that instead of dropping money from a helicopter like they used to do the finance ministry is taking it very seriously and now frees up money only when it s 100 percent sure it will be spent efficiently still corruption remains entrenched and is getting worse according to some polls and analysts warn that massive infrastructure projects are ripe for contractors to skim off budget funds the vostochny cosmodrome a space launch facility whose construction has been hampered by large cost overruns long delays and rampant graft is exhibit a for anti corruption crusaders like opposition gadfly aleksei navalny a failed project that is still being built years after its deadline has passed with a budget that has doubled during which billions were stolen of course it should be named after vladimir putin navalny said in a mocking video released november 21 a handful of launches have been conducted but the facility is still under construction at an already astronomical cost of 7 65 billion and rising looking for growth in the wrong places the kremlin has discussed proposals for ambitious potentially economy transforming projects since early in putin s presidency in the 2000s but it was only in 2018 that the national projects finally took shape the economic development ministry has estimated that investments related to the national projects will result in an 85 percent increase in the rate of growth over six years but the problem with the slow start in spending is the danger that the projects could become a drag on the economy instead of a boon to it according to an analysis released by oxford economics in october the national projects are no breakthrough for russia s growth model as long as institutions continue to constrain productivity and the working age population declines russia is still looking for growth in the wrong places wrote yevgenia sleptsova who led the research that conclusion was echoed in part by the state owned bank vtb in a report released on november 20 which found that most of the national projects were not on target to meet their goals ambitions part of the issue is the question of ambition solanko said the kremlin aspires to put russia on par economically with the united states germany france and other members of the group of seven industrialized nations that requires at least 3 percent annual growth russia wants to be a high income country so stagnation is certainly not a choice at all she said in that sense stagnation is a disappointment it would be a disappointment anywhere but it is certainly for a country that aspires to be a high income country georgy bovt a russian political scientist and kremlin critic argued that government efforts to boost gdp through massive spending programs like the national projects were misguided the entire system needs to be reformed he said this would have to begin with judicial reform with the aim of genuinely achieving the equality of all before the law dispensing with the principle for my friends everything for my enemies the law he wrote in an op ed article we are talking about a whole range of political reforms for now everyday life in russia is more reminiscent of a fortress under siege whose inhabitants are asked time and again to make more holes in their belts the better to tighten them with he wrote that poses a new problem for kremlin planners the 2021 elections for the lower house of parliament currently controlled by the kremlin allied united russia party whose popularity ratings are abysmally low the state duma elections will set the political stage for 2024 when putin in power as president or prime minister since 1999 is constitutionally barred from seeking a third straight term some forecasters predict that the backlog of spending for the national projects will give way to a burst of activity in the first half of 2020 as planners rush to spend the allocated funds that could give the economy a boost for political planners trying to generate sympathy among the electorate however the problem is that the national projects are not the best instrument to do that big spending on bridges and roads for example will benefit steel mills asphalt companies and heavy vehicle manufacturers more than voters the kremlin will face the temptation to indulge in populist spending to bolster a sagging election campaign that could drain the national projects if you want to get political support you raise salaries for state sector workers kluge said the lena river bridge isn t formally part of the national projects plan but government planners have been talking about building it since the early 1980s according to truck driver shadryn earlier in the past decade the project seemed to get approval to move forward finally but according to news reports the bridge was downgraded in priority after the crimea annexation in 2014 and the kremlin s push to build a bridge over the kerch strait linking the peninsula with russia now the proposed 3 000 meter span over the lena one of russia s longest rivers will finally link yakutsk a city of 300 000 with the national highway system it s not formally part of the national projects though it falls into one of the plan s 12 categories for roads and transportation if it s built shadryn said it ll be really difficult to build the bridge he said the river banks the ice we have 40 below cold here and then who knows if someone will try and steal the funds he added laughing source year economic headwinds challenge kremlin

unf earnings call for the period ending november 30 2019 unifirst corp unf 0 02 q1 2020 earnings call 9 00 a m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks operator greetings and welcome to the first quarter earnings call afterwards we will conduct a question and answer session i would now like to turn the conference over to mr steven sintros unifirst s president and chief executive officer please go ahead sir steven s sintros president and chief executive officer thank you and good morning i m steven sintros unifirst s president and chief executive officer joining me today is shane o connor senior vice president and chief financial officer we d like to welcome you to unifirst corporation s conference call to review our first quarter results for fiscal year 2020 and to discuss our expectations going forward this call will be on a listen only mode until we complete our prepared remarks but first a brief disclaimer this conference call may contain forward looking statements that reflect the company s current views with respect to future events and financial performance these forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties the words anticipate optimistic believe estimate expect intend and similar expressions that indicate future events and trends identify forward looking statements actual future results may differ materially from those anticipated depending on a variety of risk factors for more information please refer to the discussion of these risk factors in our most recent 10 k filing with the securities and exchange commission i m happy to report that unifirst s first quarter of fiscal year 2020 produced solid results for the company relative to both our top and bottom line shane will go into the details shortly but i wanted to first take a moment to step back and recap the quarter s results for the first quarter of 2020 unifirst set record highs for both revenues and profits consolidated first quarter revenues were 465 4 million an increase of 6 1 over the same quarter a year ago meanwhile operating income and net income were 60 1 million and 48 2 million respectively representing increases of 19 2 and 25 9 when compared to the first quarter of last year as always i d like to acknowledge that we do not achieve our company s successes alone that said i want to take this opportunity to thank those who are so critical to unifirst day to day accomplishments our 14 000 plus employee team partners throughout north and central america and in europe who work so hard week in and week out to take care of our customers each other and our company our strong first quarter results were primarily influenced by our core laundry operations which make up approximately 90 of our overall revenues and operating income with respect to the primary growth drivers of this segment the quarterly results were largely positive but there were some areas of caution to be noted as we look over the remainder of the year during the first quarter new account sales exceeded the strong first quarter sales we achieved in fiscal year 2019 however december activity combined with future sales projections have our second quarter new sales expectation softening when compared to the first quarter in prior year s activities in addition our additions versus reductions metric which measures wearer levels within existing accounts trended negatively compared to the prior year both of these trends are partially due to reduced business activity in the energy dependent markets that we service we ve used this term energy dependent markets in the past to describe those geographies in the united states and canada that have a significant portion of their economic activities tied to the oil and gas industries of course as always an ever changing macroeconomic environment makes it difficult to predict exactly how long and to what extent this trend may persist in addition overall customer retention slipped some in the first quarter partially related to select large accounts where we made the economic decision not to renew our service agreements we expect these developments to make more difficult top line comparisons for the remainder of the year when comparing to what was a strong fiscal year performance in 2019 for new account sales and customer retention in the meantime we ll continue to focus on executing on our strategic plan which includes defined goals for improving customer service and retention sales organization effectiveness and retention of our employee team partners as far as our other business segments go specialty garments which provide specialized work wear and niche services for nuclear and clean room industries and our first date and safety division both contributed positively to our overall results of the first quarter looking forward we remain committed to maximizing our results and delivering long term value to our shareholders and our team partners we ll achieve these ends with a continued focus on strengthening customer loyalties and growing our base through excellence in personalized business services and continued investments in our service production and sales teams our customer focus philosophy remains at the core of our company s success today our strong balance sheet healthy cash position and ongoing cash flows allow us to continue making solid investments and all principal areas of our business as well as to be competitively pursue business acquisitions that make business sense all helping us to meet our primary long term corporate objective to be universally recognized as the best service provider in our industry and with that i d like to turn the call back over to shane who ll provide the details of our results for the first quarter and our outlook over the remainder of fiscal year 2020 shane o connor senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks steve as steve summarized in our first quarter of 2020 consolidated revenues were 465 4 million up 6 1 from 438 6 million a year ago and consolidated operating income increased to 60 1 million from 50 4 million or 19 2 net income for the quarter increased to 48 2 million or 2 52 per diluted share from 38 3 million or 1 99 per diluted share our core laundry operations revenues for the quarter were 416 3 million up 6 6 from the first quarter of 2019 core laundry organic growth which adjust for the estimated effect of acquisitions as well as fluctuations in the canadian dollar was 6 during the quarter our organic growth continued to benefit from the solid new account sales and improved customer retention in fiscal 2019 as well as the improved collection of merchandise recovery charges in addition our core laundry revenues in the quarter benefited by approximately 0 7 from the impact of certain revenue adjustments related to our credit reserves as well as the timing of revenues around the thanksgiving holiday both of these timing items resulted in a benefit to our first quarter revenues but are expected to have very little impact on our performance for the full fiscal year core laundry and operating income was 53 8 million for the quarter up from 44 8 million in the prior year and the segment s operating margin increased to 12 9 compared to 11 5 in prior year this increase was primarily due to lower energy selling payroll and depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenues as well as the impact of the revenue adjustments i discussed earlier in addition several other costs trended favorably as a percentage of revenues due to the strong revenue growth in the quarter these benefits were partially offset by an unfavorable comparison with prior year due to a 3 million pre tax gain from the settlement of environmental litigation recognized in the first quarter of 2019 which equated to 0 11 per diluted share energy costs decreased to 3 9 of revenues in the first quarter of 2020 down from 4 2 a year ago revenues from our specialty garment segment which deliver specialized nuclear decontamination and cleanroom products and services decreased by 3 to 33 4 million in the first quarter this decrease was primarily due to decreased outage activity in the us and canadian nuclear operations which was partially offset by strong growth in our cleanroom operations this segment s operating margin increased to 14 6 from 4 9 million or 4 9 million from 13 or 4 5 million in the year ago period this increase was primarily due to lower merchandise and production payroll cost as a percentage of revenues which were partially offset by higher casualty claims expense as we ve mentioned in the past this segment s results can vary significantly from period to period due to seasonality and the timing of new nuclear reactor outages and projects that require our specialized services our first aid segments revenues increased by 15 2 to 15 7 million and it s operating income increased by 19 9 to 1 4 million these increases were primarily due to a strong quarterly performance in the segment s wholesale distribution business as well as the company s initiative to expand its first aid band business into new geographies we continue to maintain a solid balance sheet and financial position with no long term debt and cash cash equivalents and short term investments totaling 356 6 million at the end of our first quarter of fiscal 2020 cash provided by operating activities for the first three months of the year was 52 4 million an increase of 20 2 million from the first three months of fiscal 2019 this increase was primarily due to our strong operating performance in the quarter as well as lower working capital needs of the business in addition the quarterly comparison benefited from the payout of a 7 2 million one time bonus to our employees in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 for the first three months of fiscal 2020 capital expenditures totaled 29 0 million as we continue to invest in our future with new facility additions expansions updates and automation systems that will help us meet our long term strategic objectives during the quarter we capitalized 3 4 million related to our ongoing crm project which consisted of license fees third party consulting costs and capitalized internal labor costs as of the end of our first fiscal quarter we had capitalized a total of 14 1 million related to the crm project at this time we still anticipate that sometime in the second half of this fiscal year we will be begin piloting at several test locations and that we do not expect to incur any depreciation expense related to this project in fiscal 2020 we continue to look for and aggressively pursue additional targets as acquisitions remain an integral part of our overall growth strategy as we mentioned in our october webcast in september 2019 we completed an acquisition in kansas city missouri which significantly increases our presence in that market and is anticipated to contribute approximately 12 5 million in additional revenue to fiscal 2020 during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 we repurchased 50 600 common shares for a total of 10 million under our previously announced stock repurchase program as of november 30th 2020 the company had repurchased a total of 247 750 common shares at an average price of 163 43 for 40 5 million under the program i d like to take this opportunity to provide an update on our outlook for fiscal 2020 we now expect that our fiscal 2020 revenues will be between 1 860 billion and 1 872 billion this guidance has more modest expectations at the high end of the range than previously communicated due to the trends that steve discussed previously and the related impact on our expectations for the remainder of the year we now also expect our full year diluted earnings per share will be between 7 60 and 7 92 this revised eps guidance continues to assume an operating margin at the midpoint of the range of 10 3 however our forecast now includes our revised revenue expectations slightly improved assumptions for interest income as well as a lower tax rate for the year of 24 5 as a reminder our guidance for fiscal 2020 includes one less week of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter compared to fiscal 2019 due to the timing of our fiscal calendar and assumes our current level of outstanding common shares this concludes our prepared remarks and we would now be happy to answer any questions that you might have questions and answers operator thank you our first question comes from the line of andrew steinerman with j p morgan you may proceed with your question andrew steinerman j p morgan analyst hi could you jump a little bit more into the assumptions around the energy end market and so i definitely understand you re saying it s a more challenging environment for energy companies could you be a little more specific if it is like tied to number of rigs and is there any assumption made by the fact that as you well know oil price is very recently have actually have picked up steven s sintros president and chief executive officer sure andrew what we re seeing in terms of some of it is rig counts some of it is simply and you ve read the articles in the paper like i have these companies have a lot of debt coming due and they re trying to trim their operations to where they can take advantage of some of those higher prices to pay down debt and we re seeing it in management of the heads within some of those companies and so over the last couple of years after the big dip in energy activity and say 2016 we had seen some strong recovery in west texas primarily but now we re seeing softness in really all the energy markets in terms of reducing heads and we don t want to overstate the impact of it you know as you saw we trim the top end of our range and some of that really is in some of those markets last year at this time we were positive in add reductions in this year in some of those markets were negative and so we re seeing some of that activity right the recent developments around potentially spiking oil prices may or may not change that but we really haven t had enough time to see what the impact of that might be whether they will take that additional profit and pay down debt or start reinvesting again is probably going to play out over several months andrew steinerman j p morgan analyst and could you just remind us what your exposure is to the energy end market steven s sintros president and chief executive officer so we ve talked about over time that oil and gas exploration you know depending on what year you were talking about was anywhere from 5 to 10 of our business but really that s not as much the relevant number as the overall geographic exposure that we have to markets that you know are dependent on oil and gas activity in all the support businesses as well i wouldn t say we re seeing at this point that depth of an impact down to all the support businesses but we re seeing the early stages of slowdowns andrew steinerman j p morgan analyst okay thank you operator our next question comes from the line of andrew wittmann with baird you may proceed with your question andrew wittmann r w baird analyst hey great i just wanted to dig a little bit more into that last question from andrew and just ask have you lost specific contracts with these customers or steve is this really just a reflection of where levels add stops that you re seeing steven s sintros president and chief executive officer yes i would say andy that it s a little bit of all of the above but when you look at our growth drivers and you say new account sales adds reductions and lost accounts and again i think i made the comment to say that they were partially due to the oil and gas we ve seen impact in all when we look at new account activity year over year this time this year versus last year there were more energy accounts being sold last year at this time certainly i just mentioned the adds reduction metric i wouldn t say as much of it is in the lost account number although there is some we are seeing some smaller smaller customers failing andrew wittmann r w baird analyst got it i mean i guess when i do the math here i kind of it looks like you re somewhere implying for the rest of the year somewhere in the high around 2 to 2 5 total growth in your organic outlook if energy is 5 to 10 call it 7 i mean from the current rates of underlying organic growth you d have to see that business get cut in half so it sounds like it feels like there is more there and you did mention that you lost one large or maybe several large accounts are non economic basis so i guess can you talk more broadly beyond the energy paths which you re seeing and specifically on the large account if you could help us understand the size of that so that can help us understand the deceleration implied in your revenue guidance steven s sintros president and chief executive officer so i think taking a step back i think the revenue guidance we have at the beginning of the year that assumed organic growth for the year of around 4 we re basically saying that we re coming off that a little bit for the trends we re seeing but we were always assuming some deceleration of organic growth partially due to the tougher comps in a number of areas partially related to the strong account sales in 19 but also the higher merchandise recovery charges so we always sort of had the model assuming some deceleration of organic growth that put us at about that 4 mark for the year now over the remainder of the year right now our numbers are a little closer to about 3 organic which obviously assume some deceleration there is a number of pieces impacting that the slowdown in energy is a piece on the adds reduction side i talked about on the lost account side last year we had as good of a retention years we ve really had over the last decade through the first quarter we re taking a little higher than that for sure part of it being some of you know a couple of these accounts that we made the decision to move away from yes i hate to get into too much of the details but those probably make up a few million dollars of revenue so it s another item around the edges but as we always talk about our different growth drivers it s an area you know we felt worth mentioning that retention had slipped some on the new sales side i will say that i made the comment that activity had slowed some in december and through the holidays and that s having our outlook for q2 new sales being a little soft last year at this time we really blew through the holidays with very strong activity on the new account side which really helped fuel a full year new sales result that was by far a record of new account sales and we re seeing a little bit of slowing right now again i made the comment partially due to energy but probably not fully due to energy so the combination of some of those factors combined with the originally built in assumption that there was going to be some tougher year over year comps as the year went along is kind of getting us to the results in the guidance that we re putting forth at this point andrew wittmann r w baird analyst that s great context thank you i think it s probably also worth noting here that your margins were really quite good and i wanted to dig into that a little bit here as well i mean you did mention that there is 0 7 of the growth rate was from this accounting item of a release and some other stuff there as well timing i mean even if are we to assume that even if we re going to take that 0 7 or about 3 million i mean that basically does that come through is like basically pure profit and even if it does i mean your margins are still up a lot is that the right way to think about what you re calling out there in that 0 7 shane o connor senior vice president and chief financial officer yes this is shane yes that 0 7 a fair amount of that drops to our operating margin line when you take a look at the operating margin impact of those those equate to about 50 basis points on our margin so clearly the lion s share of that is translating into profit because there s no costs associated with some of those reserve adjustments andrew wittmann r w baird analyst okay and then my last question for now it s just i ve never heard the timing of thanksgiving being a factor in organic growth and so i was just wondering the mechanics behind that why is that the case here steven s sintros president and chief executive officer yes i figured that would probably be a question so again this sort of relates to our fiscal calendar and actually where thanksgiving falls this year in the actual calendar so at the end of our first quarter thanksgiving is always the last two days of our quarter and in some cases we re not able to run the routes related to those two days and we have to run those routes some of those routes we ve run before the holiday some of them we run subsequent to the quarter in the subsequent week which falls into our second quarter historically we ve always deferred the revenue related to those routes because we say that the delivery is important enough for revenue recognition because thanksgiving is a week later this year and it s actually closer to christmas we ran more of those routes before the holiday which results in that revenue being recognized in the first quarter where normally it would be deferred into the second quarter so again that s a timing item where the revenue got recognized in our first quarter normally it would be in the second quarter so it will actually be a headwind to the comparison in the second quarter because not as much as deferred there andrew wittmann r w baird analyst thank you very much operator our next question comes from the line of tim mulrooney with blair with william blair you may proceed with your question timothy mulrooney william blair analyst good morning steven s sintros president and chief executive officer good morning shane o connor senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning timothy mulrooney william blair analyst i had a couple of questions here so on the margin side for your core laundry business correct me if i m wrong but i think you were calling for an operating margin of 10 3 at the midpoint for the full year is that correct shane o connor senior vice president and chief financial officer that s correct timothy mulrooney william blair analyst okay but with the first quarter being so strong here i think actually up like 140 basis points year over year do you have updated expectations for that segment or are you still expecting 10 3 midpoint for the full year shane o connor senior vice president and chief financial officer yes i had mentioned that in some of my prepared remarks that the expectations for the remainder or for the full year still have the midpoint being 10 3 and the first quarter it was a very strong profit quarter for us but it often times is first quarter is usually very strong some of the cost escalations that we see just seasonally are in the second half of the year and i guess i ll take the opportunity to speak to a couple of those first and foremost would be we have set annual salary increases that take place in january obviously with payrolls being the lion s share of our costs our first fiscal quarter is benefiting from a lot of the revenue growth during the year but those salary increases don t hit until those last three quarters our second quarter has certain seasonal cost that caused it to almost always be down from an operating margin perspective and i think historically we ve talked about some of these things they are normal in operating but the unemployed or the resetting of unemployment taxes we have a disproportionate amount of real estate taxes that actually get expensed during that quarter and we also have a large payout of unused sick time that takes place in that some of the other things that are resulting and the margin being reduced in those last three quarters are we have mentioned the fact that we were forecasting in some additional costs related to our crm project and we expect those to be heavier in the final quarters as we move toward pilot and eventually we start to ramp up for deployment and then of course there s going to be an impact related to the modest revenue growth in the second half the more modest revenue growth in the second half of the year i guess the last item timothy mulrooney william blair analyst okay shane o connor senior vice president and chief financial officer the last item i ll talk about just because coming into the year we had commented on the fact that we had some expectations around healthcare costs starting at the beginning of our fiscal year we actually redid all our healthcare plans to our employees so our employees were introduced to those new plans and right now we have one quarter s worth of experience related to those new plan but there does remain a significant amount of uncertainty around it i guess the claims experience related to those plan and the second half of our year is also maintaining caution as it relates to the costs that are going to be associated with those timothy mulrooney william blair analyst got it okay shane yes thanks for all that extra color that s really helpful maybe one or two more from me so i mean sticking on your guidance you pulled up the low end of your eps guidance range for the full year i think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that was primarily due to a lower tax rate and maybe a more favorable interest expense than you were initially anticipating does that make up the majority of why you re pulling that up shane o connor senior vice president and chief financial officer it does it does timothy mulrooney william blair analyst okay and lastly from me could you just comment on the pricing environment is it still pretty favorable and could you also comment on your merchandise recovery charges are you still seeing a benefit there was that more of a 2019 phenomenon thank you steven s sintros president and chief executive officer sure i think the price environment is relatively stable i think it s i ve made the comment before that you know there is still a fair amount of aggressiveness in our industry in terms of new accounts in the sales process with respect to merchandise recovery charges the first quarter we still pretty strong the growth in that area was higher than the organic growth was overall so it was a contributor and i think we re starting to get to the point where we re annualizing some increases there that also leads to the caution of the second half of the year or the last nine months in terms of tougher comps timothy mulrooney william blair analyst understood thank you gentlemen shane o connor senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator there are no further questions at this time i will now turn the call back to you steven s sintros president and chief executive officer okay i d like to thank everyone for

after an exponential rise in 2019 wall street has entered into a correction mode early this year following the u s airstrikes in iran that killed its military general qasem soleimani after this development the three major stock indexes the dow the s p 500 and the nasdaq composite declined 1 0 6 and 0 3 respectively in the last three trading days however the stable economic fundamentals of the united states have raised the possibility of the recent stock market volatility being a transitory phase and markets continuing their long term uptrend once the interim trade deal between the united states and china is signed mid january while markets are likely to remain range bound until the signing of the phase one trade deal the downside potential will be limited owing to u s economic strength nonetheless volatile trading may become a regular phenomenon in wall street at this stage it makes good sense to buy those stocks on the dip that could prove to be valuable once the rally resumes geopolitical conflict in middle east intensifies on jan 7 pentagon confirmed that iran launched more than a dozen ballistic missiles against u s military and coalition forces at al assad and irbil military bases in iraq the airstrike was in retaliation to the u s killing of iran s immensely popular top ranked general qasem soleimani on jan 2 moreover on jan 5 iran announced that it would no longer respect the 2015 nuclear deal on the number of uranium enrichment centrifuges after the attack iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif tweeted we do not seek escalation or war but will defend ourselves against any aggression meanwhile president donald trump tweeted that all is well missiles launched from iran at two military bases located in iraq earlier trump had tweeted that the u s government has targeted 52 sites very important to iran and iranian culture if that country retaliates and strikes any americans or american assets investors remained busy judging how the u s iran conflict will affect stock markets volatility resurfaced in wall street in the last three trading days as market participants shifted to safe haven assets such as u s government bonds precious metals like gold and currency like japanese yen meanwhile crude oil prices have skyrocketed in apprehension of a potential oil supply disruption higher oil prices will hinder the economic revival process of several important emerging markets interim trade deal and solid economic data major drivers chinese officials are set to arrive in washington on jan 13 in order to sign an interim trade pact known as the phase one trade deal last week donald trump said that he will sign the preliminary trade deal on jan 15 the deal is expected to at least prevent further escalation of tariff war between the two largest trading countries of the world the institute for supply management reported that the u s services non manufacturing index jumped to a four month high of 55 in december from 53 9 in november the figure was higher than the consensus estimate of 54 2 notably the services sector constitutes 70 of the gdp any reading above 50 indicates expansion of service activities and a reading of 55 or more reflects exceptional performance the department of commerce reported that the u s trade deficit declined sharply by 8 2 to 43 1 billion in november marking the smallest deficit since october 2016 exports grew 0 7 to 208 6 billion in november while imports dropped 1 to 251 7 billion our top picks at this stage investors should be prepared to minimize fluctuations in their portfolio and

founder of dominion bond rating service believes newfoundland and labrador will be teetering on the brink of bankruptcy in dire need of a bailout from ottawa no change in the weather is his way of sounding the alarm newfoundland debt trades now as though it was canada sovereign debt he says if it was independent right now it d be trading probably into non investment grade bb and the interest rate that they re ultimately going to have to pay is probably going to go up 300 to 500 basis points they re going to trade as junk debt if ottawa doesn t help them it s as simple as that schroeder is quite familiar with the problem too he s spent most of his life assessing debt and he s always taken a special interest in newfoundland and labrador he founded dbrs in 1976 and remained controlling shareholder as it grew into canada s largest bond rating agency before it was sold in 2014 for reportedly more than us 500 million article content in dbrs s early years schroeder says he would travel to newfoundland and labrador for meetings and fell in love with the place the culture the people and especially the music at 77 years old the winnipeger who built his business in toronto still has an affinity for the rugged island on canada s eastern edge on a trip there in the 1980s schroeder bought a tape of folk music uncle harry s bar band at a shop and wound up listening to the album for years afterwards advertisement 3 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content we had 400 people working for us right across the world so newfoundland was one of many many many entities but it s one i stayed closer to because i enjoyed it i enjoyed the culture so i kept going back there year after year schroeder says i actually went to churchill falls as part of the rating i ate slept and drank with the guys at churchill falls for about three days that was in the 90s i really got to understand it churchill falls the massive hydroelectric dam in labrador figures prominently in no change in the weather the waterfall itself was perfect for a hydroelectric project but the location was a problem the only way to get power from central labrador to ontario and the united states is by going through quebec a deal was struck in the 1960s which allowed hydro quebec to buy power at fixed prices from a company controlled by newfoundland and labrador the power purchase contract with quebec is massively lopsided with hydro québec reaping almost all the profits until 2041 for an energy project completed in 1974 the thing is churchill falls is the significant event that separates newfoundland from prosperity schroeder says newfoundland should be 50 per cent and quebec should be 50 per cent but instead it s more like quebec 96 per cent and newfoundland four advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content photo by tory zimmerman for national post it wasn t until dbrs was sold that schroeder felt like he could devote time and money to his passion projects i was an insider with government i was an insider with probably 1 000 corporations the sec watched me like a hawk so i couldn t do very much because of conflict of interest potential and of course i could never get involved with anybody political he says we sold the company and it kind of freed me to start doing some things that before i couldn t do it was around 2017 when schroeder had the idea for a jukebox musical of newfoundland and labrador folk songs around the same time come from away another musical set in newfoundland was receiving critical acclaim and eventually seven tony award nominations winning one he says his main intention behind the new play was to showcase the province s music and culture but the final production is heavy on politics it started out being just a play that showed the beauty of newfoundland artists the rest fell into place when i did the research found that newfoundland was still in the same position he says seeing how bad it was that s what got me motivated about the second part advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content after schroeder came up with the original concept he connected with berni stapleton and ruth lawrence well known names in the newfoundland and labrador theatre community to write and direct the show he also brought on former great big sea musician bob hallett to serve as producer hallett also worked as a musical consultant on come from away the easiest call i think i d ever have to make as a debt rater would be a newfoundland bankruptcy walter schroeder set in a fictional newfoundland outport a remote coastal fishing community only accessible by boat the musical is about family and friends coming together to grieve the death of mary margaret the community matriarch but one of the key plot elements involves james the suit wearing son of mary margaret who got seduced by the big city of st john s and wound up working in the provincial government for decades through the voice of james the play includes a heavy helping of exposition and revelations about the churchill falls hydroelectric project and the theory that newfoundland and labrador failed to assert its rights to an energy transmission corridor through quebec at the behest of then prime minister lester pearson who was worried about quebec separatism advertisement 6 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article

waiting still for our country to do the right thing it wasn t that we chose canada it was that canada didn t choose us in addition to a detailed discussion of the churchill falls deal the show s 28 page playbill includes 11 pages of other information including the province s relationship with canada and a table of figures about the federal equalization formula that takes up more than half a page much of this history is contested and more complicated than it seems in a musical studded with upbeat folk songs the province has launched legal cases to try to break the hydroelectric contract losing multiple times at the supreme court of canada the lopsided churchill falls deal remains a major source of animosity between the province and quebec the playbill also includes an insert for the schroeder policy group a think tank that schroeder recently launched it has spent more than 62 000 promoting its causes on facebook since june with more than half that money being spent in october alone the policy institute has two main issues that it advocates for increased health care spending and action to address newfoundland and labrador s impending bankruptcy schroeder says he s devoting a lot of his money towards three main issues that he cares about indigenous people health care and the province s precarious fiscal situation advertisement 7 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content schroeder says he s convinced some sort of insolvency is imminent for the province driven partly by unsustainable debt and partly by a different hydroelectric project called muskrat falls that went wildly over budget if the provincial government doesn t come up with hundreds of millions of dollars to subsidize ratepayers electricity rates are set to sharply increase once the project is brought online he expects the federal government will ultimately need to bail out the province something that also comes up in no change in the weather although it s framed as recompense for the churchill falls deal the only reason bond markets aren t running scared from the province s debt schroeder says is because investors assume ottawa will come through with a bailout in the recent election campaign all the federal leaders vaguely nodded at the possibility of financial assistance for the province but the clock is ticking muskrat falls is nearly built and the economic consequences will soon hit in either the form of higher electricity rates or huge subsidies from the provincial government at a time when the budget is already soaked in red ink the minute they do that which is going to be in the next few months that s when the shit is going to hit the fan because the economy can t take it schroeder says

speech by luis de guindos vice president of the ecb at the suerf de nederlandsche bank conference forging a new future between the uk and the eu it is my pleasure to deliver the keynote speech at this year s suerf dnb conference the title of this conference is very apt brexit will certainly require a new future to be forged between the united kingdom and the eu the united kingdom s departure has important implications for the eu financial system most notably for capital markets so we need to give serious thought to optimally shaping the future relationship between our financial sectors in the awareness that london though likely to remain an important global financial centre will become less integrated with eu markets and firms we will also need to step up our efforts to further develop the eu s domestic capacity in capital market activities so as to avoid a brexit induced increase in financial fragmentation while at the same time ensuring that the united kingdom and eu member states do not engage in a race to the bottom on regulation taking up the theme of the conference i would first like to focus on how to forge a new future between the united kingdom and the eu with regard to some key financial activities i will then turn to the much needed drive to strengthen the european financial system by completing the capital markets union and banking union london s pre eminence in certain key financial market segments for decades europe s leading financial centre has been the city of london and in some notable areas the eu s financial ecosystem has relied heavily on services provided by uk based banks and market infrastructures derivatives clearing a critical segment of financial markets is a striking example as of december 2019 almost 90 of all over the counter otc derivatives positions taken by euro area institutions were cleared at uk global clearing houses derivatives clearing is not the only example however large investment banks operating from london play a significant role in euro area bilateral otc derivatives markets in august last year over a quarter of uncleared otc derivatives held by euro area institutions were sourced from the united kingdom while the activities of these investment banks were considered unlikely to create financial stability risks in a hard brexit scenario also thanks to the temporary measures taken by eu and national authorities they are still relevant to the provision of liquidity to euro area markets over the longer term uk based investment banks are also key providers of advisory and financing services related to securities issuance m a activity and syndicated lending to euro area clients they play an active role in debt and equity issuance for euro area non financial corporations including book running and underwriting services between 2012 and 2018 almost half of all debt and equity issuance for euro area non financial corporations was carried out by global banks serving our market from london our reliance on london also stems from the fact that in some cases the city represents a gateway to global financial markets for euro area financial and non financial firms allowing them to tap into global capital and liquidity pools in other areas however reliance on london is quite limited for instance uk domiciled banks play a marginal role in direct lending to euro area households and non financial companies had it not been for brexit certain global and regional trends might even have led to an increase in the eu s reliance on the city of london as a centre for market based finance indeed the balance between banks and non bank financial institutions in the eu has been evolving in recent years although still very much bank based our economy is increasingly financed by non bank institutions in the euro area total assets held by non banks have almost doubled over the last ten years growing from 23 trillion in 2008 to 45 trillion in june 2019 non banks currently account for around 55 of the euro area financial sector their fast growth reflects their expanding role in financing the euro area real economy whereas in 2008 non banks accounted for 14 of the euro area financial sector s loans to non financial corporations that share roughly doubled in a decade non banks provide a steady net flow of financing to non financial corporations through the purchase of debt securities regulatory decisions and economic drivers will affect the status quo these examples give a sense of the level of integration between uk and continental financial markets in particular for certain complex and sophisticated financial services linked to derivatives markets and investment banking activities however brexit will change this status quo and a degree of decoupling is likely it is difficult to make firm predictions about the extent to which our two financial systems may drift apart or remain integrated the contours of the future eu uk relationship in financial services are still uncertain and the economic drivers and regulatory choices which could reshape this relationship will probably only be felt over time the eu will need to balance the benefits of continued integration with the uk financial system against potential risks to financial stability consumer and investor protection the level playing field and the integrity of the single market as i have said in the past this path will not be easy for either side of the channel and the risks linked to regulatory divergence and a potential race to the bottom should not be taken lightly allow me to briefly discuss the regulatory dimension of this question a possible scenario is that the united kingdom will not seek to remain a member of the eu single market once it leaves the eu this means moving away from a fully integrated relationship underpinned by the eu s single rulebook and single passport for financial services and relying instead on the eu s equivalence framework for third countries for some types of financial activities this framework allows financial service providers from third countries to continue to serve eu clients provided a number of strict conditions are met for example in the area of central clearing which i touched upon earlier cross border market access is widespread 15 jurisdictions are considered equivalent by the eu and 33 third country central counterparties ccps are recognised by the european securities and markets authority esma at the same time given the euro area s reliance on uk ccps strong safeguards must be put in place to preserve financial stability and a level playing field in this respect i am very pleased that eu legislators have adopted a new supervisory framework for ccps in the european market infrastructure regulation emir 2 this framework requires third country ccps which are critical for the eu to meet eu prudential requirements under esma s supervision with the involvement of the relevant eu central banks if uk ccps are to continue to provide euro clearing services on a systemic scale under the equivalence framework they should be subject to the rigorous application of these safeguards in central clearing or other areas such as trading or listing the extent of continued market access will depend on whether or not a decision is taken to grant equivalence to the united kingdom these decisions are beyond the purview of the ecb and it is not my place to comment on them suffice to say that there is no automatic right to equivalence for other types of financial activities no specific regime for accessing eu markets has been established this is not unusual most if not all countries place some restrictions on the types of financial services that can be provided across their borders there may be good reasons for these restrictions such as consumer protection or financial stability considerations in the case of the eu certain bank lending and deposit taking activities are not covered by the so called third country regimes and so will no longer be able to be provided from the united kingdom but will need to be provided from within the eu this together with the fact that equivalence cannot be taken for granted is why many banks have chosen to relocate activities to the eu27 and have been engaged in very detailed discussions with the ecb and other authorities to obtain agreement on their plans the ecb expects banks to build up their capabilities in eu27 countries and to implement the agreed relocation plans within the previously agreed timelines the risks of financial fragmentation regulatory drivers and in particular the end of passporting rights for certain uk based activities are already having an effect on the geography of financial centres in the euro area according to preliminary evidence a small number of financial hubs appear to be emerging as a result of the relocation or plans for relocation of certain activities most incoming banks have indicated germany ireland the netherlands or france as their new main location in the euro area this pattern also seems to apply to the relocation of activities beyond banking public statements and market intelligence suggest that a sizeable fraction of asset management firms and insurance companies that are relocating activities from the united kingdom as a result of brexit have moved to either ireland or luxembourg and speaking here in amsterdam i should note that the netherlands is attracting a substantial amount of trading platforms exchanges and fintech companies the persistence of such dynamics and the emergence of a clearly multi centric euro area financial system could raise a number of challenges in particular without further progress on banking and capital markets union a more fragmented financial structure could affect the ability of investors and companies from a country experiencing a negative shock to access investment and funding opportunities in unaffected countries private risk sharing it could also create regulatory and supervisory challenges domestic capital markets within the eu are currently subject to national rules and supervision the differences in regimes could further inhibit the integration of markets and perhaps incentivise regulatory arbitrage brexit and the need for renewed momentum on the capital markets union and banking union indeed from a global standpoint european capital markets are too small and fragmented the goal of the capital markets union or cmu is to develop an ecosystem that will allow the development of strong european financial markets and intermediaries which are able to compete internationally this requires designing policies to support the development of markets size and scope removing barriers between eu capital markets expanding sources of funding for companies and broadening the role of the non bank financial sector ultimately a well developed cmu will increase private risk sharing promote financial stability and boost economic growth starting in 2015 the european commission launched a series of initiatives to stimulate the development and integration of eu capital markets on market development the commission adopted a set of harmonised rules on securitisation and published its fintech action plan in 2018 initiatives on market integration included the review of the european supervisory agencies and the covered bond legislative package the former aimed to make our system of financial supervision more efficient and effective and also gave the european banking authority a coordinating role in the areas of anti money laundering and terrorist financing the latter should foster the development of covered bonds by creating a harmonised eu framework providing a source of long term financing for banks and supporting the real economy across the eu despite the efforts of policymakers and market participants retail investors are far from having embraced investing in capital markets while the full impact on the real economy may take time to materialise it is concerning that the initial ambitions of the plan launched by the european commission towards the development of a cmu were significantly lowered to enable co legislators to reach an agreement so there is still much to be done on the cmu project and brexit makes these issues even more pressing let me highlight a few initiatives first the european commission signalled that it would make cmu a centrepiece of the forthcoming legislative agenda and has already set up a high level forum composed of experts from different industry sectors which has started work on proposals for the next cmu action plan second a high level working group created by germany the netherlands and france published a proposal to relaunch cmu in 2019 this proposal includes recommendations for generating long term savings opportunities developing equity markets enhancing cross border financial flows and developing debt credit and foreign exchange financing tools with a view to increasing the international role of the euro last but not least there have been industry led initiatives such as the ceps ecmi task force on rebranding cmu which put forward a market finance action plan these initiatives provide valuable input for the cmu agenda looking ahead i see two areas where progress is particularly needed first capital markets remain subject to national rules and supervision this hampers the cross border provision of services further harmonisation for instance in the area of insolvency and taxation regimes is needed to foster integration in the euro area second if the eu27 financial markets deepen diversify and expand across borders there would be a clear flipside these developments would need to be accompanied by sufficient oversight and regulatory tools to avoid regulatory arbitrage or the build up of risks in certain parts of the system in particular ensuring the resilience of individual institutions is not enough to guarantee the stability of the system as a whole a macroprudential framework for non bank financial institutions is necessary for identifying and addressing risks at the system level the links between the capital markets union and the banking union revitalising the cmu agenda will also bring benefits for the completion of the banking union as banks and markets complement each other in financing the real economy we need to ensure that this reinforcing loop is strengthened over the coming years i would like to highlight three key priorities for the banking union first it is important to operationalise a credible common backstop to the single resolution fund to provide additional confidence in the bank resolution framework the policy work on this backstop is at a very advanced stage second in order to close potential liquidity gaps that may still hinder efficient resolution the outstanding issue of liquidity in resolution needs to be addressed progress is needed in the discussions on potential solutions in order to place the banking union on a par with other major jurisdictions like the united states and the united kingdom third it is crucial to establish a european deposit insurance scheme or edis to provide uniform protection to depositors within the banking union regardless of their bank s location and to help reduce the sovereign bank nexus more efforts are still needed in this regard hopefully 2020 will be the year in which the political deadlock on edis will be resolved and a clear roadmap adopted reflecting timelines and conditions for the various stages of edis conclusion let me conclude today i have explained why brexit underscores the need to renew our ambition on cmu and complete the work on banking union the unifying theme of the priorities that i have outlined today is basically risk taking and risk sharing among private agents in a nutshell both the capital markets union and the banking union provide a framework that encourages innovation and integration further work on these agendas will enhance the attractiveness of the eu capital markets on the global stage beyond brexit
if any other indication is needed regarding china s continued no tolerance policy towards pro tibet activity a recent official document has outlined beijing s detailed stance on the various punishments to be meted out to monks considered to have attitude problems according to the document monks committing minor infractions will be sent for re education those committing more serious crimes will be thrown in jail until they renounce their stance those considered to have serious crime and attitude problems will be banned from monasteries while alleged masterminds of splittist actions have been warned that they will be prosecuted with the full force of thelaw monasteries from which at least 10 to 30 percent of the resident monks took part in the march protests appear to be the main targets of the new policy all members of these monasteries have now been ordered to re register with local party offices and those who fail loyalty tests will not be allowed to remain interestingly the new instructions did not actually originate in beijing though they now bear its stamp of approval but rather in the local communist party central executive committee in kandze prefecture in southwestern sichuan province the area is home to a significant tibetan population and saw some of the largest protests earlier this year that may be a notable example of decentralised decision making though not of a type that everyone would back
by david ditch the daily signal ten years ago the federal government reached a dismal milestone a one year deficit of 1 trillion now like too many movie franchises we re getting the sequel whether we want it or not a congressional budget office report reveals that the federal deficit for the current fiscal year has once again exceeded 1 trillion the driving force behind america s astronomical deficit is the rapid increase in spending federal outlays are up 7 compared to 2018 which far outstrips inflation population growth and the economy it is worth comparing america s situation to that of similar nations both in 2009 and today to see why the current deficit is so unacceptable the great recession of 2008 ate into tax revenue at the same time the wasteful and ineffective stimulus legislation generated a record high for spending trillion dollar deficits which were a factor in launching the tea party movement lasted from 2009 through 2012 the u s was hardly alone in this the recession devastated the global economy and damaged the bottom line of other nations a result most were able to rein in deficits as the economy rebounded with robust global growth over the last several years a majority of developed nations are taking advantage by shrinking the size of their debt relative to the size of the economy this ratio often written as debt to gdp is important because it points to how well a nation can afford its current level of debt the international monetary fund projects that of the 10 largest advanced economies the u s will have by far the largest debt growth relative to its economy over the next five years america s fiscal health should be just as strong as that of our counterparts revenues are up 3 4 from 2018 the vibrant economy means less safety net spending compared to recession years and the military is not fully engaged in war regrettably our congress has chafed at even modest spending restraints as the tea party dissipated a lack of political pressure allowed big spending legislators to pig out once more budget caps were repeatedly overridden deficits crept back up and america is now right back where it started 10 years ago trillion dollar deficits although the 2019 deficit could ultimately dip below 1 trillion depending on september s numbers the fact remains that even a mere 960 billion deficit for the year is inexcusable the majority of federal dollars do not go toward commonly cited categories such as defense cited by progressives or benefits for illegal immigrants brought up by conservatives instead most spending is focused on social benefit programs such as social security medicare and medicaid these programs are growing much faster than other parts of the federal government their size and rapid growth makes them fundamentally unsustainable and thus a threat to the economy there are multiple reasons for this medicare premiums have long been artificially low and the government does not properly index social security benefits to inflation and life expectancy as a result the overwhelming majority of retirees receive more in benefits from these programs than they paid in payroll taxes both programs are in serious trouble as the baby boomer generation enters retirement the imbalance of retirees to active workers is leading to explosivedeficits that will bankrupt trust funds in the next few years to avoid sudden and painful cuts to retirees who are counting on these benefits reforms are necessary the longer congress puts off reform the harder it will be to avoid either painful cuts or economy draining tax hikes meanwhile members of the house and senate appropriations committees sometimes take the perverse approach of citing the importance of entitlement reform as a reason not to worry about annual spending under their direct control in reality the federal government wastes countless billions every year on badly designed badly administered and straight up bad programs regardless of specific budgetary classifications not one penny of waste should get a pass the heritage foundation s unparalleled blueprint for balance provides legislators with hundreds of ways to fix the nation s broken budget streamlining spending and making the tax code more fair and efficient would protect the country from dangerous levels of debt and further enhance economic growth germany canada the united kingdom and france are all on pace to tame their debt americans should expect the same responsible governance from their elected officials and hold them accountable if they continue down the fiscal primrose path

affinity for the rugged island on canada s eastern edge on a trip there in the 1980s schroeder bought a tape of folk music uncle harry s bar band at a shop and wound up listening to the album for

400 people working for us right across the world so newfoundland was one of many many many entities but it s one i stayed closer to because i enjoyed it i enjoyed the culture so i kept going back there year after year schroeder says i actually went to churchill falls as part of the rating i ate slept and drank with the guys at churchill falls for about three days that was in the 90s i really got to understand it churchill falls the massive hydroelectric dam in labrador figures prominently in no change in the weather the waterfall itself was perfect for a hydroelectric project but the location was a problem the only way to get power from central labrador to ontario and the united states is by going through quebec a deal was struck in the 1960s which allowed hydro quebec to buy power at fixed prices from a company controlled by newfoundland and labrador the power purchase contract with quebec is massively lopsided with hydro québec reaping almost all the profits until 2041 for an energy project completed in 1974 the thing is churchill falls is the significant event that separates newfoundland from prosperity schroeder says newfoundland should be 50 per cent and quebec should be 50 per cent but instead it s more like quebec 96 per cent and newfoundland four advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content photo by tory zimmerman for national post it wasn t until dbrs was sold that schroeder felt like he could devote time and money to his passion projects i was an insider with government i was an insider with probably 1 000 corporations the sec watched me like a hawk so i couldn t do very much because of conflict of interest potential and of course i could never get involved with anybody political he says we sold the company and it kind of freed me to start doing some things that before i couldn t do it was around 2017 when schroeder had the idea for a jukebox musical of newfoundland and labrador folk songs around the same time come from away another musical set in newfoundland was receiving critical acclaim and eventually seven tony award nominations winning one he says his main intention behind the new play was to showcase the province s music and culture but the final production is heavy on politics it started out being just a play that showed the beauty of newfoundland artists the rest fell into place when i did the research found that newfoundland was still in the same position he says seeing how bad it was that s what got me motivated about the second part advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content after schroeder came up with the original concept he connected with berni stapleton and ruth lawrence well known names in the newfoundland and labrador theatre community to write and direct the show he also brought on former great big sea musician bob hallett to serve as producer hallett also worked as a musical consultant on come from away the easiest call i think i d ever have to make as a debt rater would be a newfoundland bankruptcy walter schroeder set in a fictional newfoundland outport a remote coastal fishing community only accessible by boat the musical is about family and friends coming together to grieve the death of mary margaret the community matriarch but one of the key plot elements involves james the suit wearing son of mary margaret who got seduced by the big city of st john s and wound up working in the provincial government for decades through the voice of james the play includes a heavy helping of exposition and revelations about the churchill falls hydroelectric project and the theory that newfoundland and labrador failed to assert its rights to an energy transmission corridor through quebec at the behest of then prime minister lester pearson who was worried about quebec separatism advertisement 6 story continues below

act and so we did and then we waited and here we wait waiting still for our country to do the right thing it wasn t that we chose canada it was that canada didn t choose us in addition to a detailed discussion of the churchill falls deal the show s 28 page playbill includes 11 pages of other information including the province s relationship with canada and a table of figures about the federal equalization formula that takes up more than half a page much of this history is contested and more complicated than it seems in a musical studded with upbeat folk songs the province has launched legal cases to try to break the hydroelectric contract losing multiple times at the supreme court of canada the lopsided churchill falls deal remains a major source of animosity between the province and quebec the playbill also includes an insert for the schroeder policy group a think tank that schroeder recently launched it has spent more than 62 000 promoting its causes on facebook since june with more than half that money being spent in october alone the policy institute has two main issues that it advocates for increased health care spending and action to address newfoundland and labrador s impending bankruptcy schroeder says he s devoting a lot of his money towards three main issues that he cares about indigenous people health care and the province s precarious fiscal situation advertisement 7 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content schroeder says he s convinced some sort of insolvency is imminent for the province driven partly by unsustainable debt and partly by a different hydroelectric project called muskrat falls that went wildly over budget if the provincial government doesn t come up with hundreds of millions of dollars to subsidize ratepayers electricity rates are set to sharply increase once the project is brought online he expects the federal government will ultimately need to bail out the province something that also comes up in no change in the weather although it s framed as recompense for the churchill falls deal the only reason bond markets aren t running scared from the province s debt schroeder says is because investors assume ottawa will come through with a bailout in the recent election campaign all the federal leaders vaguely nodded at the possibility of financial assistance for the province but the clock is ticking muskrat falls is nearly built and the economic consequences will soon hit in either the form of higher electricity rates or huge subsidies from the provincial government at a time when the budget is already soaked in red ink the minute they do that which is going to be in the next few months that s when the shit is going to hit

album for years afterwards we had 400 people working for us right across the world so newfoundland was one of many many many entities but it s one i stayed closer to because i enjoyed it i enjoyed the culture so i kept going back there year after year schroeder says i actually went to churchill falls as part of the rating i ate slept and drank with the guys at churchill falls for about three days

perfect for a hydroelectric project but the location was a problem the only way to get power from central labrador to ontario and the united states is by going through quebec a deal was struck in the 1960s which allowed hydro quebec to buy power at fixed prices from a company controlled by newfoundland and labrador the power purchase contract with quebec is massively lopsided with hydro québec reaping almost all the profits until 2041 for an energy project completed in 1974 the thing is churchill falls is the significant event that separates newfoundland from prosperity schroeder says newfoundland should be 50 per cent and quebec should be 50 per cent but instead it s more like quebec 96 per cent and newfoundland four advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not

passion projects i was an insider with government i was an insider with probably 1 000 corporations the sec watched me like a hawk so i couldn t do very much because of conflict of interest potential and of course i could never get involved with anybody political he says we sold the company and it kind of freed me to start doing some things that before i couldn t do it was around 2017 when schroeder had the idea for a jukebox musical of newfoundland and labrador folk songs around the same time come from away another musical set in newfoundland was receiving critical acclaim and eventually seven tony award nominations winning one he says his main intention behind the new play was to showcase the province s music and culture but the final production is heavy on politics it started out being just a play that showed the beauty of newfoundland artists the rest fell into place when i did the research found that newfoundland was still in the same position he says seeing how bad it was that s what got me motivated about the second part advertisement 6 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content after schroeder came up with the original concept he connected with berni stapleton and ruth lawrence well known names in the newfoundland and labrador theatre community to write and direct the show he also

would be a newfoundland bankruptcy walter schroeder set in a fictional newfoundland outport a remote coastal fishing community only accessible by boat the musical is about family and friends coming together to grieve the death of mary margaret the community matriarch but one of the key plot elements involves james the suit wearing son of mary margaret who got seduced by the big city of st john s and wound up working in the provincial government for decades through the voice of james the play includes a heavy helping of exposition and revelations about the churchill falls hydroelectric project and the theory that newfoundland and labrador failed to assert its rights to an energy transmission corridor through quebec at the behest of then prime minister lester pearson who was worried about quebec separatism advertisement 7 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content take one for the team they said and we ll see you right james says in the climax at the end of the show s first act and so we did and then we waited and here we wait waiting still for our country to do the right thing it wasn t that we chose canada it was that canada didn t choose us in addition to a detailed discussion of the churchill falls deal the show s 28 page playbill includes 11 pages of other information including the province s relationship with canada and a table of figures about the federal equalization formula that takes up more than half a page much of this history is contested and more complicated than it seems in a musical studded with upbeat folk songs the province has launched legal cases to try to break the hydroelectric contract losing multiple times at the supreme court of canada the lopsided churchill falls deal remains a major source of animosity between the province and quebec advertisement 8 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the playbill also includes an insert for the schroeder policy group a think tank that schroeder recently launched it has spent more than 62 000 promoting its causes on facebook since june with more than half that money being spent in october alone the policy institute has two main issues that it advocates for increased health care spending and action to address newfoundland and labrador s impending bankruptcy schroeder says he s devoting a lot of his money towards three main issues that he cares about indigenous people health care and the province s precarious fiscal situation schroeder says he s convinced some sort of insolvency is imminent for the province driven partly by unsustainable debt and partly by a different hydroelectric project called muskrat falls that went wildly over budget if the provincial government doesn t come up with hundreds of millions of dollars to subsidize ratepayers electricity rates are set to sharply increase once the project is brought online he expects the federal government will ultimately need to bail out the province something that also comes up in no change in the weather although it s framed as recompense for the churchill falls deal advertisement 9 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the only reason bond markets aren t running scared from the province s debt schroeder says is because investors assume ottawa will come through with a bailout in the recent election campaign all the federal leaders vaguely nodded at the possibility of financial assistance for the province but the clock is ticking muskrat falls is nearly built and the economic consequences will soon hit in either the form of higher electricity rates or huge subsidies from the provincial government at a time when the budget is already soaked in red ink the minute they do that which is going to be in the next few months that s when the shit is going to hit the fan because the economy

comments will be affected by risks and or uncertainties which may cause the actual results of the company to be materially different from those expressed or implied today for more information about exfo i encourage you to review our form 20 f filed with the securities and exchange commission our annual information form is available with canadian securities commission as well please note that non ifrs numbers may be used during this conference call a reconciliation of these non ifrs results with ifrs numbers is available in the q1 2020 news release on our website all dollar amounts in this conference call are expressed in u s dollars unless otherwise indicated so without further delay i will turn the call over to philippe philippe morin chief executive officer and chief operating officer all right thank you vance and good afternoon everyone first of all i d like to take the opportunity to wish everyone on the call here a happy new year now turning to our financial results exfo opened fiscal 2020 with a strong first quarter performance with sales increasing 6 3 year over year to 73 6 million now this marked the fifth consecutive quarter with our sales results finished above the midpoint of our management guidance we re also pleased with our reported adjusted ebitda of 7 5 million or 10 3 of sales which set exfo on the right path to achieve our profitability target of 33 million for the fiscal year our organic sales increase is mainly due to a steady influx of test and measurement orders that were booked and shipped in q1 2020 versus a back end loaded q1 2019 and notably we benefited from strong demand from exfo s optical test solutions in our asia pac region in our first quarter of 2020 and increased appetite of our 400 gig test equipment along with our high end lab solution our bookings however were down versus the same period last year and if you recall we had reported our second highest bookings level of 81 2 million in q1 2019 which was due to an unprecedented calendar year calendar year end spending on the part of service providers in americas for our test and measurement products now given less less than year spending year end spending and some annual maintenance contracts renewal being pushed out in the second quarter our bookings totaled 69 9 million for a book to bill ratio of 0 95 in the first quarter of 2020 now we re not overly concerned about the data point as we secured three sass orders totaling more than 2 5 million in the first quarter of december sorry the first week of december related to our ran optimization real time network topology and as well active monitoring from mobile backhaul networks now these deals would have narrowed the bookings gap had they ve been obtained a few days earlier and are still a proof point that we re increasing our relevancy with our sass offering now speaking of our sass offering we recently rebranded all of their solutions under the new nova name for nova name brand for better consistency and positioning clarity i m confident these solutions will increasingly gain traction as we get closer to deployment of 5g networks later in the fiscal 2020 so in short our test and measurement business with sales of up to 12 4 year over year continues to thrive based on our innovation we bring to the market and ongoing tailwinds related to fiber build outs and high speed deployments on the sass side sales were down 8 6 year over year as we expected we witnessed order lumpiness as we build scale and navigate through complex customer requirements related to 5g and virtualized networks now let me provide you with our guidance for q2 2020 we re forecasting sales between 66 million and 71 million for the reporting period extending from december 1st 2019 to february 29th 2020 it should be noted that exfo recognized into revenue a 5 million network topology order in q2 2019 but we don t anticipate a similar high margin software deal in q2 2020 looking at the bottom line ifrs net loss is expected to range between negative 0 09 per share to negative 0 05 per share for the second quarter of 2020 ifrs net loss includes 0 05 per share and after tax amortization of intangible assets stock based compensation costs and anticipated foreign exchange loss so at this point i will like to turn the call over to pierre to cover our financials pierre plamondon chief financial officer thank you philippe sales increased 6 3 to 73 6 million in the first quarter 2020 from 69 2 million in the first quarter of 2019 as previously mentioned we increased our sales year over year mainly due to a more steady flow of customers among other in q1 2020 compared to the same period last year in which a significant portion of our other were back end loaded and only recognized into revenue in the following quarters we also benefited from stronger demand for our solution in the asia pac region in q1 20 compared to q1 19 bookings meanwhile decreased 13 9 year over year to 69 9 million in the first quarter of 2020 for a book to bill ratio of 0 95 gross margin before depreciation and amortization improved to 58 9 of sale in the first quarter of 2020 from 58 2 in the first quarter of 2019 the adoption of ifrs 16 raised our gross margin by 0 4 in q1 2020 while our q1 19 gross margin included 0 4 for restructuring expenses in terms of operating expenses selling and administrative expenses decreased to 24 5 million or 33 3 of sales in the first quarter of 2020 from 26 4 million or 38 1 of sales in the first quarter of 2019 the 1 9 million decrease in sg a expenses reflect the full impact of our 2018 restructuring plan the adoption of ifrs 16 and no restructuring charges in q1 2020 net r d expenses dropped to 11 7 million or 16 of sales in the first quarter of 2020 from 15 2 million or 22 of sales in the same period last year likewise the 3 5 million decrease in net r d expenses is linked to the positive impact of our 2018 restructuring plan the adoption of ifrs 16 and no restructuring charges in q1 2020 compared to 2 1 million expense in q1 2019 on the other end sg a and net r d expenses were negatively affected by inflation and 2019 salary increases ifrs net loss totaled 0 1 million or 0 00 per share in the first quarter of 2020 compared to a loss of 7 5 million of 0 14 per share in the first quarter of 2019 ifrs net loss in the first quarter 2020 included 1 4 million in after tax amortization of intangible assets 0 5 million in stock based compensation costs and a foreign exchange loss of 0 1 million ifrs net loss was impacted by restructuring charges of 2 7 million in the first quarter of 2019 adjusted ebitda totaled 7 5 million or 10 3 of sales in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 2 7 million or 3 9 of sales in the first quarter of 2019 exfo adopted ifrs 16 related to leases on september 1st 2019 which had a positive impact on adjusted ebitda of 0 9 million or 1 2 of sales in the first quarter of 2020 prior period amounts were not adjusted geographically the america accounted for 54 of total sales in q1 20 europe middle east and africa represented 29 while asia pacific totaled 17 in comparison the sales split was 51 32 and 16 among the three geographic region in the first quarter of 2019 in terms of customer mix our top customer accounted for 11 9 of total sales in q1 20 while our top three represented 19 7 turning to a few key points on the balance sheet our cash position decreased by 1 9 million to 17 5 million at the end of the first quarter of 2020 this decrease is mainly due to 6 5 million in cash flow used by operation 2 million for the purchase of capital asset 1 5 million for the repayment of lease liabilities and the long term debt and 0 2 million for the redemption of share capital these cash amounts were partially offset by an 8 4 million increase in our backlog in the first quarter of 2020 at the end of q1 20 exfo has a net debt position of 0 8 million and available revolving credit facilities up to 47 7 million at this point i will turn the call over to the operator for the start of the q a questions and answers operator thank you we ll go first to thanos moschopoulos with bmo capital markets thanos moschopoulos bmo capital markets analyst hi good afternoon so philippe if i look at your results this quarter and the guidance for next quarter it would seem you re looking for the first half of the fiscal year to be relatively flat year over year so i mean based on your commentary should we attribute that primarily to a tough year over year comp or what s the bigger picture here is it maybe that you re still seeing some pause from operators as they sort out through their 5g requirements philippe morin chief executive officer and chief operating officer yeah now i think the so yes so you re right so when you look at the first half to first half it will be roughly around a flat performance coupled to i would say two facts one is the test and measurement lumpiness that we had last year the year end money was greater than what we ve done this year what we ve seen this year and as well the centurylink customer know the context around that we ve announced last year if you remember the 5 million purchase order that also came into q2 that we don t believe we re going to realize a similar type of contract this quarter so that s kind of a combination of those two things thanos moschopoulos bmo capital markets analyst okay and then if we just look at sort of the sass business i mean the bookings have been a little softer in the last three quarters now obviously that s in lumpy segments but how would you characterize the pipeline your discussions with operators how and how those have evolved over the last while i mean would you still expect to see an inflection point maybe later this year as there is more 5g activity or is there any change in that time frame philippe morin chief executive officer and chief operating officer yeah so we re going to continue to see i guess we re predicting the inflection point more into the latter part of our fiscal year we see some of our if you remember we have three phased approach with regards to 5g deployment the first one is around the whole impacting our test and measurement for fiber build out and small cells and we re seeing the benefit of that the second phase is the ran optimization mobile backhaul monitoring and so on and that s continuing and we do expect to see some demand as i mentioned in my opening remarks and then the 5g real core deployment which we expect more into an inflection point into the latter part of 2020 we do see that there is still work being done rfqs being going through that hopefully will convert into our second half or 2020 in terms of our performance from a bookings point of view thanos moschopoulos bmo capital markets analyst okay would you still hope to achieve mid single digit revenue growth for the fiscal year philippe morin chief executive officer and chief operating officer yeah and as i mentioned as well achieving the 33 million of ebitda as well thanos moschopoulos bmo capital markets analyst okay and then a question for pierre taxes were higher this quarter what do that relate to pierre plamondon chief financial officer you know it s mostly a matter of timing of tax in different countries but for the next quarter we are expecting probably in again in tax expense average of 0 5 million for the quarter thanos moschopoulos bmo capital markets analyst okay and then looking at your guidance it would seem that opex should be relatively consistent in q2 relative to q1 is that correct pierre plamondon chief financial officer you need to remember that in q2 we had the salary increases starting in january 1st and we do have some abilities like insurance premium and so on that kick on again at the beginning of the year so and you have probably mentioned noticed that the currency is not playing in our favor in this quarter as the canadian dollar gets stronger compared to the previous quarter so though all of those in a manner tend to increase our opex for next quarter thanos moschopoulos bmo capital markets analyst okay and what level of fx gain or loss is embedded in your eps guidance pierre plamondon chief financial officer it s roughly 0 01 thanos moschopoulos bmo capital markets analyst okay alright thank you i ll pass the line pierre plamondon chief financial officer thank you operator we ll move next to todd coupland with cibc todd coupland cibc capital markets analyst hi good evening everyone i had a question on follow up question on the 5g what can we watch for from the outside to see whether the market is moving in line with your expectations over the course of this year what are some of the signs we should watch for philippe morin chief executive officer and chief operating officer yes so the we re monitoring ourselves as one activities associated with antennas small cells deployment and fiber deployment associated with it second is announcements around what i would call the 5g radio new radio selection from our customer base and then the virtualization announcements around in terms of what they re looking at modernizing their network and these are kind of the bellwether we re looking at with regards to the activities obviously internally we see rfqs and rfis that we received but from an external point of view these are kind of the activities i would say are either leading front end indicators of the 5g deployment about to happen todd coupland cibc capital markets analyst and the new i mean it s a good point on the new radios i mean this has been something the sector has been watching for for a while would you think that that happens when some of the later in calendar q1 early q2 releases from the carriers come out is that the kind of timing that s generally expected right now and so that will say yes the rfqs will turn into orders this year or do you have a different view of that philippe morin chief executive officer and chief operating officer yeah i think it really depends on by countries and it starts off as you know todd first of all there are going to be auction for the particular spectrum that in each of the respective countries and then in certain countries you ve seen already deployment of new radios being deployed obviously the us korea and china are examples of where that s taking place and then right behind that you ve got the opportunities for not only the new radio but the modernization or the virtualization of the core end and ran which follows right behind that so that s kind of the leading indicators that i think the industry should be looking for todd coupland cibc capital markets analyst okay and if you were to again just to be see if we could be as precise as possible characterize your view of the rollout of these indicators now versus three months ago has it changed at all and if so how philippe morin chief executive officer and chief operating officer what s changed versus three months ago i would say for depending on the regions again the level of some of our activities with response to responding to rfqs i think six months ago we were still having discussions around architecture and tocs now we re seeing some rfqs for monitoring for service assurance virtual service assurance that are starting to come in and then increasing that with that level of increasing activity depending again on the regions so that would be the the difference between three to six months ago todd coupland cibc capital markets analyst okay last question from me is there any way for you to characterize your market share now let s say versus last year or the last cycle do you directionally can you give any commentary on that philippe morin chief executive officer and chief operating officer yeah and i ll answer the market share i mean as you know we have two business units so on the test and measurement side they re optical test solution we believe we re number one market share and with the addition of our lab solutions with the acquisition that we made two years ago in yenista we actually believe we have increased our position there with regards to sass as you know the market is very fluid very dynamic there s a lots of solutions involved in this we like to use analysys mason data report about a month ago for the year of 2019 and they put us as number two at 9 market share for that year behind netscout but again that was probably full from a 2019 view so with a very focused on the service assurance probe virtual probe monitoring capability but as you know in our sass product we have fiber monitoring we have a simulator product so it becomes really more complex trying to figure out exactly where we stand in terms of that total market market share but overall like in the pro market we have made some improvement in our market share in the last 18 months todd coupland cibc capital markets analyst and is it too early to tell whether astellia is going to help you raise your market share for 5g particularly in the us philippe morin chief executive officer and chief operating officer well astellia for sure helps us with regards to being adding a solution and a portfolio that we didn t have before especially of virtualized solutions that we ve been able to implement into three uk and europe it also provides us with professional services capability that we didn t have before so absolutely it will help us in our positioning in north america for 5g and for service assurance deployment for 4g plus and 5g as well in north america todd coupland cibc capital markets analyst okay great i really appreciate the color thanks a lot philippe morin chief executive officer and chief operating officer thank you operator we ll move next to tim savageaux with northland capital markets steven northland capital markets analyst hi this is actually steven on for tim thank you for taking my call i was wondering if you guys could give us a little color any indication on the drivers for your guide next year in terms of like optical and protocol philippe morin chief executive officer and chief operating officer for the next quarter you mean guidance for the next quarter steven northland capital markets analyst yes correct yeah i just want to like what was that philippe morin chief executive officer and chief operating officer well yeah no i just want to make sure i thought you said guidance for next year so i just want to make sure we re talking about guidance for next quarter steven northland capital markets analyst yes next quarter philippe morin chief executive officer and chief operating officer yeah yeah so again as you may know q2 for us is from a seasonality point of view is a quarter that goes from november sorry december january and february which is a bit more of a challenge for us in terms of both the t m and the sass because you ve got obviously the holidays and chinese new year and so on and so that s a part of one take into account when we do the guidance the seasonality aspect of that and as well when you look at our backlog you look at the booking level our book to bill ratio being at 0 95 it really got us to a point where that s providing our guidance to make sure when we it is a realistic guidance for our revenue profile so it takes into account the seasonality it takes into account the service provider approval process and budgeting process that they go through at the beginning of the calendar year and it s also take into account the backlog that we walked into the quarter following our bookings that we did in q1 steven northland capital markets analyst okay great and then and do you think you could give us any more color on like optical compared to like last year and even compared to this quarter philippe morin chief executive officer and chief operating officer yes so the so what happened last year and again if just to remind everybody q4 of 2018 was a softer quarter for us from a t m point of view and q1 was very strong as i mentioned in my opening statement if you actually look at it from a six month point of view and you compare the six months q4 2019 with q1 2020 with the same period a year before what we re seeing is a t m market that s absolutely from a bookings point of view pretty flat so what we re seeing is more of an even out over six months of that particular activity in that particular market segment we do foresee as we talk to our service provider customers and our web scale customer that they continue to do the fiber build out there is you know and on top of that that s if you coupled with our 400 gig solution that were seeing some really nice momentum there and the ongoing lab the iron lab solution that we have we continue to foresee a good good high demand for that t m portfolio steven northland capital markets analyst okay thank you philippe morin chief executive officer and chief operating officer okay operator we ll hear next from christian sgro with canaccord christian sgro canaccord genuity inc analyst hi good evening just one question todd with with a longer term view would you point out any seasonality across the two business segments you often comment that the sass segment is lumpy but thinking about quarter to quarter in the longer term is it something we should be looking for in spending patterns and the spending environment philippe morin chief executive officer and chief operating officer so there is more a seasonality associated with the t m business than there is with the sass business the sass business tends to be more lumpiness from the point of view of bigger contracts longer sales cycles and when we close these deals as i mentioned earlier last year we closed there were 5 million deals of this assets tend to have multi year multi million dollar contract so there is no seasonality on the sass side it s more about closing deals and their longer sales cycles are more complex type of deal versus t m there is more seasonality aspect associated with it and as well being able to convert those bookings that tends to be more back ended into the quarter to be able to convert them into revenue christian sgro canaccord genuity inc analyst okay that s helpful but when you look quarter to quarter across the fiscal year is there a period in the year where you would say that new customers are looking to i think you called it budget flush or clear the budget or spend more or is that not so much a theme anymore philippe morin chief executive officer and chief operating officer and your question is on sass or on t m or overall christian sgro canaccord genuity inc analyst that s all t m philippe morin chief executive officer and chief operating officer okay so t m so the seasonality where there are year end money being spent and we saw some of it this year but not as much as last year it tends to be in q1 of our fiscal quarter now this year we saw some year end money but not as much as the previous year christian sgro canaccord genuity inc analyst that very helpful all right thank you for taking my questions philippe morin chief executive officer and chief operating officer thank you operator and at this time i d like to turn things back to ceo philippe morin for closing remarks philippe morin chief executive officer and chief operating officer all right thank you so just a few key takeaways before we conclude this call today so first exfo delivered a strong first quarter based on our sales mainly all of them are organic sales now increasing 6 3 year over year and an adjusted ebitda reaching 7 5 million or 10 3 of sales second we received more than 2 5 million of sass related orders in the first week of december and if we had secured these orders a few days earlier our book to bill ratio would have been closer to 1 in our q1 2020 and so consequently timing of orders continues to affect our sass business as we build the scale of that particular business unit we evaluate the performance of our sass business more and more into a six month period and i would actually encourage you to do likewise so finally exfo will be holding its annual meeting on wednesday 9 00 am at the vantage venues room l2 on the 27th floor located at 150 king street west in toronto both shareholders and analysts are welcome to attend at this point this concludes our q1 2020 conference call on behalf of the entire exfo team thank you for joining us today operator duration 29 minutes call
