say about australia the external position in 2018 was broadly in line with the level implied by medium term fundamentals and desirable policies the ca deficit in 2018 narrowed to about 2 per cent of

rates and acquisitions net of dispositions ebit margin was 15 4 an increase of 30 basis points versus the prior year and eps for the quarter was up 5 to 1 68 per share the results continue to demonstrate consistency and diversity of omnicom s operations our ability to deliver consumer centric strategic business solutions to our clients and our best in industry creative talent combined with market leading digital data and analytical expertise organic growth in the quarter was broad based across our agencies disciplines and client sectors looking first across disciplines advertising and media was up 4 4 with both advertising and media practices experiencing good growth in the quarter crm consumer experience was up 1 9 our precision marketing and digital agencies had double digit growth in the quarter this growth was offset by negative performance in our events business which had difficult comps as compared to the prior year as expected crm execution support was down 2 6 healthcare continues to be one of our best performing practice areas with growth of 8 4 omnicom health group has the top agencies in the world serving the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries and the group is very well positioned for continued growth and pr was down 1 3 in the quarter turning now to our performance by geography the us was up 3 2 in the quarter driven by strong results in advertising and media healthcare and our precision marketing group offset by declines in our events business and in crm execution support beyond the us the north american region primarily consisting of canada was up 11 8 in the quarter the uk was up 5 7 our agencies in the uk had solid results across advertising and media healthcare precision marketing and pr offset by declines in our crm execution support business overall growth in the euro and non euro region was 1 5 in the euro markets italy the netherlands and spain performed well france had negative growth as it continued to be impacted by the loss of a specialty print production client this impact will not cycle out until the first quarter of 2020 our events businesses in france also had a negative performance due to difficult comps versus 2018 in the non euro markets the czech republic russia and switzerland had better than average growth asia pacific organic growth was 1 9 led by new zealand and japan china had negative growth latin america was down 2 4 primarily due to the continuing challenges we face in brazil while we took several actions in the first half of 2019 to rationalize our operations in brazil

eur1 billion in both eight and 12 year bonds at very attractive interest rates of 1 2 overall we re very pleased with our performance this quarter omnicom s success is grounded in our steady focus on our growth strategies we continue to hire and develop the best talent in the industry with a fundamental commitment to creativity and diversity remained focused on relentlessly pursuing organic growth by expanding our service offerings to our existing clients and winning new business continue to invest in high growth areas and opportunities through internal initiatives and acquisitions and we remained vigilant on driving efficiencies throughout our organization increasing ebit and shareholder value let me now discuss what we re seeing in the marketplace and how our strategies enable us to sustain our financial performance having recently returned from the cannes lions festival of creativity a key takeaway was the return to celebrating creativity as the most sought after force in our industry before i speak about our creative ip i d like to spend a few minutes on tools we ve built to support our creators in 2009 we launched annalect our core data analytics and insights group with the responsibility for consolidating and developing our data and tech stacks annalect was established to deliver more effective and targeted media for our clients it has been instrumental in enhancing the services and capabilities of our media business over the years last year we took another step forward when annalect launched our people based precision marketing and insights platform called omni omni provides data and analytics cultural insights content inspiration and tech tools to inform powerful and connected brand strategies orchestrated across every touch point whether it s marketing sales or service and through all media these tools are developed to empower our people to derive better outcomes and results for their clients and they re available across our media creative and crm agencies importantly our data and analytics strategy is focused on three areas first is ensuring that the platforms remain open we prefer to rent the right data and technology that can improve our agility and client integration at any point in time rather than invest in legacy data assets and platforms that can easily become obsolete second we are making selective focused investments to develop and integrate differentiated tools in one place in support of the services our agencies offer and last we have prioritized these capabilities in our key markets while we have been and remained keenly focused on the importance of data analytics and technology we also realized they can only take us so far our investment in data and analytics have been made with the understanding that they are tools in service of creativity and content as i ve said before our true source of differentiation our ip is our ability to bring deep consumer insights to our clients in lockstep with brilliant creative ideas driving business results we are delivering on this promise by continuing to invest in our agency brands omnicom was founded by creators creativity which is in our dna is bred through a deep culture that must be nurtured over time in our case since our formation it is not something that can be acquired or sold we have also encouraged our agencies to maintain their unique positioning in go to market strategies this differentiation attracts top talent and needs to breakthrough ideas and results for our clients our creativity supported by data and insights was a key reason for omnicom s success at the annual cannes lions festival for the second consecutive year we were named holding company of the year with approximately 123 of our agencies across 35 countries winning over 200 lions speaking to the strength of our individual brands all three of our creative networks ddb bbdo and tbwa placed in the top 5 of network of the year category in addition we are extremely pleased to have jeff goodby and rich silverstein founders of goodby silverstein partners received this year s lion of st mark award as the chairman of cannes lions said this award was given to jeff and rich because of their profound influence not only in creating ground breaking work but also in inspiring others to create great work too it was a proud moment to see their legacy recognized one of tbwa s longer standing clients apple was also honored this year at cannes as the 2019 creative marketer of the year this award recognizes an organization that demonstrates sustained creative excellence and distinguishes itself by embracing collaboration between partners and agencies to produce truly outstanding creative campaigns cannes lions was just one example of how our agencies excelled this quarter let me just mention a few other recent highlights of how our agencies were recognized around the globe at the 2019 one show awards omnicom was named creative holding company of the year and ddb was named network of the year fleishmanhillard was named larger agency of the year at the 2019 sabre awards at this year s d ad pencil of the year ddb was ranked number 1 network of the year with

reflect our outstanding creativity and talent people drive our business success where they are pitching new business helping our clients to create powerful brands designing interactive web experiences or planning multi platform media campaigns we support them with a diverse inclusive environment that nurtures their creative energy this means diversity in backgrounds race gender age and experience omnicom s commitment to diversity and inclusion starts at the top with our board of directors i m proud to report that omnicom was recently recognized by fortune magazine as only one of six fortune 500 companies that have more women than men on its board of directors at a broader level omnicom was part of history last month as a platinum sponsor of the first ever worldpride celebration in new york city which also marked the 50th anniversary of the stonewall uprising working closely with new york city pride several omnicom agencies joined forces to provide branding and pr work for this year s celebration including interbrand rapp siegel gale tbwa worldhealth harrison star fleishman hillard ketchum porter novelli and rx mosaic it was an incredible team effort with planning and execution taking place over the course of two years we are proud to celebrate our lgbtq employees and show support for the greater community the best way we know how through our work in summary we ve made significant strides in changing our services capability and organization to better serve our clients while always staying true to our commitment to creativity we are pleased with our financial performance in the second quarter which continued to reflect the benefits of our strategies as we move into the second half of the year we are well positioned to deliver on our internal targets for the full year 2019 i will now turn the call over to phil for a closer look at the second quarter results phil philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you john and good morning as john said results for the second quarter of 2019 were in line with our expectations our operating results continue to be driven by outstanding client service provided by our agencies and net new business wins along with the positive impact that our efficiency initiatives have had on our cost structure and the benefits from the change in mix resulting from our repositioning actions for the second quarter organic revenue growth totaled 2 8 or 108 million the continued strength of the us dollar over the past 12 months created an fx headwind reducing our reported revenue by 100 million or 2 6 the reduction in revenue from dispositions made during the last 12 months primarily in our crm execution support discipline exceeded revenue from acquisitions in the quarter as a result our second quarter revenue was reduced by 148 million or about 3 8 in total our reported revenue decreased 3 6 to 3 7 billion in the quarter we will discuss the drivers of the changes in revenue in more detail in a few minutes turning to the income statement items below revenue our q2 operating profit or ebit was 574 million with a resulting operating margin of 15 4 which was up 30 basis points when compared to the second quarter of 2018 and our ebitda for the quarter was 595 million resulting in an ebitda margin of 16 up 20 basis points compared to last year s q2 we continue to see benefits from the change in business mix resulting from the disposition of several non strategic or underperforming agencies over the past year we also continue to seek out opportunities to increase operational efficiency throughout our organization focused on our real estate back office services procurement and it support services these actions continue to positively impact our operating performance net interest expense for the quarter was 50 2 million down 2 3 million compared to the second quarter of 2018 and up 4 2 million versus q1 of this year interest expense on our debt increased 2 2 million in the second quarter of 19 versus q2 of 18 this was driven by higher rates on our fixed to floating interest rate swaps which was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense due to a reduction in commercial paper activity compared to the prior year as you may recall this past february we issued eur520 million of 0 short term senior notes and a private placement to an investor outside the united states those notes will mature in august of 2019 as a result we ve been able to reduce our other short term borrowing needs including our commercial paper issuances which lowered our interest expense year over year the reduction in commercial paper activity relative to 2018 is expected to continue through the maturity of the notes next month interest income increased 2 5 million versus q2 of 18 as a result of an increase in our cash balances available for investment at our treasury centers when compared to q1 of 2019 interest expense increased 3 6 million primarily due to commercial paper borrowings during q2 compared to no cp borrowings during q1 of 19 additionally interest income from our treasury center activities decreased versus q1 as you are aware in early july we took steps to refinance some of our debt i will provide more details related to this later on in the presentation regarding income taxes our reported effective tax rate for the second quarter was 24 9 lower than our projected effective tax rate for the full year 2019 the reduction during the quarter was primarily related to the net favorable settlement of uncertain tax positions in various jurisdictions which resulted in the recognition of net deferred tax assets in the second quarter of 2019 for approximately 11 million we expect our effective tax rate for the third and fourth quarters to be in line with our previously estimated tax rate of 27 earnings from our affiliates was 1 2 million in the second quarter of 19 relatively flat compared to q2 of 2018 the allocation of earnings to the minority shareholders in our less than fully owned subsidiaries decreased to 23 4 million primarily due to our disposition activity as well as the impact of fx as a result net income for the second quarter was 370 7 million up 1 8 or 6 5 million when compared to the 364 2 million in q2 of 2018 now turning to slide two our diluted share count for the quarter decreased 3 2 versus q2 of last year 220 9 million shares as a result our diluted eps for the second quarter was 1 68 which is an increase of 0 08 or 5 when compared to our reported q2 eps for last year on slides three and four we provide the summary p l eps and other information year to date i ll give you just a few highlights organic revenue growth was 2 7 during the first six months of the year fx translation decreased revenue by 3 and the net impact of acquisitions and dispositions reduced revenue by 3 7 so for the year to date period revenue totaled 7 2 billion a decrease of 4 compared to the first six months of 2018 ebit totaled just over 1 billion and our year to date operating margin of 13 9 was up 50 basis points when compared to the first six months of 2018 and our six month diluted eps was 2 85 per share which was up 0 12 or 4 4 versus the first six months of 2018 turning to the components of our revenue change in the second quarter which is detailed on page five on a year over year basis strengthening of the dollar continues to create a significant fx headwind in our reported revenue the impact of changes in currency rates decreased reported revenue by 100 million or 2 6 for the quarter and as has been the case since the third quarter of 2018 the strengthening in the second quarter of 2019 was widespread on a year over year basis the dollar once again strengthened against every one of our major foreign currencies the largest fx movements in the quarter were from the euro the uk pound the australian dollar chinese yuan and the brazilian real looking forward if currency stay where they currently are the negative impact on our reported revenues is expected to be approximately 1 for the third quarter and 0 5 in the fourth quarter resulting in a negative impact for the full year of between 1 75 and 2 the impact of our recent acquisitions net of dispositions decreased revenue by 148 million in the quarter or 3 8 in line with the impact we previously projected and primarily driven by the sellbytel disposition and other actions we took from the second half of last year through the first quarter of 2019 we will cycle through the most significant of last year s dispositions by the end of this coming september based on transactions we ve completed to date our current expectations are that the impact of our acquisition activity net of dispositions will continue to be negative by approximately 3 for the third quarter and 1 5 for the fourth quarter resulting in an anticipated negative impact of 3 for the year turning to organic growth it was up 108 million for the quarter or 2 8 by discipline for the quarter we again saw mixed performance advertising and the healthcare led the way with solid organic growth our crm consumer experience businesses also performed well this quarter while pr and crm execution support continued to lag geographically our us and uk businesses had the strongest performance asia and continental europe were also positive overall although performance was mixed with several markets facing difficult comparisons q2 of last year while our two smallest regions latin america and the middle east and africa both were negative for the quarter slide six shows our mix of business by discipline for the first quarter the split was 56 for advertising and 44 for marketing services as of their organic growth by discipline our advertising discipline was up 4 4 advertising s organic growth was led by our media businesses along with solid performances by most of our global and national advertising agencies crm consumer experience was up 1 9 for the quarter strong performance from our precision marketing group was partially offset by reductions at our events businesses which faced difficult comparisons back to q2 of 2018 also within the discipline branding saw a good growth while our shopper and commerce businesses were slightly positive crm execution support continued to underperform this quarter positive performance by our field marketing businesses in continental europe was more than offset by the negative performance from our merchandising and point of sale businesses as well as our specialty production businesses pr was down 1 3 performance in the discipline continues to be mixed by geographic region the uk and asia were positive while our us continental europe and latin america agencies were negative and healthcare was up 8 4 as has been the case for the past year growth has been well balanced across the regions these agencies operate in on slide seven which details the regional mix of business you can see during the quarter the split was 54 in the us bit higher than typical because of the strength of the dollar relative to the other currencies we operate in 3 for the rest of north america 10 in the uk 18 for the rest of europe 11 for asia pacific 3 for latin america and the balance from our middle east and african markets as for the details of our performance by region on slide eight organic revenue growth in the second quarter in the us was 3 2 led by our advertising and media healthcare and crm consumer experience agencies our domestic pr agencies were down slightly while our crm execution support agencies had sluggish performance our other north american businesses were up year on year driven by the strength of our precision marketing and media offerings the uk was positive again this quarter up 5 7 with growth across most disciplines however the uncertainty regarding the uk s departure from the eu now scheduled for the fourth quarter of this year continues the rest of europe was up 1 5 organically in the quarter so the performance was decidedly mixed by market and discipline in our euro markets while spain and italy continued to turn in strong performances this quarter we saw weakness in germany and the negative performance in france and organic growth in europe outside the eurozone continues to be positive with many of our major markets in asia pacific facing difficult comps versus q2 of 2018 organic growth was 1 9 with japan and new zealand having strong performances this quarter our greater china agencies were down organically for the quarter due to reductions in our media businesses and in our events businesses china in particular was facing a difficult comparison to the prior period latin america was down 2 4 organically in the quarter due to weakness at our brazilian agencies which continue to face significant macroeconomic forces in the market while mexico was flat for the quarter and lastly the middle east and africa which is our smallest region was down for the quarter on slide nine we present our revenue by industry sector in comparing the year to date revenue for 2019 to 2018 we continue to see a slight shift in our mix to business with an increase in the contribution of our pharma clients offset by a decrease from our technology clients primarily as a result of the sellbytel disposition turning to our cash flow performance which we detailed starting on slide 10 in the first half of the year we generated 814 million of free cash flow including changes in working capital as for our primary uses of cash on slide 11 dividends paid to our common shareholders were 280 million up slightly versus the first six months of last year the 0 05 per share increase in the quarterly dividend that was effective with the quarterly payment in april was partially offset by a reduction in common shares over the past 12 months dividends paid to our non controlling interest shareholders totaled 46 million capital expenditures were 49 million year to date down compared to 2018 due to less leasehold improvement activity and an increase in our equipment leasing program acquisitions including earn out payments totaled 34 million a decrease when compared to this point last year and stock repurchases net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans increased to 524 million all in we outspent our free cash flow by about 120 million in the first half of 2019 before discussing the details of our capital structure at the end of the quarter on slide 12 i want to review the steps we recently took related to refinancing some of our debt on july 8th we issued eur500 million of eight year senior notes due in 2027 at an effective rate of 0 92 and we issued an additional eur500 million of 12 year senior notes due in 2031 at 1 53 the euro note issuance after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses resulted in net proceeds of 1 1 billion at an average rate of 1 23 part of the proceeds were used to retire the 500 million 2019 senior notes which matured this past monday july 15th in addition on july 2nd we called 400 million of the 2020 senior notes for redemption on august 1st the balance of the proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes our expected ongoing long term debt portfolio will be comprised of 4 billion in dollar denominated debt and eur1 billion in euro denominated debt we expect interest expense for the second half of 2019 to be reduced when compared to 2018 by approximately 3 million in q3 after recording expected book loss on the early extinguishment of part of our 2020 notes and by 10 million in q4 our net debt position at the end of the quarter was 2 6 billion up around 1 4 billion compared to year end december 31st 2018 the increase in net debt was a result of the typical uses of working capital which historically are highest in the first half of the year and which totaled about 1 3 billion as well as the use of cash in excess of our free cash flow of approximately 120 million these increases in net debt were partially offset by the cash we received from our disposition activity 75 million and the slightly positive effect of exchange rates on cash during the first six months of the year which increased our cash balance by about 10 million compared to june 30th 2018 our net debt is down approximately 340 million the decrease was primarily driven by the positive change in operating capital during the past 12 months of approximately 205 million and the cash proceeds received from the sale of subsidiaries during the past year 385 million partially offsetting these increases over the past 12 months was an overspend of our free cash flow of approximately 80 million and the negative impact of fx on our cash balances which was also approximately 80 million as for our debt ratios they remain solid our total debt to ebitda ratio was 2 3 times reflecting the issuance of the euro denominated zero coupon note in q1 while our net debt to ebitda ratio fell to 1 1 times and due to the year over year increase in our interest expense our interest coverage ratio decreased to 9 6 times but remained strong and finally on slide 13 you can see we continue to manage and build the company through a combination of well focused internal development initiatives and prudently priced acquisitions for the last 12 months our return on invested capital ratio was 23 3 and our return on equity was 56 3 and that concludes our prepared remarks please note that we have included a number of other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review but at this point we re going to ask the operator to open the call for questions thank you questions and answers operator our first question will come from the line of alexia quadrani with jpmorgan please go ahead alexia quadrani jpmorgan analyst thank you so much just two questions i guess first off just following up on the ongoing improvement in the us organic growth i know it s kind of nitpicking and it s not necessarily the way you guys look at it but if you have some color you can give us on whether you think the improvement is really driven by the better influx or better mix of new business wins you know less losses are you really seeing some underlying improvement at your agencies or an existing client spend john d wren chairman and chief executive officer you said you had a second question alexia quadrani jpmorgan analyst i do i ll go ahead you want me to ask it now john d wren chairman and chief executive officer yeah go ahead alexia quadrani jpmorgan analyst it s just on international you gave great color thank you john about the different regions in the quarter and i think you mentioned that brazil for example to be a challenge for the rest of the year i m curious if you have any other sort of color you can add about the outlook of the other major regions how we should look to the other major regions for the back half of the year john d wren chairman and chief executive officer okay in terms of us organic growth you re absolutely right we do not look at it on a quarterly basis we look at it across the year and where our what we expect clients to spend because money can shift from quarter to quarter and when you re in the 2 to 3 growth range those shifts have a meaningful impact on the percentages that we report we had a solid performance i mean i think contributing to it was where clients decided to spend and some of the new business wins from last year but there is not i can t point out any one obvious reason for the particular growth that we reported phil might have philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think any one quarter doesn t necessarily make a trend but we are pleased with the results with respect to the us performance and our overall outlook for the company has always been on the consolidated growth profile we don t necessarily nitpick it by country or by region but we re certainly pleased with the second quarter john has referenced to the percentages themselves within a quarter can vary so we re certainly cautiously optimistic about the second half john d wren chairman and chief executive officer and then in terms of international growth brazil we do point out because we ve had to take actions and it is still a work in progress for us to get it to the level that we would like it to be as you go across the rest of the world the uncertainties that exist because of geopolitical decisions will have some impact on what goes on with our clients and spending we cannot predict what s going to happen with brexit the good news is we don t have a lot of financial service clients in the uk we don t know what s going to happen with tariffs and what the reaction to that s going to be so we remain optimistic cautious and trying to gain market share in all the places we operate in alexia quadrani jpmorgan analyst and just one follow up on your us commentary some of the new business was some of the headline clients which i know is not necessarily everything that you see it seems like a little slower to kind of ramp post their announcements that they shift their accounts on the last year do you see still from what you see today maybe a greater tailwind of new business benefit in the back half of the year than you did in the first half john d wren chairman and chief executive officer you re correct in your comment that some of those headline accounts are slower to ramp up and will start to contribute more in the second half but i don t think meaningfully enough to affect our overall guidance of growth of 2 to 3 alexia quadrani jpmorgan analyst okay thank you very much operator our next question will come from the line of tim nollen with macquarie please go ahead tim nollen macquarie research analyst john i wonder if you could elaborate a bit more please on your commentary on renting data and technology rather than buying it is quite a difference from at least two of your peers and yet your growth rate has been better than at least one of those so i just wonder if you could give us a bit more on kind of the logic behind us and what difference it actually makes to work with third party data versus having access to first party data and in terms of renting technology versus owning thanks john d wren chairman and chief executive officer okay as an overall statement since it seems to be of interest to not only you but probably others we did look at both of those acquisitions that our competitors made and if we thought they were worth it we would have purchased them ourselves but going back to your question there is risk when you do a transaction like that there is huge integration risk you ve seen it in some instances in other companies in our industry where they ve done previously done very large acquisitions for their size and not really been able to successfully integrate them within a relatively period as short period of time the other thing and the other real risk is their legacy businesses in europe most of them don t operate but they ve gdpr i can t tell what the risk is going to be to that data delivering safe data for brands and what the regulations are going to be in the united states let alone china or anywhere else so to us as we looked at it the risk versus the data versus our ability to obtain the same data but in a very relevant up to date way there was no roi on the transactions for us our systems have always been open and unbiased and we think that s critical it s critical for us to get the best results for our clients and we re focused on creating meaningful outcomes for our clients i have never wanted to be in a position where the way i sell you something or the way i work on your behalf you have to buy what legacy systems that i put in place and i don t have any flexibility of changing those systems to improve them with whatever the marketplace seems to offer or needs to offer philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer i will just add we ve been building and investing in the annalect and omni platform for the last 10 years it s something that we ve done internally spend an awful lot of time and energy in having one common platform that s going to continue to evolve and as john had said in an open fashion it s also a global platform not just the us platform and we re going to continue to invest in it going forward and maintain the flexibility we have to work with various best in class partners and get the data that we need when we need it from a variety of sources it s much more flexible approach and one that we can scale tim nollen macquarie research analyst can i just tack on to that last bit that you just mentioned phil about and it s again back to the first versus third party data i mean do you have access to the first party data you need we hear more and more about how important that is or do you have that or do you disagree that it s so important if third party data serves your purposes philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer look the first to keep in mind now the first party data is the clients data it s not our data and i think to the extent we need it to help whichever client we re working with we can easily and effectively help clients integrate our third party data with their first party data in a very effective way and we do that for many clients today and we expect to continue to do that in the future we don t seek a situation where in the short term or even in the long term that clients are essentially going to give up the ownership of that first party data but they need a partner to help them to more meaningfully merge that data with relevant third party data to come up with solutions to help them reach the consumers they are trying to reach john d wren chairman and chief executive officer and said another way we don t need to own it to connect to that data on behalf of our clients and we do that and the data that those companies that i think you re alluding to pales in comparison to the quality of the clients having on their own tim nollen macquarie research analyst all right thanks very much for the explanations john d wren chairman and chief executive officer guess people are excited because it s a headline but when you look to the substance of it we think god bless them but it will be a challenge tim nollen macquarie research analyst okay thanks a lot john d wren chairman and chief executive officer sure operator next question comes from the line of ben swinburne with morgan stanley please go ahead benjamin swinburne morgan stanley analyst i m not an economist per se but i wanted to get a sense from you when you look at the outlook in the us and also globally how you re thinking about the macro backdrop because we re seeing a really strong ad market here in the us you guys had nice us and advertising results this quarter you mentioned you were optimistic for the back half but there are a lot of leading indicators on the macro side it looked like they have rolled over and people seem to be getting more cautious about sort of factory orders or capital goods or sort of business investment obviously the fed talking about slower growth so i m just curious i d love to get your perspective on all that and how you reconcile the strong ad market with what seems to be a slowing broader macro and if you have thoughts on that i d love to hear it john d wren chairman and chief executive officer i m no economist either so i can take that for what it s worth but in speaking to many of our clients each industry has particular concerns but if i had to sum it up everybody most people believe that the us economy continues to perform well but same time they recognize that the us economy has never performed this well for this long at any point in the past and so at some point you can expect some dips or some changes nobody can figure out when i do think you see it having more of an impact in long term planning in terms of some of our clients that have to commit capital to their businesses in the future it doesn t have the same type of impact on the advertising business because we nothing is completely flexible but we re very vigilant about what our clients are doing and what they tell us they are going to do and the services that we offer so we can be a bit more nimble than many many businesses which require a lot more capital to do things benjamin swinburne morgan stanley analyst all right that makes sense and then maybe just a separate follow up on the competitive front with the it consulting firms they get a lot of press in the marketplace one of the things i saw recently is i m sure as you know a lot of these consultants audit agency buying for their clients while at the same time they are competing for business and i think there have been some agencies or holding companies that have balked at allowing that and turning over media data to get audited by what is essentially a competitor i was just curious if you thought this was a big issue if yes or no and if it is sort of what are the options for you to sort of navigate this what seems to be a rising source of conflict on the competitive front john d wren chairman and chief executive officer yeah there is no absolute answer to your question but this is not a new problem and oftentimes most times with these clients we mutually agree on who is going to audit and not audit our results and i don t know of any of the major holding companies that have really easily agreed with to having them come in and ask the type of questions you are referring to i applaud mark read in making it a more public issue but privately this issue has been dealt with on a client by client basis for a long time benjamin swinburne morgan stanley analyst got it thank you john d wren chairman and chief executive officer sure operator next question comes from the line of julien roch with barclays please go ahead julien roch barclays capital analyst yes good morning thank you for taking the question my first one is on crm execution support that has been a problem for a while so when can you turn this around or is it structurally challenged for many years to come and into later further disposition secondly you mentioned several times in your opening remarks that some of your event businesses had impacted revenue in certain geography in which divisions do you put event and what percentage of revenue does this activity represent broadly and then lastly can we have a sense of the total investment in annalect and omni in the last 10 years so we can compare that to how much some of your competitors have spent externally thank you john d wren chairman and chief executive officer you go ahead phil philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer so as far as crm execution support goes i think the businesses that remain in the portfolio we continue to work with management and actually management of the practice area to get them focused on improving their execution i think we ve done a lot in terms of what we intended to do as far as our disposition strategy as it relates to the businesses in that portfolio but longer term we don t expect them to grow as rapidly as the rest of our portfolio and we expect we ll continue to evaluate the pieces of that portfolio as we go forward we do have some good businesses that have been performing well in that portfolio they tend to be the smaller pieces of the portfolio so we re going to continue business as usual and trying to help them execute better and turn themselves around but we ll also continue to reevaluate the portfolio as we go down the road with respect to the events businesses i m not if you could repeat your question i m not sure i got the last part of it julien roch barclays capital analyst first of all in which division is it i assume it s in crm but which bit of crm philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah it s in the consumer experience portion julien roch barclays capital analyst it s in the consumer experience okay and then broadly what percentage of the total omnicom business is it are we talking about 1 of revenue 5 of revenue philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer it s probably less than 5 of our revenue on a global basis julien roch barclays capital analyst okay and then the last question on annalect and omni investment philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think one broad comment and then i ll turn it to john but certainly we ve invested quite a bit over the last 10 years in annalect and omni but probably not close to what the two recent acquisitions the spend on the two recent acquisitions have been by our two of our main competitors john d wren chairman and chief executive officer the only thing i d add is we have made significant investments in the whole area of technology annalect tools some other investments as well the way that we ve made these investments is internally so we expense them as incurred we don t capitalize them so you won t see it on our balance sheet or goodwill for that matter i m no accountant but i do know and it gets quite a bit of priority from the management of omnicom and the management of other creative businesses because of the importance of the tools that we re creating and what we re doing so if you go back which i don t suggest you have to do and listen to prior conference calls or read any one of our prior transcripts you ll see that we ve been talking about this for 10 years or so philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer yes the bulk of the investment has been in potentially people as well as some software tools and technology tools but it is something that certainly has run through the p l it hasn t been trying to piece together and integrate a bunch of acquisitions but we also recognize that it s an investment we need to continue to make and expect to continue to make we continue to maintain and upgrade the platform as technology changes and as the media landscape changes julien roch barclays capital analyst but if you had to venture like an amount for investment are we talking couple of hundred million 500 million close to 1 billion over 10 years or is it too hard to do just to have a really broad sense philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer it s not too hard we just don t we spend what we need we don t add it up and pat ourselves on the back for having spent it and john d wren chairman and chief executive officer yeah i mean you could philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer we don t have it john d wren chairman and chief executive officer you could also include or exclude a number of other miscellaneous costs so do you include the training in that investment the training in the people which is now global or don t you how do you calculate those numbers it s an integrated integral part of the business that we don t spend a considerable amount of time trying to figure out every last dollar so that we could report it and have it make a big splash on how much we ve invested and well it s an integral integrated part of the business and investing in this platform is something we re going to continue to do and it s just the basic part of the business julien roch barclays capital analyst okay very clear thank you very much john d wren chairman and chief executive officer sure operator our next question comes from the line of michael nathanson with moffettnathanson please go ahead michael nathanson moffettnathanson research analyst thank you i have one for john and then one for john or phil john question for you is you started the call by saying there has been a return to the celebration of creativity as a force i wonder in that return as that acknowledgment of creativity are you seeing any change in maybe the pressures on fees or maybe a reranking of priorities for your clients so is there anything that is a business outcome from what you acknowledge as maybe a different focus now on clients john d wren chairman and chief executive officer before i answer your question this should be the last question that we take because i think the market is just about to open michael nathanson moffettnathanson research analyst okay john d wren chairman and chief executive officer it s a recognition i think and it s a recognition for the first time in a long time that people realize clients realize that the differentiation is the quality of the creative people that you have somebody previously asked about consultants that go back to cannes two years ago the place was crawling with some of the people that we referred to in the earlier question there were very few of them there this year if there were any at all because they can put in enterprise systems and do fancy things and pretend like they are in our business but in fact they don t have any creative assets and creating a global network of creative assets is not a simple matter i think if you i m not the only one saying it i think in some of the i think maurice levy was interviewed at sun valley and he pointed out that when you get through all the changes that are going on in the business the key thing which remains constant and most important is creativity so that s always been our dna i think not only do we recognize it and we really cherish it and nurtured it since our beginning i believe the rest of our competition recognizes that it s the only differentiation in value that we can really bring to the party you said you had two questions michael nathanson moffettnathanson research analyst yeah the other one was just on acquisition patterns is the lack of spending this year acknowledgment of either a change of prioritization or just timing of deals or maybe just the pricing of deal so usually you guys do enter the marketplace and buy some assets but this year you ve done very little so i just wanted to know what s driving that john d wren chairman and chief executive officer phil can answer but i would say mostly circumstance we ve recognized the same thing in the second quarter and we since then put more resources in the area looking for certain selective acquisitions it s going to take some time to identify them and then to bring them into the fold philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think we certainly want to do more acquisitions than less in terms of how we use our free cash flow if we can find the right ones this particular quarter there were two acquisitions in particular that we ve been working on for quite some time one of them we just couldn t complete we couldn t come to terms they weren t economic terms that were the issue other things and the other just didn t happen this quarter from a timing perspective i think we do have a pipeline in place that we ve been working but as john had said we are taking some actions to kind of redouble our efforts to find deals i think from a pricing perspective that really hasn t been what has held us up or caused us to do less this year than last year last year we had some excellent candidates and got some deals done that have been very successful we expect that we ll do more of those in the future michael nathanson moffettnathanson research analyst okay thank you both philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you thank you everybody for taking the time to join the call operator our next question will come from the line of adrien de saint hilaire please go ahead john d wren chairman and chief executive officer i think we have to unfortunately end the call operator given the market is now open operator okay john d wren chairman and chief executive officer thank you everybody have a great day operator duration 63 minutes call participants shub mukherjee investor relations john d wren chairman and chief executive officer philip j

by the global economy is in the worst crisis since the great depression of the 1930s despite unparalleled affluence in the western world personal and corporate bankruptcies are soaring so is consumer credit millions are losing jobs more millions their homes the united states national debt is measured in trillions of dollars headlines of credit fraud identity theft and corruption fill the news events are spinning out of control in my own opinion the greatest threat the united states faces in the 21st century is not russia china iran or climate change but rather the reckless monetary and fiscal policies of the united states should the u s dollar collapses it will be the single most substantial affair in human history no money in human account has ever had an extraordinary impact globally as the u s dollar all other currency crises have been regional in nature and there were other currencies for people to use a u s dollar collapse would be global and it will bring down all other fiat currencies history is filled with sudden currency collapses venezuela zimbabwe argentina and weimar republic germany have each experienced awful currency crises since the 1900s the cause any currency collapse is usually the lack of faith in the stability of the currency for trade and exchange as soon as users stop believing that a currency is useful due to inflation and low growth that currency is in serious trouble ron paul the american people are not suffering from an excess of free markets they suffer from an excess of taxes regulations and especially fiat money therefore populist conservatives should join libertarians in seeking to eliminate federal regulations repeal the 16th amendment and restore a free market monetary system instead of fighting to end the welfare regulatory system that benefits economic and political elites at the expense of average americans populist conservatives are promoting increased economic interventionism for example many populist conservatives support increased infrastructure spending and tariffs and other forms of protectionism like all forms of central planning these schemes prevent goods and services from being used for the purposes most valued by consumers this distorts the marketplace and lowers living standards including of people whose jobs are temporally saved or created by these government interventions those workers would be better off in the long term finding new jobs in a free market anti free market conservatives ignore how their policies harm those they claim to care about for example protectionism harms farmers and others working in businesses depending on international trade the most common complaint of social conservatives is that libertarianism promotes immorality these conservatives confuse a libertarian s opposition to outlawing drugs for example with moral approval of drug use many libertarians condemn drug use and other destructive behaviors however libertarians reject the use of government force to prevent individuals from choosing to engage in these behaviors instead libertarians support the right of individuals to use peaceful means to persuade others not to engage in destructive or immoral behaviors libertarians also support the right of individuals not to associate with or to subsidize in any way those whose lifestyles or beliefs they find objectionable social conservatives object to libertarians because social conservatives wish to use government power to force people to be good this is the worst type of statism because it seeks to control our minds and souls most people accept the idea that it is wrong to initiate force against those engaging in peaceful behaviors libertarians apply this nonaggression principle to government making government follow the nonaggression principle would end unjust wars income and inflation taxes and the destruction caused by the use of force to control what we do with our property how we raise our children who we associate with and what we put into our bodies making governments abide by the nonaggression principle is the only way to restore a society that is free prosperous and moral the weakness of the u s dollar the weakness of the us dollar is primarily that it is a fiat currency just like every other major global currencies without the discipline of the gold standard governments print too much money for political purposes if the us federal reserve prints too much dollars the value of the currency will fall fortunately apart from the united states nearly all the reserve currency implement similar monetary policies like the united states this thinking is tragically wrong what world empire with half america s problems ever survived the economies of america and other nations of the west will soon collapse into full blown bankruptcy this will happen although things could temporarily get a little better various individual states will in fact likely precede this country into bankruptcy and thus hasten the overall collapse of course nature abhors a vacuum and a european based world government will step in to fill america s abdication as global leader private corporate debt in the us stands at

primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us this cannot now be far away the world as you know it including your life and i mean all aspects of it will change beyond your wildest imagination so far we have only discussed government debt private debt from loans and credit cards amounts to an additional 54 000 for every american compared to an average savings of only 2 700 since 2007 7 trillion has been lost in the u s stock market and 6 trillion in its housing market these are devastating losses to people s investments including stocks bonds retirement plans employee stock ownership and home values hopes and dreams crash daily global downward spiral employment is now shrinking at the fastest rate since the great depression unemployment percentages have climbed into the double digits in the united states and this does not include the discouraged who have given up looking many other countries are much worse the combination of exploding debt and unemployment is hitting home in 2009 alone well over 1 million americans declared bankruptcy with more and more families also winding up jobless and in despair facing abject poverty this problem is worldwide many well educated middle class people now live on unemployment or welfare and food stamps having never thought this could happen to them tent cities are springing up across america thousands are living in cars and growing numbers now live in sewer systems will the u s dollar collapse the question isn t if the u s dollar will collapse but rather when what would cause a u s economic collapse the united states cannot sustain the national debt that it got at 22 trillion as the national debt continues to increase interest rates must go up as well if america s debt is soo massive why hasn t it collapsed yet the answer is simple major economies like japan china and the european union still invest in the us economy also the u s accurately pays off its bonds worth trillions of dollars a year events that could trigger the u s dollar collapse first of all the federal reserve starts to print too much paper money to pay for politicians spending program social security medicare defense spending debt servicing creating hyperinflation in the united states next china implements its nuclear option to dump its u s treasuries holdings china is the world s biggest u s treasury investor owning over 1 12 trillion by continuously purchasing u s treasuries it keeps borrowing costs very low for u s companies and government by dumping its treasury holdings bond yields would increase and interest rates will rise making it very expensive for the u s government and companies to borrow fund their operations budget deficits and savings shortfalls to avoid this problem the federal reserve has been stepping in to buy u s treasury bonds it may not be in china s interest to dump its u s treasuries but it definitely has the power to do it if china does other us debt holding countries could also dump their u s debt holdings causing panic food crisis queuing case of a food shortage you should be aware that grocery stores only have about 3 days of food in stock people will rush and buy as much as they can so probably the food will vanish in less than a day or hours so if anything was to disrupt the food supply chain for an extended period of time there would be chaos in most communities it s very important to start preparing now there are several ways to start the choice you make should depend on the event you are preparing for of course the best way is to prepare for all scenarios including long periods what would happen in an economic collapse modern economies are built mostly on faith people have confidence in the u s dollar because the u s economy is the biggest and most significant economy in the world also the u s economy frequently outperforms the economies of europe and japan the us dollar is backed up by the output of american workers when people do lose faith in the u s dollar its value will plunge the stock market will crash and the u s economy will collapse the u s national debt is over 22 trillion however the total the us total debt debt owed by state local governments household businesses financial institution and the federal government is a staggering 74 trillion the point i m making is that this charade cannot continue much longer china the european union india brazil russia and other major economies are very aware of this coming crisis it s hard to imagine the u s dollar being replaced by another currency as the world s economic standard but it could very well happen it is possible to wake up one morning and see the u s dollar slide into a death spiral stocks in a free fall and hyperinflation if the u s dollar and the economy collapses the result will be the most significant stock market crash ever in the new york stock exchange probably 1000 2000 points in the first day thus the major stock exchange in london frankfurt tokyo and hong kong will have to suspend trading of course this suspension will significantly increase the panic among the general population once people all over the world realize that they are a significant stock market crash happening there will be a run on banks similar to the 1930s in response major financial institutions will put a freeze on most or all banking transactions including credit card transactions this will significantly increase panic due to the bank freeze employers will be unable to make bank transactions to pay their employees with employers unable to access frozen bank accounts people won t be paid bills won t get paid etc consequently most businesses will be forced to either go out of business or significantly reduce their workforce unemployment will become rampant with millions out of a job the number of unemployment claims will skyrocket bankrupting unemployment insurance programs in the major countries when people realize that the value of their hard earned wealth is about to evaporate they will take drastic measures to prevent it those who own stores and businesses will increase their prices for goods and services drastically to survive the crisis panic hoarding of food medical supplies gasoline heating oil and other commodities will erupt runaway inflation gas lines and rationing will begin widespread violence will explode across america that could range from inner city riots or gang wars the breakdown of law and order will be the ultimate effect of rioting and looting as they lose all their sense of right and wrong and are increasingly empowered in their sense of anger panic and greed major social upheaval will occur in america and the fear of the unknown will set in amongst the populace the u s will be hardest hit because it has the largest economy an enormous national debt an economy based on credit and a population greatly divided by race ethnic origin gender color religious beliefs cultural differences and financial status
much of the outlook remains very unclear for the sector with falling rates and the potential for further economic weakness in the united states said joshua mahony senior market analyst with ig in london the top three us indexes moved lower after president donald trump said there was a long way to go with china on trade and threatened to put tariffs on another us325 billion of chinese goods in a really quiet market a headline like this has a magnified effect so even if it s not something investors don t already know it can move the market with ease said michael antonelli managing director institutional sales trading at robert w baird in milwaukee while bets on a us rate cut remain steady the data isn t cooperating june retail sales really put an exclamation point on what is poised to be a very robust 2q for consumer spending rbc capital markets tom porcelli said in a note not only was the critical retail control measure ex autos gasoline building materials much firmer at 0 7 consensus 0 3 but there were back month upward revisions aplenty retail control adjusted for core inflation is now sitting at 6 1 annualized in 2q which goes down as the best pace since 3q03 when the economy was only beginning to accelerate away from the infamous jobless recovery advertisement this means we are very likely to see a 4 handle on overall real consumer spending for 2q when that prints just a few days ahead of the july fomc meeting in other words the fed is poised to cut rates even in the face of very sound economic fundamentals in place when it comes to the most significant part of

by simon black 75 years ago this month a group of 744 delegates from around the world gathered at the very posh mount washington hotel in new hampshire to build a brand new global financial system the year was 1944 world war ii was still raging in europe and the pacific but with the successful invasion of normandy well underway the allies knew that hitler s days were numbered and they needed to start preparing for a post war world everyone knew the us would emerge from world war ii as the the dominant superpower so the financial system they designed put the united states at the center of the world economy they called it the bretton woods system named for the town in new hampshire where they gathered and their central idea was that the value of the us dollar would be fixed to gold at a rate of 35 per troy ounce while every other currency would be fixed to the us dollar the swiss franc for example was fixed at a rate of 4 3 francs per us dollar while the danish krone was fixed at 4 8 bretton woods ushered in a period of remarkable economic stability worldwide during the roughly quarter century that the bretton woods system was in place banking crises were almost nonexistent recessions were rare and global debt fell from nearly 150 of gdp at the end of world war ii to roughly 30 by the early 1970s then it all came to a screeching halt in 1971 the united states weighed down by a costly war in vietnam suddenly and unilaterally terminated the agreement the us government wanted the flexibility to print as much money as it needed without being forced to maintain the gold standard so the whole system collapsed practically overnight and it was replaced by a new standard where unelected central bankers have supreme authority to conjure near infinite quantities of money out of thin air the effects have been pretty disastrous ever since the end of bretton woods global debt has skyrocketed to roughly 200 trillion approximately 225 of gdp banking crises and financial shocks have become much more commonplace market crashes are more severe recessions are more common inflation worldwide has soared it s ironic that back in 1944 the price of a room at the mount washington was 18 today it s over 250 perhaps most of all we now regularly witness some of the most extreme financial anomalies imaginable and one of the most obvious examples of this is negative interest rates in a number of countries including switzerland japan denmark and the entire eurozone central bankers have printed so much money that interest rates are actually negative if you buy a ten year german government bond for instance your annual investment return will be negative 0 27 per year based on this morning s rates that s insane but just a few days ago the insanity reached a whole new level we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us according to the wall street journal there are now some junk bonds in europe that have negative yields think about this a junk bond is basically debt issued by a company with financials so risky that analysts expect there s a good chance the company won t pay its debts hell the company might not even be in business by the time the debt matures and yet despite these substantial risks investors are willing to loan money to these companies at negative rates of return seriously you take all that risk and then guarantee that you ll lose money honestly i m not a pessimistic person but this sort of absurdity makes me pause and consider what might happen next the global economic expansion is one of the longest on record ever financial markets around the world are soaring at all time highs stocks bonds real estate one of the only things we know for sure about financial markets is that they are always cyclical up down boom bust these cycles have been with us forever it s impossible to predict exactly when the decline will occur but when you see junk bonds with negative yields it s likely that we re probably close to the end of the boom phase it s possible this madness could continue for a while longer or it could end tomorrow no one has a crystal ball but the important fact is to realize that at some point this trend has got to correct all the trillions of dollars printed out of thin air to buy securities that yield negative interest rates will eventually have consequences that s why i think makes sense to take sensible steps to protect yourself no matter what happens next that s why i own gold gold is still one of the only asset classes in the world that s not anywhere near an all time high unlike stocks bonds and real estate in fact relative to what s going on in the world gold is downright cheap gold is something people tend to buy in times of uncertainty and right now there is a lot of uncertainty between trade disputes financial madness and the bolsheviks coming to power i see a lot of reasons to own gold gold is also at an interest tipping point gold supplies around the world are falling and that could be a major catalyst for much higher gold prices in the future it s never a good idea to dump all your life savings into any one thing but at a time when central banks are printing more money out of thin air and the bull market is long in the tooth allocating a portion of your savings to gold can make a lot of sense as part of sovereign man s 10th

overview after slapping punitive tariffs on structural steel from china and mexico last week us president trump threatened to end the tariff truce with china because it has not stepped up its

its first estimate of q2 gdp next week something near what the fed considers as the non inflationary pace or long term rate 1 8 seems reasonable but even an upside surprise would not be sufficient to

powerful way to get donald j trump realdonaldtrump july 12 2019 if mexico produces which i think they will biggest part of deal with mexico has not yet been revealed china is similar except they devalue currency subsidize companies to lessen effect of 25 tariffs so far little effect to consumers companies will relocate to u s donald j trump realdonaldtrump july 12 2019 with the u s and wishes it had not broken the original deal in the first place in the meantime we are receiving billions of dollars in tariffs from china with possibly much more to come these tariffs are paid for by china devaluing pumping not by the u s taxpayer donald j trump realdonaldtrump july 15 2019 and tuesday morning he tweeted that his administration will take a look into whether google is guilty of treason for working with the chinese government despite no evidence to support the claim besides an accusation leveled by billionaire investor and trump backer peter thiel billionaire tech investor peter thiel believes google should be investigated for treason he accuses google of working with the chinese government foxandfriends a great and brilliant guy who knows this subject better than anyone the trump administration will take a look donald j trump realdonaldtrump july 16 2019 while trump plays bad cop others in his inner circle are promoting the potential resumption of negotiations treasury secretary steven mnuchin said monday the two sides are set to hold a principal level call this week if all goes well mnuchin said he will travel to beijing with u s trade representative robert e lighthizer to continue talks advertisement but some china watchers say there may be less to the administration s latest china maneuverings than meets the eye i think our side is gradually coming to recognize that they ve painted themselves into a corner here says bill reinsch a trade expert at the center for strategic and international studies the chinese are not going to do everything we want and the president s choice at some point is going to be accept an agreement that s weaker than he wants or restart the trade war those are not great options and they re certainly not great political options given the stakes the eurasia group in a tuesday report pointed to the rising probability that trade negotiations do not produce a deal in 2019 and the parties instead maintain an uneasy status quo that keeps tariffs in place but avoids further escalation the firm sees a muddle through strategy as the new base case for 2019 and perhaps through the us presidential election cycle then again the direction of u s trade policy toward china remains entirely in trump s hands and the president has demonstrated his willingness to turn that policy on a dime most recently in may when he blew up expectations of an imminent deal and ramped up existing tariffs on chinese imports instead if trump makes good on his tuesday threat to slap levies on as yet untaxed chinese goods consumers would see higher prices on staples including apparel electronics and furniture so the move would invite considerable political peril that said we have seen affinity for tariffs and we have seen how he likes to use plenty of leverage in his negotiations claire reade senior counsel at arnold porter in washington and a former assistant u s trade representative for china tells me in an email perhaps he would choose a subset of products out of the 300 billion and wait until after major seasonal sales were over to impose tariffs or perhaps he would impose a low level tariff advertisement despite trump s argument that a slowing chinese economy is stoking urgency among its leadership to cut a deal beijing has taken a harder line toward the u s in recent days that includes the promotion of commerce minister zhong shan considered a trade hawk to a more prominent role in negotiations plus the chinese have balked at making major purchases of american agricultural goods leaving trump hanging on a commitment believe he secured at the g 20 those developments have stirred concern among trump allies that the chinese are digging in and avoiding firm commitments my colleagues bob costa and david lynch reported last week if that is in fact the case trump imposing more tariffs in an attempt to break the chinese could backfire says reade china s interest in a deal seems likely to depend on a strategic calculus about the costs versus the benefits understanding that china will not enter an agreement where there is a serious risk of losing face market movers trump s policies could help him secure fed cuts the new york times s jeanna smialek trump lacks official power to make the federal reserve cut interest rates but he may have found a way to force its hand stoking economic uncertainty the fed s chair jerome h powell has signaled that he and his colleagues could cut interest rates at their upcoming meeting as inflation remains stubbornly low and risks including mr trump s trade war with china threaten economic growth mr powell speaking in paris on tuesday reiterated that the fed would act as appropriate to sustain the economic expansion advertisement and the fed appears to be

may dallas fed prez one rate cut could be enough the post s heather long dallas federal reserve president robert kaplan has joined the chorus of central bank leaders hinting strongly that an interest rate cut is coming at the end of july but he does not see the need for additional cuts this year kaplan said tuesday that he could support a modest tactical adjustment down in interest rates not the start of a rate cutting cycle but a tactical adjustment that s restrained and modest that might be appropriate i could see an argument for that kaplan told the washington post in an interview tuesday

finance minister ken ofori atta 17 07 2019 listen the world bank and international monetary fund imf have maintained ghana is being high risk of debt distress despite recent debt management strategies and expansion of the economy this was captured in the latest debt sustainability analysis dsa released by the two washington based institutions this dsa concludes that ghana s risks of external and overall debt distress continue to be assessed as high while the rebased nominal gdp significantly improved the public debt to gdp ratios albeit remaining elevated the debt service ratios continue to breach their respective thresholds under the baseline reflecting underlying vulnerabilities the two institutions maintained that a downward trend in the total public debt gdp ratio was interrupted in 2018 as a result of the realization of significant contingent liabilities in the banking sectors what is high risk of debt distress the imf world bank debt sustainability analysis is seen as a structure to guide the borrowing needs of low income countries in a way that matches their financing needs with current and prospective repayment ability it generally looks at one or more thresholds that have been breached under the baseline scenario but the country does not currently face any repayment difficulties some have also argued that it s warning to the country in question that if steps are taken deal with its rising debt it could soon be classified as a debt distress country or get into that status this should mean that the country in question could be experiencing difficulties in serving its debts or getting into distress the two institutions looked at these indicators in classifying the various countries in assessing the country s ability to pay its debt the imf and world bank do not only look at the debt to gdp ratio present value of debt to gdp ratio present value of debt to exports ratio present value of debt to revenue ratio debt service to revenue ratio ghana and the debt sustainability classification another report issued by world bank says ghana remains at high risk of debt distress even though external debt indicators have significantly improved relative to the previous dsa on account of a based gdp but vulnerabilities associated with debt service remain the world bank in its economic update report noted that two out of four indicators debt service to exports and debt service to revenue are in breach of the thresholds under the baseline the debt outlook remains sensitive to standard shocks under the dsa the standard stress tests suggest that ghana is particularly vulnerable to a decline in exports confirming the need to diversify the economy and increase resilience to external shocks government and rising debt numbers government has however argued that the measures that it is implementing would soon yield the desired results finance minister ken ofori atta in a recent interview told joybusiness that some of these strategies even though is taking time would result in the situation improve very soon he however maintained that rising debt stock can be attributed to the management of legacy issues rather than questionable expenditure some of these fresh borrowings was rather meant to manage the situation and not because we were borrowing to spend on stuff that was captured in the budget according to data from the bank of ghana the country s total debt stock has reached gh 198 billion ending march 2019 reactions to the dsa report economist professor peter quartey has told joybusiness the development warrant some drastic actions to contain the situation he maintains the government must do more to improve revenue mobilization to help move the country to a moderate status prof quartey however warned the situation could impact negatively on the cost of borrowing going forward classification of debt sustainability analysis the debt sustainability framework dsf therefore classifies countries into one of three debt carrying capacity categories strong medium and weak using a composite indicator which draws on the country s historical performance and outlook for real growth reserves coverage remittance inflows and the state of the global environment in addition to the world bank s country policy and institutional assessment cpia index different indicative thresholds for debt burdens are used depending on the country s debt carrying capacity thresholds corresponding to strong performers are highest indicating that countries with good macroeconomic performance and policies can generally handle greater debt accumulation facts on countries classification at the end of may 31 2019 seven countries are in debt distress 25 countries including ghana are at high risk 26 countries are at moderate risk and 14 countries are at low risk of debt distress why the imf world bank do this review the dsf has enabled the imf and the world bank to integrate debt issues more effectively into their analysis and policy advice it has also allowed comparability across countries the dsf is important for the imf s assessment of macroeconomic stability the long term sustainability of fiscal policy and overall debt sustainability furthermore debt sustainability assessments are taken into account to determine access to imf financing as well as for the design of debt limits in fund supported programs while the world bank uses it to determine the share of grants and loans in its assistance to each low income countries lics and to design non concessional borrowing limits the effectiveness of the dsf in preventing excessive debt accumulation hinges on its broad use by borrowers and creditors lics are encouraged to use the dsf or a similar framework as a first step toward developing medium term debt strategies creditors are encouraged to incorporate debt sustainability assessments into their lending decisions in this way the framework should help lics raise the finance they need to meet the sustainable development goals sdgs including through grants when the ability to service debt is limited key reforms that took effect in july 2018 include i moving away from relying exclusively on the cpia to classify countries debt carrying capacity and instead of using a composite measure based on a set of economic variables ii introducing realism tools to scrutinize baseline projections iii recalibrating standardized stress tests while adding tailored scenario stress tests on contingent liabilities natural disasters commodity prices shock and market financing shock and iv providing a richer characterization of debt vulnerabilities including those from domestic debt and market financing and better discrimination across countries within the moderate risk category joy business
critics of the plan say it may allow rich foreign nations to dictate india s policies an influential hindu nationalist group close to indian prime minister narendra modi s ruling party has demanded that his government review its plan to raise money by selling foreign currency bonds bonds are a form of borrowing money these particular bonds would be issued in a foreign currency meaning the principal repayment and periodic interest payments will not be made in indian rupees but rather in a foreign currency if the rupee devalues it will become more expensive for india to pay off this form of debt critics say the plan to issue foreign currency bonds is anti patriotic as it could create long term risks for the economy potentially allowing rich foreign nations and their financial institutions to dictate india s policies we can t allow this to happen declared ashwani mahajan the co convenor of swadeshi jagran manch sjm the economic branch of the right wing hindu organisation rashtriya swayamsevak sangh rss the rss was the key founder of the ruling bharatiya janata party and people it has nurtured including modi himself are in top positions in the government declaring that the sjm will campaign against the plan by convening meetings of influential economists mahajan said we are confident that government will withdraw its decision on these bonds we must look at the experience of countries that have taken loans from international markets to meet their government deficit the experience of these countries has been far from good he said citing argentina and turkey as examples a spokesman from the ministry of finance declined to comment for this story subhash chandra garg the top official at the finance ministry told indian business leaders last week that the overseas debt move was part of efforts to bring down real interest rates for indian companies in order to help the economy grow faster we will have a very open attitude to welcome foreign investment and savings because that is what would be required he said garg said that the problem with relying so much on domestic debt was that the government tapped into nearly 80 percent of total savings in the economy leaving little for private companies as a result those businesses are forced to pay up to 13 percent in interest rates on bank loans the government has in the past considered raising funds from overseas markets but those tasked with determining the feasibility of such a plan have ended up advising against it most of the debt is of domestic origin insulating the debt portfolio from currency risk india s previous finance minister arun jaitley wrote in a paper on public debt in february of last year faddish investors it is not only the rss s economic branch that has criticised the government for the proposal india should worry about short term faddish investors buying when india is hot and dumping us when it is not former indian central bank governor raghuram rajan wrote in an article for the times of india newspaper last saturday the sjm has shown it can mobilise opinion to change government policy on several occasions in the past few years including pushing the government to take a harder line against genetically modified crops and a more protectionist stance on trade issues the sjm helped to pressure the government into introducing new e commerce regulations in february that upset two american behemoths amazon com inc and walmart the us companies said the move discriminated against them and favoured domestic retailers but the bjp may not bend on this occasion gopal krishna agarwal the bjp s national spokesman on economic affairs said that despite some risks highlighted by critics the sovereign bonds are the best alternative at this point considering the government s massive investment plans the government s goal of keeping real interest rates low makes it difficult to raise funds in the domestic market at reasonable rates he added agarwal cautioned however that the government has to stick to its fiscal deficit target of 3 3 percent of gross domestic product for the current year ending next march and ensure that overseas borrowing does not lead to a higher deficit lower costs india s sovereign credit rating is in the stable range bbb so analysts suggest that based on current market rates the country would be able to raise us dollar funds overseas at about 3 2 percent that figure could rise once hedging costs are taken into account the 10 year government bond the most liquid bond in the domestic debt market closed at 6 33 percent on tuesday overseas borrowing exposes the government s liabilities to currency fluctuations and can therefore impact domestic interest rates india s vulnerability to external events is very high given its disproportionately high dependence on imported oil said rupa rege nitsure group chief economist at l t financial holdings

ago as guarantor of global monetary stability since the imf and the world bank were set up at the end of world war ii to establish a cooperative global economic order after the chaos the conflict had wrought the former has been led by a european and the latter by a united states citizen that convention reflects the economic and political realities of 1945 when the us and europe dominated the emerging new world order there is nothing in the rules however to prevent non western candidates from taking the top posts many have argued that these institutions should cast the net wider to better reflect the realities of the 21st century in which countries such as china now have enormous economic power there are no indications that the us and europe are quite ready to relinquish their hold on the two main global financial institutions this year the tradition of naming someone from the us to lead the world bank was maintained with the appointment of former treasury official david malpass as its president as for the vacancy at the imf france s finance minister bruno le maire has already been quoted as saying the top job there should once again go to a european pragmatists would argue that what matters is not where these top officials come from but rather the policies they pursue the imf has been widely criticized over the years for pursuing western interests by imposing austerity on developing countries in return for its fiscal support in a world in which trade tensions are building and the model of wider globalization is under threat there is more than ever a need for consensus in the top financial institutions to preserve the benefits of cooperation a file photo of christine lagarde lagarde s leadership of the imf was viewed positively in beijing which supported her candidacy for the post she took up in 2011 she backed the inclusion of the chinese yuan into the imf s currency basket previously made up of dollars yen pounds and euros lagarde established a good relationship with chinese leaders and was among world leaders who were in beijing in april to discuss investment opportunities in the belt and road initiative president xi jinping said that in advancing the bri china was applying debt sustainability criteria recommended by the imf so what can china and other imf participants expect of lagarde s successor european or not the key credential of the next imf chief will be to defend the interests of the new world economic powers while maintaining the trust of the us and europe one of the key challenges will be dealing with an irascible and unpredictable white house poorer developing countries will need to know that if economic disaster strikes the imf will be there to bail them out without imposing crippling terms there has been speculation that given asia s new role in the global economy the imf might break with tradition and appoint a non westerner the new york times reported that early shortlists for the top job included singapore s tharman shanmugaratnam and egyptian american businessman mohamed el erian the potential european candidates include the bank of england governor mark carney a canadian who also has british and irish citizenship china already has one of the most senior posts at the imf with former people s bank of china official zhang tao serving as its deputy managing director high on the new imf chief s agenda will be confronting the impact of president donald trump s trade war on china which lagarde recently warned threatens global economic growth and which may cost 455 billion in lost output next year she said there were growing concerns that the most recent us china tariff s could further reduce investment productivity and growth and that trump s threats of tariffs on mexico were also of concern the world bank has been equally gloomy predicting that increased political uncertainty would push down world growth to 2 6 percent this year its weakest since 2016 these are self inflicted wounds that must be avoided lagarde said how by removing the recently implemented trade barriers and by avoiding further barriers in whatever form any downturn will impact smaller economies as well as large ones obliging the new imf chief to deal with emerging crises the imf is due to disburse a new tranche of aid to argentina any day now at the end of the day the nationality of the new imf chief is perhaps the least important thing to consider about lagarde s successor as the financial times commented far more important than nationality is the ability to do one job above all to use the fund s weight to defend the open world economy and help sustain global cooperation harvey morris is a senior media consultant for china daily uk
following up on the recent conclusions for the 5th review we had fruitful discussions with the authorities on recent economic developments and the outlook for tunisia washington d c united states of america july 17 2019 apo group tight monetary and fiscal policies during the first half of 2019 have reduced inflation and laid the foundation for a second year of budget deficit reduction risks to the economic outlook have increased due to higher oil prices weaker growth in tunisia s trading partners and an appreciating dinar near term policies should continue to focus on reducing fiscal and external deficits lowering inflation further and strengthening the social safety net for low income households an international monetary fund imf staff team led by björn rother visited tunis from july 11 17 2019 to discuss tunisia s recent economic developments outlook and reform program at the end of these discussions mr rother made the following statement following up on the recent conclusions for the 5th review we had fruitful discussions with the authorities on recent economic developments and the outlook for tunisia strong monetary and fiscal policy implementation during the first half of 2019 have helped reduce inflation to 6 8 percent in june from a peak of 7 7 percent a year earlier lower refinancing as of end june and laid the foundation for a second year of fiscal deficit reduction at the same time risks to the economic outlook for 2019 have increased since the fifth review growth will likely be limited to at most 2 percent reflecting notably the disappointing performance of industry in recent months moreover the recent appreciation of the dinar the increase in oil prices and slower growth in tunisia s main trading partners are likely to weigh on the fiscal and external current accounts despite the more favorable than expected performance of the tourism sector these trends make it even more critical to stay the course on policy implementation meeting the budget deficit target of 3 9 percent of gdp for 2019 is critical to slow down the accumulation of public debt that reached 77 percent of gdp at the end of 2018 this will require continued strong performance on tax and tax arrears collection as well as additional measures to contain current expenditures including through continued moderation of the wage bill and energy subsidies in an environment of higher international oil prices staff also supports the authorities ongoing efforts to strengthen social safety nets especially for low income households monetary policy should remain geared towards reducing inflation that erodes the purchasing power of tunisians while exchange rate flexibility can support an improvement in the current account and international reserves the imf team met with minister of finance ridha chalghoum minister of development investment and international cooperation zied laâdhari minister of major reforms taoufik rajhi and central bank governor marouane el abassi as well as their staff it also held discussions with representatives of the labor and employers unions the private sector civil society and the diplomatic community the mission would like to thank the authorities and all those with whom it met for their warm welcome and constructive discussions

the international monetary fund said on wednesday the u s dollar was overvalued by 6 to 12 based on near term economic fundamentals while the euro the japanese yen and china s yuan were seen as broadly in line with fundamentals the imf has been at odds with u s president donald trump over his use of tariffs to resolve trade imbalances but its assessment that the dollar is overvalued is likely to give trump more fodder for his frequent complaints that dollar strength is hampering u s exports trump has railed against european and chinese policies that lead to what he calls a devaluation of the euro and other currencies against the dollar the fund s external sector report an annual assessment of currencies and external surpluses and deficits of major economies showed that current account surpluses remained centered in the euro area and other advanced economies such as singapore while deficits remained persistent in the united states britain and some emerging market economies the report said net creditor positions had increased again and were now at a historical peak of about 20 of global gross domestic product or about four times the level seen in the early 1990s net debtor positions were at a similar level the fund which has warned that the u s china trade war could cost the global economy about 455 billion next year said recent trade policy actions were weighing on global trade flows eroding confidence and disrupting investment but they had done nothing to reverse external imbalances thus far instead of tit for tat tariffs surplus and deficit countries should work to revive liberalization efforts and strengthen the rules based multilateral trading system that has been in effect for the past 75 years the imf said it is imperative that all countries avoid policies that distort trade imf chief economist gita gopinath told reporters higher tariffs have been associated with increased prices for consumers and are weighing on global trade investment and growth including by eroding confidence and disrupting global supply chains she repeated the fund s estimate that the tariffs applied in the u s china trade war could shave 0 5 off global economic growth in 2020 global trade growth was slowing which showed that the trade disputes were not simply causing manufacturers to shift production away from china as trump has claimed but that the overall trade system was suffering from the tariffs she said gopinath also noted that disputes over technology such as the u s decision to put chinese technology company huawei on its entity list could also fracture global supply chains raising concerns about investment and productivity companies on the entity list cannot buy parts and components from u s companies without government approval the fund said short term financing risks were generally contained since debtor positions were concentrated in reserve currency issuing economies but risks remained for the global economy an intensification of trade tensions or a disorderly brexit outcome with further repercussions for global growth and risk aversion could affect other economies that are highly dependent on foreign demand and external financing it said countries with deficits like the united states and britain should pare back spending in a growth friendly manner while those with big surpluses like germany the netherlands and korea should boost public infrastructure investment and discourage excessive saving it said germany s current account surplus was excessive running about 4 to 5 larger than warranted luis cubeddu chief of the imf s research department told reporters there s a need to ease fiscal policy in germany there is fiscal space to do that he said urging spending on infrastructure while the report assessed the euro s valuation as appropriate for the euro zone as a whole it said the euro s real effective exchange rate was 8 to 18 too low for germany s fundamentals given its high current account surplus the report said that while china s yuan was broadly in line with its fundamentals imf models showed wide divergences with desired policies from an 11 5 undervaluation to an 8 5 percent overvaluation due to uncertainties over beijing s policy outlook gopinath said the imf had looked carefully at exchange rates but saw no evidence that changes had much impact on trade flows particularly in countries that invoiced trade in the u s dollar structural changes such as improving access to credit and better transportation infrastructure could be more useful in the short term she said
transcript of the external sector report press conference gita gopinath economic counsellor and director research department luis cubeddu division chief research department martin kaufman assistant director strategy policy and review department gustavo adler deputy division chief research department raphael anspach senior communications officer communications department mr anspach good morning welcome to this press conference on the imf s external sector report delighted that you could be here today with us also welcome to all our colleagues that are following us online before we start let me just introduce you to the speakers of today s press conference let me start with ms gita gopinath the imf s economic counselor and the director of the imf research department to her left is mr luis cubeddu he s the division chief in the research department to his left mr martin kaufman he s the assistant director in the strategy policy and review department and finally to my left mr gustavo adler from the research department a deputy division chief there gita will have some introductory remarks and then we ll be happy to take your questions gita the floor is yours ms gopinath thank you good morning everyone we ve just released the latest edition of the external sector report the report provides a multilaterally consistent assessment of external positions of the was 30 largest economies which makes up about 90 percent of gdp this is part of our continuous efforts to monitor systemic risks emanating from external balances imbalances and discussed policy options to address them in this year s report we also explore in depth the role of exchange rate flexibility in aiding external adjustment an issue that has elicited significant policy debate let me start by stressing that not all external imbalances are a cause for concern as there are good reasons for countries to run current account deficits or current account surpluses at certain points in time for example it s natural for young fast growing economies to run current account deficits as they borrow from aging economies with weaker growth prospects but there are also circumstances when imbalances can be excessive and risky as countries that borrow too much may be subject to sudden stops in capital inflows and in addition countries that run large current account surpluses may be saving too much and therefore be detrimental to global demand our job is to assess when external imbalances are excessive we focused on the overall external position and not bilateral positions vis a vis particular countries since it s natural for a country to run a current account deficit with some countries and a current account surplus with other countries depending upon how they specialize in their production so our multilateral focus also enables us to say something about the macro and structural policies behind external imbalances now let me turn to discussing the key findings of the report significant progress has been made since global imbalances peaked in 2007 at around 6 percent of world gdp now they stand at 3 percent of world gdp although progress since 2013 has been slow and accompanied by rotation of imbalances towards advanced economies we assess that about 35 to 45 percent of global imbalances were excessive in 2018 excess surpluses remain centered in the euro area as a whole driven by germany and the netherlands and in other advanced economies in asia like korea and singapore while excess deficits remain concentrated in the united kingdom in the united states and some emerging economies like argentina and indonesia a noteworthy development is the continued narrowing of china s current account surplus against a backdrop of greater exchange rate flexibility and real appreciation over the last decade its current account is now assessed to be line with fundamentals although achieving a lasting external rebalancing will require adopting further structural reforms including to reduce subsidies to state owned enterprises and reduce entry barriers in certain sectors as current expansionary fiscal and credit policies are gradually withdrawn the picture of external stock imbalances is less positive as a net external wealth or debtor and creditor countries have continue to diverge reaching historical peaks short term financing risks from the current configuration of external imbalances are generally contained as current account deficits and debtor positions are concentrated in reserve currency issuing countries like the united states the main short term risks stem from an intensification of trade tensions or a disorderly brexit which can have negative implications for global demand and global risk appetite which then in turn can affect economies that are highly dependent on foreign demand and on external finance over the medium term in the absence of corrective policies trade tensions could become entrenched and a further widening of stock imbalances could trigger disruptive adjustments in key debtor economies that could then spillover to the rest of the world so what can countries do with output near potential in most systemic economies well calibrated macroeconomic policies are necessary to support rebalancing countries with excess current account deficits need to pursue growth friendly fiscal consolidation while excess surplus economies should use fiscal policy where available to boost potential growth and achieve rebalancing structural policies remain central to tackle external imbalances in general excess surplus countries should adopt reforms that encourage investment and discourage excess saving including by supporting innovation and lowering barriers to entry in key sectors widening the coverage of social safety nets and addressing distortions behind rising and high corporate savings excess deficit countries should strengthen competitiveness in tradable sectors including by investing more in the skill base of workers finally the rise of external indebtedness by sovereigns and corporates in some economies warrants careful monitoring to ensure that there are no growing mismatches in currencies or in maturities let me now say a few words about our analysis on exchange rates an external adjustment which is featured in chapter 2 there has been a lively debate in recent years over the role of exchange rates in facilitating external adjustment and in particular on how the currency in which trade is invoiced and the role of global supply chains may affect the adjustment process to inform this discussion we undertook a very thorough analysis of these particular aspects of international trade in general we find that the effects of exchange rates on trade flows are relatively muted in the short term and in economies where trade is largely invoiced in the us dollar export volumes tend to respond little to exchange rate movements in the short run this means that the benefits of exchange rate flexibility in terms of external rebalancing or buffering the economy to real shocks may be limited in the near term this points to the need of complementing exchange rate flexibility with other cyclical policy instruments structural policies may also be useful to strengthen the export response for example through improvements in the access to credit and better transportation infrastructure our analysis also shows that these features of international trade become somewhat less relevant in the medium term and exports and imports respond more meaningfully to exchange rate changes this means that exchange rate flexibility remains key to facilitate durable medium term external adjustment so let me finish with some broader remarks it is imperative that all countries avoid policies that distort trade recent bilateral trade actions have had no discernible impact on the global imbalances as external imbalances reflect macro policies that affect aggregate saving and investment instead higher tariffs have been associated with increased prices for consumers and a weighing on global trade investment and growth including by eroding confidence and disrupting global supply chains so while external positions are not grossly misaligned and don t present an imminent danger to global stability actions of the right type are needed to avoid further widening of stock positions or a re emergence of more strongly divergent floor positions both deficit and surplus countries should focus on tackling the underlying macro and structural sources of imbalances instead of resorting to distortive trade actions countries should work jointly towards reviving liberalization efforts and strengthening the rule based multilateral trade system that has served the global economy well over the past 75 years thank you mr anspach thank you we ll try to get to as many questions as possible both here in the room as well as online so who wants to go first questioner there s been a lot of discussion a lot of it emanating from the us president about the strong dollar i wonder in this report you re again seeing an overvaluation of the dollar although it s a little bit less than it was last year and the year before can you just say a word or two about the impact of the strong dollar and what measures from your perspective should be undertaken to sort of bring that more in line with the fundamentals ms gopinath our assessment is that the imbalances that are excessive right now are a reflection more of macro policies and structural policies in the different countries so the larger fiscal deficits in the u s and the larger fiscal surpluses in some euro area countries so to address the imbalances the right thing would be to address those macro issues we should also recognize that we see much less of countries accumulating reserves and you know an impact of exchange rates through that so that s not what we observe and what we see at this point so again the right approach would be to focus on adjustments on macro policies and on the structural side questioner in the report and just now you ve said that it s imperative that all countries avoid policies that distort trade but can you go a little further on that and what you see is that a message that s getting through to policy makers and political sphere and do you see that improving or deteriorating ms gopinath it is our role to continue to put that message out there we welcome the trade truce between the us and china that came towards the end of june at the g 20 meetings and we would hope that the world would continue to work cooperatively to not only not trigger these trade tensions but also to address the issues with the multilateral trading system we ve always talked about the need to modernize it further to incorporate services trade to deal with industrial subsidies and to deal with intellectual property rights we need to continue to strengthen that system mr anspach i ll move to a question online this is a question on the surplus countries and more specifically on germany the question is how much should germany ease its fiscal position and what would be the effect on growth in germany and the rest of the world of such a change in policy mr cubeddu i d be very happy to take that question i d like to first point out that the germany article four consultation just took place and that the germany report is currently available online and in a thorough discussion on our views with regards to germany could be can be found there in the case of germany what we find is that their surplus is excessive roughly four to five percent larger than warranted we also are mentioning that there s a need to ease fiscal policy in germany there is fiscal space to do that but given that output gaps are fairly close and in some ways positive fiscal policies should be centered on boosting potential growth and that s why we re also recommending that the spending takes place in the form of infrastructure that would facilitate again growth potential we also emphasized quite a bit the area of tackling structural issues and in particular better understand the rise in corporate saving in the case of germany so structural policies have a role to play and the report did do some good work trying to link the rise in corporate saving the rise in the current account to issues related to wealth inequality and an income distribution at the very top and i encourage you to look at this issue mr anspach i m going to take another question online this is more on trade and continuing trade tensions what are the imf projections about the impact of a continuing trade war between the u s and china and how would that affect mexico ms gopinath so yes we ve looked into this and we estimated that if you take into account the tariffs that were put in place in 2018 between the u s and china and then include the tariffs that were threatened in may between again the u s and china then that would reduce the level of global gdp in 2020 by 0 5 percent so that s what we d estimate so this is a significant cost to the global economy and at a time when global trade is already very weak and investment is weak in the world in terms of implications for countries including mexico i think one important factor to keep in mind is that with prolonged trade uncertainty it s weighing on business sentiment everywhere in the world which then has implications for global demand which then impacts countries like mexico too so this is an important factor that we flag all the time and we ll be doing so again when we release the world economic outlook next week questioner so china just released its gdp data for the first half the year at 6 3 percent any new policy recommendations going forward for the policymakers in beijing to maintain growth ms gopinath i think this question would be even more appropriate when we put out the world economic outlook update because that s when we will we ll have the updated numbers too we think it s important for us for china to continue its pivot towards more domestic demand driven growth to ensure that there s less reliance on a credit boom driven growth and to work on encouraging the private sector reducing subsidies to state owned enterprises so these are the kinds of policies that we would we expect will continue to benefit china s growth questioner i know that we re talking here in a very structured sort of institutional language but can i ask you how you assess that the possibility of these sort economies that is now very interconnected pulling apart as a result of all these trade measures do you see a sort of a general slowdown in globalization and or is it just shifting to different centers we see companies moving out of china moving to vietnam other places is it just a shift or is there actually something sort of fundamental happening now as a sort of change in globalization ms gopinath we are seeing global trade growth slow which tells you that this is not just about shifting of trade to different parts of the world but an actual overall reduction in in trade so this is having a fundamental impact on global trade there is certainly are more more being said about companies moving out of china now given that as china has grown and has if wages have risen in china there were companies already looking for other countries to produce in that would be more competitive on the wage front this particular set of trade tensions certainly accelerates that process and so that also is playing out but again it is a loss in terms of the sum which is that there has been a decline in in world trade growth and the concerns are not just on the trade side but also on the technology side because technology tensions have also risen and that also has the possible impact of fracturing global supply chains global technology chains and that can have implications for the diffusion of technology around the world at a time when productivity growth is already weak questioner can i just ask you to elaborate on what you meant by the technology piece can you just say a sentence more about that ms gopinath so this is about the recent actions taken by the us to put huawei on the entity list citing cybersecurity concerns of course cybersecurity concerns are important and countries need to deal with that but it s also important to flag that there is a risk to how technology diffuses around the world and that have kind of implications for investment and productivity questioner it s connected to high tech i m sure you followed them last debate around libra do you have any views on that you think it s indeed a big concern and we have to monitor the way it could be effective you saw probably the comment in france from bruno lemaire but also steven mnuchin yesterday so what is your view on the libra ms gopinath our view is firstly that it s important for greater financial inclusion and to the extent that digital currencies can help in that process they certainly have an important role to play at the same time we also flag the risks and concerns associated with it there are questions about consumer protection there are concerns about how the data will be used there are important questions to be asked about how this would affect monetary policy transmission and if you look at particularly countries that are not reserve currency countries would this lead to you know backdoor dollarization so all of these questions in terms of whether there will be enough checks and balances in place to prevent money laundering these kinds of aspects all are very important which means that it s it is very important for regulatory agencies in the world to pay close attention to these developments and to make sure that they re not too late in undertaking the right steps mr anspach with that we will conclude this press conference i would like to thank you for attending and also thanks to colleagues online for submitting their questions and again a reminder that next week on tuesday we ll be releasing the words economic outlook update from santiago in chile thank you very much

new zealanders usually welcome the praise when overseas authorities describe us as the best in the world this time not so much in the past fortnight global economic news authorities the economist and bloomberg economics have both declared new zealand houses to be vastly over valued relative to both rents and incomes they describe new zealand as in bubble territory similar to those seen in other countries before the global financial crisis and vulnerable to the sort of 30 40 percent price crash seen in the likes of ireland and parts of the us through 2007 to 2010 the economist s long running global house price index was refreshed on june 27 with march quarter data for most countries and showed new zealand top of the pops when it came to over valuation relative to incomes and second most over valued relative to rents behind canada it found new zealand prices in the december quarter of 2018 to be 57 percent over valued relative to incomes rents just above australia s 42 percent overvalued in the march quarter new zealand was 113 percent over valued relative to rents just behind canada s 120 percent the economist found new zealand prices have more than trebled since 1990 while british and american prices are still less than double what they were 30 years ago on this basis house prices appear to be on an unsustainable path in australia canada and new zealand the economist wrote ten years ago they reached similarly dizzying heights against rents and incomes in spain ireland and some american cities only to endure a brutal collapse it concluded oof bloomberg was no kinder on us and the canadians niraj shah at bloomberg economics wrote last week that canada and new zealand were the economies most vulnerable to a correction in house prices with australia and britain also at concerning levels the results showed that canada and new zealand seem to be on the most unsustainable path with the cost of housing compared with wages the highest in the world in both countries shah wrote this economist chart shows nz house prices more than trebling in the last 30 years to the sorts of levels seen in ireland shortly before its housing market crashed in 2008 our prices are now 40 percent higher than in australia and 75 percent higher than in the us relative to the starting point of 1990 in this chart exceptional by most measures new zealand s housing market is now worth nz 1 13 trillion which is up by more than 1 trillion from nz 123 billion in 1990 the increase is more than triple because there are more houses with more extras decks garages rooms added on that s 1 trillion in untaxed capital gains which at the top marginal rate would have generated extra tax revenues of 330 billion or enough to build nearly 700 000 new state houses or fund the next 14 years of new zealand superannuation payments our housing market is worth 3 9 times our gdp and more than 7 2 times the value of our stock market for comparison sake australia s housing market is worth a 6 6 trillion or 3 5 times australia s gdp and 3 3 times the value of its stock market america s housing market is worth us 33 3 trillion or 1 6 times us gdp and 1 5 times the value of the us stock market i initially put quotation marks around the word bubble in my introduction but there should not be any debate it s clear from any reasonable measure our housing market is over valued relative to household incomes rents history gdp and company values our houses are worth 14 years of our export receipts enough said but over valued does not necessarily mean prices are about to collapse why no panic so why aren t we worried enough to start taking urgent action to head off a collapse to be fair to the reserve bank and governments of both flavours over the last 10 years there has been some action taken and goodness knows how much higher prices would have been without the so far limited actions the national led government of 2008 to 2017 stopped landlords from claiming depreciation on buildings and introduced a new two year bright line test that is designed to make property traders pay tax on profits from flipping properties the reserve bank under governor graeme wheeler restricted high loan to value ratio lending in 2013 to both first home buyers and landlords before tightening it even more to auckland landlords the labour led government has increased the bright line test for landlords to five years and is building 1 000 new state houses per year it has banned non residents from buying houses the reserve bank under adrian orr has proposed to double the amount of capital banks have to put aside in reserve for all of their loans including the 290 billion lent against our houses that doubling of capital makes it more expensive for bank shareholders to lend quickly to home buyers governments have not done nothing but they also have not done everything they could in part because of the fear of politicians and property owning voters that real action would reduce some of that 1 trillion of unearned wealth for those who just choked on their weetbix at my assertion about unearned wealth the rise in value is due largely to falling interest rates increased bank leverage very fast population growth and various taxation and housing development policies it has virtually nothing to do with new zealand s real income growth in the last 30 years or any sort of sacrifice or saving home owners did nothing to earn that 1 trillion other than vote against policies that might have limited that growth in 1989 the resource management act the reserve bank act and increased taxation on pensions all combined to trigger a once in one lifetime lump of capital gain for home owners that most think can never be repeated see more from me on 1989 as year zero for the housing boom but it also unlikely to be taken away bubbles usually burst except for ours usually a massive over valuation of a particular type of asset is temporary either a demand or a supply response or both will rectify the imbalance either quickly or very very slowly in ireland vast amounts of over building bank collapses and a very sharp economic downturn were enough to trigger their 50 percent plus crash spain s 35 percent slump was triggered by banking collapses over building an ageing population and a long grinding recession us housing prices fell around 30 percent in most markets through 2007 and 2008 because of an over supply of new houses bank collapses higher interest rates and then a recession house prices fell globally in the late 1980s although not that much in new zealand because of a sharp rise in mortgage rates to over 20 percent in some cases australia s house prices have fallen around 10 percent in the last 18 months because of much tighter bank lending rules and a big increase in apartment supply especially in sydney and melbourne where prices are down by 15 20 percent but none of those things have happened in new zealand in the last 30 years and are unlikely to in the next decade at least our layers of armour plating i had thought in 2008 that new zealand s house prices would also fall 30 percent in a similar way to what was seen in america our prices were more over valued than even america at that stage and our economy was staring down the barrel of a similarly large recession our banks were also very exposed to the short term credit markets in london and new york that froze repeatedly through late 2008 and early 2009 many also feared a sharp rise in interest rates as the global economy recovered would deflate our bubble but the market didn t slump nearly as much here as overseas instead prices fell just 10 percent through 2008 and then rebounded to fresh record highs by early 2012 for a variety of reasons then a series of automatic stabilisers kicked in and a structural change in the global economy towards ever lower inflation supported prices firstly the reserve bank cut the official cash rate by nearly 600 basis points in less than a year starting in july 2008 new fixed mortgage rates fell from nearly 10 percent to 5 9 percent by early 2009 they have since fallen to under 4 0 percent as the globalisation of services markets through the mobile phone drives prices lower in the same way the globalisation of manufacturing did through the 1990s and 2000s the percentage of disposable income going to service household debt in new zealand has actually fallen from 14 percent in early 2008 to under 8 0 percent now despite household debt rising by over 100 billion secondly the reserve bank helped the big four australian banks avoid a cash crunch by lending them more than 7 billion over late 2008 and 2009 to make sure they could roll over their own short term loans from us and european banks our government also provided a guarantee for 10 4 billion worth of bonds issued by the new zealand arms of the big four australian banks and obviously kiwibank unlike in ireland spain and america our banks did not collapse and therefore there were no receivers forcing mortgagee sales through to cover bank debts that s because our government effectively gave them a short term bailout but didn t talk about it much at the time for obvious reasons thirdly we got lucky with china s immediate and effective response to the global financial crisis gfc which was to unleash a wave of state funded infrastructure spending on roads apartments railways and airports that ramped up iron ore and coal prices because they are used to make concrete and steel australia was the largest supplier of both to china and australia was our largest trading partner at the time china was our second largest trading partner back then and the combined effect of china s astonishing growth for the last decade and australia s unending growth it has not had a recession since 1991 delivered a double whammy that cushioned the blow of the global financial crisis that all unleashed another wave of middle class spending by chinese households our government also borrowed over 60 billion to spend on infrastructure and supporting incomes from 2008 to 2014 through the gfc and the two christchurch earthquakes fourthly our population growth from migration has been twice as fast as australia britain ireland and america over the last decade other countries with flat to falling house prices such as spain japan and france also have flat to falling populations fifthly we started the global financial crisis with a structural shortage of houses built up over 30 years of systematic under building connected to the end of state house building the end of government subsidies for home loans and house building the onset of restrictions linked to the rma and a growing reluctance by both the government and councils to fund new infrastructure for houses see more on that from my comment piece last week on council infrastructure funding tools the plates are even thicker now those five factors are all still there puffing up our bubble and holding it tight if anything the pressures are greater firstly the reserve bank is expected to cut the official cash rate to 1 0 percent by mid november which could see fixed mortgage rates drop towards 3 5 percent that s because inflation remains under the middle of the rbnz s 1 3 percent target range and both the global and local economies are slowing which is sucking further air out of inflation aside from housing costs the government s spending plans detailed in budget 2019 are forecast to actually reduce stimulus in the economy which would force the reserve bank to push even harder on the interest rate lever that may change next year but for now the reserve bank is doing all the heavy lifting the central bank is already talking about what it would have to do if the ocr was cut all the way to zero percent including so called quantitative easing that would involve the reserve bank inventing money to buy assets such as mortgage bonds to lower long term interest rates both lower interest rates and quantitative easing have been blamed for further pumping up asset prices the irony is the reserve bank is having to look at buying mortgage assets because there are not enough new zealand government bonds pushing this policy to the absurd extreme of buying assets to support the economy the reserve bank would eventually have to start buying shares as the bank of japan has had to do or even houses itself that s one bidder you would not want to come up against at an auction secondly the already miniscule risk of a banking crisis is getting smaller because reserve bank is forcing banks to hold more capital the reserve bank has also reduced the chance of a slump in house prices driven by mortgagee sales because its lvr policies have reduced the riskiest type of lending with deposits of less than 20 percent to less than seven percent of lending from almost 20 percent of lending five years ago there reserve bank estimates that less than seven percent of households would be under water with negative equity if house prices fell 20 percent which is down from nearly one in six households under water five years ago the banks could easily cope with a house price slump the last reserve bank stress test of the banking system in 2017 found a 35 percent fall in house prices and a rise in the unemployment rate to 11 percent would reduce aggregate bank profits over the following five years to 4 billion from 36 billion which would leave banks well above minimum capital levels they would not even lose money over that period let alone chew heavily into their capital and that test was done before house prices rose another 6 9 percent and home owners equity rose another 77 billion in the last two years thirdly the government is bringing in a formal term deposit guarantee which further reduces the chance of a bank collapse the reserve bank also stands ready again help banks with cash shortages as the lender of last resort and the government would no doubt offer a wholesale debt guarantee again if global financial markets froze fourthly migration remains stubbornly high as newsroom s laura walters reported today the coalition government has pivoted away from talk about drastic migration cuts and towards quality of skills and stamping out exploitation residency applications show thousands more are applying than the government s new targets and while the government has made some changes to migration settings so far policy changes have been largely tinkering at the edges and have not led to any significant drop off in migration annual net migration has remained consistently high since 2014 in april it was 55 800 over 224 000 new migrants have arrived in new zealand in net terms over the last four calendar years fifthly housing construction may be at record highs by number of consents in annual terms but it remains well below the early 1970 peaks once adjusted for our population and even on a monthly basis there have been 126 332 dwelling consents issued over the last four years while the number of new households formed is estimated by statistics new zealand to have risen by 175 000 over that time the housing shortage was variously estimated from around 50 000 to as high as 500 000 before this latest population surge even with the record house building of the last four years that shortage has risen by another 50 000 houses why supply is so inelastic here when prices have spiked to unsustainably high levels in other markets the usual market reaction has been for lots of new houses to be built at the new higher prices to generate profits for builders and developers that is what happened in the likes of america spain ireland and in the cbds of sydney and melbourne but here our infrastructure funding systems are broken with little prospect of that changing also the underlying drivers for excessive demand including leveraged tax free capital gains for home owners high net migration and government support for the banking system remain intact it s no accident that the owners of that 1 13 trillion worth of property forced prime minister jacinda ardern to abandon plans for a capital gains tax for the forseeable future short of a complete meltdown in the global financial system some sort of decade long global depression and a complete transformation in the way we plan fund and build housing infrastructure and houses that amour plating remains intact first home buyers may be hoping for some sort of exocet missile to burst the bubble they will wait in vain in the absence of a global financial armageddon if that happens they will have other things to worry about and no one to borrow money off to buy a home let alone someone to build it article corrected to make clear overvaluation of 57 percent is against incomes not rents that overvaluation is 113 percent

saturday the sjm has shown it can mobilize opinion to change government policy on several occasions in the past few years including pushing it to take a harder line against genetically modified crops and a more protectionist stance on trade issues it helped to pressure the government into introducing new e commerce regulations in february that upset two american behemoths amazon com inc and walmart the u s companies said the move discriminated against them and favored domestic retailers but the bjp may not bend on this occasion gopal krishna agarwal the bjp s national spokesman on economic affairs said that despite some risks highlighted by the critics the sovereign bonds were the best alternative at this point considering the government s massive investment plans the government s goal of keeping real interest rates low makes it difficult to raise funds in the domestic market at reasonable rates he added agarwal cautioned however that the government has to stick to its fiscal deficit target of 3 3 percent of gdp for the current year ending next march and ensure that overseas borrowing does not lead to a higher deficit lower costs based on its sovereign credit rating which stands at bbb analysts suggest india would be able to raise u s dollar funds overseas at about 3 2 percent at current market rates though that figure would rise once hedging costs are taken into account the 10 year government bond the most liquid paper in the domestic debt market closed at 6 33 percent on tuesday overseas borrowing exposes the government s liabilities to currency

the sale of orion diagnostica president and ceo timo lappalainen priority review for darolutamide marketing authorisation application in the united states the single most important growth project for orion in the next few years took a step forward in the review period as the united states food and drug administration fda granted priority review designation for darolutamide for the treatment of non metastatic prostate cancer resistant to conventional hormone therapy in april with priority review darolutamide may be granted marketing authorisation in the united states in the coming months we are eligible to receive significant milestone payments upon first commercial sales which amount to eur 45 million in the united states in may new research data was published indicating that darolutamide combined with androgen deprivation therapy adt slowed down the worsening of symptoms in men with non metastatic conventional hormone therapy resistant castration resistant prostate cancer nmcrpc we also continue our ongoing trial with bayer which evaluates darolutamide in patients with metastatic prostate cancer darolutamide s commercial potential will grow significantly if this second phase iii clinical trial arasens yields positive results in around 2022 another significant phase iii clinical trial refals which investigates orally administered levosimendan odm 109 in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als has progressed well patient recruitment for the project was completed sooner than expected after the review period in july and we are expecting results from the refals trial in just over a year we are conducting this trial alone and if the research findings are positive it is possible that orion will commercialise the product on its own not just in europe but also in some key markets outside europe our net sales in the first half of 2019 amounted to eur 493 million and operating profit to eur 107 million in proprietary drugs the sales of the easyhaler product family and simdax developed well most of the growth in easyhaler product sales came from the budesonide formoterol combined formulation the sales of salmeterol fluticasone combined formulation have also started but they have initially developed more slowly than anticipated and for the time being the product has no material impact on the net sales of the product family so far there has been no competition for simdax but marketing authorisation applications have been submitted for generic versions of the drug in europe the sales of dexdor was at level with comparative period but generic competition is expected to intensify in the future we have reacquired from novartis the european sales and distribution rights for the parkinson s drugs stalevo and comtan following the reacquisition we expect the full year sales of these parkinson s drugs to match last year s despite continuously expanding generic competition the decline in parkinson s drugs sales seen in the first half of the year is explained by the timing of partner deliveries in particular in 2018 there were more partner deliveries on the first half of the year while this year we expect there to be more on the second half of the year net sales of specialty products was at level with the previous year although sales in our biggest market finland continued to decline due to price competition however the average prices of reference priced prescription drugs did not decline in the second quarter compared to the first april to june 2019 was the first quarter in nearly two years when the net sales of this business division increased from the comparative period the ongoing projects supporting growth are expected to burden orion s profit in 2019 by an estimated eur 30 million this comprises clearly increased depreciation as well as investments in sales and marketing and research at the same time operating profit is burdened by intense price competition in the market and gradually expanding generic competition for orion s old proprietary drugs the outlook remains unchanged orion estimates that its net sales in 2019 will slightly increase from 2018 projected net sales include the possible eur 45 million milestone payment related to the commercialisation of darolutamide operating profit is projected to be on the same level as in 2018 the projection includes the possible eur 45 million milestone payment associated with the commercialisation of darolutamide as well as significant investments in actions to generate growth the complete outlook estimate and the basis for it can be found in this report under outlook for 2019 and basis for outlook key events in the review period from april to june 1 apr 2019 the sales and distribution rights in certain european countries for the parkinson s disease drug comtan developed by orion transferred back to orion from novartis orion estimates that the return of the sales rights will initially increase its comtan sales by several million euros on annual level 29 apr 2019 the united states food and drug administration fda accepted the marketing authorisation application for darolutamide for review and granted it priority review

eur 493 493 million exchange rates impacted net sales positively by eur 3 million net sales of orion s top ten pharmaceuticals in january june were eur 237 231 million they accounted for 48 47 of the total net sales operating profit the orion group s operating profit was down by 23 at eur 107 140 million gross profit from product and service sales was eur 7 million lower than in the comparative period the negative effect of the decline in net sales calculated in local currencies on gross profit was eur 2 million and change in margins reduced the gross profit by eur 7 million exchange rate changes had a eur 2 million positive effect on the gross profit milestone payments accounted for eur 1 3 million and royalties for eur 7 9 million of net sales and operating profit the decline in other operating income also had a eur 3 million negative impact on the operating profit operating expenses increased by eur 19 million operating expenses the group s sales and marketing expenses totalled eur 107 97 million the growth was mostly due to depreciation associated with the reacquisition of european rights for stalevo as well as investments in the sales of the easyhaler product portfolio in particular r d expenses were eur 58 52 million they accounted for 12 10 of the group s net sales research projects are reported in more detail under the business review part of this

eur 0 59 0 78 equity per share was eur 4 55 4 99 the return on capital employed before taxes roce was 27 65 and the return on equity after taxes roe 24 70 the high figures in the comparative period are explained by the eur 128 million capital gain recognised for the sale of orion diagnostica financial position the group s gearing was 2 8 and the equity ratio 73 67 the group s total liabilities at 30 june 2019 were eur 259 370 million at the end of the period interest bearing liabilities amounted to eur 38 151 million including eur 5 1 million of long term loans the change in interest bearing liabilities was mostly due to the fact that the eur 150 million bond loan issued by orion in 2013 matured in june 2019 the company acquired substitutive financing by issuing commercial papers after the matured bond loan was paid off the group had eur 27 205 million of cash and cash equivalents and money market investments at the end of the period the cash and cash equivalents are invested in short term money market instruments issued by financially solid financial institutions and corporations orion signed a eur 100 million loan agreement with the european investment bank in january 2019 the loan has not yet been raised cash flow cash flow from operating activities was eur 98 106 million cash flow declined less than the operating profit since cash tied up in working capital increased more slowly than in the comparative period the cash flow from investing activities was eur 18 140 million the cash flow from investing activities was positive in the comparative period due to the sale of orion diagnostica the cash flow from financing activities was eur 338 203 million the difference to the comparative period is mostly due to the repayment of the bond loan that matured in june orion has also bought back its own shares by eur 7 million capital expenditure the group s capital expenditure totalled eur 19 20 million this comprised eur 13 17 million on property plant and equipment and eur 5 3 million on intangible assets key business targets for 2019 target development 1 6 2019 preparing for the launch and commercialisation of the prostate cancer drug darolutamide in collaboration with bayer assuming that the marketing authorisation process progresses as planned continued research and development collaboration in the arasens trial metastatic prostate cancer to expand the indication marketing authorisation applications submitted in main markets in the united states the fda granted priority review for the application with recruitment completed the arasens trial continues as planned development of orally administered levosimendan odm 109 for als in phase iii clinical trial and preparation for its possible commercialisation in research and development the potential of different projects are reviewed with consideration of the total research portfolio patient recruitment was completed in july 2019 strengthening orion s position as the most significant provider of generic drugs in finland and competitive pricing development of a competitive product portfolio in specialty products and strengthening of product launches orion s sales volume of reference priced prescription drugs in finland grew faster than the market accelerating the growth of the easyhaler product family and strengthening its market position the launch of the salmeterol fluticasone easyhaler progressing in europe easyhaler product family sales increased by 20 per cent evaluation of new in licensing opportunities in europe particularly in the area of hospital care the work continues orion regularly monitors the progress of these goals in its financial reports outlook for 2019 issued on 6 february 2019 orion estimates that in 2019 net sales will be slightly higher than in 2018 net sales in 2018 were eur 977 million the estimated net sales include the possible eur 45 million milestone payment associated with the commercialisation of darolutamide the operating profit is estimated to be at the same level as in 2018 operating profit in 2018 was eur 253 million the estimated operating profit includes the possible eur 45 million milestone payment associated with the commercialisation of darolutamide as well as significant investments in actions to generate growth basis for outlook in more detail orion continues persistent actions to generate growth more rapidly than growth of the market in the long term the ongoing projects supporting growth are expected to burden orion s profit in 2019 by an estimated eur 30 million this comprises clearly increased depreciation as well as investments in sales and marketing and research at the same time operating profit is burdened by intense price competition in the market and gradually expanding generic competition for orion s old proprietary drugs net sales the sales of the easyhaler product family will continue to grow also in 2019 due to combined formulations budesonide formoterol and salmeterol fluticasone launched in the past few years orion reacquired from novartis the european sales and distribution rights for the parkinson s drugs stalevo and comtan in december 2018 and april 2019 respectively due to the anticipated additional sales of slightly over eur 20 million following the transactions the sales of orion s branded parkinson s drugs comtess comtan and stalevo are estimated to remain at the same level as in the previous year despite continuously expanding generic competition in several european countries marketing authorisation has been granted for a generic version of dexdor generic competition commenced in germany in 2017 and expanded to a few other european countries during 2018 in 2019 generic competition is estimated to further expand in the eu and the sales of the product to turn to decline orion has also been informed that marketing authorisation applications have been filed for a generic version of simdax in europe it is however difficult to estimate the impact of generic competition on the sales of dexdor and simdax the patent for the simdax molecule expired in september 2015 but this is still not expected to have a material impact on sales of the product in 2019 orion is continuing actions to defend its rights sales of generic products account for a significant proportion of orion s total sales competition in finland the most important generic market for orion remains intense in 2019 however product launches continue to support orion s position as market leader in finland at the beginning of 2017 changes were made to the pricing system for substitutable prescription drugs in finland by narrowing the so called price band the change caused an estimated eur 15 million yearly sales decline both in 2017 and 2018 thus the cumulative two year negative impact was around eur 30 million the 2019 outlook assumes that the impact of the system change and its effect in lowering prices will still be significant but slightly smaller than in the two previous years in the first half of 2019 the sales of reference priced drugs in the finnish market declined by 8 and the sales of orion s reference priced drugs declined by 7 the volume of these sales grew by 3 and the volume of orion s sales by 4 source pharmarket sales statistics 1 6 2019 in 2017 the eur 57 million sales of the biosimilar remsima generated a significant portion of the growth in net sales of the specialty products business division but in 2018 remsima sales were materially lower due to intensified competition and declined price level besides remsima orion has launched other biosimilars such as ritemvia rituximab and amgevita adalimumab as a whole the sales of biosimilars are expected to increase from 2018 collaboration agreements with other pharmaceutical companies are an important component of orion s business model agreements often include payments recorded in net sales that vary greatly from year to year forecasting the timing and amount of these payments is difficult in some cases they are conditional on for instance the progress or findings of research projects which are not known until studies have been completed on the other hand neither the outcome nor the schedule of contract negotiations is generally known before the final signing of the agreement the possible eur 45 million milestone payment associated with the commercialisation of the prostate cancer drug darolutamide in the united states is included in the outlook for 2019 and is expected to materialise in the coming months expenditure the start of production at fermion s new manufacturing plant in hanko increases production costs by around eur 3 million following depreciation the investment is an important part of orion s preparation for the future in the short term however increased depreciation has a negative impact on profit since the new plant replaces the one built in the 1970s marketing expenditure will be higher than in the previous year due to additional promotion of sales of the easyhaler product portfolio in countries where these products have been launched in recent years in 2019 expenditure will also be increased by a eur 12 million depreciation related to the acquisition of european sales and distribution rights for the parkinson s drugs stalevo and comtan orion paid a total of usd 28 million for the transfer of the sales rights in december 2018 and in april 2019 and the investment will be depreciated over two years because the registrations and launches of new products are projects that generally take more than a year the increases in resources and other inputs required in 2019 were mainly planned during the previous year research and development costs are estimated to be higher than in 2018 in particular due to the phase iii refals clinical trial evaluating levosimendan odm 109 for the treatment of symptoms of als of the eur 60 million total investment in the roughly three year trial it is estimated that more than eur 25 million will be spent in 2019 research and development costs are partly the company s internal fixed cost items such as salaries and maintenance of the operating infrastructure and partly external variable costs external costs arise from among other things long term clinical trials which are typically performed in clinics located in several countries the most important clinical trials scheduled for 2019 are either continuing from the previous year or at an advanced stage of planning therefore their cost level can be estimated rather accurately however the accrued costs are materially affected by collaboration arrangements and how the costs arising are allocated between orion and its collaboration partners for instance bayer is paying the majority of the darolutamide research costs investments the group s total capital expenditure in 2019 is expected to be lower than in 2018 when capital expenditure was eur 65 million near term risks and uncertainties the reacquisition of european sales and distribution rights for stalevo and comtan will generate additional sales for orion s branded parkinson s drugs in 2019 on the other hand sales will decline due to continued generic competition these effects have been taken into account in the outlook estimate for the current year however they still entail uncertainty that may materially affect the accuracy of the estimate made at this stage the basic dexdor and simdax patents have expired and dexdor s indication patent expired at the end of march 2019 in several european countries marketing authorisation has been granted for a generic version of dexdor generic competition commenced in germany in 2017 and expanded to a few other european countries during 2018 in 2019 generic competition is estimated to further expand in the eu and the sales of the product to turn to decline orion has also been informed that marketing authorisation applications have been filed for a generic version of simdax in europe it is however difficult to estimate the impact of generic competition on the sales of dexdor and simdax as regards simdax the possible generic competition is still not estimated to materially impact its sales in 2019 sales of individual products and also orion s sales in individual markets may vary for example depending on the extent to which the ever tougher price and other competition prevailing in pharmaceuticals markets in recent years will specifically focus on orion s products deliveries of parkinson s drugs to novartis the most important collaboration partner are based on timetables that are jointly agreed in advance nevertheless they can change for example as a consequence of decisions by novartis concerning adjustments of stock levels in addition changes in market prices and exchange rates affect the value of deliveries to novartis the structural exchange rate risk due to the us dollar has decreased in recent years because the share of orion s net sales invoiced in dollars has fallen to below ten per cent and at the same time the value of purchases in dollars has increased the greatest exchange rate risk at present relates to european currencies such as the swedish crown and british pound however the overall effect of the risk due to currencies of european countries will be abated by the fact that orion has organisations of its own in most of these countries which means that in addition to sales income there are also costs in these currencies changes in the japanese yen exchange rate have become more important as sales of parkinson s drugs in japan have increased the exchange rate effect related to the russian rouble has increased due to the strong volatility of the currency however russian sales are not a significant portion of orion s entire net sales orion s broad product range may cause risks to the delivery reliability and make it challenging to maintain the high quality standard required in production authorities and key customers in different countries undertake regular and detailed inspections of development and manufacturing of drugs at orion s production sites any remedial actions that may be required may at least temporarily have effects that decrease delivery reliability and increase costs orion s product range also includes products manufactured by other pharmaceutical companies possible problems related to the delivery reliability or quality of the products of those manufacturers may cause a risk to orion s delivery reliability the single channel system used for pharmaceuticals distribution in finland in which orion s products have been delivered to customers through only one wholesaler may also cause risks to delivery reliability to ensure deliveries in addition to oriola finland oy there are also other distributors temporarily distributing certain orion products research projects always entail uncertainty factors that may either increase or decrease estimated costs the projects may progress more slowly or faster than assumed or they may be discontinued nonetheless changes that may occur in ongoing clinical studies are reflected in costs relatively slowly and they are not expected to have a material impact on earnings in the current year owing to the nature of the research process the timetables and costs of new studies that are being started are known well in advance they therefore typically do not lead to unexpected changes in the estimated cost structure orion often undertakes the last in other words phase iii clinical trials in collaboration with other pharmaceutical companies commencement of these collaboration relationships and their structure also materially affect the schedule and cost level of research projects collaboration arrangements are an important component of orion s business model possible collaboration and licensing agreements related to these arrangements also often include payments to be recorded in net sales that may materially affect orion s financial results in 2014 2018 the annual payments varied from eur 5 million to eur 39 million the payments may be subject to certain conditions relating to the development of research projects or sales and whether these conditions are triggered and the timing of triggering always entail uncertainties the possible eur 45 million milestone payment associated with the commercialisation of the prostate cancer drug darolutamide in the united states is included in the outlook for 2019 and is expected to materialise in the coming months orion s dividend distribution policy orion s dividend distribution takes into account the distributable funds and the capital expenditure and other financial requirements in the medium and long term to achieve the financial objectives financial objectives through the financial objectives orion aims to develop the group s shareholder value and ensure financial stability and profitable growth orion s financial objectives are growing net sales more rapidly than growth of the pharmaceuticals market achievement of this objective requires continuous investment in development of the product portfolio maintaining profitability at a good level the aim is operating profit that exceeds 25 of net sales keeping the equity ratio at least 50 distributing an annual dividend that in the next few years will be at least eur 1 30 per share and increasing the dividend in the long term in the short term what actually happens may deviate from the objectives r d projects that have made promising progress will probably somewhat increase the company s research expenses in the next few years however agreements already made relating to research projects and their good progress and possible new agreements with partners relating to other projects are expected to generate material milestone payments in coming years successful projects will have a positive effect on orion s net sales and especially operating profit

an influential hindu nationalist group close to prime minister narendra modi s ruling party has demanded his government review its plan to raise money by selling foreign currency bonds they say it is anti patriotic as it could create long term risks for the economy potentially allowing rich foreign nations and their financial institutions to dictate the country s policies we can t allow this to happen declared ashwani mahajan the co convenor of swadeshi jagran manch sjm the economic wing of the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh rss the rss was the key founder of the ruling bharatiya janata party and has people it nurtured in top positions in the government including modi himself declaring that the sjm will campaign against the plan by convening meetings of influential economists mahajan said we are confident that government will withdraw its decision on these bonds we must look at the experience of countries that have taken loans from international markets to meet their government deficit the experience of these countries has been far from good he said citing argentina and turkey as examples mahajan said going overseas to borrow may mean that the rupee currency depreciates at a faster rate and allows foreign governments to demand tariff reductions a finance ministry spokesman declined to comment for this story speaking at a business summit in london british prime minister theresa may expressed hope that the indian government would choose the british capital as the location to issue its first international sovereign bonds new delhi has not so far given any details about where they will be issued subhash chandra garg the top official at the finance ministry told indian business leaders last week that the overseas debt move was part of efforts to bring down real interest rates for indian firms to help the economy grow faster we will have a very open attitude to welcome foreign investment and savings because that is what would be required he said also read govt plans to fund highways by issuing bonds with attractive returns garg said that the problem with relying so much on domestic debt was that the government tapped into nearly 80 of total savings in the economy leaving little for private companies as a result those businesses are forced to pay up to 12 13 in interest rates on bank loans the government has in the past considered raising funds from overseas markets but those tasked with determining the feasibility of such a plan have ended up recommending against it most of the debt is of domestic origin insulating the debt portfolio from currency risk india s previous finance minister arun jaitley wrote in a paper on public debt in february last year faddish investors it is not only the rss economic branch that has criticised the government s proposal india should worry about short term faddish investors buying when india is hot and dumping us when it is not former central bank governor raghuram rajan wrote in an article for the times of india newspaper last saturday the sjm has shown it can mobilise opinion to change government policy on several occasions in the past few years including pushing it to take a harder line against genetically modified crops and a more protectionist stance on trade issues it helped to pressure the government into introducing new e commerce regulations in february that upset two american behemoths amazon com inc and walmart the us companies said the move discriminated against them and favoured domestic retailers but the bjp may not bend on this occasion gopal krishna agarwal the bjp s national spokesman on economic affairs said that despite some risks highlighted by the critics the sovereign bonds were the best alternative at this point considering the government s massive investment plans the government s goal of keeping real interest rates low makes it difficult to raise funds in the domestic market at reasonable rates he added agarwal cautioned however that the government has to stick to its fiscal deficit target of 3 3 of gdp for the current year ending next march and ensure that overseas borrowing does not lead to a higher deficit lower costs based on its sovereign credit rating which stands at bbb analysts suggest india would be able to raise u s dollar funds overseas at about 3 2 at current market rates though that figure would rise once hedging costs are taken into account the 10 year government bond the most liquid paper in the domestic debt market closed at 6 33 on tuesday overseas borrowing exposes the government s liabilities to currency fluctuations and can therefore impact domestic interest rates india s vulnerability to external events is very high given its disproportionately high dependence on imported oil said rupa rege nitsure chief economist at l t financial holdings
july 17 2019 4 05 pm edt close email this news article your name your email friend s name friend s email receive copy yes kinder morgan declares 0 25 per share dividend and announces results for second quarter of 2019 houston strong performance in natural gas pipelines segment major permian projects advance kinder morgan inc nyse kmi today announced that its board of directors approved a cash dividend of 0 25 per share for the second quarter 1 00 annualized payable on august 15 2019 to common stockholders of record as of the close of business on july 31 2019 kmi is reporting second quarter net income available to common stockholders of 518 million compared to a net loss of 180 million in the second quarter of 2018 and distributable cash flow dcf of 1 128 million a 1 percent increase over the second quarter of 2018 the dividend we announce today represents a 25 percent increase over the fourth quarter 2018 dividend as we continue to deliver on the dividend growth plan we outlined two years ago said richard d kinder executive chairman during the second quarter we maintained discipline by continuing to fund growth capital through operating cash flows without accessing capital markets in addition fitch ratings recognized our strengthened balance sheet as it joined other ratings agencies in upgrading our credit rating in short the company had another strong quarter and the future is bright said chief executive officer steve kean these are exciting times for kinder morgan with booming u s natural gas and oil production projected to grow more than 30 percent through 2030 continued kean our north american footprint positions us extremely well in both the near and long term as a leading infrastructure provider for those and other essential energy products kean added one of the foundations for our future growth is the fact that our network connects key natural gas supply basins to robust and growing demand points along the gulf coast more than 70 percent of the forecasted u s natural gas demand growth between 2018 and 2030 is expected to be in texas and louisiana where we already have significant assets in place and key growth projects in our backlog led by the natural gas pipelines segment our commercial financial and operating performance in the second quarter was very strong said kmi president kim dang we generated second quarter earnings per common share of 0 23 compared to an 0 08 loss per common share in the second quarter of 2018 at 0 50 per common share dcf per share was flat to the second quarter of 2018 with 559 million of excess dcf above our declared dividend we also made excellent progress on our gulf coast express pipeline project and defeated a court challenge to our permian highway pipeline project we look forward to completing both of those projects as they are critical to the development of resources in the permian basin continued dang as noted above kmi reported second quarter net income available to common stockholders of 518 million compared to a net loss of 180 million for the second quarter of 2018 and dcf of 1 128 million up from 1 117 million for the comparable period in 2018 these increases were due to greater contributions from the natural gas pipelines segment and lower financing costs partially offset by the elimination of the kinder morgan canada business segment following the trans mountain sale and lower commodity prices impacting our co 2 segment net income also improved year over year due to non cash impairments taken during the second quarter of 2018 kmi s project backlog for the second quarter stood at 5 7 billion 400 million less than the first quarter of 2019 with additions of approximately 400 million in new projects primarily in the natural gas pipelines segment offset by approximately 800 million in projects placed in service and other project capital adjustments excluding the co 2 segment projects kmi expects projects in the backlog to generate an average project ebitda multiple of approximately 5 6 times for the first six months of 2019 kmi reported net income available to common stockholders of 1 074 million compared to 305 million for the first six months of 2018 and dcf of 2 499 million up 6 percent from 2 364 million for the comparable period in 2018 net income for the first six months also improved year over year due primarily to the non cash impairments taken during the second quarter of 2018 2019 outlook for 2019 kmi s budget contemplates declared dividends of 1 00 per common share dcf of approximately 5 0 billion 2 20 per common share and adjusted ebitda of approximately 7 8 billion adjusted ebitda is currently estimated to be slightly below budget primarily due to the delay in elba s in service date lower ngl prices impacting the co 2 segment and the impact of 501 g settlements partially offset by the strong performance of the west region natural gas business unit the 501 g settlements were in line with kmi s previous estimates and the resolution of those matters is a positive outcome albeit not reflected in the 2019 budget dcf is expected to be on budget as lower interest expense offsets the slightly lower adjusted ebitda kmi budgeted to invest 3 1 billion in growth projects and contributions to joint ventures during 2019 kmi now expects to be slightly below that amount due to lower capital expenditures in the co 2 segment kmi expects to use internally generated cash flow to fund the vast majority of its 2019 discretionary spending without the need to access equity markets due to the adjusted ebitda impact discussed above kmi now expects to end 2019 with a net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio of approximately 4 6 times kmi does not provide budgeted net income available to common stockholders the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to dcf and adjusted ebitda or budgeted metrics derived therefrom such as the portion of net income attributable to an individual capital project the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to project ebitda due to the impracticality of predicting certain amounts required by gaap such as unrealized gains and losses on derivatives marked to market and potential changes in estimates for certain contingent liabilities kmi s budgeted expectations assume average annual prices for west texas intermediate wti crude oil of 60 00 per barrel and henry hub natural gas of 3 15 per million british thermal units mmbtu consistent with forward pricing during the company s budget process the vast majority of revenue kmi generates is fee based and therefore not directly exposed to commodity prices for 2019 kmi estimates that every 1 per barrel change in the average wti crude oil price impacts dcf by approximately 9 million each 1 percent change in the ratio of the weighted average ngl price per barrel to the wti crude oil price per barrel impacts dcf by approximately 3 million and each 0 10 per mmbtu change in the price of natural gas impacts dcf by approximately 1 million the primary area where kmi has commodity price sensitivity is in its co 2 segment with the majority of the segment s next 12 months of oil and ngl production hedged to minimize this sensitivity details may be found in the supplemental earnings pages posted on kmi s website at overview of business segments the natural gas pipelines segment s financial performance for the second quarter of 2019 was higher relative to the second quarter of 2018 said dang the transmission assets saw higher revenue on el paso natural gas epng due to increases in its base business and expansion related activity driven by permian basin demand partially offset by the negative impact of the 501 g settlement from tennessee gas pipeline tgp due to projects placed in service and on kinder morgan louisiana pipeline kmlp due to the sabine pass expansion that went into service in december 2018 the segment also benefited from continued growth on its gathering and processing assets in louisiana and texas due to increased drilling and production in the haynesville and eagle ford basins respectively natural gas transport volumes were up 10 percent compared to the second quarter of 2018 with the largest gains on epng and kmlp followed by colorado interstate gas pipeline company cig wyoming interstate company wic and ruby pipeline this constitutes the sixth quarter in a row in which volumes exceeded the previous comparable prior year period by 10 percent or more epng benefited from permian related activity and colder weather in california kmlp s increase was due to the sabine pass expansion in service cig improved due to increased production in the dj basin and colder weather wic saw higher flows from the dj and powder river basins and ruby volumes were up due to colder west coast weather and pacific northwest pipeline outages natural gas gathering volumes were up 16 percent from the second quarter of 2018 due primarily to higher volumes on the kinderhawk and south texas midstream systems ngl volumes were up 6 percent compared to the second quarter of 2018 natural gas is critical to the american economy to meeting the world s evolving energy needs and to cost effectively achieving greenhouse gas emissions reductions independent analysts project that u s natural gas demand including exports to mexico and net exports of liquefied natural gas lng displacing more carbon intensive fuels will increase from 2018 levels by 34 percent to more than 120 bcf d by 2030 consistent with kmi s own internal modeling of the natural gas consumed in the u s about 40 percent moves on kmi pipelines and roughly the same percentage holds true for u s natural gas exports analysts project that future natural gas infrastructure opportunities through 2030 will be driven by greater demand for gas fired power generation across the country forecast to increase by 13 percent net lng exports forecast to increase more than five fold net exports to mexico forecast to rise by 57 percent and continued industrial development up 18 percent particularly in the petrochemical industry the products pipelines segment earnings were down slightly compared with the second quarter of 2018 as strong contributions from kinder morgan southeast terminals central florida pipeline double eagle pipeline and the km condensate processing facility were offset by reduced contributions from km crude condensate pipeline kmcc due to lower average re contracted rates and from sfpp due primarily to higher operating expenses dang said crude and condensate pipeline volumes were up 2 percent compared to the second quarter of 2018 while total refined products volumes were flat versus the same period in 2018 terminals segment earnings were up this quarter due to an impairment taken in the second quarter of 2018 that was treated as a certain item segment earnings before certain items were down in the liquids business which accounts for nearly 80 percent of the segment total increased contributions from expansion projects placed in service and higher throughput and ancillary contributions were more than offset by reduced volumes as well as off hire time on our jones act tankers caused by mississippi river closures due to historically high water levels along with tank lease costs at the edmonton south terminal paid pursuant to a lease agreement with trans mountain that became a third party arrangement due to our sale of trans mountain said dang contributions from the terminals segment s bulk business were down compared to the second quarter of 2018 on lower volumes across several key commodities including petroleum coke steel and coal the co 2 segment was negatively impacted versus the second quarter of 2018 primarily by lower ngl and crude oil prices our weighted average ngl price for the quarter was down 9 30 per barrel or 28 percent from the second quarter of 2018 our realized weighted average crude oil price for the quarter was down 14 percent at 49 95 per barrel compared to 58 08 per barrel for the second quarter of 2018 largely driven by our midland cushing basis hedges said dang second quarter 2019 combined oil production across all of our fields was down 2 percent compared to the same period in 2018 on a net to kmi basis with an 8 percent increase in tall cotton volumes and a 1 percent increase in sacroc volumes offset by declines at our other assets co 2 volumes were up 12 percent on a net to kmi basis compared to the second quarter of 2018 mcelmo dome production was up 12 percent over the same period in 2018 while bravo dome and doe canyon experienced lower production compared to the previous comparable period second quarter 2019 net ngl sales volumes of 10 4 thousand barrels per day were up 3 percent compared to the same period in 2018 other news natural gas pipelines at the end of june the travis county district court dismissed all claims raised against the permian highway pipeline php

dd a and certain items segment ebda before certain items net income before interest expense taxes dd a and certain items adjusted ebitda adjusted earnings adjusted earnings per common share net debt adjusted net debt and project ebitda are presented herein our non gaap measures described above should not be considered alternatives to gaap net income or other gaap measures and have important limitations as analytical tools our computations of these non gaap measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others you should not consider these non gaap measures in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under gaap dcf should not be used as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities computed under gaap management compensates for the limitations of these non gaap performance measures by reviewing our comparable gaap measures understanding the differences between the measures and taking this information into account in its analysis and its decision making processes certain items as used to calculate our non gaap measures are items that are required by gaap to be reflected in net income but typically either 1 do not have a cash impact for example asset impairments or 2 by their nature are separately identifiable from our normal business operations and in our view are likely to occur only sporadically for example certain legal settlements enactment of new tax legislation and casualty losses dcf is calculated by adjusting net income available to common stockholders before certain items for dd a total book and cash taxes sustaining capital expenditures and other items dcf is a significant performance measure useful to management and external users of our financial statements in evaluating our performance and in measuring and estimating the ability of our assets to generate cash earnings after servicing our debt paying cash taxes and expending sustaining capital that could be used for discretionary purposes such as common stock dividends stock repurchases retirement of debt or expansion capital expenditures we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to dcf is net income available to common stockholders a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to dcf is provided herein dcf per common share is dcf divided by average outstanding common shares including restricted stock awards that participate in dividends segment ebda before certain items is used by management in its analysis of segment performance and management of our business general and administrative expenses are generally not under the control of our segment operating managers and therefore are not included when we measure business segment operating performance we believe segment ebda before certain items is a significant performance metric because it provides us and external users of our financial statements additional insight into the ability of our segments to generate segment cash earnings on an ongoing basis we believe it is useful to investors because it is a measure that management uses to allocate resources to our segments and assess each segment s performance we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to segment ebda before certain items is segment earnings before dd a and amortization of excess cost of equity investments segment ebda segment ebda before certain items is calculated by adjusting segment ebda for the certain items attributable to a segment which are specifically identified in the footnotes to the accompanying tables adjusted

administrative expenses attributable to such project or for joint venture projects our percentage share of the foregoing management uses project ebitda to evaluate our return on investment for capital projects before expenses that are generally not controllable by operating managers in our business segments we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to project ebitda is the portion of net

5 full time versus part time the devil will be in the detail too because there is more at play than just the headline unemployment rate that matter of spare capacity also includes the issue of underemployment which has despite falls in the unemployment rate in recent years kept stubbornly high the unemployment rate is forecast to come in steady today at 5 2 per cent and the economy is expected to have added a modest 9000 jobs last month but here is the nuance how many of these will be full time and how many will be part time last month most were the latter policymakers will be hoping we don t see a repeat performance 6 stock investors won t mind soft jobs numbers investors perhaps paradoxically might be hoping for the former in order to prompt the rba to cut rates again having fallen to all time lows last month longer term interest rates have climbed recently as a slightly improved outlook for the global economy nudged markets into unwinding bets of massive monetary stimulus from global central bankers that dynamic has driven money away marginally from australian stocks where valuations have become relatively less appealing hence market bulls will likely be hoping for a slight miss in the labour market figures to bring forward those bets and support share prices 7 australian dollar in focus the aussie will also be in focus as it holds onto the 70us level after wednesday s us dollar rally the aussie has bounced recently courtesy of an overall weaker greenback with the us fed clearly winning the global race to the bottom in devaluing its currency and signalling future rate cuts which makes the australian dollar really a us dollar story for now but a global economic slowdown is apparently upon us and the aussie is approaching a long term downward trend line against the greenback a miss in unemployment numbers today could feed into that trend and put the australian dollar under pressure 8 market watch asx futures were down15 points or 0 23 per cent at 6 591 0 at around 7am aest aud flat at 70 11 us cents on wall st dow 0 4 s p 500 0 7 nasdaq 0 5 in new york bhp 0 8 rio 0 9 atlassian 0 5 in europe stoxx 50 0 6 ftse 0 6 cac 0 8 dax 0 7 spot gold 1 2 to us1423 65 a tonne at 2 24pm in new york brent crude 1 1 to us63 63 a barrel us oil 1 3 to us56 87 a barrel iron ore 0 7 to us121 27 a tonne dalian iron ore 0 5 to 898 5 yuan lme aluminium 0 2 to us1847 a tonne lme copper 0 5 to us5980 a tonne 2 year yield us 1 81 australia 0 94 5 year yield us 1 81 australia 1 01 10 year yield us 2 04 australia 1 39 germany 0 29 10 year us australia yield gap near 6 45am aest 65 basis points this column was produced in commercial partnership between the sydney morning herald the age and ig
kinder morgan inc nyse kmi today announced that its board of directors approved a cash dividend of 0 25 per share for the second quarter 1 00 annualized payable on august 15 2019 to common stockholders of record as of the close of business on july 31 2019 kmi is reporting second quarter net income available to common stockholders of 518 million compared to a net loss of 180 million in the second quarter of 2018 and distributable cash flow dcf of 1 128 million a 1 percent increase over the second quarter of 2018 during the second quarter we maintained discipline by continuing to fund growth capital through operating cash flows without accessing capital markets in addition fitch ratings recognized our strengthened balance sheet as it joined other ratings agencies in upgrading our credit rating in short the company had another strong quarter and the future is bright said chief executive officer steve kean these are exciting times for kinder morgan with booming u s natural gas and oil production projected to grow more than 30 percent through 2030 continued kean our north american footprint positions us extremely well in both the near and long term as a leading infrastructure provider for those and other essential energy products kean added one of the foundations for our future growth is the fact that our network connects key natural gas supply basins to robust and growing demand points along the gulf coast more than 70 percent of the forecasted u s natural gas demand growth between 2018 and 2030 is expected to be in texas and louisiana where we already have significant assets in place and key growth projects in our backlog led by the natural gas pipelines segment our commercial financial and operating performance in the second quarter was very strong said kmi president kim dang we generated second quarter earnings per common share of 0 23 compared to an 0 08 loss per common share in the second quarter of 2018 at 0 50 per common share dcf per share was flat to the second quarter of 2018 with 559 million of excess dcf above our declared dividend we also made excellent progress on our gulf coast express pipeline project and defeated a court challenge to our permian highway pipeline project we look forward to completing both of those projects as they are critical to the development of resources in the permian basin continued dang as noted above kmi reported second quarter net income available to common stockholders of 518 million compared to a net loss of 180 million for the second quarter of 2018 and dcf of 1 128 million up from 1 117 million for the comparable period in 2018 these increases were due to greater contributions from the natural gas pipelines segment and lower financing costs partially offset by the elimination of the kinder morgan canada business segment following the trans mountain sale and lower commodity prices impacting our co 2 segment net income also improved year over year due to non cash impairments taken during the second quarter of 2018 kmi s project backlog for the second quarter stood at 5 7 billion 400 million less than the first quarter of 2019 with additions of approximately 400 million in new projects primarily in the natural gas pipelines segment offset by approximately 800 million in projects placed in service and other project capital adjustments excluding the co 2 segment projects kmi expects projects in the backlog to generate an average project ebitda multiple of approximately 5 6 times for the first six months of 2019 kmi reported net income available to common stockholders of 1 074 million compared to 305 million for the first six months of 2018 and dcf of 2 499 million up 6 percent from 2 364 million for the comparable period in 2018 net income for the first six months also improved year over year due primarily to the non cash impairments taken during the second quarter of 2018 2019 outlook for 2019 kmi s budget contemplates declared dividends of 1 00 per common share dcf of approximately 5 0 billion 2 20 per common share and adjusted ebitda of approximately 7 8 billion adjusted ebitda is currently estimated to be slightly below budget primarily due to the delay in elba s in service date lower ngl prices impacting the co 2 segment and the impact of 501 g settlements partially offset by the strong performance of the west region natural gas business unit the 501 g settlements were in line with kmi s previous estimates and the resolution of those matters is a positive outcome albeit not reflected in the 2019 budget dcf is expected to be on budget as lower interest expense offsets the slightly lower adjusted ebitda kmi budgeted to invest 3 1 billion in growth projects and contributions to joint ventures during 2019 kmi now expects to be slightly below that amount due to lower capital expenditures in the co 2 segment kmi expects to use internally generated cash flow to fund the vast majority of its 2019 discretionary spending without the need to access equity markets due to the adjusted ebitda impact discussed above kmi now expects to end 2019 with a net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio of approximately 4 6 times kmi does not provide budgeted net income available to common stockholders the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to dcf and adjusted ebitda or budgeted metrics derived therefrom such as the portion of net income attributable to an individual capital project the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to project ebitda due to the impracticality of predicting certain amounts required by gaap such as unrealized gains and losses on derivatives marked to market and potential changes in estimates for certain contingent liabilities kmi s budgeted expectations assume average annual prices for west texas intermediate wti crude oil of 60 00 per barrel and henry hub natural gas of 3 15 per million british thermal units mmbtu consistent with forward pricing during the company s budget process the vast majority of revenue kmi generates is fee based and therefore not directly exposed to commodity prices for 2019 kmi estimates that every 1 per barrel change in the average wti crude oil price impacts dcf by approximately 9 million each 1 percent change in the ratio of the weighted average ngl price per barrel to the wti crude oil price per barrel impacts dcf by approximately 3 million and each 0 10 per mmbtu change in the price of natural gas impacts dcf by approximately 1 million the primary area where kmi has commodity price sensitivity is in its co 2 segment with the majority of the segment s next 12 months of oil and ngl production hedged to minimize this sensitivity details may be found in the supplemental earnings pages posted on kmi s website at overview of business segments the natural gas pipelines segment s financial performance for the second quarter of 2019 was higher relative to the second quarter of 2018 said dang the transmission assets saw higher revenue on el paso natural gas epng due to increases in its base business and expansion related activity driven by permian basin demand partially offset by the negative impact of the 501 g settlement from tennessee gas pipeline tgp due to projects placed in service and on kinder morgan louisiana pipeline kmlp due to the sabine pass expansion that went into service in december 2018 the segment also benefited from continued growth on its gathering and processing assets in louisiana and texas due to increased drilling and production in the haynesville and eagle ford basins respectively natural gas transport volumes were up 10 percent compared to the second quarter of 2018 with the largest gains on epng and kmlp followed by colorado interstate gas pipeline company cig wyoming interstate company wic and ruby pipeline this constitutes the sixth quarter in a row in which volumes exceeded the previous comparable prior year period by 10 percent or more epng benefited from permian related activity and colder weather in california kmlp s increase was due to the sabine pass expansion in service cig improved due to increased production in the dj basin and colder weather wic saw higher flows from the dj and powder river basins and ruby volumes were up due to colder west coast weather and pacific northwest pipeline outages natural gas gathering volumes were up 16 percent from the second quarter of 2018 due primarily to higher volumes on the kinderhawk and south texas midstream systems ngl volumes were up 6 percent compared to the second quarter of 2018 natural gas is critical to the american economy to meeting the world s evolving energy needs and to cost effectively achieving greenhouse gas emissions reductions independent analysts project that u s natural gas demand including exports to mexico and net exports of liquefied natural gas lng displacing more carbon intensive fuels will increase from 2018 levels by 34 percent to more than 120 bcf d by 2030 consistent with kmi s own internal modeling of the natural gas consumed in the u s about 40 percent moves on kmi pipelines and roughly the same percentage holds true for u s natural gas exports analysts project that future natural gas infrastructure opportunities through 2030 will be driven by greater demand for gas fired power generation across the country forecast to increase by 13 percent net lng exports forecast to increase more than five fold net exports to mexico forecast to rise by 57 percent and continued industrial development up 18 percent particularly in the petrochemical industry the products pipelines segment earnings were down slightly compared with the second quarter of 2018 as strong contributions from kinder morgan southeast terminals central florida pipeline double eagle pipeline and the km condensate processing facility were offset by reduced contributions from km crude condensate pipeline kmcc due to lower average re contracted rates and from sfpp due primarily to higher operating expenses dang said crude and condensate pipeline volumes were up 2 percent compared to the second quarter of 2018 while total refined products volumes were flat versus the same period in 2018 terminals segment earnings were up this quarter due to an impairment taken in the second quarter of 2018 that was treated as a certain item segment earnings before certain items were down in the liquids business which accounts for nearly 80 percent of the segment total increased contributions from expansion projects placed in service and higher throughput and ancillary contributions were more than offset by reduced volumes as well as off hire time on our jones act tankers caused by mississippi river closures due to historically high water levels along with tank lease costs at the edmonton south terminal paid pursuant to a lease agreement with trans mountain that became a third party arrangement due to our sale of trans mountain said dang contributions from the terminals segment s bulk business were down compared to the second quarter of 2018 on lower volumes across several key commodities including petroleum coke steel and coal the co 2 segment was negatively impacted versus the second quarter of 2018 primarily by lower ngl and crude oil prices our weighted average ngl price for the quarter was down 9 30 per barrel or 28 percent from the second quarter of 2018 our realized weighted average crude oil price for the quarter was down 14 percent at 49 95 per barrel compared to 58 08 per barrel for the second quarter of 2018 largely driven by our midland cushing basis hedges said dang second quarter 2019 combined oil production across all of our fields was down 2 percent compared to the same period in 2018 on a net to kmi basis with an 8 percent increase in tall cotton volumes and a 1 percent increase in sacroc volumes offset by declines at our other assets co 2 volumes were up 12 percent on a net to kmi basis compared to the second quarter of 2018 mcelmo dome production was up 12 percent over the same period in 2018 while bravo dome and doe canyon experienced lower production compared to the previous comparable period second quarter 2019 net ngl sales volumes of 10 4 thousand barrels per day were up 3 percent compared to the same period in 2018 other news natural gas pipelines at the end of june the travis

printer friendly copy of this earnings release and supplemental earnings information are available under the earnings releases tab in the annual and quarterly reports section of our investor website which can be accessed via the following link non gaap financial measures the non generally accepted accounting principles non gaap financial measures of distributable cash flow dcf both in the aggregate and per share segment earnings before depreciation depletion amortization and amortization of excess cost of equity investments dd a and certain items segment ebda before certain items net income before interest expense taxes dd a and certain items adjusted ebitda adjusted earnings adjusted earnings per common share net debt adjusted net debt and project ebitda are presented herein our non gaap measures described above should not be considered alternatives to gaap net income or other gaap measures and have important limitations as analytical tools our computations of these non gaap measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others you should not consider these non gaap measures in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under gaap dcf should not be used as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities computed under gaap management compensates for the limitations of these non gaap performance measures by reviewing our comparable gaap measures understanding the differences between the measures and taking this information into account in its analysis and its decision making processes certain items as used to calculate our non gaap measures are items that are required by gaap to be reflected in net income but typically either 1 do not have a cash impact for example asset impairments or 2 by their nature are separately identifiable from our normal business operations and in our view are likely to occur only sporadically for example certain legal settlements enactment of new tax legislation and casualty losses dcf is calculated by adjusting net income available to common stockholders before certain items for dd a total book and cash taxes sustaining capital expenditures and other items dcf is a significant performance measure useful to management and external users of our financial statements in evaluating our performance and in measuring and estimating the ability of our assets to generate cash earnings after servicing our debt paying cash taxes and expending sustaining capital that could be used for discretionary purposes such as common stock dividends stock repurchases retirement of debt or expansion capital expenditures we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to dcf is net income available to common stockholders a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to dcf is provided herein dcf per common share is dcf divided by average outstanding common shares including restricted stock awards that participate in dividends segment ebda before certain items is used by management in its analysis of segment performance and management of our business general and administrative expenses are generally not under the control of our segment operating managers and therefore are not included when we measure business segment operating performance we believe segment ebda before certain items is a significant performance metric because it provides us and external users of our financial statements additional insight into the ability of our segments to generate segment cash earnings on an ongoing basis we believe it is useful to investors because it is a measure that management uses to allocate resources to our segments and assess each segment s performance we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to segment ebda before certain items is segment earnings before dd a and amortization of excess cost of equity investments segment ebda segment ebda before certain items is calculated by adjusting segment ebda for the certain items attributable to a segment which are specifically identified in the footnotes to the accompanying tables adjusted ebitda is calculated by adjusting net income before interest expense taxes and dd a ebitda for certain items net income attributable to noncontrolling interests further adjusted for kml noncontrolling interests and kmi s share of certain equity investees dd a net of consolidating joint venture partners share of dd a and book taxes which are specifically identified in the footnotes to the accompanying tables adjusted ebitda is used by management and external users in conjunction with our net debt to evaluate certain leverage metrics therefore we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to investors we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda is net income adjusted earnings is net income available to common stockholders before certain items adjusted earnings is used by us and certain external users of our financial statements to assess the earnings of our business excluding certain items as another reflection of the company s ability to generate earnings we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to adjusted earnings is net income available to common stockholders adjusted earnings per share uses adjusted earnings and applies the same two class method used in arriving at basic earnings per common share net debt and adjusted net debt as used in this news release are non gaap financial measures that management believes are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our leverage net debt is calculated by subtracting from debt i cash and cash equivalents ii the preferred interest in the general partner of kinder morgan energy partners l p iii debt fair value adjustments iv the foreign exchange impact on euro denominated bonds for which we have entered into currency swaps and v 50 of the outstanding kml preferred equity adjusted net debt is net debt with the cash component as of december 31 2018 reduced by the amount of cash distributed to kml s restricted voting shareholders as a return of capital on january 3 2019 and increased by the net of the gain realized on settlement of net investment hedges of our foreign current risk with respect to our share of the kml return of capital on january 3 2019 we believe the most comparable measure to net debt and adjusted net debt is debt net of cash and cash equivalents as reconciled in the notes to the accompanying preliminary consolidated balance sheets page project ebitda as used in this news release is calculated for an individual capital project as earnings before interest expense taxes dd a and general and administrative expenses attributable to such project or for joint venture projects our percentage share of the foregoing management uses project ebitda to evaluate our return on investment for capital projects before expenses that are generally not controllable by operating managers in our business segments we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to project ebitda is the portion of net income attributable to a capital project important information relating

fellow peronists followers of the justicialist party of the late strongman who traditionally favoured labour and big government he privatised state owned companies curbed the power of unions scissored state subsidies and pink slipped thousands on the bloated government payroll in his most controversial manoeuvre menem fixed the exchange rate of the argentinian peso to the american dollar one to one it brought a windfall of foreign investment at first but ultimately proved destabilising making the country impossibly expensive for the vast majority of argentinians menem did himself no favours with an authoritarian tendency that led him to alter the constitution to permit him to seek a second consecutive term as his country slid into recession he did little to hide his taste for ferraris and penchant for squiring beauty queens his political actions and personal extravagance opened the way for de la rua a stalwart of the centrist radical civic union that forged an alliance with disgruntled justicialists de la rua who played up his sedate image in an election that was essentially a referendum on menem did not rouse argentinians with his vibrant oratory or record but he trounced justicialist candidate eduardo duhalde congress along with many governorships remained in peronist hands and de la rua s alianza coalition was fragile less ideologically than opportunistically aligned the country was sliding deeper into recession and de la rua by most accounts hesitated to take assertive steps to reverse course he said drastic moves would spook investors or else provoke economic catastrophe that the political opposition could then use as ammunition against him under pressure from the international monetary fund he made gestures towards austerity including an unsuccessful effort to sell the luxurious presidential jet tango 01 that menem purchased for 66m but he largely maintained menem s economic policies meanwhile it became cheaper for investors to park money in brazil and other countries that had devalued their currency de la rua s coalition frayed with an alleged vote buying scandal in late 2000 in which several administration officials were accused of paying senators 5m to pass a bill weakening workplace protections his vice president resigned reportedly in protest of de la rua s unwillingness to investigate the charges vigorously the president s approval rating plummeted to 7 per cent and the alliance was walloped in the 2001 midterms after a bank run in november 2001 the economy minister domingo cavallo imposed the corralito a last ditch move severely limiting bank withdrawals across the country protesters wielding pots and pans clanged out their anger some started fires on the boulevards of the capital city de la rua declared a state of emergency which did little to lessen public rage demonstrators turned more violent and there was looting de la rua centre during his corruption trial in 2012 he was subsequently acquitted epa authorities deployed tear gas and rubber bullets and rode through the streets on horseback striking protesters with clubs marchers yelled back assassins assassins more than 20 people were killed in confrontations with police and dozens more on both sides were injured de la rua s attempts to form a new government with the opposition were rebuffed in a position he described as total solitude he tendered his resignation on 20 december and alighted by helicopter it was widely seen as a moment of disgrace in a 2016 interview he blamed the imf and his political opposition for creating conditions ripe for a civil coup accusing peronists and the media of encouraging the protests and then blaming the government for repression he also criticised the head of presidential security for insisting on his evacuation by helicopter that was a mistake he said like all those cases in which one allows an image to become a symbol during a series of caretaker administrations and after the election of peronist nestor kirchner in 2003 the government abandoned the fixed exchange rate system and broke with the imf by defaulting temporarily on its debt the economy fell sharply in early 2002 but began to skyrocket after that a demand for argentinian commodities such as beef and soybeans helped to generate ample financial reserves fernando de la rua was born in cordoba argentina s second largest city in 1937 he received a doctorate in law from the university of cordoba at 21 and began his rise in the radical civic union while writing books on legal procedure in 1973 he was elected as a senator representing buenos aires and also was the vice presidential running mate of ricardo balbin who lost decisively to peronist candidate hector campora de la rua returned to legal practice during the junta years and resumed his senate career after the military rule in 1996 he became buenos aires s first elected mayor a position previously filled by presidential appointment his term at the helm of argentina s largest city with 12 million inhabitants was perhaps the high point of his career he vowed to emphasise probity fiscal restraint and good services in a municipality not known for any of those qualities he was credited with transforming a 600m deficit into a surplus by targeting sticky fingered city officials and politically connected business executives who had wangled sweetheart deals he also grew the city s subway system his reputation as a municipal leader helped elevate him to the presidency de la rua faced trial in 2012 and 2013 for his alleged role in the vote buying scandal that tarnished his administration he and several colleagues were acquitted with this verdict he said i have recovered my dignity he is survived by his wife ines pertine urien whom he married in 1970 and three children fernando de la rua born 15 september 1937 died 9 july 2019 washington post
by chris powell of the gold anti trust action committee gata dear friend of gata and gold modern monetary theory which has been getting much attention lately is so controversial mainly because it is misunderstood it is misunderstood first because it is not a theory at all but a truism that is mmt holds essentially that a government issuing a currency without a fixed link to a commodity like gold or silver is constrained in its currency issuance only by inflation and devaluation dispatch continues below this is a very old observation in economics going back centuries even to the classical economist adam smith and perhaps first formally acknowledged by the u s government with a speech given in 1945 by the president of the federal reserve bank of new york beardsley ruml the speech was published in 1946 home hiwaay net becraft rumltaxes html ruml said the necessity for a government to tax in order to maintain both its independence and its solvency is true for state and local governments but it is not true for a national government two changes of the greatest consequence have occurred in the last 25 years which have substantially altered the position of the national state with respect to the financing of its current requirements the first of these changes is the gaining of vast new experience in the management of central banks the second change is the elimination for domestic purposes of the convertibility of the currency into gold final freedom from the domestic money market exists for every sovereign national state where there exists an institution which functions in the manner of a modern central bank and whose currency is not convertible into gold or into some other commodity ruml noted that in a fiat currency system such as the united states had adopted by 1945 government did not need to tax to raise revenue but could create as much money as it wanted and deploy it as it thought best using taxes instead to give value to its currency and implement social and economic policy mmt does not claim that the government should create and deploy infinite money it claims that money can be created and deployed as much as is necessary to improve general living conditions and eliminate unemployment until the currency begins to lose value the second big misunderstanding about mmt is that it is not a mere policy proposal but is actually the policy that has been followed by the u s government for decades without the candor of ruml s 1945 acknowledgment the problem with mmt is that in its unacknowledged practice it already has produced what its misunderstanding critics fear it for the creation and deployment of infinite money and credit by central banks as well as vast inflation in accordance with mmt this creation of infinite money and credit has necessitated central banking s financial repression its suppression of interest rates and commodity prices through both open and surreptitious intervention in bond and futures markets and the issuance of financial derivatives that is since money creation in the current financial system is restrained only by inflation this restraint can be removed or lessened with certain price controls which to be effective must be disguised lest people discern that there are no markets anymore just interventions the british economist peter warburton perceived this in his 2001 essay the debasement of world currency it is inflation but not as we know it www gata org node 8303 warburton wrote what we see at present is a battle between the central banks and the collapse of the financial system fought on two fronts on one front the central banks preside over the creation of additional liquidity for the financial system to hold back the tide of debt defaults that would otherwise occur on the other they incite investment banks and other willing parties to bet against a rise in the prices of gold oil base metals soft commodities or anything else that might be deemed an indicator of inherent value we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us their objective is to deprive the independent observer of any reliable benchmark against which to measure the eroding value not only of the u s dollar but of all fiat currencies equally they seek to deny the investor the opportunity to hedge against the fragility of the financial system by switching into a freely traded market for non financial assets central banks have found the battle on the second front much easier to fight than the first last november i estimated the size of the gross stock of global debt instruments at 90 trillion for mid 2000 how much capital would it take to control the combined gold oil and commodity markets probably no more than 200 billion using derivatives moreover it is not necessary for the central banks to fight the battle themselves although central bank gold sales and gold leasing have certainly contributed to the cause most of the world s large investment banks have overtraded their capital so flagrantly that if the central banks were to lose the fight on the first front then the stock of the investment banks would be worthless because their fate is intertwined with that of the central banks investment banks are willing participants in the battle against rising gold oil and commodity prices this financial repression and commodity price suppression have channeled into financial and real estate assets the assets of property owners the vast inflation resulting from the policy of infinite money creation thereby diverting inflation from assets whose prices are measured by government s consumer price indexes meanwhile those indexes are constantly distorted and falsified to avoid giving alarm as a result the ownership class is enriched and the working class impoverished of course this is exactly the opposite of what mmt s advocates intend but while the monetary science conceived by mmt people well might develop a formula for operating a perfect monetary system with full employment and prosperity for all the monetary system always will confer nearly absolute power on its operators and as long as the operators are human such power will always corrupt many of them even mmt s advocates themselves that s why market rigging is the inevitable consequence of mmt as it is now practiced and why the world is losing its free and competitive markets to monopoly and oligopoly and becoming less democratic and more totalitarian so what is the solution maybe some libertarianism would help let governments use whatever they want as money but let individuals do the same and don t mess with them gold cryptocurrencies seashells oxen whatever leave them alone most of all require government to be completely transparent in whatever it does in the markets if government wants to rig markets require that it be done in the open and reported contemporaneously after all the world can hardly know where to go when it isn t permitted to know where it is chris powell secretary treasurer gold anti trust action committee inc cpowell gata org join gata here new orleans investment conference hilton new orleans riverside hotel friday

the us dollar traded lower against all of the major currencies on wednesday as treasury yields resumed their slide the new zealand benefitted the most from the decline rising to its strongest level in 3 months sterling which had fallen to a year to date low versus the greenback during the european session recovered steadily into the ny close ending the day in positive territory housing starts and building permits dropped more than expected but the sell off in the dollar really didn t begin until the ny equity market open stocks started to fall and along followeds the us dollar the federal reserve s beige book didn t hurt as the fed districts reported a modest expansion with little change from the previous month most of their assessments were positive they said manufacturing was flat but a few districts reported a modest pickup employment growth slowed slightly but their outlook is positive and they expect continued modest growth ahead the problem is the widespread concern created by trade uncertainty this outlook is consistent with the central bank s broader views and did not have had a meaningful impact on the greenback instead the dollar took its cues from yields and stocks which should remain the case for the rest of the week tomorrow s philadelphia fed survey should be stronger given the uptick in manufacturing activity in the ny region there hasn t been any meaningful progress in us china trade talks and president trump isn t pleased on tuesday he said there s a long way to go on trade talks before an agreement can be reached and if china isn t serious he could unfreeze the final round of tariffs while china wants the tariffs rolled back it is not clear how far they will bend for this to happen their commerce minister was added to the negotiating team last week and many see an agreement more difficult with his hard line stance according to commerce minister zhong shang the us has started this economic and trade dispute with us in violation of the principles of the world trade organisation a classic example of unilateralism and protectionism we must make the best of the spirit of struggle and stand firm in defending the interests of our country and the people as well as the multilateral trading system aud and nzd took the news in stride with the latter rising to its strongest level in 3 months but if it becomes more apparent that trade talks turn sour both currencies could suffer in the meantime nzd is outperforming its neighbor thanks to better than expected inflation data and higher dairy prices australian labor market numbers are scheduled for release tonight there s a good chance that job growth slowed because according to the pmis employment growth in the manufacturing and service sectors slowed in the month of june aud usd is at the cusp of a turn and weak labor market numbers could take it down to 6950 easily the canadian dollar continues to rise despite benign data although consumer prices declined less than expected in the month of june the 0 2 decrease was still the first drop in inflation this year it drove the year over year rate down to 2 from 2 4 and the details of the report showed a decline in prices and internet services lower inflation is one of the main reasons why the central bank turned dovish this month but none of that seem to matter to the canadian dollar with oil prices falling for the fifth day in a row it should only be a matter of time before usd cad bottoms as it is currently only being pressured lowered by the us dollar euro rebounded on the back of stronger inflation data but uk data was mixed inflationary pressures stagnated in june leaving the year over year rate unchanged at 2 as noted by our colleague boris schlossberg overall inflation readings in uk remain steady providing no impetus for boe to move either way for now the focus in cable remains squarely on politics but after all the harsh rhetoric from torries regarding a hard brexit the markets appear to have settled down with traders now looking to see the next moves from london and brussels once the leadership transition in both places is completed
an overview of an offshore wind farm in zhejiang province s zhoushan city in china yao feng china daily clean energy environmentally friendly technology green infrastructure planet preserving finance and sustainable economic development on a global scale is achievable with sustained efforts sharp focus visionary policy and imaginative project implementation that s the takeaway for umpteen businesses participating in and benefiting from the china led belt and road initiative bri experts have said the bri is getting greener they said china spearheads the bri to create transcontinental infrastructural and trade networks across land and sea routes so as to deliver development and prosperity to billions of people around the world more businesses are sewing up plans to invest trillions of dollars to promote environmentally friendly infrastructure and technology projects in over 130 economies participating in the bri and given the bri s global scale the go green thrust on development will have far reaching impact on the participating economies in the coming decades they said with the deepening of the bri green development should be taken as a top priority in addition to other key factors like gross domestic product and employment said ma jun chairman of the green finance committee of the china society for finance and banking ma made the remarks at a panel discussion during the world economic forum s wef s annual meeting of the new champions 2019 known as summer davos the event was held in liaoning province s dalian city earlier this month the majority of investments worldwide in the coming decades will be in the bri economies so the initiative is expected to drive a huge amount of capital globally said ma the timing of his remarks coincides with china s newfound focus on environmentally friendly development via the bri to be in line with the un 2030 agenda for sustainable development china s stance is expected to inject fresh impetus into efforts for economic development in bri economies green bri is also part of china s broader efforts to promote high quality development high quality infrastructure construction will greatly improve environment and lead to high quality economic growth experts said president xi jinping shared his vision for green development at the first belt and road forum brf for international cooperation in may 2017 he urged participating economies to embrace the new vision of green development and a way of life and work that is green low carbon circular and sustainable xi reiterated his vision at the second brf in april this year joint development of the initiative is also aimed at building an open and green development road he said china and other bri economies reached a broad consensus at the forum on high quality green development the country aims to bring greater development opportunities to other countries around the world through the bri jeffrey wong head of advisory at market consultancy kpmg china said at summer davos during this process chinese companies are actively engaged in a lot of environment related projects such as renewable energy like wind and solar clean energy including lng and lpg as well as environment utilities these projects have helped reduce consumption of energy and boosted the development of local economies he said for instance chint group a chinese industrial electrical equipment and new energy enterprise is helping construct several hundred photovoltaic power stations in economies relating to the bri photovoltaic generated by solar cells is a clean and renewable energy it has long been considered the key to a country s efforts to transform its energy mix and boost safety chint chairman and founder nan cunhui said while helping build photovoltaic infrastructure we also brought our most advanced clean technologies and concepts to bri economies especially the underdeveloped ones and that turned out to be an important accelerator of local economic and social development the leqing zhejiang province based firm has also offered its high and low voltage products and services to 80 per cent of the bri markets including pakistan thailand egypt and russia nan said more green than black according to a report by the global development policy center s global china initiative at boston university china s investments in power generation have been more green than black over the past few years over 50 per cent of the country s investments in power generation projects around the world are related to clean energy that has water wind or the sun as the main source the report said the total investment in energy projects in bri related countries and regions has reached 186 3 billion of this the clean energy sector accounts for 26 per cent in chile south america the first batch of 100 chinese made electric buses of byd which offer quiet smooth quick and green rides are being inducted into the local public transport fleet an employee works at a chint group solar panel production plant in zhejiang province s hangzhou city in china liang zhen china daily chilean president sebastian pinera said the nation hopes to cooperate with chinese companies like byd in clean energy chile boasts solar wind and tidal energy resources and is in need of such projects that can exploit them he said kpmg s wong allayed fears that the bri may gradually morph into a vehicle that transports pollution from china to other countries china s green bri proves that the concept of production capacity cooperation does not really mean shifting industry that may be highly polluting and a big consumer of energy from china to bri countries instead china is sharing advanced technologies and industry expertise to benefit bri countries helping them develop the local industry and enabling sustainable growth besides technologies and expertise effective financing is crucial for green development the asian development bank estimated that asia would need 1 7 trillion of infrastructure investment annually between 2016 and 2030 so china has led the path of green finance by encouraging flow of capital into more sustainable projects it helped found the silk road fund in december 2014 to offer investment and financing support for trade and economic activities within the framework of the bri the chinese government contributed 40 billion to the fund and added 100 billion yuan 14 5 billion in 2017 by the end of last year the fund had pledged to back 28 projects entailing investments of over 11 billion at the wef s dalian event cambodian minister of public works and transport sun chanthol acknowledged the significance of this move it was not easy for most developing countries to get financing for road and railway construction yet china led bri including the silk road fund has offered a hand such help enabled cambodia to build its first high speed railway which is expected to reduce air pollution and congestion as well as promote economic prosperity he said another shining example of development oriented finance is green bonds when the world bank issued the first ever green bond over 10 years ago it was a novelty that raised tens of millions of dollars but by mid 2018 the world had 1 45 trillion of climate aligned bonds outstanding china has been leading the region s shift toward financing with green bonds and has been at the forefront of using green bonds to finance sustainable development said rajiv biswas asia pacific chief economist at ihs markit in an article published in china daily in 2016 china officially launched its green bond market and issued labelled green bonds worth 205 2 billion yuan china was also the first country to make it compulsory for all listed firms and bond issuers to disclose the environmental social and governance risks associated with their operations by next year several large chinese banks including industrial and commercial bank of china ltd bank of china ltd and china development bank corp have issued climate bonds this april icbc also issued its first green bond focusing on belt and road interbank cooperation offered in three currencies the bond aims to support the development of green projects under the bri and boost interbank cooperation in the region media reported that china is by far the largest issuer of green bonds among the world s emerging

looking statements are subject to the following principal risks and uncertainties our businesses financial results and balance sheet values are affected by business and economic conditions including the following changes in interest rates and valuations in debt equity and other financial markets disruptions in the u s and global financial markets actions by the federal reserve board u s treasury and other government agencies including those that impact money supply and market interest rates changes in customer behavior due to recently enacted tax legislation changing business and economic

financial market conditions will be substantially different than those we are currently expecting and do not take into account potential legal and regulatory contingencies these statements are based on our views that u s economic growth has accelerated over the past two years to above its long run trend however growth is expected to slow over the course of 2019 and into 2020 we expect that further gradual improvement in the labor market this year including job gains and rising wages will be another positive for consumer spending slower global economic growth trade restrictions and geopolitical concerns are downside risks to the forecast inflation has slowed in early 2019 to below the fomc s 2 percent objective but is expected to gradually increase over the next two years our baseline forecast is for two 0 25 percentage point cuts to the federal funds rate in july and october 2019 taking the rate to a range of 1 75 to 2 00 percent by the end of 2019 taking the rate to a

pnc s comprehensive capital plan for the applicable period in connection with the federal reserve board s comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar process and to the acceptance of such capital

scope and terms of final capital regulations then in effect and management actions affecting the composition of pnc s balance sheet in addition pnc s ability to determine evaluate and forecast regulatory capital ratios and to take actions such as capital distributions based on actual or forecasted capital ratios will be dependent at least in part on the development validation and regulatory

thursday was a red letter day for that old you don t say riposte we are referring to the obvious response to powell s black and white confession to the senate banking committee yesterday that more people working doesn t cause inflation the relationship between the slack in the economy or unemployment and inflation was a strong one 50 years ago and has gone away powell said thursday during his testimony before the senate banking committee he added the strong tie between unemployment and inflation was broken at least 20 years ago and the relationship has become weaker and weaker and weaker why yes it apparently has disappeared entirely per the graph below since the recessionary jobs bottom in 2010 the unemployment rate brown bars has plunged from just under 10 to a 50 year low of 3 7 at present yet despite the apparent massive evacuation of labor slack from the us economic bathtub real weekly earnings of prime age males purple bars have essentially flat lined during the last eight years so you could put a stake in the so called phillips curve and be done with it but actually the story is far bigger and powell s confession implicates much more than merely the wage employment equation to wit it actually crushes the core tenant of keynesian central banking namely that fed policy operates largely in a closed bathtub of domestic gdp and that by raising or lowering the water level of demand therein the eccles building can bend domestic inflation employment and economic growth to its will self evidently it cannot and the reason for that starts with powell s incorrect claim that the relationship between wages and employment has gone away in fact what is implicated here is the fundamental law of supply and demand which did not mysteriously disappear into some monetary stranger things realm no it simply migrated from the lower 48 to a planet wide venue peak trump the undrai david a stockman best price 12 72 buy new 43 07 as of 11 40 utc details indeed is it not blindingly obvious that hundreds of millions of peasants have been drained from the rice paddies and villages of asia and herded into spanking new factories funded with the cheapest credit central bankers can print so of course the u s domestic supply demand equation has been severed per the chart above that s because the china price for globally traded goods and the india price for globally supplied services drive the geographic allocation of production and determine the marginal wage rate in the global economy stated differently the u 3 unemployment metric is about as useless as a tit on a boar the relevant slack is unutilized workers in the global labor pool and there remains plenty of them stated differently during the last 10 years of economic recovery rising domestic demand for production and labor has leaked out of the domestic gdp bathtub into the global economy and were domestic wages to have risen rapidly per the old phillips curve equation there would have been even more production and wages shifted offshore given that resource allocation happens on the margin in an open global economy in fact there is nothing new about this demand leakage factor especially since alan greenspan s institution of keynesian central banking in the 1990s the leakage factor has been growing because the fed has refused to allow domestic financial markets to clear in the indicated deflationary direction accordingly the cost and wage gap between domestic production and venues driven by the china price and india price has been steadily widening we estimate that in nominal terms the average us wage gap with china was 10 per hour fully loaded in the late 1980s and is upwards of 25 per today this growing us wage cost gap relative to offshore production is what is holding down real us wages yet even relatively flat real wages trends have not been enough to halt the migration of us demand to lower wage cost foreign venues as is more than evident in the chart below the chart simply indexes us imports and final sales to domestic purchasers to the base year of 1994 what it shows is that imports purple line have grown nearly 300 or 5 8 per annum over the past 25 years whereas the total pool of domestic demand as measured by nominal sales to domestic purchasers essentially gdp less exports and inventory swings has risen by 195 and just 4 5 per annum so a materially growing share of the domestic demand pie has gone to foreigners the widening gap in the chart between the two lines measures the demand leakage it s the powerful engine of wage suppression that remains so mysterious to our monetary central planners that is the destroyer of the old time domestic phillips curve of course the chart explains a lot more than weak wages versus purportedly strong employment it actually explains why the very idea of keynesian demand management of the us economy is such a destructive nonstarter that is in theory the eccles building can goose domestic demand by means of interest rate repression which in turn is supposed to cause domestic sectors to borrow more and spend more than would otherwise be the case but in a technologically and efficient transportation enabled global economy that enhanced demand doesn t necessarily bring the water level to the brim in the domestic gdp bathtub thereby causing wages to rise and all available domestic labor to be absorbed instead it s a matter of prices not aggregates that is if domestic wages prices and costs are uncompetitive with foreign venues adjusted for transportation costs inventory carry and the like premiums on imports self evidently some or all of the incremental demand lands on foreign shores where it nudges up jobs output and wages abroad not here in other words the fed is essentially lashing the us economy with a wet noodle even when it manages to coax out some incremental borrowing and spending by domestic households and businesses but even that is now in doubt owing to three decades of money pumping and massive growth of domestic debt and leverage we have called it the financial equivalent of a national lbo the latter has now brought on a condition best described as peak debt which reflects the fact that a large share of domestic household and business balance sheets are tapped out accordingly cutting interest rates has increasingly less potency on main street due to the crushing absolute level of debt as of q1 2019 in fact total public and private debt weighed in at 73 trillion and is up by 21 trillion from the pre crisis peak in q4 2007 as shown below there are now two turns of extra debt on the national income 3 47x versus 1 48x compared to the long standing leverage ratio which prevailed during the century between 1870 and 1970 in quantitative terms those extra turns amount to 40 trillion of extra debt being lugged around by the us economy needless to say it is becoming ever harder for the fed to stimulate more borrowing and spending relative to the nation s 21 trillion of nominal income it s simply a matter of diminishing returns to small reductions in what are already rock bottom rates coupled with the exhaustion of balance sheet capacity us economy still freighted down by national lbo that s especially the case in the household sector where leverage soared between 1987 and the 2008 financial crisis as shown below that household leverage has remained at historically extreme levels relative to wage and salary income notwithstanding some modest deleveraging in the wake of the mortgage default crisis household leverage went from historic 80 of wages and salaries to 180 in short the fed s interest rate tool is getting weaker and weaker domestic demand growth owing to higher leverage is petering out and what incremental domestic demand the fed is able to stimulate is going increasingly into the purchase of foreign goods and the labor and other factors of production embedded therein besides that even the u 3 metric isn t what it used to be in terms of measuring slack in the domestic labor market that because a steadily rising share of available workers and workers hours are not being employed in the domestic economy a factor that the crude headcount based u 3 measure cannot capture that missing labor factor is evident in the chart below since the q4 2000 peak of the 1990s tech boom the census of potential workers in the us economy has grown by 21 yet labor hours actually deployed have risen by only 11 9 so the true labor utilization rate has fallen sharply not withstanding the u 3 metric being reported by the bls which counts all jobs the same as we have detailed elsewhere the adult population 20 69 years of age in the year 2000 was 175 5 million implying annual available works hours at a standard 2000 hour year of 351 billion labor hours in fact according to the bls actual labor hours employed that year amounted to 229 5 billion leaving 121 5 billion hours unutilized that means the comprehensive unemployment rate stood at 34 6 at the turn of the century by contrast presently the available labor pool totals 212 3 million potential workers or 424 6 billion annual hours that compares to 255 6 billion actual hours employed during the latest reading so the current comprehensive unemployment rate is 40 0 but here s the thing in april 2000 the u 3 unemployment rate was 3 8 virtually identical to today s 3 7 rate but self evidently there is a lot more slack in the pool of domestic labor hours available today versus 19 years ago to be sure the reason there are currently 169 billion unemployment adult labor hours under this comprehensive apples to apples measure of labor market slack is that there are more and more part time jobs in the bls employment count and because people choose to work in the stay at home unmonetized household or black market economy or to go on welfare disability student loans or sell used beer cans on e bay from mom and pop s basement ordinarily rising real domestic wages would on the margin cause hours to shift from welfare to work studentdom to gainful employment and mom s basement to the paid labor market yet with an abundant pool of cheap surplus labor abroad causing domestic real wages to stagnate those 169 billion unused labor hours have remained outside the paid work force in any event rather than see that the death of the domestic phillips curve means the death of keynesian central banking as well powell offered the prospect that sooner or later this massive abundance of unutilized domestic labor would be absorbed and that the holy grail of monetary central planning would once again come into view that is more inflation the great deformation david a stockman best price 2 00 buy new 9 95 as of 09 55 utc details at the end of the day there has to be a connection because low employment will drive wages up and ultimately higher wages will drive inflation but we haven t reached that point in many cases that connection between the two is quite small these days the fed chief said no it won t for all practically purposes there is no limit to the cheap labor pool on the planet meaning that the wage inflation that our monetary politburo keeps promising will not happen any time soon apparently however robust wage inflation is the monetary godot that the fed heads are waiting for that means they believe they can keep stimulating demand and falsifying the interest rates indefinitely thereby fueling an ever more egregious bubble on wall street and an even more disastrous day of reckoning when it finally bursts what that means of course is that the fed is essentially backing itself into an unstated version of modern monetary policy mmt in fact the clueless pivoting powell more or less conceded that in this interchange with one of its leading advocates the very alexandria ocasio cortez in recent congressional hearings with fed chair gerome powell alexandria ocasio cortez noted that over the past five years the central bank had repeatedly suggested that unemployment could not fall much lower without triggering high inflation only to see unemployment fall much lower without triggering high inflation ocasio cortez in early 2014 the federal reserve believed that the long run unemployment rate was around 5 4 percent in early 2018 it as estimated that this was now lower around 4 5 percent now the estimate is around 4 2 percent what is the current unemployment rate today powell 3 7 percent ocasio 3 7 percent unemployment has fallen about three full points since 2014 but inflation is no higher today than it was five years ago given these facts do you think it s possible that the fed s estimates of the lowest sustainable unemployment rate may have been too high powell absolutely imagine that the route to socialism in america may end up being channeled through the big meeting room in the eccles building in the interim however the actual condition of the global economy is becoming steadily weaker a condition that the fed s impending rate cutting campaign will do nothing to reverse accordingly when the financial bubble finally bursts it will likely happen in the midst of a global recession where the fed and its convoy of central banks are finally and truly out of dry powder as bloomberg noted the overnight news was distinctively negative the first warning shot to the global economy came from singapore where gross domestic product in the trade reliant city state declined an annualized 3 4 in the second quarter a plunge from 3 8 in q1 and far below the 0 5 consensus estimate this was the biggest drop since 2012 singapore s manufacturing index contracted an annualized 6 in the second quarter from the previous three months construction declined 7 6 reversing a 13 3 expansion in the first quarter the services industry shrank 1 5 in the second quarter singapore is the canary in the coal mine being very open and sensitive to trade said chua hak bin an economist at maybank kim eng research pte in singapore the data points to the risk of a deepening slowdown for the rest of asia separately in the second blow to global trade and the latest confirmation that china will be forced to engage in even more aggressive stimulus beijing s latest trade figures showed exports fell 1 3 in june from a year ago and imports shrank a more than expected 7 3 the main culprit for the latest disappointing data exports to the us contracted significantly by 7 8 yoy in june down further from 4 1 yoy in may exports to the eu also decelerated to a decline of 3 yoy in june from 6 1 yoy in may and exports to japan increased modestly by 2 4 yoy v s 0 5 yoy in may in contrast exports to asean accelerated significantly to 12 9 yoy in june from 3 5 yoy in may needless to say in his testimony this week powell spent considerable time gumming about these crosscurrents and risks to the outlook might well he did even if his wet noodle tools can do exactly nothing about them since our may meeting however these crosscurrents have reemerged creating greater uncertainty apparent progress on trade turned to greater uncertainty and our contacts in business and agriculture report heightened concerns over trade developments growth indicators from around the world have disappointed on net raising concerns that weakness in the global economy will continue to affect the us economy these concerns may have contributed to the drop in business confidence in some recent surveys and may have started to show through to incoming data meanwhile the budget deficit is soaring up by 23 to 747 1 billion in the first nine months of the fiscal year which in turn has caused the us treasury secretary to warn that uncle sam may run out of cash by labor day then again the fed is cutting rates because its bogus keynesian models have given it still another excuse to pleasure wall street all that and they are once again buying the dip hand over fist but at least we now know that the phillips curve is dead and if we are fortunate the death of keynesian central banking can t be too far behind reprinted with permission from david stockman s contra corner the

txt earnings call for the period ending june 29 2019 textron inc txt 1 20 q2 2019 earnings call 8 00 a m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks operator ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by and welcome to the textron second quarter earnings call and at this time all participants are in a listen only mode later we will conduct a question and answer session and as a reminder today s conference is being recorded i will now turn the call over to vice president investor relations eric salander please go ahead sir eric salander vice president of investor relations thanks kevin and good morning everyone before we begin i d like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today these forward looking statements are subject to various risk factors which are detailed in our sec filings and also in today s press release on the call today we have scott donnelly textron s chairman and ceo and frank connor our chief financial officer our earnings call presentation can be found in the investor relations section of our website textron s revenues in the quarter were 3 2 billion down 500 million from last year s second quarter while net income was 0 93 per share up from 0 87 per share last year manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions totaled 102 million compared to 399 million in last year s second quarter with that i will turn the call over to scott scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer thanks eric and good morning everybody q2 was a solid quarter for textron as we continue our focus on operational improvements across the company segment profit margin was up 120 basis points as we continue to see strong execution across our businesses driven by higher margins at aviation and industrial bell revenues were down in the quarter largely due to lower military volume as we transition to lower production quantities on our military programs on the commercial side we delivered 53 helicopters down from 57 last year despite the lower commercial deliveries in the quarter we expect to see a ramp in deliveries in the second half of the year supported by continued strong order activity and an increased production rates in the quarter japan s national police agency placed the first order for the bell for 412epx the newest upgrade of the 412 series this aircraft has been co developed between bell and subaru corporation for the new utility helicopter program under japan s ministry of defense and we expect this program to support the 412 program well into the future within future vertical lift we continue with the flight testing and demonstration activities of our valor v 280 we have now demonstrated army level one handling qualities successfully proving the aircrafts maneuverability this represents the highest performance standards for agility which is critical to the army mission we re also encouraged by the army s recent actions regarding the potential acceleration of the future long range assault aircraft program these actions include an industry days schedule at the end of this month that should allow potential contractors to gain more insight into the army s acquisition approach proposed alternative procurement path through other transaction authority mechanism to be awarded in february and identification of an engineering manufacturing development program or a middle tier acquisition award date estimated to be occurred 19 months following the ota award also within fvl bell was among five defense contractors down selected by the us army to progress through the next phase of the future attack reconnaissance aircraft program we re pleased the army recognized our competitive offering which will utilize advanced rotor technology and fly by wire flight control capabilities validated in our bell 525 program to create an innovative aircraft that is well suited for the far mission our systems revenues were down largely due to lower volume at tru simulation training and unmanned systems during the second quarter our tru training business formed a new company with flightsafety international called flightsafety textron aviation training newly formed company which is 30 owned by textron provides training services through textron aviation s broad product line of general aviation aircraft we expect the combination of the strengths and resources of these businesses will further enhance the training and services available to our customers while increasing efficiency and ensuring the extension of our high quality training programs new textron aviation aircraft also in the quarter textron airborne solutions announces it s atac subsidiary received a one year 56 million contract modification to provide high subsonic and supersonic aircraft services to the us navy extending our current contract through 2020 within unmanned systems our fee for service product line captured over 90 million of new wins in the quarter for the aerosonde program moving to industrial revenues were lower primarily reflecting the impact of the disposition of the tools and test product line in last year s third quarter in specialized vehicles we saw continued favorable performance resulting from the cost reduction and manufacturing realignment actions that we initiated in the fourth quarter of last year also in the quarter we continue our on boarding bass pro and cabela stores as well as independent tracker marine dealers and we re seeing momentum build in this new retail channel our ground support business received multiyear contraction from both american and united airlines for our equipment across our tug safeaero and douglas brands to service their operations worldwide moving to textron aviation revenue was down largely due to lower volume on our commercial turboprop and defense product lines in the quarter we delivered 46 jets down from 48 last year and 34 commercial turboprops down from 47 last year s second quarter beginning in late may we experienced lower order activity across our product lines largely attributable to the uncertainties around tariffs and concerns about economic growth which cause disruptions in both our domestic and foreign markets since then we believe these uncertainties have largely diminished as we ve seen the mexico tariff issue resolved stronger economic indicators and a bias toward further interest rate cuts which have improved customer outlook as we are going into the third quarter remains positive and we expect deliveries and order to ramp throughout the second half of the year driving revenue growth at aviation moving to longitude we continue to make good progress on the certification efforts while this has been a much larger test than originally anticipated the documentation flow and review with faa continues and we expect type certification deliveries of the aircraft in the third quarter continuing with hemisphere we determine that the engine has not yet demonstrated the performance required for the aircraft design and we have put the program on hold any decision to revisit the program in the future would depend on the state of the market proven engine performance and a competitive landscape at that time our engineering focus remains on the certification of longitude in addition to the skycourier and denali programs where we expect to complete first flights later this year in summary we continue to feel good about execution across our businesses and we re well positioned for second half revenue growth from increased deliveries at aviation driven by the longitude entry into service as well as higher commercial deliveries at bell we expect these developments to drive strong earnings and cash generation throughout the balance of the year with that i will turn the call over to frank frank connor chief financial officer thank you scott good morning everyone segment profit in the quarter was 339 million down 7 million from the second quarter of 2018 with segment profit margin of 10 5 up 120 basis points from a year ago let s review how each of the segments contributed starting with textron aviation revenues at textron aviation of 1 1 billion were down 153 million from last year s second quarter primarily due to lower commercial turboprop and defense volume and mix textron aviation delivered 46 jets down from 48 last year and 34 commercial turboprops down from 47 last year segment profit was 105 million in the second quarter up 1 million from a year ago as favorable performance was offset by the lower volume and mix textron aviation backlog at the end of the second quarter was 1 9 billion revenues at bell of 771 million were down 7 from last year primarily on lower military volume bell delivered 53 commercial helicopters in the quarter down from 57 last year segment profit of 103 million was down 14 million primarily due to lower military volume bell backlog at the end of the second quarter was 6 billion revenues at textron systems were 308 million down from 380 million last year primarily reflecting lower volume at tru simulation and training and unmanned systems segment profit was up 9 million from last year s second quarter primarily due an 11 million impact from performance reflecting an 18 million gain related to the formation of our new training business with flightsafety international moving forward we will continue to record our portion of the operating profit from the new training business textron systems backlog at the end of the second quarter was 1 4 billion industrial revenues of 1 billion decreased 213 million largely related to the impact from the disposition of our tools and test product line and lower volume segment profit was down 4 million from the second quarter of 2018 largely due to the impact from the product line disposition and lower volume partially offset by favorable performance primarily related to the specialized vehicles product line finance segment revenues were down 1 million and profit was up 1 million from last year s second quarter moving below segment profit corporate expenses were 24 million and interest expense was 36 million we also repurchased 3 1 million shares at an overall cost of 159 million through the first six months of the year we ve repurchased 7 million shares returning 361 million in cash to shareholders to wrap up with guidance we are raising our expected full year earnings per share from continuing operations to a range of 3 65 to 3 85 per share up 0 10 from our prior outlook we are reiterating our outlook for cash flow from continuing operations of the manufacturing group before pension contributions of 700 million to 800 million that concludes our prepared remarks so kevin we can open the line for questions questions and answers operator thank you first question is from the line of david strauss please go ahead barclays david strauss barclays analyst thanks thanks good morning i guess first clarification can you just tell us how much the gain was on the systems side for the training jv frank connor chief financial officer it was 18 million dave david strauss barclays analyst okay thanks and then scott could you you maybe talk about the potential for your 737 max stimulator business how many you ve built there what s your ability to ramp that up given the potential training needs on the back of what s going on with max scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer so dave i can t give you a whole lot of detail on it i mean obviously we ve been delivering max since boeing and several 737 max customers i think a lot of that will depend on how all those plays out in terms of the recommendations or requirements that faa and they also put on airlines around the need for sim training it looks at this point to us like it s probably going to be a requirement that allows them to get back and flying in the transition course and then would mandate actual maxsim training later on so we ve certainly had quite a number of inquiries from customers who are interested in going ahead and getting maxsims on order we started to do some long lead ordering already for to support those deliveries next year but i couldn t give you a firmed up number yet i think we re still working on that and working with boeing to understand their strategy on a go forward basis as well but we really have to kind of wait and i think see where the faa also end up in terms of what their training mandates are david strauss barclays analyst okay thanks i ll get back in the queue operator and our next question is from the line of carter copeland melius research please go ahead carter copeland melius research analyst hi good morning guys scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer good morning carter copeland melius research analyst scott i wondered if you could just kind of expand a little bit on the rationale of the the company you set up with flightsafety and just what that should tell us about the what applications are for your what you ve been trying to create organically there how much does this change the growth expectation that you have for those efforts and are you trying to expand that much more rapidly and trading some of the profit as a result to try to get more scale there just kind of give us some detail on the rationale and then what you re trying to accomplish with that scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer sure carter so as you know we decided to get into that training business several years ago we felt that was a very important part of sort of the service aftermarket element of our business and we weren t really participating in that we had a lot of feedback from customers that they would be interested in us participate in that space and so as you know we made a couple of fairly small acquisitions obviously over the last few years we ve invested a fair bit in both irad and r d as well as capex to start to build out that training capability the business is going very well great customer feedback i think the training materials and the techniques that we were deploying were working the challenge was that the time frame of how long that would take to build out the number of training centers and number of locations it was a fairly daunting task and was going to take quite some period of time to do that we happen to engage in discussions with flightsafety whom we had relationship for many years obviously in the training side and so look we ought to link together let s take the technology and a lot of the tools and the capability that we developed organically and put these businesses together in a joint venture and basically what that s allowing us to do is take what we think were the advantages of that business and the positive feedback we are getting from customers and expand it much more rapidly so this now has the ability to much more quickly accelerate the returns for us and i think for the customers it sort of taking the best of whole worlds the combination of what we would invest in organically and the significant footprint that flightsafety has around the world so that we could touch more customers in a time frame it was much shorter than doing this just going training center by training center in terms of us putting more and more capital out there and flightsafety already have the capital out there so as we said the gain is a function of having invested in that business and having put those assets in the joint venture you got to look at sort of reevaluating those assets and obviously we created a very valuable business and so that s a good thing i think more importantly what we will see going forward is the earnings as a result of our share of that joint venture which is going to grow much faster than we had we stayed just on a pure organic path so and you ll see those earnings come through systems as we go forward carter copeland melius research analyst just in general terms do you expect the growth to be 50 more or 2x or what just any color around how you can help what your expectation is or how much you ve accelerated that as a result scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer well i don t we don t break out the numbers and that level of detail carter but i d say it s significantly faster in terms of the rate of return what we would have had if we had played this out on a purely organic basis let s say the difference to having build up that capital infrastructure versus leveraging what flightsafety already had on the ground that becomes more of a technology play than a capex play carter copeland melius research analyst okay great i ll get in the queue back as well thanks scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer sure operator our next question is from the line of sheila kah jefferies please go ahead sheila kahyaoglu jefferies analyst hi good morning thank you scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer good morning sheila kahyaoglu jefferies analyst scott just a big picture question organically your sales were down 10 in the quarter you ve been focused on new products to gain share by fleet so in relatively tough end markets how do you kind of think about the levers from here just given your decision on the hemisphere as well scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer sure sheila i think the for us in the quarter really in the first half of the year the big impacts that will change how the second half plays out here is one around bell commercial and we talked last year when you were seeing strong demand on the commercial side we indicated that we need to turn up our production rates to meet that demand that takes a little bit longer for the from the time you make that decision till the time you have aircraft that are coming off the line so when we increase the production rates on 407 and the 429s we didn t have those aircraft available coming off the line until right about now so i think we ll see a significant impact in increases on the third and the fourth quarter the demand is there the orders are there it s been a matter of getting the production up and delivering at a higher rate and that s where we are now so you ll see the benefits of that here in the third and fourth quarter they are already supported by orders that we have we just needed to meet the demand in terms of the production side on the aviation side obviously longitude getting into service that was a huge part of our growth story on aviation for the year and we expect that clearly will be the second half impact here we continue frankly to see good demand on the historical aircraft latitudes continue to sell very strongly we again demand a longitude side is very good i think across the whole portfolio clearly we had a very strong first quarter for second quarter we felt pretty good things did get a little bit shaken up there right toward the end and but they re mostly customers who would say look i want to wait for the markets to settle out and i m going to defer this in the second half so i think our view at the business jet market is still very healthy and so i think between that and the longitude coming into service we will see strong growth in the second half sheila kahyaoglu jefferies analyst thank you and then frank one for you on working capital it s been a steep usage in the first half i think primarily due to inventory how do you think about that reversing and any potential risks in it frank connor chief financial officer yeah sheila as scott said with that growth in the second half we expect to kind of obviously sell off and liquidate that inventory that the bulk of that build is at aviation it s kind of certainly impacted by the longitude moving into the second half of the year but it s also kind of bell commercial and other volume that scott indicated we are looking to have come through in the second half of the year and feel good about where we re positioned to do that sheila kahyaoglu jefferies analyst thank you operator next question is from the line of peter arment baird please go ahead peter arment robert w baird co analyst thanks good morning scott and frank scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer good morning peter arment robert w baird co analyst scott could you just give us a little more color on how things are going in terms of within the industrial segment particularly i guess specialized vehicles format seem to be a little better than i think a lot of us were expecting what s how is the bass pro kind of rollout going just maybe some color there scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer sure no there s a couple of things there peter first of all obviously from an operational performance standpoint the business is doing much better historical businesses where we ve had a very strong position and good performance for a long time in golf and ground support equipment and areas like that our sales performance is back where it should be guys are doing very well the markets are healthy and again the teams operational execution is quite strong in the off road world we re down that s quite conscious right we re working very very hard to make sure that we do a much better job in terms of how we manage those retail channels snow is a good example the position that we took this year as we said guys we re only going to pre sell when you look at the north american market which is obviously the vast majority of the market in the snow world we went out with our program and so guys were only going to build what we ve already sold so we went around and have deposits from customers this product line is basically sold out and so we ll be here through the whole third quarter manufacturing all those units and shipping them out but unlike in previous years where we ll be putting a lot of inventory out into the field and dependent on how that sold through and then getting into rebating if it s not selling through we said we re just not going to do that so we re going to do only a presale and that was frankly a very successful program we saw very strong demand across the product line but were pre sold so on the dirt side obviously that s a longer and sort of a little bit of a different selling season as you go through there but again we re being very very cautious about how we manage that channel how much inventory we allowed to be out into that channel we did awful lot of hard work on looking at individual dealers and making sure that we have relationships where that relationship is a profitable relationship for both us and the dealer and as a result we ve dramatically reduced the number of deals that we had out there because when we went back and looked at some of them by the time you get through the rebating it s not a profitable relationship and so we ve taken the pains of terminating relationships with the vast majority of those folks specifically on the tracker front obviously the bass pro cabela and their independent marine dealers is terrific channel extraordinarily well run very i would say delivered around what it does in terms of inventory so in terms of how they manage is quite consistent with how we want to manage the business going forward so we ve been seeing a lot of activity and load ins across both stores and independent dealers here over the last six months that obviously will continue through the balance of the year we like the trajectory the momentum is building so i think when you look year over year peter we re much happier with where that business is both in terms of its how it operates everyday how it thinks about managing some of those channels some of the issues we had last year would be late with some of the new products obviously that s those products did get the market and i think we have a great product lineup we just have to be a very measured about how we manage the channels and how much inventory we allow to be out there to reduce risk and make sure that we have a good profitable business peter arment robert w baird co analyst appreciate that and just a quick one on scott did you see any change in business jet pricing just given the softness in end market a little bit that you saw in may or price is still holding scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer no peter we re still seeing pricing holding you know there s always a crazy deal or two and we choose not to participate in those right so i think we make a great product it s fairly priced got a great service network behind it and there is no reason for us to chase a crazy price deal here and there so we re maintaining that discipline and as we ve said all along we will trade volume rather than damaging the price in the industry so i think that s i think the pricing is in a place where it should be right and we re going to hold the line and like you ll see here in the quarter we had price net of inflation up a little bit which is healthy for the business and that s what we need to continue to do peter arment robert w baird co analyst thanks for the color scott operator thank you next question is from the line of george shapiro of shapiro research please go ahead george shapiro shapiro research analyst yes good morning scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer good morning george shapiro shapiro research analyst scott the implied orders in the quarter were pretty weak and obviously the book to bill was less than one given that you see things picking back up in third quarter here is it natural to expect the book to bill over one in the third quarter recovering from the second quarter scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer well george i would hope that that s the case i mean clearly we had a very strong first quarter on the book to bill front we re still have our backlog numbers net through the first half above where it was coming into the year so i think we re not overly concerned by this as i said things did slow down in june given some of the gyrations in the market and talks around tariffs and things like that but i think most of the discussions that we ve had with customers particularly in the us were some things would pushed into the second half and those dialogs continue with customers so i think we re still in a pretty good in a pretty good place with that respect we were light on the turboprops particularly in the international market and as you know george that s a little bit lumpy we ve seen this before where it kind of goes in fits and starts so that s a little bit harder market to predict it generally affects more the turboprops than it does the jet side of the business but we ll see how it plays out but certainly my expectations would be that we would continue to see good order flow through the balance of the year george shapiro shapiro research analyst and frank one for you just aviation aftermarket how does that compare to last year frank connor chief financial officer yeah it was fine it was down just a touch but continues to kind of be solid for us george shapiro shapiro research analyst and the reason it s down a touch as opposed to up a little bit any color on that frank connor chief financial officer no i mean no nothing significant kind of we ve seen some variation in volume in the shops from time to time where we are looking at solid or a strong second half performance there and kind of continue to be feel good about how we re executing it george shapiro shapiro research analyst okay thanks very much operator and next we have robert stallard vertical research please go ahead robert stallard vertical research analyst thanks so much good morning scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer good morning rob robert stallard vertical research analyst scott on the bizjet side of things a couple of your competitors have launched some new products so far this year and i was wondering if you could comment on whether this could impact your market share going forward scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer really nobody in our warehouse i mean if you look at the i mean number earlier in the year obviously i think that s largely those product lines from that particular competitor have been up against the latitude and obviously on longitude i think our products are outstanding performers and we continue to see strong demand on the latitude front and look i think longitude is in a very good position i wouldn t expect to see a lot more activity to get through the certification i mean there is plenty of customers that are in the process and many of whom i think are just waiting for cert to be done so i think from a performance standpoint we continue to get fabulous feedback from everybody that demo flies that aircraft so i think it s a competitive marketplace i think it s always been one and it will continue to be a competitive marketplace but i think we re we stack up quite well with that so every transaction has got competitive nature to it but i think we re winning our fair share and feel pretty good about where we stand robert stallard vertical research analyst okay and then maybe one for frank you only changed your guidance as being up eps by 0 10 i was wondering if you could comment on whether you see at the halfway point of the year any changes to the divisional split for the full year frank connor chief financial officer no it s largely intact i d say that obviously we ve seen good performance out of bell so far this year so kind of reflected in that 0 10 is kind of continuing solid performance on the bell that probably kind of give some a little bit of upside to our original margin guidance there and then systems has done a nice job as well in kind of executing through the first half so kind of those are the two places where we re seeing some better performance that are contributing to the 0 10 robert stallard vertical research analyst that s great thank you very much operator next question is from the line of cai von rumohr cowen company please go ahead cai von rumohr cowen company analyst yes thanks so much so yes you mentioned bell doing particularly well how much of the strong profit in the second quarter reflected favorable eacs on z22 multiyear two and kind of as we go into next year are we still looking at 10 to 12 or can it be better scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer well cai i d say that we always i mean every quarter we have our eac process and there is always some performance in there it s certainly less than it was last year so from a comparable place and then we kind of talked about this right i mean we ve kind of been winding down the multiyear two revenues and ramping up the multiyear three revenues and that is certainly at a lower margin and again a lot of the performance and sort of reserves that you keep around multiyear two have largely played through so on a year over year basis the eacs or the gain associated that are down but there is still there and i would expect that ll always be there i mean we always try to continue to drive productivity and performance improvement and we recognize that we each time we go through an eac there is always some puts and takes but i think the team executes quite well so but anyway i would say along the lines of how they re performing there continue to be strong performance so even though the eac numbers might be lower gains in the quarter we re reflecting it solid operating profit across whole business and i think we ll continue to see that next year i would say look we ve had sort of that 10 to 12 guide out there for some time on bell they certainly have been overdriving that here as we worked our way through multiyear two i wouldn t change my perspective that s a business that s well run and we will continue to sit in that 10 to 12 range there s a fair bit of r d as you know going on 525 has been a big part of that v 280 has been a very large part of that what we will be transitioning into these cape set 1 and cape set 3 ota programs and those cost share associated with those right our r d spending needs to stay at a pretty high level to support what we think are some really significant opportunities for the future of bell so it s i think that 10 to 12 range is still how you all think about it cai von rumohr cowen company analyst thank you very much and then frank so you re maybe give us some numbers on where the net price increase at aviation was it narrowed a bit in the first quarter so where was it in the second and also given that you have yet to certify the longitude is your full year delivery target fully intact or does it should we be looking at a slightly smaller number this year frank connor chief financial officer yeah so on the price side cai our gross price was 13 million for the quarter and net price was 3 million so a continued good performance on that front and no i mean we continue to be positioned to deliver on longitude once we achieved certification and kind of we feel that we re in the right place to meet the commitments that we have for that and we obviously haven t adjusted the aviation number kind of in anyway cai von rumohr cowen company analyst thank you operator our next question is from the line of seth seifman jpmorgan please go ahead seth seifman jpmorgan analyst thanks very much and good morning just a follow up there on aviation i guess the projection you ve given for the segment is for about 550 million of earnings for the year it implies a pretty big second half and i think given the longitude deliveries that kind of we can understand why the second half would be bigger and second half is seasonally usually bigger anyway but even bigger this time and so can you walk us through i mean do you expect a significant increase in the earnings for aviation in the third quarter or does it kind of all come in the fourth quarter with the longitude and to the extent that there was any temporary softness in demand around some of those macro issues that you mentioned during the quarter i mean have you already seen that start to come back in terms of orders or indications of interest in the first couple of weeks of the third quarter here scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer well seth i would say that our progression as you know i mean this is usually a business that has a back end load a lot of that is driven by tax folks wanted to get their aircraft deliveries done by the end of the year i don t see any change in that i think the progression that we normally see we would expect to see arguably it s going to be a little more accentuated than that just because we have the longitude coming in to service so yes there will be more of a pickup in the back half associated with that in terms of just the normal order flow again i think things appear to be normal we actually did see customers that had said all are going to wait and see what happens after everything kind of got a little shaken up in the late may into june timeframe and to take delivery in the second quarter but more of them were look i just want to sort of put this aside and think about this as a second half activity so again from it s hard to our sales teams those dialogs are ongoing and so i would expect that we will see most of that come back and turn into third fourth quarter deals inaudible aircraft that are deliveries that would be out in the next year seth seifman jpmorgan analyst right and then on the longitude given i think it s probably just a handful of the initial units that are either marginally profitable or not profitable and so on that basis is it possible for longitude to contribute to earnings in q3 or is the q3 earnings that we re going to see basically all from non longitude platform scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer well as you know typically the initial deliveries are going to be at a lower margin there will be some contribution but certainly from a margin rate there is no question in the third quarter they would be dilutive so now that being said i think the performance you ve seen very strong performance of the business here in the first half so our relative profitability on light revenue is stronger than it has been so it s offsetting against what is very strong performance so it s still going to be respectable margins but it will be if you just looked at longitude on a stand alone basis it will certainly be dilutive seth seifman jpmorgan analyst excellent okay thanks very much operator our next question is from the line of pete skibitski of alembic global please go ahead peter skibitski alembic global analyst good morning guys scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer good morning pete peter skibitski alembic global analyst hey scott can you update us on ship to shore in terms of that initial lrp contract that i think you re expecting in when that is the one that comes through here in the second half is systems going to kind of return to growth on that basis or maybe the uav headwinds still too tough right now can you just update us there scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer so pete i definitely think that well first of all ship to shore is moving along well the first craft is in builders trials that was a huge milestone so we re about halfway through that process we re expecting delivery of the first aircraft here this quarter the rest of the initial developmental units are moving along well behind that we do continue to get long lead funding for that next production lot of aircraft is actually three fiscal years that are in there we are in negotiation of that process i would expect here in the third quarter or four quarter the latest obviously we would get that under contract so but the amount of revenue that we ll see this year is largely associated with those long lead materials we do have some of the initial assembly or initial welding activity going on the first craft but really you will see the impact of that as it starts to ramp up and generate revenue where it will be a 2020 story so clearly from our perspective systems here is sort of bottoming in 2019 and you ll see the growth in 2020 in large part driven by that transition of ship to shore from development program to the production program peter arment robert w baird co analyst can i just ask one follow up scott i haven t asked you in a while about this marine corps mux program they re doing a lot of interesting things i think with the acquisition strategy are you guys kind of comfortable on that program right now it s an opportunity for you or some of the things that they re doing are they kind of making it tougher to bid on just your thoughts scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer well i think look i think the marine corps is doing a lot of work right now and then you ve see these small levels of activity in prices where they are just for best soliciting ideas which i think is a very healthy thing to do obviously we have done a lot of work on the concept of the mux and how we would approach that program the marine corps obviously is well aware of everything that we ve that we ve done there we have participated in some of these other smaller projects where they re sort of going to industry and say hey give us your ideas around different mission systems and different concepts of operations so i think they are sort of in a fact finding mode obviously we have put a lot of information in front of them over the last couple of years and at this point i think most of the work that we feel like we need to do in advance of those thing we ve largely done that and i think here in the next couple of years you will see that thing transition from sort of the solicitation of ideas to help them formulate their final specifications if you will around that program and then it will turn into hopefully into a funded development program obviously we would participate in that i think we have a great solution to what they re looking for but it will ramp over the next couple of years i think peter skibitski alembic global analyst thank you operator and next we have the line of rajeev lalwani of morgan stanley please go ahead rajeev lalwani morgan stanley analyst good morning scott good morning frank scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer good morning rajeev lalwani morgan stanley analyst first just a question on hemisphere can you talk more about the decision to put that on hold how much of it was engine versus simply what you re seeing in the overall market and the signals you re getting there scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer it was purely the engine as we ve talked about for the last year or so we think that the niche the area that we intended to fit with that aircraft and obviously had that shared feeling with netjets as our launch customer was an area that would be a great product and a great price point performance point to go into the marketplace but the challenge was there was really only one engine in development that was suitable to meet that performance point and as i said in the prepared comments that engine hasn t yet demonstrated the performance required for the aircraft so if at some point in the future that engine or whatever is demonstrated that can meet it we would certainly revisit it it s just i think just too much time has gone by here and we can t sort of hold this thing in a i mean we can t expect our customers to kind of wait an uncertainty any longer so there is still potential for it out there we have to evaluate and understand what s competitive dynamic what s going on in the marketplace what s going on with customers to determine at that later time whether that product would make sense or not we d be certainly happy to evaluate and look at that but in the meantime clearly we need to take our engineering resource and focus on those things that are going to drive our growth in the mid to near term here which is not just getting longitude done but getting skycourier and denali into the q and as you know we re always kind of looking at other concepts and opportunities within our portfolio that need refreshes updates and things like that which is what we normally do so we re simply just going to take all that engineering resource that would have gone into the hemisphere program and deploy that into our current portfolio of programs seth seifman jpmorgan analyst on the bell side obviously are pretty well positioned on the long range and have the reconnaissance program how important are those for the future of bell i mean assuming that you re not successful there should we start thinking about an overall restructuring of the military side of the business there do you feel like there is enough other things going on to sort of sustain what you re seeing today or add to it scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer well i think if you look at the military side of bell we have good visibility on h1 production out in the 20 22 timeframe there s a number of fms opportunities that are out there that we re pursuing as you know those always take time to get those to closure v 22 were already running at that lower rate associated with multiyear three again there is some fms opportunity or other things that they could increase that over time and i think there are certainly some possibilities there and of course this has become a very large installed base so there is a ton of service business associated with this there s upgrades and enhancement programs which are typical of any large defense platform which we expect we will continue to see in the future so i think bell on the military side just around v 22 and h1 can sustain and be a nice healthy business but clearly from a growth standpoint the opportunities are out there around far around far those v 280 of course the mux program which we just talked about and some other opportunities around tiltrotor is what s going to drive the growth in the future i think we re very well positioned on several of those programs will we win them all probably not but these are these are very large programs and so winning one or two of those is what would drive significant growth for bell on top of the ongoing sustaining of the v 22 and h1 programs seth seifman jpmorgan analyst very helpful thank you scott operator and next question is from the line of jon raviv of citi please go ahead jon raviv citi investment research analyst hey thanks good morning can you just level set us a bit more on systems margin going forward post the flightsafety deal but then also with the ship to shore connect ramping up i understand that sales bottoms in for 19 but how about the margin rates and i guess overall how you think about earnings dollars growth going forward here with those two big moving pieces scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer yeah we ve showed you i think the systems business should be targeting around 10 margin we have returned that last year we re on track to be in that neighborhood this year obviously there has been a bit of a drag on associated with the fixed price development on ship to shore but again that transitions into a production program this is a business that we should expect to see a 10 margin business jon raviv citi investment research analyst okay thanks and then just going back to aviation and it got it seems like something really kind of scared customers in may june even though the market has been through some other gyrations especially for 2018 but it s kind of through that period you typically sounded quite positive so what do you think was different about the nature of this may june move and then look i mean that s a beat a dead horse but really what gives you confidence that this is going to come back i mean the fed s cutting rates because the economy is slowing that s probably not a good thing for customers scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer well look i think people when you look at the combination of you again we had some market gyrations but to your point this happens periodically right i mean but you have this concern over mexico tariffs i mean that i think we had a couple of customers that just flat out they do a lot of business in mexico and this is was a big problem for them so that created some of that uncertainty look a lot of people were talking down to hey the economy is really going to slow down dramatically and i think the numbers that actually came out would indicate that s not the case all right i mean unemployment numbers are still quite good the gdp numbers were actually better than most economists were forecasting so is the market on fire no but is it healthy and steady i think that s more of a case of where we are so customers that are interested in upgrading and buy new aircraft they didn t go say hey i m done they were let me see what happens when things settle down a little bit so and at the timing of it when we get one of these perturbations in the first month of the quarter that gives you time for customers to kind of understand where they are and get comfortable and move forward when they happened in the last month of the quarter it s a little more challenging because they come back to the table but it s now past the end of the quarter so i think but if that had not happened we probably would have over driven a few jets just given the number of things that were in the pipeline but i think at least our view right now is those were larger activities that deferred into the third quarter jon raviv citi investment research analyst got you thanks for the perspective there operator next question is from the line of robert spingarn credit suisse please go ahead robert spingarn credit suisse analyst good morning just a couple of things on the industrial business you re guiding i think pro forma for the divestiture about flat this year and that seem to track in the first half but i m wondering about some of the moving pieces in there for example how does the channel fill work with the tracker product against streamlining your other distributors and how do you think about automotive in the second half given some of the macro weakness that we re expecting so that on kautex can you essentially can h2 be flat with h1 is what i m asking scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer so i think if you look at let me talk to the automotive side first clearly volumes around most of the world are down but frankly the comparisons on q3 q4 are going to be easier than q1 and q2 because you really saw that slowdown hit in the latter part of last year so i think our business is performing well i mean we re happy with performance and operations and margins and how the guys are doing but there is no doubt it is on a lower volume basis but more or less consistent with where we thought it would be and as i said the q3 q4 comps are certainly easier than what we saw in q1 and q2 just given the global automotive slowdown so i think we re comfortable with where we are again the team is executing quite well and delivering based on where that end market is so we continue to be feel good about new programs and new nominations which obviously are growth and opportunities in the future as well on the off road side we have i ll tell you the tracker the way that the the inventory and stocking model works in bass pro and cabela and their dealers is a very disciplined process it s a very healthy process and we feel very good about how that s going and the way the team there manages that it s a great partnership we re pleased with how it s going and very comfortable with just how they do business and how they manage that business i talk a little bit about the other piece of the channel around snow we re just guys we have some very very good deals out there particularly a lot of our dealers who have a long history with that brand in the snow side as i said we re being extraordinarily disciplined with how we do that and how we manage that and we ll do that on the dirt side as well because it is largely those same dealers of guys that are historical snowmobile dealers that are carrying that arctic cat brand of dirt and by the way they are very complementary channels right the strength of that channel under that arctic cat brand tends to be in the northern parts of the us and canada where the snowmobile country exists and in most of the rest of the country happens to be where the bass pro cabela s and their independent marine dealers are very strong so it gives us in total i think a very strong distribution network robert spingarn credit suisse analyst do you find that whether is a bigger factor for dirt as it is for snow and then one last thing i wanted to ask you is similar and how in commercial helicopter similar to my first question about h2 how do you get optimistic or as optimistic for a bounce back when the rig counts have been fairly soft especially in the second quarter scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer well so on the helicopter front keep in mind that our share in those deepwater rigs we really don t address that market today that s part of what the 525 is about for the future but where our market is and where we ve frankly seen strength and very strong workflow here in the last almost going on a couple of years now is really around the near in stop in oil and gas and frankly a lot of emergency medical services executive vip customs and border patrol i mean it s a much broader market police really what really drives the 407 and 429 markets is not the oil and gas market so there is a real contrast right now between the big machines that are large oriented serving that offshore oil and gas market it s just not a market we ve had a very big position or the market that s quite strong is again around more of that the light twins the single so it s volume around 505 407 429 and 412 which is not that deep water offshore oil and gas market robert spingarn credit suisse analyst okay and then just a whether question on dirt versus snow scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer well i d say it s a lot less dependent snow is very dependent on the snow season again this is part of why we want to sort of insulate ourselves from that by saying guys we re in a pre sell so those snowmobiles are going to be built and that will be shipped and they re paid for and that will all happen before there s we even get into the snow season so by design we were trying to insulate ourselves from that one way or the other of course we look very hard at what s out there in the inventory the inventory levels of our products frankly ended up at a very low level last year well below where we originally targeted and that was because it did seem a relatively in most parts a good snow strong snow season and so our dealers did retail through a lot of product so i think it puts us in a very healthy position we have a fairly low level of inventory out there and we ve already pre sold all of our 2020 models that are going out dirt is more difficult i mean essentially more difficult i mean it s not as weather dependent right you ve got a spring season a fall season it s not it really doesn t isn t driven by particular weather cycle on the dirt side robert spingarn credit suisse analyst okay thank you scott operator next we have noah poponak goldman sachs please go ahead noah poponak goldman sachs analyst hey good morning everyone scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer good morning noah noah poponak goldman sachs analyst scott did you actually specifically have live in the process kind of ready to rock business jet customers then specifically cited the mexico tariff situation as a reason to hold off so as opposed to just you were talking broad macro and giving an example scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer no absolutely no i mean there were couple of specific transactions with customers that do a lot of business in mexico and their business is dependent on that and they got pretty rattled now will they come back i would expect so i think that whole issue i mean if you look part of it noah that came out of nowhere right i mean this was a more of a diplomatic issue then a tariff the new free trade agreements had all the dust settled on all that sort of stuff and so this kind of came as quite a surprise but of course now it s also going away so i think hopeful of those things will come back but yeah i think there were very specific transaction that literally stopped because of that and in a bigger way it contributed just to a level of uncertainty economically and people don t spend big capex items when there is uncertainty noah poponak goldman sachs analyst yeah it s interesting not to diminish the how meaningful that specific thing is but it s just a pretty specific thing and so i guess just in trying to we all keep i think trying to ascertain where we are on the spectrum of weak market to ok market but still kind of touching go and skittish to strong market and i had interpreted some of your commentary year to date to suggest we had we are really moving toward stronger market and i guess how concerned are you that you just we ll never be able to get a fully firmed up tight market until we just have until we are just out of the cycle and we re in a new cycle as long as everyone s because there s always going to be some headline not dissimilar to that right scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer no there is always and i can t predict them all or either right i mean but look we ve been playing this sort of over 10 years now and so yes things get curveball get thrown in there of one flavor or the other whether it s markets or international tensions or currency i mean look this is the nature of the world that we live in but some things are very specific localized problem some are more broad based but as i said i think you look at where the market was through 2018 and the beginning of 19 still feel very good i think we still feel like we have a very good list of customers i do think that the cycle that if you want to talk about that way there was a overhang of a lot of the used aircraft and all these sorts of things is largely behind us and so that gives us a little more stability i think and then just a general better feeling on the new side where you don t have that big overhang on the used side which clearly is the case right now most used aircraft that are out there are quite older used aircraft i mean those transact typically at a slower rate every indication on the used aircraft market which obviously we re a big participant in that market is that if you ve got newer aircraft that kind of people to do trade in and do buy aircraft it s still very liquid and there is good demand you come out there with a good used aircraft they transact so it s healthy it is healthy the underlying market is as healthy as has been in a very long time does that make it immune to something sort of percolating it like we saw here no absolutely not but i still think in general we feel good about where it is the dynamics of again used of pricing of new products coming into the market that i think will help drive a lot of our growth again we as you know we ve taken an approach that says if the markets are just sort of flattish we need to drive growth by bringing things like a latitude into the market by bringing the longitude into the market by bringing the denali and skycourier into the market those are the things that are the investments that we make to try to drive growth in the business even if we have a flattish overall market noah poponak goldman sachs analyst yeah ok that s really helpful i appreciate that on the aviation margin do we need to be aware of a substantial variance between the third quarter and the fourth quarter margin just as you bring the longitude in the third quarter scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer yeah look i think you re going to you would expect to see a somewhat lower margin in q3 because of that dilution of the initial longitude orders going out there and then you would expect to see stronger q4 margin i mean but as you all know we always that s sort of just the volume and the dynamic of our business is always kind of plays out a little bit like that anyway between q3 and q4 q3 tends to be a lower margin and q4 largely driven by volume but there will be probably a little bit of differentiation here based upon that the dilution of longitude but again i think the underlying performance of the business how they re executing the productivity the efficiencies that has been driving a pretty significant improvement on a year over year basis i mean couple of hundred basis points or so better and that will be tough to do in q3 given the longitude dilution but i think we ll you ll see continued strong performance from that business noah poponak goldman sachs analyst got it and then last one on the cash flow the year needs to be meaningfully more back end loaded than the normal historical seasonality to get to the guidance i m assuming that s primarily or entirely longitude anything else scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer well the biggest for longitude is probably the is certainly the single biggest driver we are build the aircraft the demand is there customers are there we just got to get certification done so we ve got plenty of aircraft set up and ready to go i talked a little bit about bell obviously we ve been ramping that production rate up here so that s all sitting in working capital right now and you ll see considerably higher volumes here in q3 q4 on the commercial side of bell and then i mean that are smaller numbers but as you look at for instance the snow stuff right i mean we ve got all that stuff going in working capital right now we will produce all that stuff and sell that through mostly here in the third quarter the dirt side we re always going to have a little bit of some higher inventory carrying there because we need to be able to run the factory and do nothing but snow third quarter so we built up enough inventory to make sure that we can satisfy the demand in that channel as well so but again most of that the significant dollars are associated with longitude s and the bell ramp things like the snow going out i mean i think that s why we still feel quite comfortable with our initial guidance range for sure that is more back end loaded than we would like noah poponak goldman sachs analyst okay thank you scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer sure operator and next we have the line of ronald epstein bank of america please go ahead kristine liwag bank of america analyst hi good morning guys it s kristine liwag calling in for ron scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer good morning kristine liwag bank of america analyst scott safeaero just put out a press release that there is no financial impact for both of you from the contract termination on the hemisphere since the issue seems to be largely from engine performance i was wondering why there isn t more recourse for you from safeaero how is your contract different from your competitor that got a few hundred million dollars in penalties from them scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer well because we don t have a few hundred million dollars of penalty associated with it there was we do on a much smaller scale do r d sharing with some of our key suppliers and largely we have had again a very small relatively speaking number that s in there that s been supporting some of the r d it is a shared program so we ve had r d in it they have r d in it my understanding is they re going to look to continue to work the engine i mean if they can get that engine to its specifications it would be a great engine so i can appreciate that they would continue to make some investment as well but we just we don t deal in these kinds of massive programs to offset these things and frankly because there is not i mean it s size of the market there is not a volume that anybody would ever investor or put up that kind of a upfront end loaded payment or obligation kristine liwag bank of america analyst and when you think about that size aircraft in the market i mean the hemisphere was opposed to entering service sometime next year when you first initially rolled it out can you describe what s going on in that market environment today and is there demand for replacement of hemisphere type aircraft scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer well the decision point was to be to launch it this year so they are entry the service would have been out probably five years anyway before that we go into the market but it was intended to be an aircraft that go into fleets like netjets and obviously other retail customers that had a requirement to do that longer range again i mean the theory of where we were in that business was most of the large cabin manufacturers are going to ultra long haul and even longer range aircraft and there is still was a demand in a right place at the right price for the right performance capability for an aircraft that was more in that 4 500 nautical mile range and there really hadn t been a clean sheet new airplane in that space in a long time and that was what we thought the opportunity was because the challenge there is there is you need to have the right engine airplane combination and so that was always predicated on having that engine there and as i said there has been a lot of hard work there is been a lot of progress frankly that safeaero team has made it just was not yet able to demonstrate and we just had a timeline we need to step back here and commit resources in other places for now and the engine i guess there then we can revisit that kristine liwag bank of america analyst thank you for the color eric salander vice president of investor relations okay operator that does it for this call thank you everyone and you can reach me if you have any follow up

salander vice president of investor relations thanks kevin and good morning everyone before we begin i d like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today these forward looking statements are subject to various risk factors which are detailed in our sec filings and also in today s press release on the call today we have scott donnelly textron s chairman and ceo and frank connor our chief financial officer our earnings call presentation can be found in the investor relations section of our website advertisement advertisement textron s revenues in the quarter were 3 2 billion down 500 million from last year s second quarter while net income was 0 93 per share up from 0 87 per share last year manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions totaled 102 million compared to 399 million in last year s second quarter with that i will turn the call over to scott scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer thanks eric and good morning everybody q2 was a solid quarter for textron as we continue our focus on operational improvements across the company segment profit margin was up 120 basis points as we continue to see strong execution across our businesses driven by higher margins at aviation and industrial bell revenues were down in the quarter largely due to lower military volume as we transition to lower production quantities on our military programs advertisement advertisement on the commercial side we delivered 53 helicopters down from 57 last year despite the lower commercial deliveries in the quarter we expect to see a ramp in deliveries in the second half of the year supported by continued strong order activity and an increased production rates in the quarter japan s national police agency placed the first order for the bell for 412epx the newest upgrade of the 412 series this aircraft has been co developed between bell and subaru corporation for the new utility helicopter program under japan s ministry of defense and we expect this program to support the 412 program well into the future within future vertical lift we continue with the flight testing and demonstration activities of our valor v 280 we have now demonstrated army level one handling qualities successfully proving the aircrafts maneuverability this represents the highest performance standards for agility which is critical to the army mission we re also encouraged by the army s recent actions regarding the potential acceleration of the future long range assault aircraft program these actions include an industry days schedule at the end of this month that should allow potential contractors to gain more insight into the army s acquisition approach proposed alternative procurement path through other transaction authority mechanism to be awarded in february and identification of an engineering manufacturing development program or a middle tier acquisition award date estimated to be occurred 19 months following the ota award also within fvl bell was among five defense contractors down selected by the us army to progress through the next phase of the future attack reconnaissance aircraft program we re pleased the army recognized our competitive offering which will utilize advanced rotor technology and fly by wire flight control capabilities validated in our bell 525 program to create an innovative aircraft that is well suited for the far mission advertisement advertisement our systems revenues were down largely due to lower volume at tru simulation training and unmanned systems during the second quarter our tru training business formed a new company with flightsafety international called flightsafety textron aviation training newly formed company which is 30 owned by textron provides training services through textron aviation s broad product line of general aviation aircraft we expect the combination of the strengths and resources of these businesses will further enhance the training and services available to our customers while increasing efficiency and ensuring the extension of our high quality training programs new textron aviation aircraft also in the quarter textron airborne solutions announces it s atac subsidiary received a one year 56 million contract modification to provide high subsonic and supersonic aircraft services to the us navy extending our current contract through 2020 within unmanned systems our fee for service product line captured over 90 million of new wins in the quarter for the aerosonde program moving to industrial revenues were lower primarily reflecting the impact of the disposition of the tools and test product line in last year s third quarter in specialized vehicles we saw continued favorable performance resulting from the cost reduction and manufacturing realignment actions that we initiated in the fourth quarter of last year also in the quarter we continue our on boarding bass pro and cabela stores as well as independent tracker marine dealers and we re seeing momentum build in this new retail channel advertisement advertisement our ground support business received multiyear contraction from both american and united airlines for our equipment across our tug safeaero and douglas brands to service their operations worldwide moving to textron aviation revenue was down largely due to lower volume on our commercial turboprop and defense product lines in the quarter we delivered 46 jets down from 48 last year and 34 commercial turboprops down from 47 last year s second quarter beginning in late may we experienced lower order activity across our product lines largely attributable to the uncertainties around tariffs and concerns about economic growth which cause disruptions in both our domestic and foreign markets since then we believe these uncertainties have largely diminished as we ve seen the mexico tariff issue resolved stronger economic indicators and a bias toward further interest rate cuts which have improved customer outlook as we are going into the third quarter remains positive and we expect deliveries and order to ramp throughout the second half of the year driving revenue growth at aviation moving to longitude we continue to make good progress on the certification efforts while this has been a much larger test than originally anticipated the documentation flow and review with faa continues and we expect type certification deliveries of the aircraft in the third quarter advertisement advertisement continuing with hemisphere we determine that the engine has not yet demonstrated the performance required for the aircraft design and we have put the program on hold any decision to revisit the program in the future would depend on the state of the market proven engine performance and a competitive landscape at that time our engineering focus remains on the certification of longitude in addition to the skycourier and denali programs where we expect to complete first flights later this year in summary we continue to feel good about execution across our businesses and we re well positioned for second half revenue growth from increased deliveries at aviation driven by the longitude entry into service as well as higher commercial deliveries at bell we expect these developments to drive strong earnings and cash generation throughout the balance of the year with that i will turn the call over to frank frank connor chief financial officer advertisement advertisement thank you scott good morning everyone segment profit in the quarter was 339 million down 7 million from the second quarter of 2018 with segment profit margin of 10 5 up 120 basis points from a year ago let s review how each of the segments contributed starting with textron aviation revenues at textron aviation of 1 1 billion were down 153 million from last year s second quarter primarily due to lower commercial turboprop and defense volume and mix textron aviation delivered 46 jets down from 48 last year and 34 commercial turboprops down from 47 last year segment profit was 105 million in the second quarter up 1 million from a year ago as favorable performance was offset by the lower volume and mix textron aviation backlog at the end of the second quarter was 1 9 billion revenues at bell of 771 million were down 7 from last year primarily on lower military volume bell delivered 53 commercial helicopters in the quarter down from 57 last year segment profit of 103 million was down 14 million primarily due to lower military volume bell backlog at the end of the second quarter was 6 billion revenues at textron systems were 308 million down from 380 million last year primarily reflecting lower volume at tru simulation and training and unmanned systems segment profit was up 9 million from last year s second quarter primarily due an 11 million impact from performance reflecting an 18 million gain related to the formation of our new training business with flightsafety international moving forward we will continue to record our portion of the operating profit from the new training business advertisement advertisement textron systems backlog at the end of the second quarter was 1 4 billion industrial revenues of 1 billion decreased 213 million largely related to the impact from the disposition of our tools and test product line and lower volume segment profit was down 4 million from the second quarter of 2018 largely due to the impact from the product line disposition and lower volume partially offset by favorable performance primarily related to the specialized vehicles product line finance segment revenues were down 1 million and profit was up 1 million from last year s second quarter moving below segment profit corporate expenses were 24 million and interest expense was 36 million we also repurchased 3 1 million shares at an overall cost of 159 million through the first six months of the year we ve repurchased 7 million shares returning 361 million in cash to shareholders to wrap up with guidance we are raising our expected full year earnings per share from continuing operations to a range of 3 65 to 3 85 per share up 0 10 from our prior outlook we are reiterating our outlook for cash flow from continuing operations of the manufacturing group before pension contributions of 700 million to 800 million that concludes our prepared remarks so kevin we can open the line for questions questions and answers operator thank you first question is from the line of david strauss please go ahead barclays advertisement advertisement david strauss barclays analyst thanks thanks good morning i guess first clarification can you just tell us how much the gain was on the systems side for the training jv frank connor chief financial officer it was 18 million dave david strauss barclays analyst okay thanks and then scott could you you maybe talk about the potential for your 737 max stimulator business how many you ve built there what s your ability to ramp that up given the potential training needs on the back of what s going on with max scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer so dave i can t give you a whole lot of detail on it i mean obviously we ve been delivering max since boeing and several 737 max customers i think a lot of that will depend on how all those plays out in terms of the recommendations or requirements that faa and they also put on airlines around the need for sim training it looks at this point to us like it s probably going to be a requirement that allows them to get back and flying in the transition course and then would mandate actual maxsim training later on so we ve certainly had quite a number of inquiries from customers who are interested in going ahead and getting maxsims on order we started to do some long lead ordering already for to support those deliveries next year but i couldn t give you a firmed up number yet i think we re still working on that and working with boeing to understand their strategy on a go forward basis as well but we really have to kind of wait and i think see where the faa also end up in terms of what their training mandates are david strauss barclays analyst okay thanks i ll get back in the queue operator and our next question is from the line of carter copeland melius research please go ahead carter copeland melius research analyst hi good morning guys scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer good morning carter copeland melius research analyst scott i wondered if you could just kind of expand a little bit on the rationale of the the company you set up with flightsafety and just what that should tell us about the what applications are for your what you ve been trying to create organically there how much does this change the growth expectation that you have for those efforts and are you trying to expand that much more rapidly and trading some of the profit as a result to try to get more scale there just kind of give us some detail on the rationale and then what you re trying to accomplish with that scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer sure carter so as you know we decided to get into that training business several years ago we felt that was a very important part of sort of the service aftermarket element of our business and we weren t really participating in that we had a lot of feedback from customers that they would be interested in us participate in that space and so as you know we made a couple of fairly small acquisitions obviously over the last few years we ve invested a fair bit in both irad and r d as well as capex to start to build out that training capability the business is going very well great customer feedback i think the training materials and the techniques that we were deploying were working the challenge was that the time frame of how long that would take to build out the number of training centers and number of locations it was a fairly daunting task and was going to take quite some period of time to do that we happen to engage in discussions with flightsafety whom we had relationship for many years obviously in the training side and so look we ought to link together let s take the technology and a lot of the tools and the capability that we developed organically and put these businesses together in a joint venture and basically what that s allowing us to do is take what we think were the advantages of that business and the positive feedback we are getting from customers and expand it much more rapidly so this now has the ability to much more quickly accelerate the returns for us and i think for the customers it sort of taking the best of whole worlds the combination of what we would invest in organically and the significant footprint that flightsafety has around the world so that we could touch more customers in a time frame it was much shorter than doing this just going training center by training center in terms of us putting more and more capital out there and flightsafety already have the capital out there so as we said the gain is a function of having invested in that business and having put those assets in the joint venture you got to look at sort of reevaluating those assets and obviously we created a very valuable business and so that s a good thing i think more importantly what we will see going forward is the earnings as a result of our share of that joint venture which is going to grow much faster than we had we stayed just on a pure organic path so and you ll see those earnings come through systems as we go forward carter copeland melius research analyst just in general terms do you expect the growth to be 50 more or 2x or what just any color around how you can help what your expectation is or how much you ve accelerated that as a result scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer well i don t we don t break out the numbers and that level of detail carter but i d say it s significantly faster in terms of the rate of return what we would have had if we had played this out on a purely organic basis let s say the difference to having build up that capital infrastructure versus leveraging what flightsafety already had on the ground that becomes more of a technology play than a capex play carter copeland melius research analyst okay great i ll get in the queue back as well thanks scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer sure operator our next question is from the line of sheila kah jefferies please go ahead sheila kahyaoglu jefferies analyst hi good morning thank you scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer good morning sheila kahyaoglu jefferies analyst scott just a big picture question organically your sales were down 10 in the quarter you ve been focused on new products to gain share by fleet so in relatively tough end markets how do you kind of think about the levers from here just given your decision on the hemisphere as well scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer sure sheila i think the for us in the quarter really in the first half of the year the big impacts that will change how the second half plays out here is one around bell commercial and we talked last year when you were seeing strong demand on the commercial side we indicated that we need to turn up our production rates to meet that demand that takes a little bit longer for the from the time you make that decision till the time you have aircraft that are coming off the line so when we increase the production rates on 407 and the 429s we didn t have those aircraft available coming off the line until right about now so i think we ll see a significant impact in increases on the third and the fourth quarter the demand is there the orders are there it s been a matter of getting the production up and delivering at a higher rate and that s where we are now so you ll see the benefits of that here in the third and fourth quarter they are already supported by orders that we have we just needed to meet the demand in terms of the production side on the aviation side obviously longitude getting into service that was a huge part of our growth story on aviation for the year and we expect that clearly will be the second half impact here we continue frankly to see good demand on the historical aircraft latitudes continue to sell very strongly we again demand a longitude side is very good i think across the whole portfolio clearly we had a very strong first quarter for second quarter we felt pretty good things did get a little bit shaken up there right toward the end and but they re mostly customers who would say look i want to wait for the markets to settle out and i m going to defer this in the second half so i think our view at the business jet market is still very healthy and so i think between that and the longitude coming into service we will see strong growth in the second half sheila kahyaoglu jefferies analyst thank you and then frank one for you on working capital it s been a steep usage in the first half i think primarily due to inventory how do you think about that reversing and any potential risks in it frank connor chief financial officer yeah sheila as scott said with that growth in the second half we expect to kind of obviously sell off and liquidate that inventory that the bulk of that build is at aviation it s kind of certainly impacted by the longitude moving into the second half of the year but it s also kind of bell commercial and other volume that scott indicated we are looking to have come through in the second half of the year and feel good about where we re positioned to do that sheila kahyaoglu jefferies analyst thank you operator next question is from the line of peter arment baird please go ahead peter arment robert w baird co analyst thanks good morning scott and frank scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer good morning peter arment robert w baird co analyst scott could you just give us a little more color on how things are going in terms of within the industrial segment particularly i guess specialized vehicles format seem to be a little better than i think a lot of us were expecting what s how is the bass pro kind of rollout going just maybe some color there scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer sure no there s a couple of things there peter first of all obviously from an operational performance standpoint the business is doing much better historical businesses where we ve had a very strong position and good performance for a long time in golf and ground support equipment and areas like that our sales performance is back where it should be guys are doing very well the markets are healthy and again the teams operational execution is quite strong in the off road world we re down that s quite conscious right we re working very very hard to make sure that we do a much better job in terms of how we manage those retail channels snow is a good example the position that we took this year as we said guys we re only going to pre sell when you look at the north american market which is obviously the vast majority of the market in the snow world we went out with our program and so guys were only going to build what we ve already sold so we went around and have deposits from customers this product line is basically sold out and so we ll be here through the whole third quarter manufacturing all those units and shipping them out but unlike in previous years where we ll be putting a lot of inventory out into the field and dependent on how that sold through and then getting into rebating if it s not selling through we said we re just not going to do that so we re going to do only a presale and that was frankly a very successful program we saw very strong demand across the product line but were pre sold so on the dirt side obviously that s a longer and sort of a little bit of a different selling season as you go through there but again we re being very very cautious about how we manage that channel how much inventory we allowed to be out into that channel we did awful lot of hard work on looking at individual dealers and making sure that we have relationships where that relationship is a profitable relationship for both us and the dealer and as a result we ve dramatically reduced the number of deals that we had out there because when we went back and looked at some of them by the time you get through the rebating it s not a profitable relationship and so we ve taken the pains of terminating relationships with the vast majority of those folks specifically on the tracker front obviously the bass pro cabela and their independent marine dealers is terrific channel extraordinarily well run very i would say delivered around what it does in terms of inventory so in terms of how they manage is quite consistent with how we want to manage the business going forward so we ve been seeing a lot of activity and load ins across both stores and independent dealers here over the last six months that obviously will continue through the balance of the year we like the trajectory the momentum is building so i think when you look year over year peter we re much happier with where that business is both in terms of its how it operates everyday how it thinks about managing some of those channels some of the issues we had last year would be late with some of the new products obviously that s those products did get the market and i think we have a great product lineup we just have to be a very measured about how we manage the channels and how much inventory we allow to be out there to reduce risk and make sure that we have a good profitable business peter arment robert w baird co analyst appreciate that and just a quick one on scott did you see any change in business jet pricing just given the softness in end market a little bit that you saw in may or price is still holding scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer no peter we re still seeing pricing holding you know there s always a crazy deal or two and we choose not to participate in those right so i think we make a great product it s fairly priced got a great service network behind it and there is no reason for us to chase a crazy price deal here and there so we re maintaining that discipline and as we ve said all along we will trade volume rather than damaging the price in the industry so i think that s i think the pricing is in a place where it should be right and we re going to hold the line and like you ll see here in the quarter we had price net of inflation up a little bit which is healthy for the business and that s what we need to continue to do peter arment robert w baird co analyst thanks for the color scott operator thank you next question is from the line of george shapiro of shapiro research please go ahead george shapiro shapiro research analyst yes good morning scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer good morning george shapiro shapiro research analyst scott the implied orders in the quarter were pretty weak and obviously the book to bill was less than one given that you see things picking back up in third quarter here is it natural to expect the book to bill over one in the third quarter recovering from the second quarter scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer well george i would hope that that s the case i mean clearly we had a very strong first quarter on the book to bill front we re still have our backlog numbers net through the first half above where it was coming into the year so i think we re not overly concerned by this as i said things did slow down in june given some of the gyrations in the market and talks around tariffs and things like that but i think most of the discussions that we ve had with customers particularly in the us were some things would pushed into the second half and those dialogs continue with customers so i think we re still in a pretty good in a pretty good place with that respect we were light on the turboprops particularly in the international market and as you know george that s a little bit lumpy we ve seen this before where it kind of goes in fits and starts so that s a little bit harder market to predict it generally affects more the turboprops than it does the jet side of the business but we ll see how it plays out but certainly my expectations would be that we would continue to see good order flow through the balance of the year george shapiro shapiro research analyst and frank one for you just aviation aftermarket how does that compare to last year frank connor chief financial officer yeah it was fine it was down just a touch but continues to kind of be solid for us george shapiro shapiro research analyst and the reason it s down a touch as opposed to up a little bit any color on that frank connor chief financial officer no i mean no nothing significant kind of we ve seen some variation in volume in the shops from time to time where we are looking at solid or a strong second half performance there and kind of continue to be feel good about how we re executing it george shapiro shapiro research analyst okay thanks very much operator and next we have robert stallard vertical research please go ahead robert stallard vertical research analyst thanks so much good morning scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer good morning rob robert stallard vertical research analyst scott on the bizjet side of things a couple of your competitors have launched some new products so far this year and i was wondering if you could comment on whether this could impact your market share going forward scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer really nobody in our warehouse i mean if you look at the i mean number earlier in the year obviously i think that s largely those product lines from that particular competitor have been up against the latitude and obviously on longitude i think our products are outstanding performers and we continue to see strong demand on the latitude front and look i think longitude is in a very good position i wouldn t expect to see a lot more activity to get through the certification i mean there is plenty of customers that are in the process and many of whom i think are just waiting for cert to be done so i think from a performance standpoint we continue to get fabulous feedback from everybody that demo flies that aircraft so i think it s a competitive marketplace i think it s always been one and it will continue to be a competitive marketplace but i think we re we stack up quite well with that so every transaction has got competitive nature to it but i think we re winning our fair share and feel pretty good about where we stand robert stallard vertical research analyst okay and then maybe one for frank you only changed your guidance as being up eps by 0 10 i was wondering if you could comment on whether you see at the halfway point of the year any changes to the divisional split for the full year frank connor chief financial officer no it s largely intact i d say that obviously we ve seen good performance out of bell so far this year so kind of reflected in that 0 10 is kind of continuing solid performance on the bell that probably kind of give some a little bit of upside to our original margin guidance there and then systems has done a nice job as well in kind of executing through the first half so kind of those are the two places where we re seeing some better performance that are contributing to the 0 10 robert stallard vertical research analyst that s great thank you very much operator next question is from the line of cai von rumohr cowen company please go ahead cai von rumohr cowen company analyst yes thanks so much so yes you mentioned bell doing particularly well how much of the strong profit in the second quarter reflected favorable eacs on z22 multiyear two and kind of as we go into next year are we still looking at 10 to 12 or can it be better scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer well cai i d say that we always i mean every quarter we have our eac process and there is always some performance in there it s certainly less than it was last year so from a comparable place and then we kind of talked about this right i mean we ve kind of been winding down the multiyear two revenues and ramping up the multiyear three revenues and that is certainly at a lower margin and again a lot of the performance and sort of reserves that you keep around multiyear two have largely played through so on a year over year basis the eacs or the gain associated that are down but there is still there and i would expect that ll always be there i mean we always try to continue to drive productivity and performance improvement and we recognize that we each time we go through an eac there is always some puts and takes but i think the team executes quite well so but anyway i would say along the lines of how they re performing there continue to be strong performance so even though the eac numbers might be lower gains in the quarter we re reflecting it solid operating profit across whole business and i think we ll continue to see that next year i would say look we ve had sort of that 10 to 12 guide out there for some time on bell they certainly have been overdriving that here as we worked our way through multiyear two i wouldn t change my perspective that s a business that s well run and we will continue to sit in that 10 to 12 range there s a fair bit of r d as you know going on 525 has been a big part of that v 280 has been a very large part of that what we will be transitioning into these cape set 1 and cape set 3 ota programs and those cost share associated with those right our r d spending needs to stay at a pretty high level to support what we think are some really significant opportunities for the future of bell so it s i think that 10 to 12 range is still how you all think about it cai von rumohr cowen company analyst thank you very much and then frank so you re maybe give us some numbers on where the net price increase at aviation was it narrowed a bit in the first quarter so where was it in the second and also given that you have yet to certify the longitude is your full year delivery target fully intact or does it should we be looking at a slightly smaller number this year frank connor chief financial officer yeah so on the price side cai our gross price was 13 million for the quarter and net price was 3 million so a continued good performance on that front and no i mean we continue to be positioned to deliver on longitude once we achieved certification and kind of we feel that we re in the right place to meet the commitments that we have for that and we obviously haven t adjusted the aviation number kind of in anyway cai von rumohr cowen company analyst thank you operator our next question is from the line of seth seifman jpmorgan please go ahead seth seifman jpmorgan analyst thanks very much and good morning just a follow up there on aviation i guess the projection you ve given for the segment is for about 550 million of earnings for the year it implies a pretty big second half and i think given the longitude deliveries that kind of we can understand why the second half would be bigger and second half is seasonally usually bigger anyway but even bigger this time and so can you walk us through i mean do you expect a significant increase in the earnings for aviation in the third quarter or does it kind of all come in the fourth quarter with the longitude and to the extent that there was any temporary softness in demand around some of those macro issues that you mentioned during the quarter i mean have you already seen that start to come back in terms of orders or indications of interest in the first couple of weeks of the third quarter here scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer well seth i would say that our progression as you know i mean this is usually a business that has a back end load a lot of that is driven by tax folks wanted to get their aircraft deliveries done by the end of the year i don t see any change in that i think the progression that we normally see we would expect to see arguably it s going to be a little more accentuated than that just because we have the longitude coming in to service so yes there will be more of a pickup in the back half associated with that in terms of just the normal order flow again i think things appear to be normal we actually did see customers that had said all are going to wait and see what happens after everything kind of got a little shaken up in the late may into june timeframe and to take delivery in the second quarter but more of them were look i just want to sort of put this aside and think about this as a second half activity so again from it s hard to our sales teams those dialogs are ongoing and so i would expect that we will see most of that come back and turn into third fourth quarter deals inaudible aircraft that are deliveries that would be out in the next year seth seifman jpmorgan analyst right and then on the longitude given i think it s probably just a handful of the initial units that are either marginally profitable or not profitable and so on that basis is it possible for longitude to contribute to earnings in q3 or is the q3 earnings that we re going to see basically all from non longitude platform scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer well as you know typically the initial deliveries are going to be at a lower margin there will be some contribution but certainly from a margin rate there is no question in the third quarter they would be dilutive so now that being said i think the performance you ve seen very strong performance of the business here in the first half so our relative profitability on light revenue is stronger than it has been so it s offsetting against what is very strong performance so it s still going to be respectable margins but it will be if you just looked at longitude on a stand alone basis it will certainly be dilutive seth seifman jpmorgan analyst excellent okay thanks very much operator our next question is from the line of pete skibitski of alembic global please go ahead peter skibitski alembic global analyst good morning guys scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer good morning pete peter skibitski alembic global analyst hey scott can you update us on ship to shore in terms of that initial lrp contract that i think you re expecting in when that is the one that comes through here in the second half is systems going to kind of return to growth on that basis or maybe the uav headwinds still too tough right now can you just update us there scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer so pete i definitely think that well first of all ship to shore is moving along well the first craft is in builders trials that was a huge milestone so we re about halfway through that process we re expecting delivery of the first aircraft here this quarter the rest of the initial developmental units are moving along well behind that we do continue to get long lead funding for that next production lot of aircraft is actually three fiscal years that are in there we are in negotiation of that process i would expect here in the third quarter or four quarter the latest obviously we would get that under contract so but the amount of revenue that we ll see this year is largely associated with those long lead materials we do have some of the initial assembly or initial welding activity going on the first craft but really you will see the impact of that as it starts to ramp up and generate revenue where it will be a 2020 story so clearly from our perspective systems here is sort of bottoming in 2019 and you ll see the growth in 2020 in large part driven by that transition of ship to shore from development program to the production program peter arment robert w baird co analyst can i just ask one follow up scott i haven t asked you in a while about this marine corps mux program they re doing a lot of interesting things i think with the acquisition strategy are you guys kind of comfortable on that program right now it s an opportunity for you or some of the things that they re doing are they kind of making it tougher to bid on just your thoughts scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer well i think look i think the marine corps is doing a lot of work right now and then you ve see these small levels of activity in prices where they are just for best soliciting ideas which i think is a very healthy thing to do obviously we have done a lot of work on the concept of the mux and how we would approach that program the marine corps obviously is well aware of everything that we ve that we ve done there we have participated in some of these other smaller projects where they re sort of going to industry and say hey give us your ideas around different mission systems and different concepts of operations so i think they are sort of in a fact finding mode obviously we have put a lot of information in front of them over the last couple of years and at this point i think most of the work that we feel like we need to do in advance of those thing we ve largely done that and i think here in the next couple of years you will see that thing transition from sort of the solicitation of ideas to help them formulate their final specifications if you will around that program and then it will turn into hopefully into a funded development program obviously we would participate in that i think we have a great solution to what they re looking for but it will ramp over the next couple of years i think peter skibitski alembic global analyst thank you operator and next we have the line of rajeev lalwani of morgan stanley please go ahead rajeev lalwani morgan stanley analyst good morning scott good morning frank scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer good morning rajeev lalwani morgan stanley analyst first just a question on hemisphere can you talk more about the decision to put that on hold how much of it was engine versus simply what you re seeing in the overall market and the signals you re getting there scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer it was purely the engine as we ve talked about for the last year or so we think that the niche the area that we intended to fit with that aircraft and obviously had that shared feeling with netjets as our launch customer was an area that would be a great product and a great price point performance point to go into the marketplace but the challenge was there was really only one engine in development that was suitable to meet that performance point and as i said in the prepared comments that engine hasn t yet demonstrated the performance required for the aircraft so if at some point in the future that engine or whatever is demonstrated that can meet it we would certainly revisit it it s just i think just too much time has gone by here and we can t sort of hold this thing in a i mean we can t expect our customers to kind of wait an uncertainty any longer so there is still potential for it out there we have to evaluate and understand what s competitive dynamic what s going on in the marketplace what s going on with customers to determine at that later time whether that product would make sense or not we d be certainly happy to evaluate and look at that but in the meantime clearly we need to take our engineering resource and focus on those things that are going to drive our growth in the mid to near term here which is not just getting longitude done but getting skycourier and denali into the q and as you know we re always kind of looking at other concepts and opportunities within our portfolio that need refreshes updates and things like that which is what we normally do so we re simply just going to take all that engineering resource that would have gone into the hemisphere program and deploy that into our current portfolio of programs seth seifman jpmorgan analyst on the bell side obviously are pretty well positioned on the long range and have the reconnaissance program how important are those for the future of bell i mean assuming that you re not successful there should we start thinking about an overall restructuring of the military side of the business there do you feel like there is enough other things going on to sort of sustain what you re seeing today or add to it scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer well i think if you look at the military side of bell we have good visibility on h1 production out in the 20 22 timeframe there s a number of fms opportunities that are out there that we re pursuing as you know those always take time to get those to closure v 22 were already running at that lower rate associated with multiyear three again there is some fms opportunity or other things that they could increase that over time and i think there are certainly some possibilities there and of course this has become a very large installed base so there is a ton of service business associated with this there s upgrades and enhancement programs which are typical of any large defense platform which we expect we will continue to see in the future so i think bell on the military side just around v 22 and h1 can sustain and be a nice healthy business but clearly from a growth standpoint the opportunities are out there around far around far those v 280 of course the mux program which we just talked about and some other opportunities around tiltrotor is what s going to drive the growth in the future i think we re very well positioned on several of those programs will we win them all probably not but these are these are very large programs and so winning one or two of those is what would drive significant growth for bell on top of the ongoing sustaining of the v 22 and h1 programs seth seifman jpmorgan analyst very helpful thank you scott operator and next question is from the line of jon raviv of citi please go ahead jon raviv citi investment research analyst hey thanks good morning can you just level set us a bit more on systems margin going forward post the flightsafety deal but then also with the ship to shore connect ramping up i understand that sales bottoms in for 19 but how about the margin rates and i guess overall how you think about earnings dollars growth going forward here with those two big moving pieces scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer yeah we ve showed you i think the systems business should be targeting around 10 margin we have returned that last year we re on track to be in that neighborhood this year obviously there has been a bit of a drag on associated with the fixed price development on ship to shore but again that transitions into a production program this is a business that we should expect to see a 10 margin business jon raviv citi investment research analyst okay thanks and then just going back to aviation and it got it seems like something really kind of scared customers in may june even though the market has been through some other gyrations especially for 2018 but it s kind of through that period you typically sounded quite positive so what do you think was different about the nature of this may june move and then look i mean that s a beat a dead horse but really what gives you confidence that this is going to come back i mean the fed s cutting rates because the economy is slowing that s probably not a good thing for customers scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer well look i think people when you look at the combination of you again we had some market gyrations but to your point this happens periodically right i mean but you have this concern over mexico tariffs i mean that i think we had a couple of customers that just flat out they do a lot of business in mexico and this is was a big problem for them so that created some of that uncertainty look a lot of people were talking down to hey the economy is really going to slow down dramatically and i think the numbers that actually came out would indicate that s not the case all right i mean unemployment numbers are still quite good the gdp numbers were actually better than most economists were forecasting so is the market on fire no but is it healthy and steady i think that s more of a case of where we are so customers that are interested in upgrading and buy new aircraft they didn t go say hey i m done they were let me see what happens when things settle down a little bit so and at the timing of it when we get one of these perturbations in the first month of the quarter that gives you time for customers to kind of understand where they are and get comfortable and move forward when they happened in the last month of the quarter it s a little more challenging because they come back to the table but it s now past the end of the quarter so i think but if that had not happened we probably would have over driven a few jets just given the number of things that were in the pipeline but i think at least our view right now is those were larger activities that deferred into the third quarter jon raviv citi investment research analyst got you thanks for the perspective there operator next question is from the line of robert spingarn credit suisse please go ahead robert spingarn credit suisse analyst good morning just a couple of things on the industrial business you re guiding i think pro forma for the divestiture about flat this year and that seem to track in the first half but i m wondering about some of the moving pieces in there for example how does the channel fill work with the tracker product against streamlining your other distributors and how do you think about automotive in the second half given some of the macro weakness that we re expecting so that on kautex can you essentially can h2 be flat with h1 is what i m asking scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer so i think if you look at let me talk to the automotive side first clearly volumes around most of the world are down but frankly the comparisons on q3 q4 are going to be easier than q1 and q2 because you really saw that slowdown hit in the latter part of last year so i think our business is performing well i mean we re happy with performance and operations and margins and how the guys are doing but there is no doubt it is on a lower volume basis but more or less consistent with where we thought it would be and as i said the q3 q4 comps are certainly easier than what we saw in q1 and q2 just given the global automotive slowdown so i think we re comfortable with where we are again the team is executing quite well and delivering based on where that end market is so we continue to be feel good about new programs and new nominations which obviously are growth and opportunities in the future as well on the off road side we have i ll tell you the tracker the way that the the inventory and stocking model works in bass pro and cabela and their dealers is a very disciplined process it s a very healthy process and we feel very good about how that s going and the way the team there manages that it s a great partnership we re pleased with how it s going and very comfortable with just how they do business and how they manage that business i talk a little bit about the other piece of the channel around snow we re just guys we have some very very good deals out there particularly a lot of our dealers who have a long history with that brand in the snow side as i said we re being extraordinarily disciplined with how we do that and how we manage that and we ll do that on the dirt side as well because it is largely those same dealers of guys that are historical snowmobile dealers that are carrying that arctic cat brand of dirt and by the way they are very complementary channels right the strength of that channel under that arctic cat brand tends to be in the northern parts of the us and canada where the snowmobile country exists and in most of the rest of the country happens to be where the bass pro cabela s and their independent marine dealers are very strong so it gives us in total i think a very strong distribution network robert spingarn credit suisse analyst do you find that whether is a bigger factor for dirt as it is for snow and then one last thing i wanted to ask you is similar and how in commercial helicopter similar to my first question about h2 how do you get optimistic or as optimistic for a bounce back when the rig counts have been fairly soft especially in the second quarter scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer well so on the helicopter front keep in mind that our share in those deepwater rigs we really don t address that market today that s part of what the 525 is about for the future but where our market is and where we ve frankly seen strength and very strong workflow here in the last almost going on a couple of years now is really around the near in stop in oil and gas and frankly a lot of emergency medical services executive vip customs and border patrol i mean it s a much broader market police really what really drives the 407 and 429 markets is not the oil and gas market so there is a real contrast right now between the big machines that are large oriented serving that offshore oil and gas market it s just not a market we ve had a very big position or the market that s quite strong is again around more of that the light twins the single so it s volume around 505 407 429 and 412 which is not that deep water offshore oil and gas market robert spingarn credit suisse analyst okay and then just a whether question on dirt versus snow scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer well i d say it s a lot less dependent snow is very dependent on the snow season again this is part of why we want to sort of insulate ourselves from that by saying guys we re in a pre sell so those snowmobiles are going to be built and that will be shipped and they re paid for and that will all happen before there s we even get into the snow season so by design we were trying to insulate ourselves from that one way or the other of course we look very hard at what s out there in the inventory the inventory levels of our products frankly ended up at a very low level last year well below where we originally targeted and that was because it did seem a relatively in most parts a good snow strong snow season and so our dealers did retail through a lot of product so i think it puts us in a very healthy position we have a fairly low level of inventory out there and we ve already pre sold all of our 2020 models that are going out dirt is more difficult i mean essentially more difficult i mean it s not as weather dependent right you ve got a spring season a fall season it s not it really doesn t isn t driven by particular weather cycle on the dirt side robert spingarn credit suisse analyst okay thank you scott operator next we have noah poponak goldman sachs please go ahead noah poponak goldman sachs analyst hey good morning everyone scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer good morning noah noah poponak goldman sachs analyst scott did you actually specifically have live in the process kind of ready to rock business jet customers then specifically cited the mexico tariff situation as a reason to hold off so as opposed to just you were talking broad macro and giving an example scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer no absolutely no i mean there were couple of specific transactions with customers that do a lot of business in mexico and their business is dependent on that and they got pretty rattled now will they come back i would expect so i think that whole issue i mean if you look part of it noah that came out of nowhere right i mean this was a more of a diplomatic issue then a tariff the new free trade agreements had all the dust settled on all that sort of stuff and so this kind of came as quite a surprise but of course now it s also going away so i think hopeful of those things will come back but yeah i think there were very specific transaction that literally stopped because of that and in a bigger way it contributed just to a level of uncertainty economically and people don t spend big capex items when there is uncertainty noah poponak goldman sachs analyst yeah it s interesting not to diminish the how meaningful that specific thing is but it s just a pretty specific thing and so i guess just in trying to we all keep i think trying to ascertain where we are on the spectrum of weak market to ok market but still kind of touching go and skittish to strong market and i had interpreted some of your commentary year to date to suggest we had we are really moving toward stronger market and i guess how concerned are you that you just we ll never be able to get a fully firmed up tight market until we just have until we are just out of the cycle and we re in a new cycle as long as everyone s because there s always going to be some headline not dissimilar to that right scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer no there is always and i can t predict them all or either right i mean but look we ve been playing this sort of over 10 years now and so yes things get curveball get thrown in there of one flavor or the other whether it s markets or international tensions or currency i mean look this is the nature of the world that we live in but some things are very specific localized problem some are more broad based but as i said i think you look at where the market was through 2018 and the beginning of 19 still feel very good i think we still feel like we have a very good list of customers i do think that the cycle that if you want to talk about that way there was a overhang of a lot of the used aircraft and all these sorts of things is largely behind us and so that gives us a little more stability i think and then just a general better feeling on the new side where you don t have that big overhang on the used side which clearly is the case right now most used aircraft that are out there are quite older used aircraft i mean those transact typically at a slower rate every indication on the used aircraft market which obviously we re a big participant in that market is that if you ve got newer aircraft that kind of people to do trade in and do buy aircraft it s still very liquid and there is good demand you come out there with a good used aircraft they transact so it s healthy it is healthy the underlying market is as healthy as has been in a very long time does that make it immune to something sort of percolating it like we saw here no absolutely not but i still think in general we feel good about where it is the dynamics of again used of pricing of new products coming into the market that i think will help drive a lot of our growth again we as you know we ve taken an approach that says if the markets are just sort of flattish we need to drive growth by bringing things like a latitude into the market by bringing the longitude into the market by bringing the denali and skycourier into the market those are the things that are the investments that we make to try to drive growth in the business even if we have a flattish overall market noah poponak goldman sachs analyst yeah ok that s really helpful i appreciate that on the aviation margin do we need to be aware of a substantial variance between the third quarter and the fourth quarter margin just as you bring the longitude in the third quarter scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer yeah look i think you re going to you would expect to see a somewhat lower margin in q3 because of that dilution of the initial longitude orders going out there and then you would expect to see stronger q4 margin i mean but as you all know we always that s sort of just the volume and the dynamic of our business is always kind of plays out a little bit like that anyway between q3 and q4 q3 tends to be a lower margin and q4 largely driven by volume but there will be probably a little bit of differentiation here based upon that the dilution of longitude but again i think the underlying performance of the business how they re executing the productivity the efficiencies that has been driving a pretty significant improvement on a year over year basis i mean couple of hundred basis points or so better and that will be tough to do in q3 given the longitude dilution but i think we ll you ll see continued strong performance from that business noah poponak goldman sachs analyst got it and then last one on the cash flow the year needs to be meaningfully more back end loaded than the normal historical seasonality to get to the guidance i m assuming that s primarily or entirely longitude anything else scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer well the biggest for longitude is probably the is certainly the single biggest driver we are build the aircraft the demand is there customers are there we just got to get certification done so we ve got plenty of aircraft set up and ready to go i talked a little bit about bell obviously we ve been ramping that production rate up here so that s all sitting in working capital right now and you ll see considerably higher volumes here in q3 q4 on the commercial side of bell and then i mean that are smaller numbers but as you look at for instance the snow stuff right i mean we ve got all that stuff going in working capital right now we will produce all that stuff and sell that through mostly here in the third quarter the dirt side we re always going to have a little bit of some higher inventory carrying there because we need to be able to run the factory and do nothing but snow third quarter so we built up enough inventory to make sure that we can satisfy the demand in that channel as well so but again most of that the significant dollars are associated with longitude s and the bell ramp things like the snow going out i mean i think that s why we still feel quite comfortable with our initial guidance range for sure that is more back end loaded than we would like noah poponak goldman sachs analyst okay thank you scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer sure operator and next we have the line of ronald epstein bank of america please go ahead kristine liwag bank of america analyst hi good morning guys it s kristine liwag calling in for ron scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer good morning kristine liwag bank of america analyst scott safeaero just put out a press release that there is no financial impact for both of you from the contract termination on the hemisphere since the issue seems to be largely from engine performance i was wondering why there isn t more recourse for you from safeaero how is your contract different from your competitor that got a few hundred million dollars in penalties from them scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer well because we don t have a few hundred million dollars of penalty associated with it there was we do on a much smaller scale do r d sharing with some of our key suppliers and largely we have had again a very small relatively speaking number that s in there that s been supporting some of the r d it is a shared program so we ve had r d in it they have r d in it my understanding is they re going to look to continue to work the engine i mean if they can get that engine to its specifications it would be a great engine so i can appreciate that they would continue to make some investment as well but we just we don t deal in these kinds of massive programs to offset these things and frankly because there is not i mean it s size of the market there is not a volume that anybody would ever investor or put up that kind of a upfront end loaded payment or obligation kristine liwag bank of america analyst and when you think about that size aircraft in the market i mean the hemisphere was opposed to entering service sometime next year when you first initially rolled it out can you describe what s going on in that market environment today and is there demand for replacement of hemisphere type aircraft scott c donnelly chairman and chief executive officer well the decision point was to be to launch it this year so they are entry the service would have been out probably five years anyway before that we go into the market but it was intended to be an aircraft that go into fleets like netjets and obviously other retail customers that had a requirement to do that longer range again i mean the theory of where we were in that business was most of the large cabin manufacturers are going to ultra long haul and even longer range aircraft and there is still was a demand in a right place at the right price for the right performance capability for an aircraft that was more in that 4 500 nautical mile range and there really hadn t been a clean sheet new airplane in that space in a long time and that was what we thought the opportunity was because the challenge there is there is you need to have the right engine airplane combination and so that was always predicated on having that engine there and as i said there has been a lot of hard work there is been a lot of progress frankly that safeaero team has made it just was not yet able to demonstrate and we just had a timeline we need to step back here and commit resources in other places for now and the engine i guess there then we can revisit that kristine liwag bank of america analyst thank you for the color eric salander vice president of investor relations okay operator that does it for this call thank you everyone and you can reach me if you have any

a packet of u s five dollar bills is inspected at the bureau of engraving and printing in washington by andrea shalal washington reuters the international monetary fund said on wednesday the u s dollar was overvalued by 6 to 12 based on near term economic fundamentals while the euro the japanese yen and china s yuan were seen as broadly in line with fundamentals the imf has been at odds with u s president donald trump over his use of tariffs to resolve trade imbalances but its assessment that the dollar is overvalued is likely to give trump more fodder for his frequent complaints that dollar strength is hampering u s exports advertisement advertisement trump has railed against european and chinese policies that lead to what he calls a devaluation of the euro and other currencies against the dollar the fund s external sector report an annual assessment of currencies and external surpluses and deficits of major economies showed that current account surpluses remained centred in the euro area and other advanced economies such as singapore while deficits remained persistent in the united states britain and some emerging market economies the report said net creditor positions had increased again and were now at a historical peak of about 20 of global gross domestic product or about four times the level seen in the early 1990s net debtor positions were at a similar level the fund which has warned that the u s china trade war could cost the global economy about 455 billion next year said recent trade policy actions were weighing on global trade flows eroding confidence and disrupting investment but they had done nothing to reverse external imbalances thus far instead of tit for tat tariffs surplus and deficit countries should work to revive liberalization efforts and strengthen the rules based multilateral trading system that has been in effect for the past 75 years the imf said it is imperative that all countries avoid policies that distort trade imf chief economist gita gopinath told reporters higher tariffs have been associated with increased prices for consumers and are weighing on global trade investment and growth including by eroding confidence and disrupting global supply chains she repeated the fund s estimate that the tariffs applied in the u s china trade war could shave 0 5 off global economic growth in 2020 global trade growth was slowing which showed that the trade disputes were not simply causing manufacturers to shift production away from china as trump has claimed but that the overall trade system was suffering from the tariffs she said gopinath also noted that disputes over technology such as the u s decision to put chinese technology company huawei on its entity list could also fracture global supply chains raising concerns about investment and productivity companies on the entity list cannot buy parts and components from u s companies without government approval the fund said short term financing risks were generally contained since debtor positions were concentrated in reserve currency issuing economies but risks remained for the global economy an intensification of trade tensions or a disorderly brexit outcome with further repercussions for global growth and risk aversion could affect other economies that are highly dependent on foreign demand and external financing it said story continues countries with deficits like the united states and britain should pare back spending in a growth friendly manner while those with big surpluses like germany the netherlands and korea should boost public infrastructure investment and discourage excessive saving it said germany s current account surplus was excessive running about 4 to 5 larger than warranted luis cubeddu chief of the imf s research department told reporters there s a need to ease fiscal policy in germany there is fiscal space to do that he said urging spending on infrastructure while the report assessed the euro s valuation as appropriate for the euro zone as a whole it said the euro s real effective exchange rate was 8 to 18 too low for germany s fundamentals given its high current account surplus the report said that while china s yuan was broadly in line with its fundamentals imf models showed wide divergences with desired policies from an 11 5 undervaluation to an 8 5 percent overvaluation due to uncertainties over beijing s policy outlook gopinath said the imf had looked carefully at exchange rates but saw no evidence that changes had much impact on trade flows particularly in countries that invoiced trade in the u s dollar structural changes such as improving access to credit and better transportation infrastructure could be more useful in the short term she said reporting by andrea shalal editing by shri navaratnam and bernadette baum

97 in the second quarter of 2019 compared to 4 06 in the first quarter of 2019 and 3 94 in the 2018 second quarter compared to the 2019 first quarter compression in our margin was caused primarily by higher average interest rates on deposits and borrowings and slightly lower yields on loans due to lower libor interest rates credit quality metrics remain good and classified assets are at low levels we always anticipate that non performing asset totals will fluctuate from time to time as such in the second quarter we saw a modest increase in non performing loans which was primarily related to one

decreased nine basis points compared to the net interest margin of 4 06 in the three months ended march 31 2019 the increase in the margin from the prior year second quarter was primarily the result of increased yields in most loan categories and higher overall yields on investments and interest earning deposits at the federal reserve bank and an increase in the additional yield accretion recognized in conjunction with updated estimates of the fair value of the acquired loan pools compared to the prior year period significantly offset by an increase in the average interest rate on

compared to 3 73 for the six months ended june 30 2018 in october 2018 the company entered into an interest rate swap transaction as part of its ongoing interest rate management strategies to hedge the risk of its floating rate loans the notional amount of the swap is 400 million with a termination date in october 2025 under the terms of the swap the company receives a fixed rate of interest of 3 018 and pays a floating rate of interest equal to one month usd libor the floating rate resets monthly and net settlements of interest due to from the counterparty also occur monthly the initial floating rate of interest was set at 2 277 with monthly adjustments to the floating rate occurring after that time to the extent that the fixed rate continues to exceed one month usd libor the company will receive net interest settlements which will be recorded as loan interest income if one month usd libor exceeds the fixed rate of interest in future periods the company will be required to pay net settlements to the counterparty and will record those net payments as a reduction of interest income on loans the company recorded loan interest income related to this swap transaction of 568 000 and 1 1 million respectively in the three and six months ended june 30 2019 the company s net interest margin has been positively impacted by significant additional yield accretion recognized in conjunction with updated estimates of the fair value of the loan pools acquired in the fdic assisted transactions on an on going basis the company estimates the cash flows expected to be collected from the acquired loan pools for each of the loan portfolios acquired the cash flow estimates increased during the current and prior periods presented below based on payment histories and reduced credit loss expectations this resulted in increased income that has been spread on a level yield basis over the remaining expected lives of the loan pools and therefore has decreased over time additional estimated cash flows reclassification of discounts from non accretable to accretable totaling approximately 3 7 million and 5 3 million were recorded in the three and six months ended june 30 2019 respectively related to these loan pools the impact to income of adjustments on all portfolios acquired in fdic assisted transactions for the reporting periods presented is shown below three

yield adjustment that will affect interest income is 5 1 million of the remaining adjustments affecting interest income we expect to recognize 2 0 million of interest income during the remainder of 2019 additional adjustments may be recorded in future periods from the fdic assisted transactions as the company continues to estimate expected cash flows from the acquired loan pools excluding the impact of the additional yield accretion net interest margin for the three and six months ended june 30 2019 increased one and seven basis points respectively when compared to the year ago periods the increase in net interest margin in the three and six month periods is primarily due to increased yields in most loan categories and higher overall yields on investments and interest earning deposits at the federal reserve bank partially offset by an increase in the average interest rates on deposits and borrowings for additional information on net interest income components see the average

exempt investments and loans and the overall level of pre tax income the company s effective income tax rate is currently expected to continue to be less than the statutory rate due primarily to the

quarterly loan portfolio presentation available on the company s investor relations website under presentations provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses management records a provision for loan losses in an amount it believes is sufficient to result in an allowance for loan losses that will cover current net charge offs as well as risks believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio of the bank the amount of provision charged against current income is based on several factors including but not limited to past loss experience current portfolio mix actual and potential losses identified in the loan portfolio economic conditions and internal as well as external reviews the levels of non performing assets potential problem loans loan loss provisions and net charge offs fluctuate from period to period and are difficult to predict weak economic conditions higher inflation or interest rates or other factors may lead to increased losses in the portfolio and or requirements for an increase in loan loss provision expense management maintains various controls in an attempt to limit future losses such as a watch list of possible problem loans documented loan administration policies and loan review staff to review the quality and anticipated collectability of the portfolio additional procedures provide for frequent management review of the loan portfolio based on loan size loan type delinquencies financial analysis on going correspondence with borrowers and problem loan work outs management determines which loans are potentially uncollectible or represent a greater risk of loss and makes additional provisions to expense if necessary to maintain the allowance at a satisfactory level the provision for loan losses for the quarter ended june 30 2019 was 1 6 million compared with 2 0 million for the quarter ended june 30 2018 the provision for loan losses for the six months ended june 30 2019 was 3 6 million compared with 3 9 million for the

2018 respectively during the six months ended june 30 2019 1 6 million of the 2 7 million of net charge offs were in the consumer auto category in addition two unrelated commercial loan relationships were responsible for 560 000 of the total net charge offs during the first six months of 2019 in response to a more challenging consumer credit environment the company tightened its underwriting guidelines on automobile lending in the latter part of 2016 management took this step in an effort to improve credit quality in the portfolio and lower delinquencies and charge offs this action also resulted in a lower level of origination volume and as such the outstanding balance of the company s automobile loans continued to decline in the six months ended june 30 2019 we expect to see more rapid reductions in the automobile loan outstanding balance as we determined in february 2019 to cease providing indirect lending services to automobile dealerships at june 30 2019 indirect automobile loans totaled approximately 157 million we expect this total balance will be largely paid off in the next two to four years general market conditions and unique circumstances related to individual borrowers and projects contributed to the level of provisions and charge offs collateral and repayment evaluations of all assets categorized as potential problem loans non performing loans or foreclosed assets were completed with corresponding charge offs or reserve allocations made as appropriate in june 2017 the loss sharing agreements for inter savings bank were terminated in april 2016 the loss sharing agreements for team bank vantus bank and sun security bank were terminated loans acquired from the fdic related to valley bank did not have a loss sharing agreement all acquired loans were grouped into pools based on common characteristics and were recorded at their estimated fair values which incorporated estimated credit losses at the acquisition date these loan pools are systematically reviewed by the company to determine the risk of losses that may exceed those identified at the time of the acquisition techniques used in determining risk of loss are similar to those used to determine the risk of loss for the legacy great southern bank portfolio with most focus being placed on those loan pools which include the larger loan relationships and those loan pools which exhibit higher risk characteristics review of the acquired loan portfolio also includes review of financial information collateral valuations and customer interaction to determine if additional reserves are warranted the bank s allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans excluding fdic acquired loans was 0 97 0 98 and 0 97 at june 30 2019 december 31 2018 and march 31 2019 respectively management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover losses inherent in the bank s loan portfolio at june 30 2019 based on recent reviews of the bank s loan portfolio and current economic conditions if economic conditions were to deteriorate or management s assessment of the loan portfolio were to change it is possible that additional loan loss provisions would be required thereby adversely affecting future results of operations and financial condition asset quality former teambank vantus bank sun security bank interbank and valley bank non performing assets including foreclosed assets and potential problem loans are not included in the totals or in the discussion of non performing loans potential problem loans and foreclosed assets below these assets were initially recorded at their estimated fair values as of their acquisition dates and are accounted for in pools therefore these loan pools are analyzed rather than the individual loans the performance of the loan pools acquired in each of the five transactions has been better than expectations as of the acquisition dates as a result of changes in balances and composition of the loan portfolio changes in economic and market conditions and other factors specific to a borrower s circumstances the level of non performing assets will fluctuate non performing assets excluding all fdic assisted acquired assets at june 30 2019 were 15 9 million an increase of 4 1 million from 11 8 million at december 31 2018 and an increase of 5 6 million from 10 3 million at march 31 2019 non

español 中文 日本語 português following the global financial crisis overall current account surpluses and deficits fell sharply from about 6 percent of global gdp in 2007 to about 3 5 percent in 2013 since then as shown in our new external sector report global current account imbalances have declined only slightly to 3 percent of world gdp in 2018 while rotating toward advanced economies and away from emerging economies including china whose current account is now broadly in line with fundamentals trade actions and tensions have so far not significantly affected global current account imbalances as trade has been diverted to other countries with lower or no tariffs instead as highlighted in an earlier blog these trade tensions and related uncertainties are weighing on global investment and growth especially in sectors most integrated into global supply chains where production is carried out across multiple countries despite the narrowing of global current account imbalances stock imbalances measured as the sum of countries net foreign assets and liabilities have continued to increase as creditor countries have run surpluses and debtor countries have run deficits for the most part at 40 percent of gdp stock imbalances have reached a historical peak and are four times larger than in the early 1990s moreover gross external debt liabilities of sovereigns and corporates have risen sharply in some economies in recent years supported by benign global financing conditions this entails financial stability risks not only for borrowers in deficit countries but also savers in surplus countries trade actions and tensions have so far not significantly affected global current account imbalances having a proper understanding of countries external positions current accounts stock positions and currencies is critical to highlight policymakers shared responsibility to tackle external imbalances before they become too risky risks from external imbalances external imbalances are not necessarily a cause for concern as there are good reasons for countries to run deficits and surpluses at certain points in time for example it is natural for young fast growing economies to run deficits and borrow from aging advanced economies with weaker growth potential but just as over indebted households may lose access to credit if their earnings become insufficient to repay their debts economies that borrow too much and too quickly from abroad may become vulnerable to sudden stops in capital flows this would in turn negatively affect creditor economies as they would suffer losses on their external assets therefore the challenge lies in determining when they are excessive or pose a risk using a combination of numerical tools and country specific insights we estimate that about 35 45 percent of overall current account surpluses and deficits were excessive in 2018 excessive current account surpluses remained centered in the euro area driven largely by germany and the netherlands and in other smaller advanced asian economies korea and singapore while excessive current account deficits remained concentrated in the united kingdom the united states and some emerging market economies argentina and indonesia after many years of excess current account surpluses china s external position moved to become more broadly in line with fundamentals in 2018 this decline reflected a combination of structural factors and expansionary credit and fiscal policies but also greater exchange rate flexibility and the associated real appreciation over the last decade risks from the current configuration of external imbalances are generally contained at least in the near term as current account deficits and debtor positions are largely concentrated in advanced economies that issue reserve currencies that said not everyone is immune an intensification of trade or geopolitical tensions with negative repercussions for global growth and risk appetite could affect economies that are highly dependent on foreign demand or external financing over the medium term in the absence of corrective policies to reduce imbalances trade tensions could become entrenched moreover a further increase in countries external debts in key countries could trigger costly disruptive adjustments that could spill over to the rest of the world that s why both surplus and deficit countries must work together to reduce excess global imbalances in a manner supportive of global growth and stability how to tackle imbalances many countries are now near full employment and have limited room to maneuver in their public budgets so governments need to carefully calibrate their policies to achieve domestic and external objectives countries with excess current account deficits like the united kingdom and the united states should adopt or continue with growth friendly fiscal consolidation while those with excess current account surpluses like germany and korea should use fiscal space to boost public infrastructure investment and potential growth moreover carefully tailored and sequenced structural policies should play a more prominent role in tackling external imbalances while boosting domestic potential growth reforms that encourage investment and discourage excessive saving for example through the removal of entry barriers or stronger social safety nets would support external rebalancing in excess current account surplus countries reforms that improve productivity and workers skill base are appropriate to promote exports in countries with excess current account deficits even economies with external positions that we assess to be broadly in line with fundamentals like china and japan need to adopt policies that address domestic imbalances and prevent a resurgence of external imbalances this requires structural reforms that facilitate competition in sectors like services exchange rate flexibility remains key to facilitating external adjustment as highlighted in this year s analytical chapter varying features of international trade including the extent of integration into global value chains and trade invoicing in a dominant currency like the us dollar can weaken some mechanisms of external adjustment and limit the benefits of exchange rate flexibility in the short term so exchange rate flexibility may need to be supported with other policies that bolster the export response including through improved access to credit and transportation infrastructure allowing exchange rates to play their role however remains key to deliver durable medium term rebalancing more generally all countries should avoid policies that distort trade as they tend to come at the expense of global trade investment and growth instead surplus and deficit countries should work toward reviving international trade and strengthening the rules of the multilateral trading system that have served the global economy well over the past 75 years

i spend a lot of time on the phone with congressional candidates trying to figure out who to believe and who not to believe how progressive are they how courageous how capable it didn t take much of a discussion to figure out aoc was going to be a super star if she ever beat joe crowley which seemed impossible to everyone but her and her posse but she beat him and she s a superstar sometimes we get disappointed i talked so much about how great jared golden me would be but did he ever turn out to be a dud i got that all wrong rashida tlaib somehow just tasting her mother s cooking plus glimpsing at her record in the michigan state legislature made it clear exactly what kind of a congresswoman she was going to be and she is it makes it so much easier when candidates are already where they have to be and don t need persuading yesterday jeremy gantz noted in his piece for here s where the 2020 candidates stand on labor that democrats have a history of empty promises when it comes to bolstering unions and workers rights amen brother he then asks and tries to answer who can be trusted in 2020 he noted that during the primaries democratic presidential candidates have always made a point of showing up at union halls and playing up ties to working people it s one of the first pages in the democratic political playbook biden officially started his campaign at a teamsters banquet hall in pittsburgh announcing he is a union man warren kicked off her campaign at the site of the historic 1912 textile workers bread and roses strike in lawrence mass klobuchar and sen cory booker n j mention union members in their extended family while speaking to union audiences but historically what comes next is what gantz calls a pivot to the center during the general election after fighting for union endorsements during primary season the democratic nominee zeroes in on swing voters taking union voters for granted even as unions send a door to door army to get out the vote labor has been a core part of the democratic party s coalition going back to the great depression does anyone have to guess that that will be union man joe biden but who can working families actually trust and believe eighty years later in 2016 something changed donald trump had the best gop presidential candidate performance with union households since 1984 trailing hillary clinton by only 8 percentage points in 2012 mitt romney trailed barack obama in this demographic by 18 points all of which raises the question are democrats losing labor as a reliable constituency dems can still count on union endorsements to be sure but with trump attacking from the left on free trade support from white male union members who still make up a plurality of the movement s members is up for grabs this uncertainty was born of neglect since the 1970s as the country s industrial base withered and unionbusting flourished democrats in washington have done little to reverse the labor movement s decline under presidents jimmy carter bill clinton and barack obama union money and organizing muscle helped deliver control of congress and the white house to democrats each time the party failed to pass labor law reform that would have empowered workers and bolstered the movement in 2016 the party paid an electoral price for their waywardness this time around will candidates do more than pander during the primaries public support for labor is at a 15 year high especially among young people women and college graduates nearly half a million workers were part of a strike or lockout last year the highest figure since 1986 might we finally see democrats place unions at the heart of their political agenda it s far fetched but conceivable candidates know they can no longer take union votes for granted more significantly the center of gravity on labor and economic issues has moved left there s this sense now that we have a big problem of inequality and capitalism run amok says nelson lichtenstein a history professor at university of california santa barbara where he directs the center for the study of work labor and democracy that s clear on the democratic side but what is the solution is it about taxation or is it vitalization of the union movement that latter idea has become more understood in some ways candidates rush to the left makes it harder to discern just how deeply committed they are to strengthening unions everyone always says they want to rebuild the middle class who really wants to rebuild the labor movement if you zero in on the protecting the right to organize pro act the answer appears to be most of the leading candidates co sponsored by 40 senators and 100 members of the house the pro act offers a litany of labor law reforms the larger context here is that the united states has among the weakest workers rights protections of any industrialized country on par with myanmar pakistan and ethiopia over the past 40 years employers have aggressively fought unionization through perfectly legal tactics like captive audience meetings when workers must sit and listen to anti union presentations or the sometimes legal firing of striking workers the pro act would strengthen the right to organize and strike by among other things eliminating so called right to work laws banning permanent strike replacements legalizing secondary boycotts and picketing and broadening the definition of employee to include many current independent contractors compared to the employee free choice act efca the reform law pushed by the labor movement during the 2008 election cycle that ultimately died in the senate the pro act is a progressive smorgasbord but the pro act does fall short of efca in one significant regard while efca enabled workers to organize through a majority sign up process card check the pro act only requires card check if an employer is found to have violated labor law during a failed union election every current senator running for president backs the bill with multiple leading candidates able to point to a history of support for unions today s democratic field stands in stark contrast to the 2016 primary with its binary choice of establishment liberal hillary clinton versus change agent bernie sanders nearly all unions endorsed clinton many early on rankling rank and file sanders supporters this time around unions are in no hurry to back a candidate only the international association of fire fighters has done so biden got the nod the american federation of teachers aft the national education association and others have unveiled new endorsement approaches to more deeply engage both candidates and members and one assumes to close any perceived distance between the wishes of the rank and file and executive boards there s intensity for a bunch of candidates this time says randi weingarten president of the aft the union endorsed clinton in july 2015 and poured 1 7 million into her campaign and pro clinton pacs heartburn from the calamitous 2016 election appears to be giving the union endorsement process a dose of democracy as millions of union members decide who to back they ll be wrestling with the question of which candidate would most effectively fight for their interests because the leading democratic candidates are staking out similar ground to make their case it s important to look at the candidates records how central the union movement is to their theory of change and what unilateral actions they would be willing to embrace as president should congress fail to act this much is clear across the democratic primary field raising the federal minimum wage to 15 and taxing the rich have become table stakes all the leading candidates biden booker buttigieg harris former rep beto o rourke texas sanders warren support both beyond those two issues the top of the field is replete with differences big and small it s easy to sort out where candidates stand on a raft of proposed legislation it s harder to know what they would try to do for the labor movement if all those proposals become moot which will be the case should the gop hold the senate biden is an old pro at signaling he s a fighter for the union cause but it s hard to find an example of him sticking his neck out for workers in may biden held a fundraiser at the los angeles home of a board member of kaiser foundation hospitals a subsidiary of healthcare giant kaiser permanente the national union of healthcare workers nuhw which has a longstanding dispute with kaiser in california over mental health staffing levels called on biden to cancel the event they never heard back says nuhw president sal rosselli nuhw members protested outside the house but biden went into the event and didn t even talk to our folks rosselli says that s very disappointing biden also didn t endear himself to the labor movement by voting for nafta and supporting the trans pacific partnership tpp trade agreement both of which unions opposed biden did support efca as a senator but has not committed to the pro act and his campaign did not respond to a request for comment in contrast the leading presidential candidates from the senate have been out front on labor law reform sanders has been pushing the workplace democracy act wda for decades beginning as a congressman in 1992 which is co sponsored by booker harris and warren the wda can be seen as a forerunner of the pro act it also legalizes secondary boycotting stops companies from delaying a first contract with workers and gives bargaining rights to many workers who are currently classified as independent contractors unlike the pro act it would let all workers unionize via card check as a matter of course sanders method has been persistence he reintroduced the wda throughout the 1990s in the house then brought new versions into the senate in 2015 and 2018 as with other issues such as medicare for all the democratic party has now caught up to him it took sanders years to earn the backing of any national union they didn t flock to him when he first ran for congress in 1988 but came around after he won congressional campaigns in the early 1990s today sanders remains as outspoken as ever about the power of unions they live at the heart of his agenda the trade union movement is the last line of defense against a corporate agenda that not only wants tax breaks for billionaires but wants to privatize social security medicare and medicaid sanders told in these times via email we must strengthen unions and bargaining rights of workers everywhere it s not hard to imagine the other leading candidates saying something similar indeed most have before crowds of union members it s sanders long record of actually supporting labor actions that makes him stand out political candidates love to call their campaigns a movement and sanders is no exception but it feels less cliched when a campaign actively urges supporters to join protests around the country like those held by university of california campus workers and delta air lines flight attendants what bernie is doing is very very unique lichtenstein says the most radical thing in this campaign cycle that s happened is bernie using his email list to get people to picket lines and protests in march sanders staffers became the first presidential campaign staff to unionize starting a trend castro s campaign staff followed in may and warren s team did so in june the candidates each publicly supported the union efforts every worker who wants to join a union bargain collectively make their voice heard should have a chance to do so warren tweeted unlike sanders warren can t point to decades of direct solidarity work with the labor movement but the two new england senators share much in common yes warren has called herself capitalist to my bones while sanders keeps trumpeting his democratic socialism but both have new deal liberalism deep in their blood including the sense that worker empowerment is vital to economic justice and they broadly agree that american capitalism needs structural change warren s accountable capitalism act is a good example introduced in the senate in 2018 the bill would empower employees to elect at least 40 of board members at large u s companies this new board could then in theory push management to do something about yawning pay disparities between the c suite and average workers for sanders part he unveiled plans in may to boost employee ownership of corporations and attended a walmart shareholders meeting in june at the request of united for respect a workers rights group to support a resolution to require walmart to put hourly employees on its board both senators want to do more than tinker around the edges of neoliberalism this perspective and a willingness to call out the rich as an enemy along class lines is what sets them apart from their primary season peers strengthening america s labor unions will be a central goal of my administration warren told in these times via email for too long a worker s right to unionize has been under attack the rich and powerful have teamed up with the republican party to push for measures at all levels of government designed to decimate unions and collective bargaining warren says she wants to modernize our labor laws for the 21st century noting various reforms included in the pro act and that she would fight for fully portable benefits for everyone and make sure that all work full time part time gig carries basic pro rata benefits she also wants to push to amend federal law so the president and federal courts cannot enjoin lawful strikes that pose a threat to national health or safety far too often these injunctions have been invoked in strikes not because there is a genuine threat to national health or safety but rather to curb the power of unions engaging in lawful strikes she says this attitude has endeared warren to the labor movement she spoke in las vegas at the service employees international union seiu and center for american progress action fund s national forum on wages and working people in april along with a handful of other candidates we need more power in the hands of employees she said the washington post reported the crowd gave her its most passionate response jane mcalevey a former union organizer and author of no shortcuts organizing for power in the new gilded age says that getting a sympathetic democrat in the white house is only the first step the next mcalevey says is a massive wave of strikes the relationship between direct action power and creating a crisis with a democrat in the white house is the missing link so often in this discussion mcalevey says the labor movement should back a candidate who will restore the fundamental constitutional right to strike as the pro act effectively would and commit to never calling out federal troops on striking workers we need a candidate who commits to defending the right of workers to be on strike and using the full resources of the federal government to aid workers in re claiming some of what s deserved by the working class nothing like that has been seen in the united states since the 1930s when fdr first entered the white house and waves of strikes followed the backdrop was the great depression short of another crisis far reaching strikes are far fetched but one thing is clear enough waiting for democrats to lead the labor movement out of decline is a losing strategy

reit rankings industrial in our reit rankings series we introduce and update readers to each of the commercial and residential real estate sectors we rank reits within the sectors based on both common and unique valuation metrics presenting investors with numerous options that fit their own investing style and risk return objectives we update these rankings every quarter with new developments for existing readers we encourage readers to follow our seeking alpha page click follow at the top to continue to stay up to date on our reit rankings weekly recaps and analysis on the reit and broader real estate sector industrial reit sector overview industrial reits comprise roughly 10 of the broad based real estate etfs vnq and iyr within the hoya capital industrial reit index we track all thirteen industrial reits which account for roughly 100 billion in market value prologis pld duke dre liberty lpt americold cold first industrial fr ps business parks psb eastgroup egp rexford rexr stag stag terreno trno monmouth mnr industrial logistics ilpt and innovative industrials iipr investors looking to invest in the sector through a pure play etf can do so through the pacer benchmark industrial reit etf inds once thought to be a boring real estate sector destined for chronic underperformance industrial real estate has been on fire for the last half decade demand for industrial space has been relentless primarily driven by the rapid growth of e commerce and the need for speed in goods distribution amazonâ s push to two day and same day delivery has sparked a supply chain â arms raceâ among retailers and logistics providers of all sizes where itâ s all about supply chain densification consumers and businesses alike are demanding ever shortening delivery windows necessitating the densification of supply chain networks and the establishment of distribution hubs closer to end consumers outside of amazon amzn we think that industrial reits are perhaps best positioned to capitalize on the continued growth of e commerce enjoying better competitive dynamics than third party logistics providers like fedex fdx ups ups and xpo xpo that face a higher potential disintermediation risk from amazon itself industrial reits own roughly 5 10 of total industrial real estate assets in the united states but own a higher relative percentage of higher value distribution focused assets with building sizes averaging around 200 000 square feet industrial reits and have enjoyed some of the most favorable supply demand fundamentals across the real estate sector over the past half decade e commerce sales still represent just a small fraction of total retail sales but roughly half of the incremental growth in retail sales over the past three years has come from e commerce importantly e commerce is far less efficient than brick and mortar from an industrial space usage perspective each dollar spent on e commerce requires roughly three times more logistics space than the equivalent brick and mortar dollar according to estimates from prologis according to our estimates e commerce still accounts for less than 20 of total at risk retail categories but is taking market share from these sectors at a rate of roughly 1 per year importantly it s not just amazon that is growing their e commerce business the traditional brick and mortar powerhouses have honed the omnichannel approach with significant success as walmart wmt target tgt and costco cost have been among the biggest investors in e commerce distribution over the last three years the bull bear case for industrial reits industrial reits continue to enjoy perhaps the strongest property level fundamentals across the real estate sector demand has outpaced supply growth in each of the past nine years and has shown few signs of slowing as we ll discuss in greater detail below re leasing spreads actually accelerated last quarter to the strongest rate in more than a decade at more than 10 indicative of a substantial and mounting shortage of industrial real estate space and substantial pricing power enjoyed by real estate owners same store noi growth which chronically lagged the broader reit average for more than a decade before 2014 has been among the strongest in the real estate sector since that time while supply growth has been robust over the past half decade as well there are mounting signs that lack of available land is becoming a larger hurdle for new development strong share price performance across the industrial sector over the past twelve months has also restored a sizable nav premium for industrial reits giving these companies a cost of capital advantage relative to fuel accretive acquisition fueled external growth to that point size and scale have proven to be an important competitive advantage for industrial reits and we think the importance of this will only increase over time as amazon becomes a more aggressive and concentrated power in the logistics space below we outline the five primary reasons that investors are bullish on the industrial reit sector not all investors are quite so bullish on the industrial reit space however an excellent recent report from the chilton reit team discussed some reasons to be cautious about the long term competitive dynamics of the industrial reit sector death by amazon has been the mantra across the retail sector but amazon s push into logistics and the potential negative impact on industrial reit pricing power shouldn t be ignored the chilton reit team highlights the heavy reliance on amazon fueled business across the sector and the potential for the e commerce giant to disintermediate the industrial real estate space just as they are disintermediating the third party logistics providers one step up the supply chain amazon third party logistics 3pl aspirations have hit the share prices of xpo ups and fedex but they are also a risk for the large big box industrial reits source chilton reit team with a fleet of more than 20 000 delivery vans 500 semi trucks and 50 airplanes amazon clearly has its sights set on becoming a logistics powerhouse on a scale that will almost undoubtedly rival incumbents fedex and ups the company has shifted its retail offerings towards the far higher margin third party marketplace model which now accounts for more than two thirds of its retail sales according to research firm emarketer naturally assuming more of a logistics role through the marketplace model amazon now accounts for nearly half of total e commerce retail sales according to emarketer s estimates considering the massive presence of amazon there s risk to industrial reits that they will increasingly dictate the terms of the relationship interestingly a risk also shared by the data center reit sector additionally warehouse users are increasingly focusing on technologies to improve the efficiency and utilization of existing space given the relatively large supply pipeline the sector remains more exposed than most to an unexpected economic downturn for a valuation perspective a common theme over the past several years valuations across traditional metrics like ffo share for industrial reits remain lofty below we outline the five reasons that investors are bearish on the sector industrial reit fundamentals while long term competitive dynamics are uncertain across nearly every sector in the age of amazon there s little question that industrial reits are currently enjoying some of the best property level fundamentals across the reit sector already priced for perfection 1q19 earnings were seemingly even better than perfect as more than half the sector beat noi and leasing estimates year over year releasing spreads averaged more than 10 the best rate in more than a decade same store noi topped 5 4 in the quarter among the sample of eight reits we track most closely while occupancy climbed higher to 96 7 within shouting distance of record highs after growing at a 9 rate in 2017 us industrial rents rose another 8 in 2018 according to prologis stronger than the 6 global average behind this demand growth prologis sees a greater willingness to pay for quality space as e commerce the need to be close to consumers and rising consumer expectations around speed and product availability are pushing a mandate for quality the company expects continued rent growth in 2019 and mounting barriers to supply growth in the urban infill markets full year guidance was similarly strong with five out of the eight reits raising full year same store noi estimates after just one quarter 2q19 earnings season begins this week with prologis reporting earnings on tuesday absent a significant trade war related slowdown in the second half of this year the sector is on pace to potentially match or exceed the 5 0 same store noi growth level which would be the fourth straight year of exceeding that mark as we pointed out last quarter full occupancy is a good problem to have but it does mean that future same store growth must come exclusively from rental rate growth despite supply growth that has averaged nearly 2 per year since 2015 occupancy reached a new record high at the end of 2017 and remain above 96 throughout 2018 according to nareit t tracker data in their 1q19 report prologis research notes â as of q1 â 19 most logistics real estate markets remain capacity constrained meaning that customers are waiting for new supply to come online in order to expand their distribution networks prologis research sees this pent up demand reflected in a high proportion of built to suit projects and strong pre leasing in the construction pipeline as a result demand and supply should remain roughly in line through 2019 keeping the vacancy rate near its historic low of 4 5 and putting further upward pressure on rental rates in addition to robust organic growth industrial reits continue to benefit from the added tailwind of external growth primarily fueled by internal development after trading at a slight nav discount early in 2018 the recent reit rally has allowed industrial reits to regain the coveted nav premium which is critical for further accretive external growth despite rising construction and land costs development yields remain favorable according to nareit data the industrial reit development pipeline ended 1q19 above 6 6b retreating slightly from 10 year highs set in 4q18 again there are indications that a lack of available land as well as rising construction costs and tight construction labor markets may be constraining factors on new development that said supply growth is still likely to average nearly 2 per year in 2019 and 2020 towards the higher end of the reit sector these reits continue to see more value add opportunities in ground up development compared to acquisitions and see development yields at roughly 6 8 compared to cap rates between 4 6 as a result industrial reits were net sellers in each of the past three years but became net buyers for the first time in a while in 1q19 driven by the widening nav premium accretive acquisition opportunities have emerged over the past several months that did not exist at this time last year highlighted perfectly by prologis just announced 4b acquisition talks regarding non traded reit industrial properties trust that hit the wires just as we typed this piece we think 2019 will see more private to public m a activity given the premium cost of equity capital conditions enjoyed by these reits among real estate sectors industrial reits were perhaps most positively impacted by the economic surprises from the start of 2016 through mid 2018 aided by corporate tax reform and deregulation combined with the continued secular tailwind from e commerce driven supply chain densification demand for warehouse space has historically shown a high correlation with several economic indicators reflected in the prologis ibi activity index pmi retail sales job growth and inventories all of which inflected higher in 2018 but have slowed over the past two quarters amid a slowdown in global economic growth and trade related headwinds industrial real estate demand has seemingly been unaffected so far by these headwinds but investors will be closely monitoring earnings commentary from industrial reits as well as third party logistics firms for signs of cracks in the near term demand outlook recent long term share price performance it wasn t always this way for industrial reit investors but the last half decade has been quite kind to patient investors and those who were willing to pay up for the premium valuations awarded to the industrial reit sector since the start of 2016 no major real estate sector has outmatched the performance of industrial reits outperforming the broader reit index by a cumulative 50 during this time despite trading at valuation premiums for most of this time the sector has outperformed the reit average in three straight years outdone only by the four year outperformance streak of the cell tower sector and the remarkable six year streak delivered by the manufactured housing sector after dipping 3 last year the sector is back to it s winning ways in 2019 with the hoya capital industrial reit index jumping more than 34 second only to the single family rental sector s 35 ytd gains meanwhile the broader reit averages have climbed roughly 20 almost perfectly in line with the 20 gain on the s p 500 spy the broader reit sector has benefited by receding interest rates and a return of goldilocks economic conditions of low inflation and slow but solid domestic economic growth the under the radar story in the industrial reit sector this year has been the staggeringly strong performance by cannabis focused innovative industrial which has seen its share price more than double this year outside of that high flyer rexford and terreno have been the top performers each climbing more than 40 ytd while industrial sector stalwart prologis has delivered a solid 37 ytd gain monmouth and industrial logistics have been the laggards on the year apart from those two laggards the other eleven reits are higher by at least 20 ytd industrial reit valuations as they have for most of the past five years industrial reits continue to trade at a sizable free cash flow aka affo fad cad premiums to the reit averages according to our estimates when we factor in two year growth expectations in our fcf g metric however the sector appears more attractively valued during this run of outperformance we note that growth has generally been chronically undervalued underscored by strong performance in the e reit sectors industrial data center and cell towers during this time value has generally underperformed underscored by weak relatively performance from the retail reit sector industrial reit dividend yields based on dividend yield industrial reits rank below the reit average paying an average forward yield of 2 7 note that our reit average is skewed lower by our coverage universe which generally excludes externally managed and small cap reits under 1b in market capitalization industrial reits pay out roughly 80 of their available cash flow leaving a decent cushion for development fueled growth and future dividend increases within the sector we note the varying strategies of the thirteen industrial reits stag monmouth and industrial logistics which are generally popular with yield focused investors pay the highest yield but does so through allocating a higher share of free cash flow towards dividend payments and taking on higher debt levels than the other lower yielding names in the sector how macroeconomics impact industrial reits compared to other reit sectors industrial reits are not particularly sensitive to interest rates and generally respond more closely to movements in the equity markets industrial leases have an average term of around 4 years roughly average among reit sectors and the majority of leases are structured on a net lease basis meaning tenants assume most or all property level operating expenses property taxes are the most significant operating expense accounting for 50 or more of total expenses leases range from as short as two years to as long as fifteen years in general longer lease terms and the use of net lease terms are typically associated with higher levels of interest rate sensitivity we separate reits into three categories yield reits growth reits and hybrid reits in general the sector falls into the hybrid category with a blend of growth like and yield like features as noted above investors should understand the different distribution strategies employed by each of these firms with some firms focusing on long term growth while others prioritize near term dividend distributions bottom line prime time for industrial reits amazonâ s push to two day and same day delivery has sparked a supply chain â arms raceâ among retailers and logistics providers of all sizes where itâ s all about supply chain densification riding the e commerce wave industrial reit performance has been relentless over the past half decade consumers increasingly demand speedy delivery and retailers need industrial reits to deliver it what trade war despite continued uncertainty over trade and its impact on the supply chain the secular tailwinds driven by domestic e commerce has overwhelmed trade related headwinds so far this year last quarter s earnings results indicated that the best may be yet to come leasing spreads jumped nearly 12 while the acquisition pipeline has re opened given reit s favorable cost of capital death by amazon has been the mantra for the retail industry but amazon s push into logistics and the potential negative impact on pricing power shouldn t be ignored we remain overweight the industrial reit sector noting that while long term competitive dynamics may shift unfavorably over time and that there are near term pressures from slowing global growth the massive long term secular tailwinds of supply chain densification may still be in the relatively early innings also affected by amazon but unlike the data center sector where barriers to entry are uncertain and the supply picture could be dramatically altered by technology the availability of land near major population centers and transportation hubs has more defined limits sharing similar supply demand dynamics as the us housing sector we see robust demand continuing well into the 2020s while total supply remains constrained leading to continued upward pressure on rents if you enjoyed this report be sure to follow our page to stay up to date on the latest developments in the housing and

solomon chairman and chief executive officer thanks heather and thanks everyone for joining us this morning i m very happy to be here with you let me begin on page one we reported second quarter 2019 revenues of 9 5 billion down slightly versus last year but nonetheless reflecting solid franchise performance amid a mixed operating environment net earnings were 2 4 billion resulting in earnings per share of 5 81 all in we posted a return on equity of 11 1 and a return on tangible equity of 11 7 our business performed well and remain solidly positioned for future growth in investment banking we ranked number one in global announced and completed m a and number one in global equity underwritings year to date our equity market making business delivered its second highest quarter in four years and our franchise continues to generate broad based market share gains across regions we produced the highest quarterly i l revenues in eight years aided by significant gains from our private equity investment investing activities reflecting our ability to source opportunities for the firm and our clients and record net interest income in debt i l which annualizes to 3 5 billion lastly our assets under supervision increased by over 60 billion so another record of 1 7 trillion turning to page two our second quarter results were generated in an operating backdrop that presented both opportunities and challenges this quarter perhaps more than others reflected changing market sentiment in each of the three component months against the shift in sentiment we continue to witness relatively solid underlying economic fundamentals this year we expect real gdp growth of approximately 2 5 in the us and 3 4 globally european growth remains a bit more subdued at about 1 5 as recently reported china is running in the low 6 range slower than it has been in many years but still supportive of global growth all in while slowing the global macro backdrop remains broadly constructive the strong fundamentals that prevailed across markets were nonetheless overshadowed for most of the second quarter by geopolitical uncertainty client activity in april l turned quiet amid low volatility particularly in fixed income markets conditions in may deteriorated as geopolitical events caused significant shift in risk appetite fears of expanding trade wars draw concerns that new tariffs in china and mexico would erode the prospect for continued growth in response equity volatility there increased global markets turned risk off the us yield curve inverted and client activity slowed across a variety of products as our corporate and investor clients stayed on the sideline the trade issues also catalyzed concern among global central banks prompting dovishness with the bank of japan and the ecb emphasizing potential further stimulus and the us markets now anticipating multiple fed rate cuts this year the articulated dovish sentiment spurred a relief rally and increased client optimism and activity albeit late in the quarter this set up june to be a stronger backdrop to close out the quarter the market sentiment of june has continued through today we ve seen a pause in the us china trade war accommodative views from central banks and a continued march upward in global equity markets credit financing markets remain open and strategic transactions are getting announced as we look ahead we remain cautious on the geopolitical front but optimistic given the resiliency of global markets importantly our clients long term needs for advice financing and access to markets endure across cycles switching gears i d like to provide some insights on two important strategic decisions we made in the second quarter and our alternatives and wealth management businesses first on alternatives which is our core strength for goldman sachs for the past 30 years we recently completed an internal reorganization of our investing activities across the firm more specifically we have realigned our special situations group real estate merchant banking and several other investing platforms under common merchant banking business we have a world class investing franchise with a strong track record unique sourcing and execution capabilities and long standing relationships with the largest institutional investors going forward excuse me going forward these teams will operate across four asset classes private equity growth equity private credit and real estate by bringing together our investment professionals we will accelerate our ability to raise significant third party capital we expect this change will enable us to generate more durable recurring fee based revenues over time this will be a transition and we are mindful in protecting the revenue potential of these businesses as we grow third party assets second we announced plans to acquire united capital a registered investment advisor with approximately 25 billion in assets under supervision 220 advisors and 90 offices around the country united capital represents a key step forward toward our long term strategic goal of providing comprehensive wealth management services to individuals across the wealth spectrum upon closing the transaction today united capital will become a powerful complement to our ayco business our leading financial executive counseling and investment advisory business it serves many of the largest corporations in the united states we are excited about the incremental scale that united capital brings allowing us to serve a broader set of wealth management clients on a combined basis ayco and united capital will serve clients with over 80 billion of assets under supervision representing a strong base from which to grow our mass affluent wealth franchise it remains ambitious it remains our ambition to continue to serve ultra high net worth individuals through our long standing pwm business individuals with 1 million to 5 million of investable assets to ayco and the broader mass affluent segment through a hybrid of digital and human engagement as an extension of markets over time before turning the call over to stephen i would like to spend a moment on the recent federal reserve stress test results released in late june which showed bank s ability to withstand over 400 billion of stress losses overall the industry fared well in this year s examination from where i sit the results of the stress test clearly demonstrate the overall safety and soundness of the us financial system we also appreciate the ongoing efforts to increase the transparency of the test and very much agree with the fed s overall assessment of the us banking system is sufficiently well capitalized to support the economy even after a severe shock turning specifically to our performance on the 2019 ccar examination as you no doubt are aware we disclosed the federal reserve did not object to our plan of up to 8 8 billion of capital return including a 47 increase in our quarterly common stock dividend this change reflects the board and management s view that dividend growth is a critical component to delivering strong shareholder returns and reflects our progress over recent years increasing more durable fee based revenues to support the higher dividend lastly i would like to briefly touch on our strategic communication plan over the coming quarters importantly we continue to work toward providing a strategic update this coming january and will share a specific date once confirm this update will include the financial targets for the firm to which we will hold ourselves accountable and a broader review of our business strategy with that i will turn it over to stephen to walk through the results in each of our businesses stephen m scherr executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks david let s run through the numbers let me begin on page three of the presentation as david mentioned the environment in the second quarter turned out to be mix against this backdrop we continue to serve our clients and focus on executing on our strategic priorities let s run through the numbers in detail moving on to page four investment banking produced net revenues of 1 9 billion up 3 versus the first quarter and down 9 versus a robust year ago quarter financial advisory revenues of 776 million were down 3 versus last year during the quarter we participated in announced transactions of approximately 465 billion and closed on 235 billion of deal volume contributing to our number one m a league table rankings year to date client dialogues remain healthy and we are seeing momentum across sectors including tmt healthcare and notably financials which had been rather dormant for a number of years moving to underwriting equity underwriting net revenues of 482 million improved significantly versus the first quarter which experienced the government shutdown and held roughly flat versus a strong quarter last year year to date we ranked number one globally in equity underwriting supported by 16 billion of deal volume across over 100 transactions this quarter we held leadership roles in bringing many notable companies to the public markets during the quarter including uber avantor pinterest and slack turning to debt underwriting net revenues were 605 million down 20 from a year ago the second quarter last year included a number of significant contributions from investment grade and leverage finance activity which did not repeat to the same extent this quarter our deal flows in this quarter were consistent with trends across the industry which reflected materially lower volumes in the loan market and lower activity in acquisition related financings particularly with financial sponsors nonetheless our franchise remains well positioned with our high yield league table rank rising to the number two spot year to date further reflecting our competitive strength our investment banking backlog decreased slightly versus the end of the first quarter as we monetized a portion of our pipeline through the completion of several large equity underwritings nonetheless our backlog increased sequentially in both advisory and debt underwriting and while markets can change quickly we are optimistic that our clients will remain active in executing strategic transactions in the coming quarters given healthy levels of client dialog and continued needs to access financing markets moving to institutional client services on page five net revenues were solid at 3 5 billion in the second quarter down 3 versus last year as our diversified business experienced low client activity in ficc offset by strength in equities ficc client execution net revenues were 1 5 billion in the second quarter down 13 year over year reflecting both the mixed operating environment and generally lower client activity despite notable strength in europe overall the opportunity set presented in the second quarter prove more challenging versus a year ago specifically we saw lower volumes in our macro businesses amid low volatility and shifting client sentiment relative to last year client activity in rates and currencies including emerging markets was more subdued as trade and tariff concerns more than economic data drove sentiment and constrained client engagement uncertainty during the quarter around the timing and magnitude of anticipated rate cuts by the fed was also a contributing factor as tariff threats lessened and the direction of rates became more apparent we saw improved client activity particularly late in the quarter in currencies both implied and realized volatility in major fx pairs stood at historic lows throughout the quarter resulting in very low activity levels among our clients commodities performance by contrast was a positive results increased year over year and solid contributions from our investor products oil gas and power businesses in our micro businesses we saw lower activity in credit but better results in mortgages in credit issuance activity and our inventory levels were down relative to a year ago as investors remain more cautious following the spread widening experienced at the end of 2018 and grew more discerning in credit exposure selection we saw lower structured finance client activity versus a year ago while flows in credit came alongside from a more muted origination backdrop particularly in investment grade debt and leverage loans as i had mentioned earlier separately mortgage revenues increased amid better performance the environment notwithstanding and as i have said previously we are investing heavily to automate our workflows serve our clients electronically monitor our cost base and deliver structured solutions in capital efficient formats turning to equities on page six net revenues for the second quarter were 2 billion up 14 sequentially and up 6 versus a year ago we believe our success reflects our continuing consolidation of global market share and a dedication to serving clients across a full suite of cash derivatives and prime services in both high touch and low touch channels equities client execution net revenues of 772 million increased 13 relative to the first quarter and were up 12 versus a year ago results were aided by stronger performance in both cash and derivatives versus the second quarter of 2018 net revenues from commissions and fees were 777 million up 9 sequentially aided by strength in emea we also continue to grow market share in low touch execution security services net revenues of 458 million rose 24 sequentially and 5 year over year sequential improvement was driven by seasonal trends and a rebound in average client balances as sentiments improved moving to investing lending on page seven collectively our activities in i l produced net revenues of 2 5 billion in the second quarter equity securities generated robust net revenues of 1 5 billion driven by company specific events like ipos and the performance of corporates in the portfolio contributing to revaluations second quarter results were up 20 versus a year ago primarily reflecting higher net gains from public equities as you can see on the slide approximately 25 of our net revenues were from real estate and 75 were from our corporate investments within the corporate portfolio nearly half of the performance came from investments that went public during the quarter these results included a gain of approximately 375 million from the ipo of tradeweb our investment in tradeweb which we ve owned since 2008 was accounted for under the equity method given our significant influence at the time of the investment as a consequence we did not recognize revaluation p l on tradeweb over the time of our investment in addition to tradeweb we would draw your attention to several other notable investments that ipo ed this quarter including avantor uber and headhunter which grew the notional size of our public holdings taken together these four investments represent approximately 55 of our 2 6 billion public investment portfolio turning to page eight net revenues from debt securities and loans were 989 million and included 872 million of net interest income and modest mark to market gains our total loan portfolio was 98 billion up 2 billion sequentially driven by corporate loan growth and we note 82 of our total loan portfolio is secured our credit provision was 214 million down 4 versus last quarter our firmwide net charge off ratio remains low at approximately 60 basis points on page nine turning to investment management we produced 1 6 billion of revenues in the second quarter driven by our diversified global asset management business and leading private wealth franchise net revenues included management and other fees of 1 4 billion which were up 5 versus the first quarter and up 4 versus last year reflecting continued growth in assets under supervision by contrast we generated significantly lower incentive fees relative to the outsized 316 million last year incentive fees in the second quarter of last year were driven by the timing of realizations and performance across a variety of our alternative investment funds we also saw lower transaction revenues from pwm client trading activity assets under supervision finished the quarter at a record 1 7 trillion up 61 billion versus the first quarter driven by 17 billion of long term net inflows 12 billion of liquidity inflows and 32 billion of market appreciation now let me turn to expenses on page 10 our total operating expenses of 6 1 billion were flat versus the second quarter of last year reflecting lower litigation and lower compensation and benefits expense offset by increased expense for technology and consolidated investments for the year to date total expenses were 12 billion down 6 year over year our year to date efficiency ratio was 65 6 up 100 basis points versus a year ago driven by lower revenues and ongoing investments partially offset by lower compensation expense on the topic of investment spend as we ve spoken in the past cumulatively we are making very substantial organic investments to build new businesses and digital platforms the depth of that investment cycle will be in 2019 and 2020 investment spending will continue into 2020 when we will also see a more meaningful impact of the reserve build supporting our initial growth in the apple card portfolio following our expected launch later this summer year to date the total pre tax cost from marcus apple card and our new transaction banking platform is approximately 275 million resulting in a drag of roughly 60 basis points on our roe our cumulative pre tax loss for these businesses from the inception of each through the second quarter was approximately 1 3 billion which has been embedded in the performance of the firm as these businesses scale over the coming years this drag should not only reverse but become an accretive contributor to the firm s roe next on taxes our reported tax rate was 23 for the quarter and 20 for the year to date including discrete tax benefits in the first quarter we continue to expect our full year 2019 tax rate to be consistent with our medium term estimate of approximately 22 to 23 on the compensation ratio our philosophy remains steadfast through our principles obtain for performance reduction in the year to date ratio to 36 is a reflection as always of our best estimate of the compensation accrual for the firm which for the full year 2018 was just below 34 also as we have noted in the past as we grow more scale and platform driven businesses it is our expectation that compensation will decline as a proportion of total operating expenses and the efficiency ratio will become a more relevant measure for the firm these platform businesses should carry higher marginal margins at scale and be less reliant on compensation as a cost contributor turning to capital on page 11 our common equity tier 1 ratio was 13 8 using the standardized approach and 13 5 under the advanced approach the ratios each increased by 10 basis points versus the first quarter driven by higher retained earnings our slr was 6 4 flat sequentially in the quarter we returned a total of 1 6 billion to shareholders including stock repurchases of 1 25 billion and 319 million in common stock dividends our basic share count ended the quarter at another record low of 372 million shares our book value per share was 214 up 10 versus a year ago as david mentioned we are pleased that the federal reserve did not object to our 2019 capital plan of up to 8 8 billion of total capital return including share repurchases of up to 7 billion 40 higher than last ccar cycle while we continue to assess capital return in the context of the market environment and opportunities for accretive investment in our business consistent with our long held strategy we are encouraged by the increased flexibility afforded by our strong capital position we enjoy the option of returning a significant portion of our earnings to shareholders over the coming year following our successful completion of the federal reserve s annual stress test let s spend a moment reviewing our philosophy on capital first our long term view on capital allocation remains unchanged we first look for opportunities to invest in our business at attractive returns to the extent we have excess after these investments we will endeavor to return it to shareholders second with respect to dividends versus buybacks we aspire to having a higher dividend long term as it s an important component of total shareholder return and it s further reflective of the firm s confidence in our ability to generate more recurring and predictable sources of revenue that said we continue to value the flexibility of share repurchases as they allow us to be more dynamic with capital allocation based on the environment and business opportunities third regarding the stress capital buffer based on our calculations and the proposed rule which may differ materially in its final form we estimate an scb of approximately 5 5 based on the 2019 stress test results this would imply a total cet1 requirement excluding management buffers in the neighborhood of 12 5 to 13 which compares favorably to our second quarter 2019 standardized ratio of 13 8 while we view the ccar authorization as a ceiling and not a floor on the amount of capital we will return we are pleased to note that the 8 8 billion capacity should position the firm well to manage capital at appropriate levels turning to page 12 for balance sheet and liquidity our balance sheet was 945 billion up 20 billion versus last quarter on the liability side deposits increased to 166 billion including consumer deposits of over 50 billion which we have more than doubled since last year during the quarter we saw further progress migrating businesses into our bank entities to take advantage of their more diversified and lower cost funding our global core liquid assets averaged 225 billion during the quarter which we continue to note may decline as we have opportunities to support client demand before taking questions a few brief closing thoughts while our second quarter performance was solid despite the mixed operating environment we believe as david said the overall economic growth backdrop should remain supportive of our business as we go forward we are executing diligently on three core objectives one serving our clients with excellence and growing our existing business two diversifying our business into adjacent and new businesses and three operating more efficiently in all that we do if we do these things well we are confident we can deliver strong long term returns for our shareholders with that thank you again for dialing in and we ll now open up the line for questions questions and answers operator operator instructions and your first question is from the line of glenn schorr with evercore please go ahead glenn schorr evercore isi analyst thanks very much maybe just start with the real quickly you mentioned providing a strategic update this coming january i m curious what form you re thinking about meaning investor day update slides on the call things like that david m solomon chairman and chief executive officer so thanks glenn and good morning i appreciate the question we are committed to giving the strategic updates and in particular providing targets in january as we re working toward this fall where we ll know the exact format and also the specific date we ll communicate it glenn schorr evercore isi analyst okay well as long as the numbers are good i m cool david m solomon chairman and chief executive officer in i l i m curious i know you re going through the process of consolidating the businesses and i m sure there are some challenges there but my question is on you ve always been good at this but i feel like managing conflicts between advisor balance sheet investment and third party funds will just be that much harder as you bring this altogether and grow third party i wonder if you could talk a little bit about that and how you will allocate investments across on balance sheet versus third party things like that sure and i appreciate the question it s obviously something we spend a lot of time thinking about it we have spent a lot of time thinking about it because when you look at these businesses which in the past i did organized over multiple parts of the firm we re now internally reorganizing and bringing them together but we ve been doing this for 30 years we are one of the largest alternative asset managers in the world we manage a very very significant amount of third party and client capital and i can t say that there are issues from time to time that come out of this business model but we re focused on striking the right balance and have proven over a long period of time that i think we can do this consistently i think one of the things that you get by streamlining the organization and facing our clients as an integrated operation is it actually should make this process the decision making process easier and more clear and so we recognize it s something that we will have to continue to do well over a long period of time we are i m talking to our clients and listening to our clients and they feel bringing the businesses together and organizing them potentially will help us do that operator your next question comes from the line of chris bolu with autonomous please go ahead christian bolu autonomous research analyst good morning david and stephen david m solomon chairman and chief executive officer good morning stephen m scherr executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning christian bolu autonomous research analyst just on the targets we look forward to getting your targets in january but how should we think about the timeframe for achieving targets are you setting targets you can meet over the next one years to two years or should be looking for more long term aspirational targets that could take more like five years to get to stephen m scherr executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks christian i would say that the targets that we will focus on will be both returns and equally efficiency and in the course of putting those out our timeframe will be over the medium to longer term we re in the midst as i said in the prepared remarks of making some meaningful investments in the business the depth of that is going to be over the course of this year and into 2020 and the returns on that will play out over the medium term and so the targets will be that along the way we ll continue to point out as we did on this call with greater clarity as to the precision of what it is we re spending and what we re spending for and the direction of travel and the type of returns we expect to get but in that we re investing in particular businesses like the apple card like marcus like transaction banking those will have return profiles equally we re investing in platforms that will bring greater efficiency to existing businesses those two should have return profiles to them perhaps even inside some of the projects we have but we will give you the medium term targets but take you along in terms of what plays out between now and then christian bolu autonomous research analyst great thank you very much and then on the alternatives business i was excited to see you what does it looks like when you bring it all together i don t know if you can help us just preview maybe the size when you put all those strands together kind of what the size and maybe the growth profile of that business looks like today and then as you look to maybe compete more against the alternative asset managers if we re tricking one here but how do you balance the sort of the delicate issue of doing what s right for goldman versus competing against like a key clientele david m solomon chairman and chief executive officer sure so first with respect to the business broadly we plan to operate across four broad asset classes that we operate in today currently and that includes private equity that includes growth equity private credit and also real estate and so over time we will provide more transparency to you on the assets that currently exist in all four of these channels which are significant and to our aspirations over time to increase the amount of third party capital that we manage in these different asset classes with respect to the balance and operating is as i said to the previous question we have been doing this for 30 years these businesses are very significant in size right now we have said publicly that when you look at the businesses that we operate here collectively they make us one of the top five alternative asset managers in the world today and so we will continue to navigate and execute that the same way we have over the last 30 years and a very very significant business and the fact that we re internally reorganizing it so that we can better serve our clients does not change the process that we ve executed on for a very very long period of time stephen m scherr executive vice president and chief financial officer the one other point i ll add to respond to your question is that as david rightly points out this will be a transition during that transition we do not anticipate a revenue shortfall by this movement meaning we ll maintain balance sheet with the flexibility of reallocating balance sheet into different of these sleeves as david pointed out and it s also worth noting that different sleeves whether it s credit real estate with respect to for example equity carry different capital density and the opportunity to realize higher returns on the balance sheet deployed will be there so we are very well aware of maintaining the revenue flow that s here and as david pointed out this will be a transition over time operator your next question comes from the line of michael carrier with bank of america please go ahead michael carrier bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning thanks for taking the questions first one just on capital so you received the approval for more buybacks plus the dividend capital ratios have improved a lot you are doing some on the m a front still investing in the business so i guess just looking for some color on if this is sustainable meaning being able to do everything given the repositioning of the balance sheet and probably importantly where you are on that front particularly within like the ficc business and the alternative business stephen m scherr executive vice president and chief financial officer sure so i think it s fair to say as a general matter this year s ccar clearly demonstrates the direction of travel that we want to go in terms of overall capital return and the scope of what we asked and what otherwise was approved reflects on our commitment to put capital back to shareholders it s important to note those and as i said in the commentary our posture has not changed meaning as stewards of capital we are looking at and for opportunities where we can invest in an accretive way to generate long term shareholder return we re going to continue to do that and you see that in the investments that we re making away from that and in excess of it we ll continue to return capital back to shareholders and i think what played out in the context of ccar is a reflection of what we are comfortable with in terms of what we re going to look to put out given where the market and circumstances are on the question you raised about ficc the focus for ficc not born of this quarter in particular but since we came on and started to look and reunderwrite the business it s been around capital efficiency and equally cost in the context of delivering in to our clients and so that continues to be a focus of ours in terms of the franchise when you look at ficc in particular i would say that the business is focused on clients in the context of expanding out the corporates transaction banking and the like it s focused on the development of platforms the investment in those platforms such as marquee on pricing engine and investment grade credit equally the e commodities business and equally having the talent to be good calibrators of risk intermediation which is at the core when we do this and we do this right and it is a core historical competency for the firm we re going to continue to look at ways of accomplishing that with greater capital and cost efficiency michael carrier bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay thanks and then just a follow up question just on the strategic review i think there is a lot of focus on sort of the revenue opportunities and where you guys are focused just given some of the investments and then the longer term the focus on the efficiency ratio just wanted to get an update or run through some of the initiatives that are in place and the progress you guys are making to lower the cost base over time and improve the efficiency ratio stephen m scherr executive vice president and chief financial officer sure so i would i ll answer that in kind of in two components one is that the new business is being built whether that s the consumer business credit card business as a part of it or transaction banking those businesses are intended to be built as scaled businesses meaning the compensation component attached to that is lower you have cost and investment made such that the marginal margin in those businesses are operating at full scale continues to grow and so you achieve greater efficiency on a higher revenue number that comes in that s the way i would describe the newer initiatives the second component is what we re doing in and around the introduction of platforms and technology to our standing incumbent businesses i just mentioned a few examples of what we re doing in ficc and in the securities business more broadly these two are lowering the throughput of trades it s lowering the ability where i should say the price point to engage with clients where they want to meet us which is it s less human capital it s more platform driven it carries higher efficiency to it and that s the direction of travel i d also say equally true about the incumbent businesses part of what we re doing in the federation to support the businesses including in places like compliance is the deployment of technology in order to render us more efficient such that we can support the businesses in a much more cost efficient way then where we ve been historically operator your next question is from the line of steven chubak with wolfe research please go ahead steven chubak wolfe research analyst hey good morning david m solomon chairman and chief executive officer good morning steven chubak wolfe research analyst so i appreciate the color on the stress capital buffer certainly the 5 5 reinforces the strength of your capital position given your current ratio is 70 basis points to 120 basis points above that you re likely to accrete additional capital over the next four quarters i m just wondering how you re thinking about sizing the appropriate management buffer and maybe just philosophically what are some of the factors that will impact that calculus stephen m scherr executive vice president and chief financial officer well i think part of the calculus is the direction of travel right of where these regulations are what the final scb ruling looks like equally there is inevitably variability that comes and fluctuation in ccar results and the way in which stresses imposed so we ll maintain a buffer that s sort of mindful of those variabilities in the overall calculus itself in terms of the general direction of capital sort of philosophically it is it really is what i had laid out earlier and that is i think you should take the results in the ccar in particular what we petitioned and what was left unobjective to by the fed as the direction we d like to go we ve got a lot on our plate in terms of investments that are being made but we are quite confident under the circumstances of being able to put a reasonable amount of capital back and i d also point out that the dividend increase for this third quarter now approved by our board is a 47 jump in the dividend which is also a reflection of the confidence in the increasing durability and profile of the revenues of the firm steven chubak wolfe research analyst no thanks for that stephen and just one more for me on efficiency you sized a 1 3 billion investment in some of the newer initiatives given you noted that investment spend will likely peak in 19 and maybe the early part of 2020 i was hoping you could speak to whether we should expect to see some efficiency progress as early as 2020 and what s a reasonable expectation in terms of the marginal margin i know the newer initiatives are tougher to assess but maybe on some of the legacy businesses given some of the changes you plan to implement on the platforms there stephen m scherr executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so obviously the efficiency ratio is in one part a function of revenue so we ll see where the fortunes of the firm take us on the expense base i think in the near term there is sort of quick to be realized certain cost efficiencies in our trading costs meaning what s happening on platforms that are introduced that underpin incumbent businesses that are not looking for if you will new flows to come on but we re transacting with clients in a different manner and form than what we ve done in the past just one really small example if you look at our investment grade business and you look at the bond pricing engine we can then play both sides of a risk trade in a way that would have taken thousands of man hours right in order to compute you would have had inefficiency in terms of its time value now we re able to provide a platform where the client can engage and look to conform and develop a portfolio on a much more efficient basis cost efficient basis than would have happened in the past so i think there are sooner efficiency or i should say efficiency to be realized sooner in the context of platforms underpinning incumbent businesses there ll be a longer timeframe as you note in the context of realizing efficiency in some of the newer initiatives that we re building operator your next question is from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst hi good morning david m solomon chairman and chief executive officer good morning betsy betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst a question on how you re thinking about consumer credit and i ask the question for two parts one is the upcoming apple card and then the marcus portfolio and on the apple card i know you can t go through details we put some estimates together and i know recently where again based on a lot of assumptions i end up with an expectation that you re running at about a that you would expect to run somewhere around a 1 roa now that s again a lot of assumptions but it s based on the information that s out there on lower rates for the credit quality versus peers what peers are charging and no fee and i that another of my question is how are you thinking about consumer lending is it a business that you think is inherently more risky than your current business which is running at about a 1 roa or do you do i have it wrong what am i missing and should this be a business that generates higher than a 1 roa that s basically the another question stephen m scherr executive vice president and chief financial officer sure thank you so let me start by saying there is no denying that the consumer business whether card or marcus is a risk business meaning no matter that it s delivered digitally or that the credit card will take a different digital sort of profile than traditional credit cards this is a risk business and that s where our focus is i would say the risk is not just on credit risk and financial risk but equally operational risk in the context of what we re building and so we re quite conscious on all of those elements what s important for us is that we look at this on a risk adjusted return basis not simply on a return on asset construct and that s what s critical and that s the way we re looking at it it would be betsy for me premature to sort of speculate what the pace of growth looks like on this i would simply say that risk calibration risk decisions in and around the card belong entirely to goldman sachs as the bank and we re set up to make those i d also say that if you look at the level and rate of growth in the marcus loan business while it continues to grow and perform well we have slowed the increase in growth in that in contemplation of taking on increasing consumer credit through the card business so we look at it both in its totality so each is marginally different in the way in which credit is dispersed but this is a risk business and we ll continue to look at it as we grow it out on a risk adjusted return basis betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst so on a really a follow up has to do with the expected at scale efficiency that you think you re going to be running these businesses at when they re at scale given the fact that you did a new build should i be thinking about the efficiency and of these businesses in line with fintechs which run at intermediate expense ratio that s 30 of other legacy competitors or should i look to bank competitors as a more reasonable expense ratio or somewhere in between stephen m scherr executive vice president and chief financial officer i would say that while we ve been in beta now for a couple of months and have grown the portfolio on that basis it s nowhere near at the scale of what our expectations would be as we grow it out and so it would be premature for me to kind of speculate as to the efficiency we ll start to reflect more on that once we launch and once we start to build this portfolio out so it s a little early what i can tell you is that what we have built jointly with apple both on the front end and on the back end is intended to be operationally resilient but equally is intended to be efficient both in terms of the delivery the app i should say the application all through the delivery and on the back end and so my expectation is that the efficiency will be reflected in that but again premature to sort of put numbers around it operator your next question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities please go ahead mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst hi to continue on the investment spend as it relates to expansion of markets outside the us where do you stand with the additional countries and what else might you consider stephen m scherr executive vice president and chief financial officer so i think i think on that mike the press has been sort of ahead of our plans in the context of speculating sort of the next country in which marcus would expand obviously our first place outside the united states was in the uk where the deposit platform has really exceeded our expectations in terms of what has been capable of generating there will be opportunities for us to expand in that market there has been quite a bit of speculation about germany it s not surprising that the speculation goes there both in the context of a growing business that we have in continental europe and the depth of the deposit market in germany but it s too early to forecast as and if and when we would expand there though i understand the speculation on that so for the moment we ve got a lot on our plate in terms of the execution around the platform in the united states and in the uk and we ll continue to pursue that mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst all right and then one follow up unrelated question 1mdb did you take any additional reserves for that what s the status there is a new statement by the head of the sec on july 3rd saying that it might be a little bit easier to resolve these sorts of matters what s your take in all this stephen m scherr executive vice president and chief financial officer so just on the reserves we took incremental legal reserves this quarter of 66 million we don t give detail on what the elements of that reserve are i would say that we are adjusting our rpl to 2 5 billion from 2 billion where it was i should point out that in providing that number to you it s important to recognize that that number is our best estimate as of this date it will be published in the q events that may play out between now and the q could alter that rpl and again there are different accounting regimes and thresholds that apply one probable one possible relating to the rpl and so that s where i can offer you by the way of what s happened financially in terms of statements otherwise being made i think it would be inappropriate for me to sort of speculate on what others intend by statements they make i think as we ve said in the past we re in a cooperative engagement with the authorities we intend to stay that way and as and when there are further developments we ll be in a position to to talk about that a bit more operator your next question is from the line of kian abouhossein with j p morgan please go ahead kian abouhossein j p morgan analyst yes hi i have two questions the first one is related to your equity revenues which were clearly very strong also against some peers reporting so far and i just want to understand where that s coming from because clearly the drivers are more muted such as volatilities down on the equity derivative world transaction volumes are ok ish but nothing in terms of the numbers that you have shown in terms of year on year and quarter on quarter growth rates can you just give a bit more color of where the drivers are and do you see market share movements in this area and secondly just coming back to your ficc business we now heard from you over the last 12 months to 18 months and expansion in more liquid products and traditional client base and can you a bit more detail on the fx and rates expansion both on clients and products and when should we see actually some of that investments having an impact on your revenue base because i don t see you yet outperforming your peers in this area but clearly would be great to get an understanding if you are if you feel differently and why and what investments you re doing in order to close the gaps in those two segments david m solomon chairman and chief executive officer so i ll start with equities i ll make a broad comment on ficc and stephen will give you a little bit more detail we are very pleased with the performance of our equity franchise broadly the performance really was across the franchise it was throughout derivatives and cash i would say given the market dynamics broadly there is some sense of consolidating share and i think we ve been the benefit of that and as we ve been stating on this call and over the handful over the last quarters we continue to make investments in our low touch activity and our low touch capabilities and we are starting to see some benefits from those investments in our low touch capabilities with respect to ficc broadly i do want to highlight as was highlighted i think on page five of the presentation our business is 90 market intermediation a much higher component of market interremediation then the people that we compete or we benchmark against so if you have a 60 40 mix and market intermediation is softer which it clearly was given the environment we had this quarter your nim portion or you re non market intermediation portion has less volatility but we continue to make investments as you highlight in some of these products and in particularly in broadening out the client base i d ask stephen to provide just a little bit more detail on how we think some of that is going through stephen m scherr executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks david so just to pivot to ficc and to be direct to your question if you look at fx in rates part of the progress that we were making is on broadening out the client franchise to more corporates than to the institutional clients to which we typically if not exclusively has engaged and we re starting to see some early progress in that i would say in this quarter in particular within europe i d also say that as part of an effort to expand out and penetrate further the corporate base around fx and rates we re seeing some benefit come to us by way of the joint venture between banking and ficc where banking obviously owns an entry point into the corporates and the ability to carry through those products into the corporate franchise where we have a demonstrably strong set of relationships i think will bear dividend what s more i would say that if you look at a variety of different initiatives and builds including transaction banking or corporate cash management this one s built will carry the potential to bring forward a more captive fx business that didn t exist inside the firm i think that too could prove to be a benefit and just on that particular project goldman sachs is already a customer if you will of our own platform and we aim to bring customers and clients on in across 2020 and so we are seeing early signs of progress on this but there is no running from the observation you make which is we have yet to sort of perform at the potential we are confident this business can show we re very confident in unlocking that potential some of these new initiatives will no doubt take a little bit of time before they bear out but the direction we re moving is a positive one operator your next question comes from the line of brennan hawken with ubs please go ahead brennan hawken ubs analyst good morning guys thanks for taking the question nii as a portion of the i l s debt portfolio could you maybe help us think about rate sensitivity there depending on how you calculate nim if it s 360 or 365 day count and nim is down either a few or upper single digit bps quarter over quarter what are the benchmark rates gents predominantly in that portfolio we should watch how much of the strong nii growth that you guys have seen over the past few years has been balanced versus rate and then how should we think about how the softening rate environment might impact nii growth going forward thanks stephen m scherr executive vice president and chief financial officer sure thanks for the question i think the best way to answer that question is to just point out where we differ if you will from some other bigger commercial banks in the context of both we have a different liability mix and equally a different composition to our assets on the liability side there is a portion of our funding that s fixed a portion that s floating and so it s not as dynamically correlated if you will to the way in which rates otherwise move and i think our nii growth generally speaking will benefit from a liability mix that s starting to skew toward deposits and so that s the perspective i would offer on the liability side on the asset side much of the assets that we have are floating rate based and equally and importantly is a higher velocity turn to the assets that underlie this and that too has a more or leads to a more muted impact to which we otherwise might see in some of the bigger commercial banks as a function of the direction in which rates are moving brennan hawken ubs analyst okay and then the part on how much we ve seen as far as rate or nim improvement versus balances in the last few years is it possible to break that down or is that something that might fall off stephen m scherr executive vice president and chief financial officer i think i would encourage you to follow up sort of with for an answer that s more precise than what i can give you now i would say that some of this has to do with balances in terms of the size and scope recognizing that the lending that we re doing which is generating this net interest income is quite strategic in the context of the clients that are served by the lending itself and i d also point out as i did in the remarks that about 82 of this is secured financing and so i offer that to you but heather and the team can provide you with greater insight onto the particulars operator your next question is from the line of jim mitchell with buckingham research please go ahead jim mitchell buckingham research analyst hey good morning maybe just a quick follow up on the fixed income discussion just want to make sure i understand how do you get your i assume internal roe targets in that business is it do you see it entirely coming from efficiency improvements and expanding the footprint into more flow business or is there some component of capital that comes out whether it s derivatives or something else do you need to see the level of capital declined as well or can it come from those other ways stephen m scherr executive vice president and chief financial officer sure so the way we ve been looking at it as we ve been scrutinizing and reunderwriting that business is we re focused on both the numerator and the denominator of the roe calculation meaning it s important nobody lose focus that we need to mind how much revenue is coming in that is how do we want to define the tangible market that we face what s the revenue capture that we can take in what s the expense as an offset to that revenue to establish the numerator in the calculus and none of that is to ignore capital efficiency in the context of what the denominator contains so this is really as we ve talked about it a wholesale reunderwriting of the business but be assured both of these are in scope in the context of the way in which we re looking at the business both revenue net of expense and looking at capital and the revenue being driven largely by an ambition to have a more expansive addressable market to include corporates in addition to that which we otherwise have focused on historically jim mitchell buckingham research analyst and as you pull that capital out do you worry at all if there is any kind of revenue risk in that pivot to a lower capital or denominator or do you feel that s not really the case stephen m scherr executive vice president and chief financial officer no i mean listen there is never is kind of a linear calculus okay so the businesses for us in ficc are not themselves four wall meaning anything we do with respect to a business in ficc has knock on implications for businesses that fit outside the securities business take for example wherever it is we decide to do around credit for commodities it has knock on implications so the thread on the adjacency of all of our businesses gets pulled so we re mindful of that and need to take stock of what we do around capital the one other thing i would point out which i ve talked about publicly before is in addition to thinking about both the numerator and the denominator embedded in the numerator is equally an effort to sort of optimize our own funding meaning how do we bring our cost of funds down retail deposits has been an example of that but our treasury team is working hard both in terms of the amount of liquidity we run with how that liquidity is managed in addition to identifying more efficient lower cost funding sources in order to render these businesses more competitive operator your next question comes from the line of devin ryan with jmp securities please go ahead devin ryan jmp securities analyst hey great good morning david and stephen david m solomon chairman and chief executive officer hey good morning stephen m scherr executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning devin ryan jmp securities analyst first question just on united capital with the deal closing just look to maybe get a little more perspective on how you re thinking about the business opportunity i guess broadly and as it connects with ayco is there a bigger appetite to expand into the mass affluent segment whether it be adding financial buyers or more m a or does capital really give you just a big enough footprint to achieve what you are looking to do in the business especially with ayco david m solomon chairman and chief executive officer sure i appreciate the question we are excited actually today i believe we re closing the capital acquisition on this very day and obviously it brings with us 220 rias and 90 offices around the united states and what it s really doing is we think we have a very very interesting channel to continue to build the mass affluent segment through ayco but this particular transaction accelerates our ability to do that between ayco and united capital of 80 billion of assets under management that s a good base from which to grow from we think we can continue to make progress and what we ll call the 1 million to 5 million of investable assets mass affluent wealth management category through this channel and that we can have good growth with the extended platform we now have but if another opportunity came up that we thought could further accelerate it because it is still a very fragmented business and we have a very very big infrastructure so we can continue the fee in terms of all the wealth in terms of what the asset management and wealth management products we have in our asset management business we ll consider it this was not something this acquisition was not something that was targeted for a year that we were really running after it came up for sale we looked at it we thought it was a really good fit to accelerate our business and so we decided to act on it devin ryan jmp securities analyst got it very helpful thanks and then just a follow up just to think about the third party alternative capital fund raising any expectations on whether it be the trajectory or cadence of how we should be thinking about that just as we are just starting to think about modeling it david m solomon chairman and chief executive officer yeah i appreciate the question devin and i know that you re all anxious to model it over time we will provide a lot more transparency on how we see that plan rolling out as you would expect we have a lot of businesses across the firm we put them together and the first thing you do when you put those people together is you cast them to develop plans on a go forward basis so we are in the process of that and as those plans come forward we will be more communicative and transparent as to what expectation we think you can have with that business over time operator your next question is from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst thank you good morning david m solomon chairman and chief executive officer good morning stephen m scherr executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst in your comments on the debt underwriting you mentioned deal flows in the quarter were consistent with the trends across the industry which reflected material lower volumes in the loan market in m a activity area and you specifically cited it was with the financial sponsors can you share with us what are the financial sponsors seeing today what do you think will stop them from doing more deal activity in the quarter and any outlook for the second half of the year from those financial sponsors david m solomon chairman and chief executive officer well look in a high end there is no quite at a high level there is no question that that activity has been more muted i guess when you think about the cycle and you think about the continued run in equity markets and the accommodative monetary policy we have which is certainly inflated for assets it s been tougher more competitive you have to pay more in order to succeed i also think the financing environment and in particular the smid ph regulatory overlay it had some impact over this cycle in muting how far the private equity activity may have moved in this cycle had the regulatory environment been different that said the private equity investors still have an enormous arsenal of unspent capital big reserve and i think this business continues to have secular growth and so as the environment evolves i think there will be periods of time where we will see increased activity versus what we ve seen in the first half of the year i don t think we have a great explanation of this specifically has done it but if you think about what the first half of the year has brought in terms of the macro overlay it s not surprising probably that it s been a little bit more muted gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst very good and then as a follow up on slide 12 you gave us your balance sheet of course the allocation and you mentioned that in the quarter there was a 20 billion quarter to quarter increase reflecting client demand to use your balance sheet can you share with us as the total loans or total assets what percentage of it is clients using your balance sheet and then second when you look at the revenues those customers bring to you as a percentage of those assets where do those stand and how does that compare to about a year ago david m solomon chairman and chief executive officer so as always the fluctuation in the balance sheet is a reflection of our ability to respond to opportunities and the interest of our clients and so balance sheet fluctuation is all a function of client service hard to decompose the balance sheet to say what s client what not what is not client truth we know all of it right is in some manner or form related to client activity and across all of our businesses in the firm and so that s really the way i would view sort of balance sheet both in terms of growth size and its composition operator your next question comes from the line of brian kleinhanzl with kbw please go ahead brian kleinhanzl keefe bruyette woods analyst yeah thanks just one quick question on the markets i saw that the rate pay came down toward the end of the quarter can you just walk through what your how you came up with that decision to lower the rates or you just looking at the fed fund s future should we expect more rate cuts there kind of what s been depositor behavior stephen m scherr executive vice president and chief financial officer sure sure so we made a decision and it was the first since we began our retail deposit business we made an adjustment downward we did it in the context of rendering ourselves competitive in light of what others have done it s also worth noting at or around the time we reduced the rate we saw others in the competitive set reduced the rate as well we saw no material adverse reaction to our movement no sort of pronounced outflows nothing to really call attention to i think you should assume that we will be fluid and flexible and agile in rate movement up or down relative to where the competitive set is and we ll sort of comport ourselves that way both in our us platform and in the uk brian kleinhanzl keefe bruyette woods analyst okay thanks operator at this time there are no further questions please continue with any closing remarks david m solomon chairman and chief executive officer okay since there are no more questions i would like to take a moment to thank everyone for joining the call on behalf of our senior management team we hope to see many of you in the coming months if any additional questions arise in the meantime please don t hesitate to reach out to heather otherwise enjoy the rest of your day and we look forward

the dilemma for bank of england interest rate setters as they head towards the august meeting and release of the inflation report gets tougher by the day the sharp fall in sterling as britain s two prospective prime ministers harden their negotiating positions on brexit risks a disorderly few months ahead with the pound moving towards parity against the euro and the dollar sterling dropped 0 7 per cent against the dollar yesterday to 1 2433 taking it to its lowest level since april 2017 against the euro it is worth just 1 108 sterling dropped 0 7 per cent against the dollar yesterday to 1 2433 taking it to its lowest level since april 2017 against the euro it is worth just 1 108 the days when it calmly hovered close to 1 30 as the commons went through endless votes earlier in the year are long gone all that markets can see is turmoil with the country set to have a new prime minister chancellor cabinet and governor of the bank of england in the next few weeks the next chancellor is due to unveil a budget and spending plans in november the timing could not be worse for the army of britain s families heading overseas as schools break up a falling pound also threatens to raise the price of food imports energy and raw materials posing a threat to the 2 per cent inflation target the bigger worry will be market instability the traditional response of central banks to a falling currency is to hike interest rates brexit uncertainty has had another unfortunate impact after a surprisingly buoyant first quarter before the theresa may agreement fell apart the latest three months could see closer to zero growth this at a time that the chinese economy is slowing and trump s hardball on trade is starting to have a detrimental impact on global output that is why wall street is expecting a cut in the us federal funds rate before the bankers head for their yachts there will be interest rate setters who argue that uk inflation has only been temporarily pushed higher due to the fall in the pound so the bank of england should move with other central banks to support output and cut rates but it would be a brave monetary policy committee which ignores the current downward slide one of the saving graces is britain s robust labour market construction manufacturing and services may be slipping but unemployment stands at a remarkable 1970s style 3 8 per cent of the workforce the plunge in sterling is having no impact on the appetite for uk government bonds gilts are still seen as a super safe asset and there was a flight into fixed interest from equities in latest trading pushing down the yield on ten year bonds to 0 787 per cent the gilts market is supported by the bank of england s own holdings of 435billion a remnant of quantitative easing and the higher post brexit capital requirements of uk banks and insurers the time to panic is when loyal overseas holders such as norway s wealth funds lose faith in the united kingdom one trusts that won t happen space odyssey after years of relative passivity it is terrific that the competition and markets authority cma is taking a more robust view the timing of its intervention over the proposed disposal of uk satellite champion inmarsat could not be better with the pound weakening british firms have become sitting ducks for predators and performance driven investment funds are often too willing to take the cash inmarsat sold itself to private equity firms apax and warburg pincus for 4 8billion in march having seen off an offer from an american rival but private equity with its slash and burn approach is rarely the right place in addition to competition concerns the cma should also look at national security inmarsat does work for emergency services and the ministry of defence and there is worrying potential for technology transfer allowing sensitive technology to fall into unsafe short term hands should not be an option bad call hsbc may be britain s biggest and most profitable bank but common sense deserted it when it came to the investing in women code hiding behind the smokescreen of gender data protection looks feeble unleashing female entrepreneurship worth a potential 250billion to britain is just the kind of thing a global bank should be getting behind chairman mark tucker should order his minions to sign up immediately

exchange of views with members of the high council of public finance introductory remarks by benoît cœuré member of the executive board of the ecb prior to an informal exchange of views with the high council of public finance paris 17 july 2019 thank you for inviting me to the high council of public finance it is a pleasure to engage in an informal exchange of views with you on the monetary policy of the european central bank ecb and more broadly on economic and monetary union emu with a specific focus on issues of relevance to fiscal policy allow me to start by briefly discussing the economic situation of the euro area the euro area economic outlook the euro area economy grew by 0 4 quarter on quarter in the first quarter of 2019 following an increase of 0 2 in the fourth quarter of 2018 however incoming economic data and survey information point to somewhat weaker growth in the second and third quarters of this year this reflects the ongoing weakness in international trade in an environment of prolonged global uncertainties which are weighing in particular on the manufacturing sector looking ahead the euro area expansion will continue to be supported by favourable financing conditions the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance further employment gains and rising wages and the ongoing albeit somewhat slower growth in global activity this assessment is broadly reflected in the june 2019 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area which foresee annual real gdp increasing by 1 2 in 2019 1 4 in 2020 and 1 4 in 2021 the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook continue to be tilted to the downside on account of the prolonged presence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors the rising threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets according to eurostat s flash estimate euro area annual hicp inflation was 1 2 in june 2019 unchanged from may 2019 based on current futures prices for oil annual hicp inflation is likely to decline over the coming months adjusting for the temporary factors behind the recent volatility measures of underlying inflation remain generally muted looking further ahead underlying inflation is expected to increase over the medium term supported by our monetary policy measures the ongoing economic expansion and stronger wage growth this assessment is broadly reflected in the june 2019 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area which foresee annual hicp inflation at 1 3 in 2019 1 4 in 2020 and 1 6 in 2021 the ecb s monetary policy and its impact on the euro area economy the benefits of our monetary policy measures have been sizeable and tangible lending rates for euro area firms and households are at historic lows and have converged across the euro area while growth in bank lending volumes has recovered significantly since the beginning of 2014 thereby supporting investment and job creation there are now 10 8 million more people in employment in the euro area than there were in the second quarter of 2013 when the number of people in work fell to its lowest point during the crisis however against the backdrop of a decline in the pace of the euro area expansion and the prolonged presence of uncertainties the ecb s governing council in june took a number of policy decisions to ensure that inflation remains on a sustained path towards levels that are consistent with our inflation aim a rate of inflation which is below but close to 2 over the medium term first we updated our forward guidance on the key ecb interest rates and now expect them to remain at their present levels at least through the first half of 2020 and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation consistent with our inflation aim second the governing council reaffirmed its intention to continue reinvesting in full the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme this will continue for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ecb interest rates and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation third we decided on the modalities of the new series of quarterly targeted longer term refinancing operations tltro iii that was announced after our march meeting we decided that the interest rate will be set at a level that is 10 basis points above the average rate on our main refinancing operations but for banks whose eligible net lending exceeds a benchmark the rate applied can be as low as the average deposit facility rate plus 10 basis points this new series of tltros will help preserve favourable bank lending conditions and the smooth transmission of monetary policy looking ahead the governing council is determined to act in case of adverse contingencies and also stands ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation continues to move towards the governing council s inflation aim in a sustained manner completing economic and monetary union to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures other policy areas must contribute decisively to raising the longer term growth potential of the euro area and reducing its vulnerabilities sound fiscal and economic policies at the national level are the first line of defence to make the euro area stronger economic reform needs to be substantially stepped up in euro area countries to increase resilience reduce unemployment in a lasting way and boost productivity on the fiscal side member states often fail to make sufficient use of economic upswings to build fiscal buffers this leaves those with fragile fiscal positions ill prepared to face economic downturns at the current juncture we expect the aggregate euro area fiscal stance to be mildly expansionary in 2019 which provides welcome support to economic activity at a time when growth has decelerated however the aggregate picture masks the suboptimal differentiation across countries in particular countries with high levels of debt are with few exceptions not building fiscal buffers thereby risking a repeat of the mistakes of the pre crisis period countries with fiscal space could use some of it to strengthen public investment and increase their growth potential the european fiscal board has recently issued a report recommending a broadly neutral euro area fiscal stance for 2020 based on the expectation of a gradual pick up in economic activity as of the second half of 2019 this is also our baseline scenario but we are aware that it is surrounded by a multitude of downside risks if those risks were to materialise additional fiscal support may be needed to be clear such support should come from countries that have fiscal space but while not all countries have the space to spend more all have the opportunity to spend better the euro s benefits however will not fully materialise for as long as the architecture of emu remains incomplete material progress has been achieved in recent years the european stability mechanism provides an important safeguard and reforms currently under discussion will strengthen its precautionary and crisis resolution toolkit the creation of banking union meanwhile has considerably strengthened the resilience of the euro area financial sector and together with the bank recovery and resolution directive has created instruments to combat banking crises in a swifter and fairer way banks directly supervised by the ecb have built up strong capital positions in recent years with a common equity tier 1 cet1 ratio of 14 3 in the first quarter of 2019 compared with 11 3 at the end of 2014 they have also substantially reduced their non performing loan ratio which stood at 3 7 in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 7 5 in the second quarter of 2015 these are important steps forward as euro area firms rely heavily on bank credit to finance growth and investment so what more should be done at the european level first the ability of the financial sector to contribute to economic stabilisation should be strengthened during the crisis financial integration in the euro area reversed and it has only gradually recovered over the past few years the creditworthiness of banks remains linked to that of national governments unlike in the united states cross border investment is not a significant buffer against economic shocks the euro area still lacks genuinely integrated capital markets which hinders the efficient allocation of european savings private cross border risk sharing to smoothen consumption during idiosyncratic shocks and the use of the euro as an international currency recent legislative steps are commendable but do not measure up to the initial ambition of the capital markets union project brexit will further accentuate the need to develop and integrate the eu s capital markets a large number of banks and investment firms are in the process of establishing or expanding their euro area presence possibly resulting in the development of a multi centric european financial system while the landscape may evolve further in the future in a financial system with a number of increasingly important hubs as opposed to one dominant hub in london it will be more important than ever for these hubs to be able to efficiently interact with one another and to avoid differences across member states providing opportunities for regulatory arbitrage second the banking union needs to be completed in particular a fully fledged european deposit insurance scheme edis is a key missing element in this context the ecb has proposed that edis could be accompanied by risk based contributions by banks linked to their sovereign holdings third further efforts are needed to deepen fiscal union in the euro area european fiscal rules are complex opaque and plagued with exceptions and exemptions which have accumulated over time they rely excessively on measures of cyclical positions which are controversial and prone to manipulation simpler and more credible and effective rules are needed to ensure that euro area countries safeguard fiscal sustainability and build the necessary buffers to create room for countercyclical stabilisation in economic downturns recent proposals to focus the fiscal framework on a debt anchor complemented by an expenditure rule deserve further consideration emu also needs a central fiscal stabilisation mechanism to enhance countercyclical stabilisation during severe recessions past experience shows that the aggregate fiscal stance in the euro area is often suboptimal during the european debt crisis for example it was strongly contractionary thereby reducing the effectiveness of an expansionary monetary policy stance while the euro area budgetary instrument currently under discussion is a welcome step to support convergence it is not designed to fulfil this stabilisation function work on the fiscal architecture of emu therefore needs to continue to ensure that fiscal policies can play an effective stabilisation role conclusion let me conclude the euro which celebrates its 20th anniversary this year enjoys broad support among european citizens with three in four people in the euro area in favour of it its growing popularity is testimony to the fact that people have trust in the currency and in the ecb s strong commitment to price stability which supports investment and job creation to preserve this trust we need to step up our efforts at both national and euro area level to strengthen the architecture of the single currency much has been achieved but some of the failings that caused and perpetuated the crisis remain unresolved at a time of heightened global uncertainty completing the euro area s architecture is also necessary for europe to be able to achieve its other objectives europeans won t be able to foster cooperation on security and defence or to speak with one voice on international affairs or to complete the single market if they repeatedly have to tackle economic crises which are largely of their own making a sound and sustainable euro area will help redirect political capital where it is most needed thank you

turn the call over to bill william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer thanks bryan and good morning everybody as you ve seen this morning pnc reported net income of 1 4 billion or 2 88 per diluted common share for the second quarter by virtually every measure it was a successful quarter you saw we generated really strong growth in loans and deposits we grew total revenues both nii and non interest income increased managed expenses well generated positive operating leverage and delivered strong returns building on the strong first quarter we re pleased where where we sit on performance through the first half of this year credit quality remains strong we continue to see no cracks really on either the commercial or the consumer side our loan growth this quarter continued to be driven by the commercial side but we did see growth in consumer as well and inside of our strong commercial loan growth we saw a drop in yields consistent with lower interest rates libor sets basically and some further spread compression the effect was particularly impactful on the margin this quarter at the same time we continue to have great success in cross selling fee based products to these clients and our economic profit on the total relationships continues to be really healthy pipelines are solid going into the third quarter sales in our corporate banking segment in june actually tied a monthly record high and treasury management and capital markets revenue also set quarterly records in terms of market expansion we continue to generate strong results in c ib with our new markets and we will take our middle market corporate banking franchise into two additional markets next year with moves into both portland and seattle on the retail side our national digital expansion effort continue to make good progress this quarter our high yield savings product continues to be an attractive entry point for new customers in our expansion markets and beyond and we ve now opened three new branch locations under our solution center model in kansas city and dallas to support our digital offerings and outreach in our expansion markets and we ve been very pleased to see the growth in those branches they re growing at nearly 5 times the pace we d expect for it a de novo branch in our legacy markets looking ahead we plan to accelerate the pace of new solution center openings over the next 18 months or so in boston dallas houston and nashville we continue to return capital to shareholders even as we maintained a strong capital position i m sure you ve seen we recently announced a 21 increase in our quarterly cash dividend on common stock raising the dividend to 1 15 per share on top of a substantial increase in our share repurchase programs and as we look at the current environment and the remainder of the year ahead there is obviously some uncertainty in the economy and the outlook for rates that of course is beyond our control but we will continue to invest in our businesses particularly in customer facing innovation to keep improving the customer experience and further expand our product and service offerings to meet our customers evolving needs as always i want to thank our employees for their continued hard work and with that i ll turn it over to rob to take you through our second quarter results in a little more detail robert q reilly chief financial officer thanks bill and good morning everyone as bill just mentioned we reported second quarter net income of 1 4 billion or 2 88 per diluted common share our balance sheet is on slide four and is presented on an average basis average total loans grew 6 3 billion or 3 to approximately 235 billion linked quarter loan growth compared to the second quarter of 2018 was 12 2 billion or 5 investment securities of 83 6 billion increased 1 3 billion or 2 primarily due to purchases of agency rmbs securities increased 6 1 billion or 8 year over year our cash balances at the fed averaged 13 2 billion for the second quarter down 1 5 billion linked quarter and 7 5 billion year over year deposits grew 5 7 billion or 2 linked quarter and 11 9 billion or 5 year over year as of june 30 2019 our basel iii common equity tier 1 ratio was estimated to be 9 7 compared with 9 8 as of march 31 2019 our tangible book value was 80 76 per common share as of june 30th an increase of 12 compared to a year ago our return on average assets for the second quarter was 1 39 up 5 basis points from the first quarter and our return on tangible common equity was 14 82 an increase of 69 basis points slide five shows our loans and deposits in more detail average loans grew 6 3 billion or 3 over the first quarter with broad based growth in both commercial and consumer lending commercial lending balances increased 5 4 billion or 3 linked quarter with particularly strong growth in our secured lending portfolio on the consumer side balances increased approximately 900 million or 1 linked quarter with growth in residential real estate auto and credit card somewhat offset by runoff in our home equity and education loans compared to the same period a year ago average loans increased 5 or 12 2 billion average deposits increased approximately 5 7 billion in the second quarter compared with the first quarter reflecting growth in both commercial and consumer deposits the growth was primarily in interest bearing deposits however average non interest bearing deposits posted a small increase as well compared to the same quarter a year ago average deposits increased by 11 9 billion or 5 as you can see on slide five our capital return to shareholders has been substantial over the past several years through a combination of share repurchases and dividends while maintaining an overall strong capital position in the second quarter we completed the common stock repurchase programs we announced last year and last month we announced a new plan to repurchase up to 4 3 billion of shares over the next four quarters this represents a 48 increase over our recently completed share repurchase programs additionally last week our board of directors approved a 21 increase in the quarterly dividend to an all time high of 1 15 per share effective with the august dividend as you can see on slide six first quarter total revenue was 4 4 billion up 153 million linked quarter or 4 net interest income was up 23 million or 1 compared with the first quarter non interest income increased 130 million or 7 linked quarter reflecting seasonally higher fee income as well as an increase in other non interest income non interest expense increased 33 million or 1 compared with the first quarter as expenses continued to be well managed provision for credit losses in the second quarter was 180 million a 9 million linked quarter decrease our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 16 6 for the full year 2019 we continue to expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 17 now let s discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail turning to slide seven net interest income of 2 5 billion was up 23 million or 1 compared with the first quarter the increase reflects higher loan balances as well as an additional day in the quarter partially offset by lower commercial loan yields and higher interest bearing liability balances net interest income grew 85 million or 4 year over year driven by higher earning asset yields and balances which were partially offset by higher funding costs and balances net interest margin decreased to 2 91 in the second quarter the primary driver of this decline was commercial loan yields which were impacted by a decrease in libor rates as well as narrower spreads additionally deposit rates increased 5 basis points during the quarter non interest income increased 7 linked quarter and 2 year over year importantly fee income grew 5 linked quarter with increases across all fee categories the main drivers of the 71 million linked quarter fee increase were asset management revenue which includes our equity investment in blackrock increased 8 million reflecting higher average equity markets consumer services increased 21 million and service charges on deposits increased 3 million due to seasonally higher transaction volumes and customer growth corporate services increased 22 million driven by higher treasury management product revenue and loan syndication fees and residential mortgage non interest income increased 17 million due to higher loan sales revenue and a positive rmsr valuation adjustment partially offset by lower servicing revenue finally other non interest income increased 59 million linked quarter reflecting higher capital markets related revenue including a record quarter in our corporate securities business and asset sale and valuation gains second quarter other non interest income included a gain on the sale of the retirement record keeping business which was announced in the first quarter and was included in our second quarter guidance in the third quarter we expect other non interest income to be in the range of 250 million to 300 million excluding net securities and visa activity this reflects our expectation for lower asset sale gains compared with the second quarter turning to slide eight second quarter expenses increased 1 for both the linked quarter and year over year comparisons as our expenses remain well controlled the largest percentage increase was in our marketing expense which supports our national retail digital strategy our efficiency ratio improved to 59 in the second quarter compared with 60 for both last quarter and a year ago expense management continues to be a focus for us and we remain disciplined in our overall approach as you know we have a goal to realize 300 million in cost savings through our continuous improvement program and we re on track to achieve our full year 2019 target our credit quality metrics are presented on slide nine overall our credit quality remained strong and we continue to see strength broadly in both our commercial and consumer portfolios provision for credit losses was 180 million a 9 million decrease linked quarter net charge offs increased 6 million to 142 million linked quarter and our annualized net charge off ratio was unchanged at 24 basis points overall our allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans was 1 15 as of june 30 2019 virtually unchanged from the previous four quarters non performing loans were up 71 million or 4 driven by the commercial portfolio total non performing loans to total loans represents 73 basis points a small increase in the quarter but down year over year total delinquencies were down 127 million or 9 linked quarter reflecting a decline in both commercial and consumer delinquencies as you know we re approaching the adoption of cecl the new accounting standard for credit losses which will go into effect january 1 2020 we ve been in parallel run since the beginning of this year and based on our expectation of forecasted economic conditions and portfolio balances as of june 30 2019 we estimate that cecl could result in an overall allowance increase of 15 to 25 as compared to our current aggregate reserve levels the majority of the increase is expected to be driven by the consumer loan portfolio as longer duration assets require more reserves under the cecl methodology importantly these are still estimates at this point and we will continue to refine them through the balance of 2019 in summary pnc posted very good second quarter results which contributed to an overall strong first half of 2019 for the balance of this year we expect continued growth in gdp albeit at a slower pace over the second half of 2019 we now expect two 25 basis point cuts in the fed funds rate in 2019 one in july and one in october looking ahead to third quarter 2019 compared to second quarter 2019 reported results we expect average loans to be up approximately 1 we expect total net interest income to be stable we expect fee income to be up low single digits we expect other non interest income to be between 250 million and 300 million excluding net securities and visa activity we expect expenses to be stable and we expect provision to be between 150 million and 200 million turning to slide 12 and taking into account our third quarter guidance we d also like to take this opportunity to reaffirm our full year outlook our income statement guidance remains intact and we are increasing our outlook for average loan growth based on the strong performance we ve experienced in the first half of the year we re now expecting full year average loans to be up approximately 5 we expect the net interest income benefit of this incremental loan growth to partially offset the lower than expected rate environment which will support our ability to achieve our original full year revenue target importantly in the first half of 2019 we generated positive operating leverage and remain well positioned to deliver positive operating leverage for the full year of 2019 and with that bill and i are ready to take your questions bryan gill director investor relations edison could you poll for questions please questions and answers operator thank you your first question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore please proceed john pancari evercore analyst good morning william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer hey john robert q reilly chief financial officer good morning john john pancari evercore analyst on the on your guidance for the full year and it s good to see the revenue outlook unchanged despite the rate backdrop so is it wondering if you could break out that revenue expectation of at the higher end of the low single digits between what your expectation would be for the full year for nii versus fees because it seems likely that your fee outlook is improving here and helping keep that revenue outlook unchanged in the backdrop of the lower rate environment robert q reilly chief financial officer yeah yeah hey john this is rob when we take a look at in terms of our full year guidance what we originally expected we set the upper end of the low single digits probably at that time a little more in nii and a little less in non interest income fast forward to today accounting for the and now our rate environment where we expect declining rates so we d see the nii back off a little bit and the non interest income pick up nii is not down as much as it would be as i pointed out in my comments because of the higher than expected loan growth so probably a little bit more to answer your question probably a little bit more equal contribution both from nii and non interest income john pancari evercore analyst got it william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer yeah so and rob it s clear though what rob is saying nii down a little bit it s relative to our guidance robert q reilly chief financial officer expectation yeah of our original expectation that s right john pancari evercore analyst right got it got it okay and then as it pertains to nii can you give us a little bit more granularity on what you how you see the margin trending i know previously you looked for a couple bps impact but i was through the remainder of the year but curious what your expectation is now that you re looking for cuts and then also what would be the nii or nim impact of 25 basis point cut each just curious on your rate sensitivity thanks william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer we could both jump in right so this was a bit of a weird quarter john because the libor sets kind of gotten front of the expectation that the fed is going to cut so we had that drop in loan yields that wasn t really offset by any drop in deposit rates and other things so i don t know that you re going to see a drop like you saw this quarter interestingly all of what we saw or virtually all of it was on the asset side as opposed to the liability side of our balance sheet here so i think going forward and we do have two cuts in the forecast you will still see nim under pressure but it shouldn t be at all like the drop we saw this quarter having said all that there is a million caveats to mix and other things in there that affect that robert q reilly chief financial officer yeah i think i can add to that just in simple terms this quarter interest bearing assets were down largely driven down by commercial loan yields and on the liability side we actually went up a 1 basis point because even though borrowings came down the deposit rates were up so going forward we expect william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer and the deposit rates were up because of mix shift robert q reilly chief financial officer that s right yeah william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer because of betas yeah robert q reilly chief financial officer and competitive factors so going forward we see the liability to be more in tandem so less compression to bill s point and then on the nii itself in terms of the approximate amount relative to the two cuts that we have we approximate that to be about 100 million william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer relative to our robert q reilly chief financial officer yeah relative to what it would have been william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer if we didn t get the cut robert q reilly chief financial officer if we didn t have the cuts right john pancari evercore analyst got it okay all right thank you robert q reilly chief financial officer sure john operator the next question comes from the line of john mcdonald with autonomous research please proceed john mcdonald autonomous research analyst yeah hi bill the loan growth came in a little more color on where things have been picking up where they might versus the legacy william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer hey john you re breaking up a little bit are you there okay let s go to the next question we ll see if he comes back operator the next question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley please proceed betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst hi good morning william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer hi betsy betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst hi i wanted to understand a little bit more about the loan growth that you generated this quarter i mean you guys are known for being very conservative and careful and this is really eye popping growth so just wanted to understand what the drivers were in particular on the c i side and what kind of legs do you think this has just want to see if this was a really unusual quarter or if there is more to come robert q reilly chief financial officer yeah i can hey betsy it s rob i can start we did have a we had a great quarter in terms of loan growth as you ve mentioned largely on the commercial side although the consumer growth was good too on the commercial i think it was a bit elevated in the second quarter the primary drivers of our loan growth which we d expect to continue maybe not at the same rate we are in new geographies all of which are doing well and then in this quarter similar to what we ve been seeing for the last couple of years really strong growth in our secured lending segment which has better competitive dynamics so those two things happened in the quarter and then on top of that we had strong growth in some high quality commercial just general commercial credit so a little bit more in the second quarter than we d expect going forward which is why we guided to 1 loan growth in the third quarter but those fundamentals are still in place william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer yeah and so we haven t changed the risk bucket the actually the quality of what we ve been originating on average has been better robert q reilly chief financial officer higher william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer over the course of the first half of this year than it was last year betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst no it s interesting because we see in some of the data a little weakness in the manufacturing transportation area energy and those are big borrowers so is there any is there other industries that s really driving the bus for you than this william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer it s pretty diversified the one thing that s in there is we did see some pickup in utilization this quarter which helps a little bit particularly in the asset based lending book although i would say that it actually came down in june so it s i don t know that that s a strength that necessarily continues but it was broad based it s new clients the new i don t remember the stat off the top of my head rob but the new markets are growing at multiples robert q reilly chief financial officer multiples yeah very high percentages off a small base but clearly william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer adding materially to the balances so things are just working they re doing a good job betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst and so do you feel like that is in part because of your size going into these new markets folks are looking for somebody a little bit larger that can take down bigger bites is that part of it and maybe you can speak to the quality of the loans that you re doing is it more like cash flow asset based or is it to fund buybacks and m a william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer well remember that asset based business has been national for years betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst yeah william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer so we re not actually accounting that when we talk about our new market growth so most of the new market growth is coming from our traditional middle market products it s not differentiated by risk the cross sell ratio in the new markets is accelerating quickly and approaching legacy markets so we re just executing well i don t actually i don t know how else to explain it robert q reilly chief financial officer and taking the same approach in this new market that we do in our legacy markets we know how to compete we don t win them all but we win our fair share betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst yeah okay thank you william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer you bet operator and we will try with mr john mcdonald from autonomous research if you could proceed with your question please john mcdonald autonomous research analyst okay is this thing on robert q reilly chief financial officer yeah much better john mcdonald autonomous research analyst all right sorry about that guys i ll move on to the next topic got a big authorization on the ccar with the buyback i guess bill just kind of wondering about your philosophy there some banks front load others are more opportunistic how are you going to approach executing the buyback william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer we spread it through time you can t really front load it anyway you i forget the exact growth but robert q reilly chief financial officer in terms yeah in terms of our plan going forward is what we ve done in the past years which is pretty much evenly distributed throughout the year some others have front loaded but that s part of their submission we re opting to do otherwise william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer yeah john mcdonald autonomous research analyst okay and then rob you ll obviously get some benefit based on the tailoring proposal have you guys done any fine tuning of the estimates of how much that could help on the capital front if the tailoring goes through as proposed robert q reilly chief financial officer yeah yeah john we have and again this is proposed the quick answer is about 65 basis points on our cet1 ratio that s down a little bit from the last time we were asked that question mostly because aoci has changed around so 65 basis points is a good estimate john mcdonald autonomous research analyst and is that pretty much all blackrock then as the benefit robert q reilly chief financial officer pretty much the threshold deductions but blackrock yeah blackrock is the biggest piece bryan is right the other components msr and dtas are down a little bit but blackrock is the big piece john mcdonald autonomous research analyst okay and then just on the credit quality rob anything to note there the npls were up a touch is that just kind of lumpy stuff going on there overall credit looks good just maybe a comment there robert q reilly chief financial officer yeah yeah that s our view john just a couple of deals coming off of really really low levels last year so when you take a look at the percentages to the total loan portfolio they re virtually unchanged we had a couple of deals on the commercial side go to the npa list one of which went to the top there that we ve disclosed but they re unrelated and have instances and circumstances that mitigate what would be further broader concerns john mcdonald autonomous research analyst okay got it thanks robert q reilly chief financial officer yeah operator the next question comes from the line of erika najarian with bank of america please proceed erika najarian bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi good morning william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer hey erika erika najarian bank of america merrill lynch analyst as we think about deposit strategy in the midst of rate cuts could you share with us what kind of sensitivity you assume as you think about mitigating the first few rate cuts and are you going to continue to separately think about your expansion markets in terms of pricing versus your legacy markets robert q reilly chief financial officer yeah sure erika i can start on that obviously going forward in a declining rate environment we ll keep an eye in terms of our deposit rates and if we do get the cuts that are proposed it s likely that our rates would either subject to competitive pressures stable or go down i think in regard to the national retail digital strategy the deposits although they ve increased nicely percentage wise they are still pretty small relative to our total deposits so we ll remain pretty aggressive there in terms of the rates that we pay but of course that will be largely subject to the rate environment and the competitive pressures william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer i think practically betas lagged on the way up there so they don t have as much we don t have as much to go down the national market is interesting if you post in the top couple rates you gather lots of deposits if you re off that frontier it slows down and our strategy right now isn t actually to go out and try to grow those deposits aggressively instead it s to go out and learn exactly the dynamics of how marketing dollars spent give you a return on your investment and the combination of marketing dollars in the physical branch presence affects volume so you won t see as a practical matter i don t think rate impact causing anything to rate impact having causing any change to international expansion in the near term because we re still in the stage of kind of figuring out the levers that drive success in that effort elsewhere inside of deposits we re going to drop them drop rates subject to what the market does erika najarian bank of america merrill lynch analyst that s very helpful and as a follow up as you think about studying those new markets and how you entered those markets is that affirming the decision that we re really in a digitally initiated world and therefore the value of that traditional brick and mortar acquisition for someone like pnc is much lower particularly if it s small in size william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer a couple of things that are showing up very clearly to us the branch builds that we re putting in place are much more successful dramatically more successful than we had assumed and they affect the quality of the customer that you actually book online so our bias and i have that in my comments is probably to go with more branch builds than we builds than we had originally assumed in our national expansion the other thing that s very clear is that this online market is growing we can measure deposits that leave us to go to competitors as well as the deposits that come to us and it s very clear that through time at least in my mind this is going to take a greater greater portion of the market and for banking to be profitable as you see mix shift to interest bearing from non interest bearing and the margin on interest bearing declining in effect for banking to be profitable you re going to continue to see this branch spending in our saturated markets which we ve talked about as we build out the thin so i think this is in motion not just for us but for the whole industry and i don t think there s anything that s going to slow it down erika najarian bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it i think i was unclear in my last question i heard you loud and clear that the branch experience enhances the customer acquisition i meant more that the organic build seems more valuable than the traditional tuck in depository deal william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer oh yes ma am erika najarian bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it thank you go ahead robert q reilly chief financial officer we re going to add to that or william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer no i was just that math becomes it s fairly straightforward when these small depository institutions are trading at multiples of book value robert q reilly chief financial officer and that was one of the things that we wanted to test with this experiment and it is proving out that way erika najarian bank of america merrill lynch analyst perfect thank you operator the next question comes from the line of scott siefers with sandler o neill and partners please proceed scott siefers sandler o neill partners analyst good morning guys thanks for taking the question rob i guess first just kind of a housekeeping one the retirement record keeping business can you maybe quantify the size of the gain that was in other income i guess in a sense it doesn t matter since you ve given guide for other income in the third quarter robert q reilly chief financial officer i can help you with a little bit of the math and you d be able to do it yourself when you take a look at the amg segment information the gain on the sale of the business was it came in two components one was a 60 million gain in other non interest income associated with the transaction was 20 million of expenses the primary driver of that was the write off of the software of our own administrative system that was not part of the sale so a net 40 million gain and again you could see that pretty clearly in the amg segment info in terms of elevated revenue and expenses scott siefers sandler o neill partners analyst yeah robert q reilly chief financial officer and it was and as you pointed out it was part of our second quarter guidance scott siefers sandler o neill partners analyst yeah all right thank you and then maybe bill just sort of a broader question if the fed indeed does go into this rate cutting mode can you talk a bit about what you think sort of the stimulative impact if any would be on your customers i guess the on the consumer side it s a little more self evident but as it relates to your commercial customers i mean would it generate any change in demand or how are you or your customers thinking about that dynamic william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer i don t know that i have any insight into that in theory that s why they would do it as a practical matter i continue to think we re on a we have really low rates today so i struggle to see how another 25 basis points or 50 basis points actually is going to impact what is already pretty low cost of funding for people but we ll see robert q reilly chief financial officer and the psychological aspect of that sometime so scott siefers sandler o neill partners analyst yeah okay perfect thank you guys i appreciate it william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer sure operator the next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc please proceed gerard cassidy rbc analyst good morning bill good morning rob robert q reilly chief financial officer hey gerard william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer good morning gerard cassidy rbc analyst bill you talked a couple of times about the success of the solution branches outside your footprint and they are growing much faster than expected what are you finding is the reason for that success william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer i don t know gerard cassidy rbc analyst that s a fair answer okay william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer no i mean part of it is we design them purposely to be different in terms of the numbers of employees and types of employees so the employees in those branches spend more time than a traditional branch outside of the branch so they re out working events in neighborhoods in centers of influence more than you would see in a traditional branch i think the advertising that is in play in these markets makes people aware of us and our offer and i still think that particularly for large deposits branches matter somebody says look it s a great offer but i m willing to drive the 20 minutes to go see somebody face to face rather than do it digitally that has that s kind of common sense but i think that s been a has had a stronger impact than i otherwise would have suspected gerard cassidy rbc analyst and then circling back to the strong c i loan growth outside your traditional footprint obviously from what you ve said you re not selling or making the loans and prices at a completely different than your competition or underwriting standards the guys on the front line that are making building these relationships for you folks in the c i area what are they telling you why people are coming again i m assuming it s not just the loan is it the treasury management products that you have which are everybody knows are very strong or what s bringing these people to you guys if it s not pricing or underwriting william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer first john you have to remember that we re just kind of starting to see the roll on of this new business as we ve been in these markets for a couple of years our strategy is just to call on people sometimes for several years before we get any business we go into a market we figure out who we want to have as customers and then we just focus on them for however long it takes what you re seeing in terms of our results is mike lyons calls it the wave but basically kind of this catch up with the investments we ve made is we re starting to see growth come from three years of planting seeds if you remember all the way back when we bought rbc we kind of did the same thing right we planted seeds and that effort kind of came alive two and three years later and that s what you re seeing now so it s traditional clients so i would tell you that tm makes a big difference our ability to go in and cross sell when you more often than not you end up leading with capital with credit as part of your intro to the relationship and as you pursue cross sell we just have more to offer in terms of variety of products for treasurers and cfos to choose from we have good products and it s worked for us robert q reilly chief financial officer yeah gerard i d add to that that i agree with all that what i d add is that what we found is the receptivity of potential clients in all these geographies to a pnc calling effort has been very high which 20 years ago was difficult but the receptivity is very high and then once the dialogue occurs it s all the points that bill pointed out we tend to compete very well with our products and services gerard cassidy rbc analyst and then just lastly your federal reserve balances obviously are down year over year quite nicely how low can they go before they just have to be maintained or are you there already robert q reilly chief financial officer well so i think so how low can we go that s a good question i think we are william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer it s a function of lcr they can go down to zero if we wanted to put all the stuff into level one securities robert q reilly chief financial officer that s right that s right william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer one of the issues you saw this quarter was we actually changed the mix on balance of our securities debt to 2a which otherwise would have allowed us to have either less wholesale borrowings and or drop the balance more robert q reilly chief financial officer yeah i think that s all true i think we re essentially at the levels that we expect to be what i would point out though as part of the tailoring proposals as a possible reduction in the lcr levels and if that occurs we can go down substantially our math is much as maybe 10 billion or 20 billion depending on whether it s 70 or 85 coverage gerard cassidy rbc analyst great thank you robert q reilly chief financial officer yeah operator the next question comes from the line of matt o connor with deutsche bank please proceed matt o connor deutsche bank analyst good morning william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer good morning matt o connor deutsche bank analyst i know the period end balances can whip around a little bit but i was just wondering if we look at the securities portfolio the cash you had pretty big increases there that seem like it s being funded with wholesale and just trying to think through like if that as you think about your interest rate positioning or are you pre funding some of your securities or is it just some of that period end noise that i m overthinking william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer yeah there is some mischief between the average and the spot at period end but you are correct that we did because we added some 2a securities we funded that with home loan advances actually and so you see that jump that s all inside of our rate management process we saw value in largely certain types of mbs this quarter and took advantage of it robert q reilly chief financial officer yeah matt o connor deutsche bank analyst okay and i guess i think there was a view out there that the rate curve is maybe overly ambitious in terms of predicting rate cuts and i think folks are still trying to keep some dry powder but if the rate cuts don t materialize or they reverse quickly which could happen how would you think about managing the balance sheet and some of the securities and some of the actions that you ve taken here to what seems like reduce the asset sensitivity a little bit william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer you shouldn t confuse the increase in balances with an assumption that we simply added duration is maybe the best way i could answer that question we saw what we think were irrational prices on certain types of securities that it offered a fairly protected return inside of fairly wide rate moves if rates stay where they are we don t see we ll in fact follow the forward curve there is not a whole lot of reason to want to add duration at this point obviously if because i like you i don t believe that forward curve if that reverses then we ll take a look at it and there is opportunity there robert q reilly chief financial officer but nothing radical william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer yeah matt o connor deutsche bank analyst okay all right yeah thank you operator the next question comes from the line of kevin barker with piper jaffray please proceed kevin barker piper jaffray analyst good morning robert q reilly chief financial officer hey kevin kevin barker piper jaffray analyst last quarter you guys mentioned that you had some expense leverage expense levers you could pull if there was a lot of pressure on rates and if that were to continue are you still seeing some flexibility on the expense side if possible in order to continue to generate operating leverage given the current rate environment robert q reilly chief financial officer yeah hey kevin this is rob i m not sure what the levers that we were talking about before but we can look on the script but i ll answer in the sense that you know we do manage the positive operating leverage we ve had a good first half solid positive operating leverage and we expect that to deliver full year positive operating leverage and that s what we manage to do so on the expense side i feel good about it in terms of what we ve managed if you just go through the categories our personnel expense is up 2 which is consistent with merit that contrast where we were this time last year where we were making a lot of investments in personnel it was much higher occupancy is essentially flat equipment expense is up just a little bit reflecting our technology investments marketing is up that s deliberate discretionary and part of our build out and we expect to continue that but the real savings has been in the all other category which is our second largest behind personnel which is down year over year that s where our cip program shows up the most so i feel good about our expense management what we ve done so far this year and what will we plan to do for the balance kevin barker piper jaffray analyst okay and then shift gears back to some of the loan growth comments i mean consumer loan growth was a focus for you and has consistently lagged the commercial loan growth is there anything there that we can see that maybe develop on the consumer side that will maybe start to emerge and maybe diversify your balance sheet a little bit more between commercial and consumer lending william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer i don t think so i mean the balance the places we are growing are actually growing at reasonable percentages off of smaller balances because we haven t been that larger consumer they re being offset by the continued rundown of home equity and lending which masks some of the underlying growth but at the end of the day our consumer loan growth is always in effect i shouldn t say always but practically always is going to be slower than c i simply because it s on a much smaller base and by the way if you see a dramatic change in that then you ought to start asking questions we re growing at i think an appropriate pace off the base we re in with the products we have as we increase penetration with the clients we have but i don t know that you d see a dramatic turn robert q reilly chief financial officer i don t think it would be dramatic but to just to add to that card and auto are growing nicely and that s all part of our plan residential mortgages are up and that s a function of just higher client activity particularly in the jumbo space while one day the home equity run off will stop running off and then we ll get the benefit of that but but that s the plan kevin barker piper jaffray analyst i mean longer term do you or more broadly do you view having a more balanced commercial versus consumer lending book as ideal or do you feel comfortable with the way it is right now 70 30 give or take william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer so look optically because we are light on consumer we screen poorly efficiency ratio and some other things and our nim is lower because our loan yields are lower that doesn t have anything to do with true economics but optically people screen and say we re perhaps doing something wrong the only way to materially change that would be through some sort of acquisition of some type and we aren t just as an aside consumer lenders who for who come for sale typically have some sort of big problem and we re not necessarily robert q reilly chief financial officer interested in that william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer the people to fix a consumer lending problem i d probably answer that differently if it was a c i problem so i don t see that we have either the need economically or the opportunity to dramatically change that mix given where we re starting from robert q reilly chief financial officer nor do we want to slow down the high quality commercial growth which we re good at kevin barker piper jaffray analyst all right thank you for taking my questions william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer yeah operator the next question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities please proceed mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst hi i just wanted to follow up more on the solution center expansion and understand your thought process a little bit more i thought going back a few years you were looking at a market digital only expansion and you called that an experiment so should we take from this that now as you expand out of market you re only doing that with these solution centers and how many solution centers do you think you need in each of these markets to have the critical mass that you that s necessary william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer that s a fair question mike it s we always talked about going out digitally thin and building branches largely following our c i expansion what s changed is we re going to build more than we had originally assumed so in dallas if i was thinking 5 we re now thinking 10 or 15 those are soft numbers having said all that of course national digital is national and in markets where we have no presence and in fact some of our greatest growth is coming from parts of the country where we don t have any presence in c i or retail and we don t intend to build branches so it will be a mix all i m suggesting here is that certain markets where we had where we thought we d build a couple of branches it s becoming clear that you can actually get a higher return in those markets by building more branches and i don t know if that s a function of just better brand presence a higher return on your marketing or exactly what s driving it but that s exactly why we re doing test and learn in all these different places with different levers to see what gives us the most economic growth mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst and i mean just how do you frame who you are i mean when i go to your website it doesn t say that you re a national retail bank so is your intention to be across the country with solution centers i mean you highlighted i guess four cs here along with yeah william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer that s interesting i didn t know that was on our website i m going to change that this afternoon mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst it says look it says the east it says the midwest it says the southeast and william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer yeah and i think traditionally of course we re following where we have physical footprint it s a practical matter mike our ambition is to be a national retail bank the form that that takes for us and for everybody continues to evolve my own belief is that over time that we ll involve having physical presence in all the msas in this country done over whatever period of time as we continue to thin our saturated markets i don t have a timeline on when that plays out but i have this or we have this belief that fundamentally if you sit in your existing region and simply try to protect your region while you have the large banks coming in so bofa and jpmorgan are in pittsburgh if i simply sit and protect pittsburgh i will lose because they will take share and therefore we have to go out and compete in markets where they have share today and we pull share if you sit in your existing region you ll atrophy through time and so our strategy is to go national execute on it mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst and when you say physical so when you say physical physical presence in all msas do you mean like the top 50 top 20 top 100 and william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer yeah to be determined but assume it s a top 50 but all of that is that isn t next year s plan and it isn t the year after that it s just the practical outcome of the transformation you re seeing in banking where more and more is done digitally the bigger banks are getting larger the inability to simply defend a regional footprint in my view on a cost efficient basis suggests that you need to reach the whole country and pull share where you can pull share that s what we re going to do over time it will evolve as we go and that s why we re doing the test and learn we re doing today so we don t do a massive spend and then have to reel it back in yeah mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst and then last follow up and this is very helpful why not isn t it tougher if you don t have the brand name outside of the market i mean some of the largest banks are already known when they go into market whereas pnc going into i don t know what do you have here houston dallas it s not going to be as well known on the retail side and then why not just jump start the whole process and buy a bank and i know everybody always says we re not going to buy a bank we re not going to buy a bank and but national city your annual report highlights a decade later that was a success so why not accelerate this kind of national retail bank ambition with an acquisition william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer i don t i m not exactly sure what that has to do with brand because the brand build ultimately comes from spend in the local market and national markets as well but you could most definitely accelerate share through an acquisition it issue and you ve heard me talk about this mike if you buy the small bank you re getting a lot of stuff you really don t want at a multiple of book value we want the accounts but we more often than not don t want to have anything to do with the balance sheet and the branches that you get are in the wrong place with the wrong technology with the wrong style and the wrong in place so there s just not a return on it i wish there was if you jump up in scale look if there was another national city less than book value that we can do and then of course we would do it but that s a value question yes that would accelerate what we re doing but today at today s prices and today s opportunities it s a much much lower return than doing what we re doing mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst got it all right thanks a lot operator the next question comes from the line of brian klock with keefe bruyette woods please proceed brian klock keefe bruyette and woods analyst good morning gentlemen robert q reilly chief financial officer good morning brian klock keefe bruyette and woods analyst rob i just had a quick follow up question on the guidance around revenue for the full year it seems like the taking the first half of the year and the guidance for the third quarter it seems like the fourth quarter would imply somewhere around 140 million 150 million of revenue higher than the third quarter guide so i think you have in there there s probably the gain in there related to the mutual fund business that part that you re selling to federated is there anything else in there or is that i think that was like a 52 million sale price if i remember correctly robert q reilly chief financial officer yeah so let me just take a shot at so again so i think the spirit of your question is that we stand by our guidance and feel confident around that there is some volatility in that other non interest income number and that s nothing new and it tends to average out over the course of the year so in the second quarter it was a bit elevated because of all the reasons that i mentioned in addition to the sale of the retirement business so it ran a little bit higher than what we expected and that was included in our guidance so when i look at the third quarter guidance how i do that is a combined what i see in the next 90 days along with patterns that tend to emerge and then beyond that i go by the pattern so probably a little bit less in the third quarter in other non interest income than we had in the second quarter and then in the fourth quarter to your point we do have a sale of the mutual fund business that we ve announced that will be in there that will otherwise elevate that number so you re on the right track yeah brian klock keefe bruyette and woods analyst okay and the rest like you had some good capital markets business so that other piece of it could just be some of the seasonality that might go through robert q reilly chief financial officer yeah that s right yeah that s right brian klock keefe bruyette and woods analyst okay all right thanks for your time appreciate it robert q reilly chief financial officer sure operator the next question comes from the line of saul martinez with ubs please proceed saul martinez ubs analyst hey guys wanted to get your perspective on the sort of the trajectory of deposit cost and deposit betas on the way down because obviously deposit betas were low on the way up you can make the argument that they will be low on the way down but we also wanted your perspective on the timing of when we actually see fed rate cuts start to filter into interest bearing deposit costs because historically if i look at the data there is usually a quarter two quarter lag between when the fed cuts and when you actually start to see the benefit in deposit costs and there is even a little bit of a lag in terms of when deposit migration stops happening into interest bearing account so how do i with if we were to see a july cut how quickly do you think it actually filters into your deposit your overall deposit cost is it is there a one or two quarter lag or do you feel like you should be able to see that filter into the deposit costs which i think was 103 basis point this quarter william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer so remember the wholesale c i deposit rates will kind of drop instantaneously so we re really talking about what happens in retail and i think you will see it take effect all else equal pretty quickly the one thing that concerns me a little bit is if you look at the entire industry there are people who have been pushing on loan to deposit ratios protecting nim by effectively allowing deposits to run off and they are now trying to reverse that so competition for deposits even as rates drop could continue as we ve seen loan growth outpace deposit growth for most of the middle size banks for a period of time now so that s kind of the unknown in my mind in terms of what actually happens to consumer deposit costs robert q reilly chief financial officer and just add to that so it will be driven more by competitive pressures rather than the banks abilities to move quickly william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer yeah saul martinez ubs analyst and do you think the with a greater importance of online banks digital banks today than we ve had in the past also plays into that and maybe limits the ability or willingness of banks to reduce costs especially on the consumer side william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer yeah i think it does i think we have seen the impact of online banks on deposit growth and mix generally and i think that s going to have an impact not just on if rates go down but as we roll forward increasingly over time i think you ll see betas actually be faster and faster because the online bank rate is more deposits migrate toward that becomes real time saul martinez ubs analyst right william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer yeah i don t have a timeline for that i just i it s happening right you can t ignore it saul martinez ubs analyst right quick follow up on commercial credit obviously you made clear that the uptick in npas you re not overly worried about that but are there any segments or geographies or size of companies that you feel have a little bit more strain is there anything you re keeping a closer eye out for in terms of potential credit weakness william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer it s the traditional stuff there is some real estate on the margin on the retail side that everybody has talked about but it s fine there s transportation companies are struggling for a variety of costs at the margin but we re not over exposed to that so there is a bunch of little stuff but there is nothing inside of to rob s point i went through every single ad to our watchlist and they all had their own idiosyncratic story all in separate industries all with a reasonable explanation that largely had nothing to do with the economy saul martinez ubs analyst right ok thank you very much william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer sure robert q reilly chief financial officer yeah operator the next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies please proceed ken usdin jefferies analyst hey guys just thanks just one a follow up on tailoring so bill having heard all the commentary you made about just the long term environment for the sector how would you start to prioritize the potential benefits from that capital free up if even you go forward and say there is no value opportunities for traditional banks how do you start to strategize and prioritize about what the best and incremental uses of that capital if a deal is not the right amount the right usage at the time thanks william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer well i think look you re going to get the standard answer of course we invest in our business and we ve been investing a lot in our business for the last multiple period of years and that will continue but we have an ability for the foreseeable future in my view to generate capital in excess of what we can intelligently deploy in growth and so we get into a question of dividend and share buyback and i guess i would suggest you just look at our actions this year to give to foreshadow the way we think about and what we might be doing going forward ken usdin jefferies analyst yeah and is there anything left in the kit that you don t have on the non bank side that you ve been getting out of some businesses as you ve called up and streamline some other things but is there anything that you re still looking forward to deepening or the aspects of things that you don t have that you still need to offer as you again round out that product offering william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer there is a lot of stuff we look at at the margin inside of payments and other things we re doing in the c i space on advisory the issue in the payment space is finding value there given the multiple you pay and our need to be able to scale whatever that business model is to justify the multiple we look but we haven t really hit on anything of any size but we ll continue to look robert q reilly chief financial officer but there s no material william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer there s not a hole yeah kevin barker piper jaffray analyst got it all right thanks guys robert q reilly chief financial officer yeah thank you

income of 1 4 billion or 2 88 per diluted common share for the second quarter by virtually every measure it was a successful quarter you saw we generated really strong growth in loans and deposits we grew total revenues both nii and non interest income increased managed expenses well generated positive operating leverage and delivered strong returns building on the strong first quarter we re pleased where where we sit on performance through the first half of this year credit quality remains strong we continue to see no cracks really on either the commercial or the consumer side our loan growth this quarter continued to be driven by the commercial side but we did see growth in consumer as well and inside of our strong commercial loan growth we saw a drop in yields consistent with lower interest rates libor sets basically and some further spread compression the effect was particularly impactful on the margin this quarter at the same time we continue to have great success in cross selling fee based products to these clients and our economic profit on the total relationships continues to be really healthy pipelines are solid going into the third quarter sales in our corporate banking segment in june actually tied a monthly record high and treasury management and capital markets revenue also set quarterly records in terms of market expansion we continue to generate strong results in c ib with our new markets and we will take our middle market corporate banking franchise into two additional markets next year with moves into both portland and seattle on the retail side our national digital expansion effort continue to make good progress this quarter our high yield savings product continues to be an attractive entry point for new customers in our expansion markets and beyond and we ve now opened three new branch locations under our solution center model in kansas city and dallas to support our digital offerings and outreach in our expansion markets and we ve been very pleased to see the growth in those branches they re growing at nearly 5 times the pace we d expect for it a de novo branch in our legacy markets looking ahead we plan to accelerate the pace of new solution center openings over the next 18 months or so in boston dallas houston and nashville we continue to return capital to shareholders even as we maintained a strong capital position i m sure you ve seen we recently announced a 21 increase in our quarterly cash dividend on common stock raising the dividend to 1 15 per share on top of a substantial increase in our share repurchase programs and as we look at the current environment and the remainder of the year ahead there is obviously some uncertainty in the economy and the outlook for rates that of course is beyond our control but we will continue to invest in our businesses particularly in customer facing innovation to keep improving the customer experience and further expand our product and service offerings to meet our customers evolving needs as always i want to thank our employees for their continued hard work and with that i ll turn it over to rob to take you through our second quarter results in a little more detail robert q reilly chief financial officer thanks bill and good morning everyone as bill just mentioned we reported second quarter net income of 1 4 billion or 2 88 per diluted common share our balance sheet is on slide four and is presented on an average basis average total loans grew 6 3 billion or 3 to approximately 235 billion linked quarter loan growth compared to the second quarter of 2018 was 12 2 billion or 5 investment securities of 83 6 billion increased 1 3 billion or 2 primarily due to purchases of agency rmbs securities increased 6 1 billion or 8 year over year our cash balances at the fed averaged 13 2 billion for the second quarter down 1 5 billion linked quarter and 7 5 billion year over year deposits grew 5 7 billion or 2 linked quarter and 11 9 billion or 5 year over year as of june 30 2019 our basel iii common equity tier 1 ratio was estimated to be 9 7 compared with 9 8 as of march 31 2019 our tangible book value was 80 76 per common share as of june 30th an increase of 12 compared to a year ago our return on average assets for the second quarter was 1 39 up 5 basis points from the first quarter and our return on tangible common equity was 14 82 an increase of 69 basis points slide five shows our loans and deposits in more detail average loans grew 6 3 billion or 3 over the first quarter with broad based growth in both commercial and consumer lending commercial lending balances increased 5 4 billion or 3 linked quarter with particularly strong growth in our secured lending portfolio on the consumer side balances increased approximately 900 million or 1 linked quarter with growth in residential real estate auto and credit card somewhat offset by runoff in our home equity and education loans compared to the same period a year ago average loans increased 5 or 12 2 billion average deposits increased approximately 5 7 billion in the second quarter compared with the first quarter reflecting growth in both commercial and consumer deposits the growth was primarily in interest bearing deposits however average non interest bearing deposits posted a small increase as well compared to the same quarter a year ago average deposits increased by 11 9 billion or 5 as you can see on slide five our capital return to shareholders has been substantial over the past several years through a combination of share repurchases and dividends while maintaining an overall strong capital position in the second quarter we completed the common stock repurchase programs we announced last year and last month we announced a new plan to repurchase up to 4 3 billion of shares over the next four quarters this represents a 48 increase over our recently completed share repurchase programs additionally last week our board of directors approved a 21 increase in the quarterly dividend to an all time high of 1 15 per share effective with the august dividend as you can see on slide six first quarter total revenue was 4 4 billion up 153 million linked quarter or 4 net interest income was up 23 million or 1 compared with the first quarter non interest income increased 130 million or 7 linked quarter reflecting seasonally higher fee income as well as an increase in other non interest income non interest expense increased 33 million or 1 compared with the first quarter as expenses continued to be well managed provision for credit losses in the second quarter was 180 million a 9 million linked quarter decrease our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 16 6 for the full year 2019 we continue to expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 17 now let s discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail turning to slide seven net interest income of 2 5 billion was up 23 million or 1 compared with the first quarter the increase reflects higher loan balances as well as an additional day in the quarter partially offset by lower commercial loan yields and higher interest bearing liability balances net interest income grew 85 million or 4 year over year driven by higher earning asset yields and balances which were partially offset by higher funding costs and balances net interest margin decreased to 2 91 in the second quarter the primary driver of this decline was commercial loan yields which were impacted by a decrease in libor rates as well as narrower spreads additionally deposit rates increased 5 basis points during the quarter non interest income increased 7 linked quarter and 2 year over year importantly fee income grew 5 linked quarter with increases across all fee categories the main drivers of the 71 million linked quarter fee increase were asset management revenue which includes our equity investment in blackrock increased 8 million reflecting higher average equity markets consumer services increased 21 million and service charges on deposits increased 3 million due to seasonally higher transaction volumes and customer growth corporate services increased 22 million driven by higher treasury management product revenue and loan syndication fees and residential mortgage non interest income increased 17 million due to higher loan sales revenue and a positive rmsr valuation adjustment partially offset by lower servicing revenue finally other non interest income increased 59 million linked quarter reflecting higher capital markets related revenue including a record quarter in our corporate securities business and asset sale and valuation gains second quarter other non interest income included a gain on the sale of the retirement record keeping business which was announced in the first quarter and was included in our second quarter guidance in the third quarter we expect other non interest income to be in the range of 250 million to 300 million excluding net securities and visa activity this reflects our expectation for lower asset sale gains compared with the second quarter turning to slide eight second quarter expenses increased 1 for both the linked quarter and year over year comparisons as our expenses remain well controlled the largest percentage increase was in our marketing expense which supports our national retail digital strategy our efficiency ratio improved to 59 in the second quarter compared with 60 for both last quarter and a year ago expense management continues to be a focus for us and we remain disciplined in our overall approach as you know we have a goal to realize 300 million in cost savings through our continuous improvement program and we re on track to achieve our full year 2019 target our credit quality metrics are presented on slide nine overall our credit quality remained strong and we continue to see strength broadly in both our commercial and consumer portfolios provision for credit losses was 180 million a 9 million decrease linked quarter net charge offs increased 6 million to 142 million linked quarter and our annualized net charge off ratio was unchanged at 24 basis points overall our allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans was 1 15 as of june 30 2019 virtually unchanged from the previous four quarters non performing loans were up 71 million or 4 driven by the commercial portfolio total non performing loans to total loans represents 73 basis points a small increase in the quarter but down year over year total delinquencies were down 127 million or 9 linked quarter reflecting a decline in both commercial and consumer delinquencies as you know we re approaching the adoption of cecl the new accounting standard for credit losses which will go into effect january 1 2020 we ve been in parallel run since the beginning of this year and based on our expectation of forecasted economic conditions and portfolio balances as of june 30 2019 we estimate that cecl could result in an overall allowance increase of 15 to 25 as compared to our current aggregate reserve levels the majority of the increase is expected to be driven by the consumer loan portfolio as longer duration assets require more reserves under the cecl methodology importantly these are still estimates at this point and we will continue to refine them through the balance of 2019 in summary pnc posted very good second quarter results which contributed to an overall strong first half of 2019 for the balance of this year we expect continued growth in gdp albeit at a slower pace over the second half of 2019 we now expect two 25 basis point cuts in the fed funds rate in 2019 one in july and one in october looking ahead to third quarter 2019 compared to second quarter 2019 reported results we expect average loans to be up approximately 1 we expect total net interest income to be stable we expect fee income to be up low single digits we expect other non interest income to be between 250 million and 300 million excluding net securities and visa activity we expect expenses to be stable and we expect provision to be between 150 million and 200 million turning to slide 12 and taking into account our third quarter guidance we d also like to take this opportunity to reaffirm our full year outlook our income statement guidance remains intact and we are increasing our outlook for average loan growth based on the strong performance we ve experienced in the first half of the year we re now expecting full year average loans to be up approximately 5 we expect the net interest income benefit of this incremental loan growth to partially offset the lower than expected rate environment which will support our ability to achieve our original full year revenue target importantly in the first half of 2019 we generated positive operating leverage and remain well positioned to deliver positive operating leverage for the full year of 2019 and with that bill and i are ready to take your questions bryan gill director investor relations edison could you poll for questions please questions and answers operator thank you your first question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore please proceed john pancari evercore analyst good morning william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer hey john robert q reilly chief financial officer good morning john john pancari evercore analyst on the on your guidance for the full year and it s good to see the revenue outlook unchanged despite the rate backdrop so is it wondering if you could break out that revenue expectation of at the higher end of the low single digits between what your expectation would be for the full year for nii versus fees because it seems likely that your fee outlook is improving here and helping keep that revenue outlook unchanged in the backdrop of the lower rate environment robert q reilly chief financial officer yeah yeah hey john this is rob when we take a look at in terms of our full year guidance what we originally expected we set the upper end of the low single digits probably at that time a little more in nii and a little less in non interest income fast forward to today accounting for the and now our rate environment where we expect declining rates so we d see the nii back off a little bit and the non interest income pick up nii is not down as much as it would be as i pointed out in my comments because of the higher than expected loan growth so probably a little bit more to answer your question probably a little bit more equal contribution both from nii and non interest income john pancari evercore analyst got it william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer yeah so and rob it s clear though what rob is saying nii down a little bit it s relative to our guidance robert q reilly chief financial officer expectation yeah of our original expectation that s right john pancari evercore analyst right got it got it okay and then as it pertains to nii can you give us a little bit more granularity on what you how you see the margin trending i know previously you looked for a couple bps impact but i was through the remainder of the year but curious what your expectation is now that you re looking for cuts and then also what would be the nii or nim impact of 25 basis point cut each just curious on your rate sensitivity thanks william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer we could both jump in right so this was a bit of a weird quarter john because the libor sets kind of gotten front of the expectation that the fed is going to cut so we had that drop in loan yields that wasn t really offset by any drop in deposit rates and other things so i don t know that you re going to see a drop like you saw this quarter interestingly all of what we saw or virtually all of it was on the asset side as opposed to the liability side of our balance sheet here so i think going forward and we do have two cuts in the forecast you will still see nim under pressure but it shouldn t be at all like the drop we saw this quarter having said all that there is a million caveats to mix and other things in there that affect that robert q reilly chief financial officer yeah i think i can add to that just in simple terms this quarter interest bearing assets were down largely driven down by commercial loan yields and on the liability side we actually went up a 1 basis point because even though borrowings came down the deposit rates were up so going forward we expect william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer and the deposit rates were up because of mix shift robert q reilly chief financial officer that s right yeah william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer because of betas yeah robert q reilly chief financial officer and competitive factors so going forward we see the liability to be more in tandem so less compression to bill s point and then on the nii itself in terms of the approximate amount relative to the two cuts that we have we approximate that to be about 100 million william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer relative to our robert q reilly chief financial officer yeah relative to what it would have been william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer if we didn t get the cut robert q reilly chief financial officer if we didn t have the cuts right john pancari evercore analyst got it okay all right thank you robert q reilly chief financial officer sure john operator the next question comes from the line of john mcdonald with autonomous research please proceed john mcdonald autonomous research analyst yeah hi bill the loan growth came in a little more color on where things have been picking up where they might versus the legacy william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer hey john you re breaking up a little bit are you there okay let s go to the next question we ll see if he comes back operator the next question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley please proceed betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst hi good morning william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer hi betsy betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst hi i wanted to understand a little bit more about the loan growth that you generated this quarter i mean you guys are known for being very conservative and careful and this is really eye popping growth so just wanted to understand what the drivers were in particular on the c i side and what kind of legs do you think this has just want to see if this was a really unusual quarter or if there is more to come robert q reilly chief financial officer yeah i can hey betsy it s rob i can start we did have a we had a great quarter in terms of loan growth as you ve mentioned largely on the commercial side although the consumer growth was good too on the commercial i think it was a bit elevated in the second quarter the primary drivers of our loan growth which we d expect to continue maybe not at the same rate we are in new geographies all of which are doing well and then in this quarter similar to what we ve been seeing for the last couple of years really strong growth in our secured lending segment which has better competitive dynamics so those two things happened in the quarter and then on top of that we had strong growth in some high quality commercial just general commercial credit so a little bit more in the second quarter than we d expect going forward which is why we guided to 1 loan growth in the third quarter but those fundamentals are still in place william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer yeah and so we haven t changed the risk bucket the actually the quality of what we ve been originating on average has been better robert q reilly chief financial officer higher william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer over the course of the first half of this year than it was last year betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst no it s interesting because we see in some of the data a little weakness in the manufacturing transportation area energy and those are big borrowers so is there any is there other industries that s really driving the bus for you than this william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer it s pretty diversified the one thing that s in there is we did see some pickup in utilization this quarter which helps a little bit particularly in the asset based lending book although i would say that it actually came down in june so it s i don t know that that s a strength that necessarily continues but it was broad based it s new clients the new i don t remember the stat off the top of my head rob but the new markets are growing at multiples robert q reilly chief financial officer multiples yeah very high percentages off a small base but clearly william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer adding materially to the balances so things are just working they re doing a good job betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst and so do you feel like that is in part because of your size going into these new markets folks are looking for somebody a little bit larger that can take down bigger bites is that part of it and maybe you can speak to the quality of the loans that you re doing is it more like cash flow asset based or is it to fund buybacks and m a william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer well remember that asset based business has been national for years betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst yeah william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer so we re not actually accounting that when we talk about our new market growth so most of the new market growth is coming from our traditional middle market products it s not differentiated by risk the cross sell ratio in the new markets is accelerating quickly and approaching legacy markets so we re just executing well i don t actually i don t know how else to explain it robert q reilly chief financial officer and taking the same approach in this new market that we do in our legacy markets we know how to compete we don t win them all but we win our fair share betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst yeah okay thank you william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer you bet operator and we will try with mr john mcdonald from autonomous research if you could proceed with your question please john mcdonald autonomous research analyst okay is this thing on robert q reilly chief financial officer yeah much better john mcdonald autonomous research analyst all right sorry about that guys i ll move on to the next topic got a big authorization on the ccar with the buyback i guess bill just kind of wondering about your philosophy there some banks front load others are more opportunistic how are you going to approach executing the buyback william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer we spread it through time you can t really front load it anyway you i forget the exact growth but robert q reilly chief financial officer in terms yeah in terms of our plan going forward is what we ve done in the past years which is pretty much evenly distributed throughout the year some others have front loaded but that s part of their submission we re opting to do otherwise william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer yeah john mcdonald autonomous research analyst okay and then rob you ll obviously get some benefit based on the tailoring proposal have you guys done any fine tuning of the estimates of how much that could help on the capital front if the tailoring goes through as proposed robert q reilly chief financial officer yeah yeah john we have and again this is proposed the quick answer is about 65 basis points on our cet1 ratio that s down a little bit from the last time we were asked that question mostly because aoci has changed around so 65 basis points is a good estimate john mcdonald autonomous research analyst and is that pretty much all blackrock then as the benefit robert q reilly chief financial officer pretty much the threshold deductions but blackrock yeah blackrock is the biggest piece bryan is right the other components msr and dtas are down a little bit but blackrock is the big piece john mcdonald autonomous research analyst okay and then just on the credit quality rob anything to note there the npls were up a touch is that just kind of lumpy stuff going on there overall credit looks good just maybe a comment there robert q reilly chief financial officer yeah yeah that s our view john just a couple of deals coming off of really really low levels last year so when you take a look at the percentages to the total loan portfolio they re virtually unchanged we had a couple of deals on the commercial side go to the npa list one of which went to the top there that we ve disclosed but they re unrelated and have instances and circumstances that mitigate what would be further broader concerns john mcdonald autonomous research analyst okay got it thanks robert q reilly chief financial officer yeah operator the next question comes from the line of erika najarian with bank of america please proceed erika najarian bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi good morning william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer hey erika erika najarian bank of america merrill lynch analyst as we think about deposit strategy in the midst of rate cuts could you share with us what kind of sensitivity you assume as you think about mitigating the first few rate cuts and are you going to continue to separately think about your expansion markets in terms of pricing versus your legacy markets robert q reilly chief financial officer yeah sure erika i can start on that obviously going forward in a declining rate environment we ll keep an eye in terms of our deposit rates and if we do get the cuts that are proposed it s likely that our rates would either subject to competitive pressures stable or go down i think in regard to the national retail digital strategy the deposits although they ve increased nicely percentage wise they are still pretty small relative to our total deposits so we ll remain pretty aggressive there in terms of the rates that we pay but of course that will be largely subject to the rate environment and the competitive pressures william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer i think practically betas lagged on the way up there so they don t have as much we don t have as much to go down the national market is interesting if you post in the top couple rates you gather lots of deposits if you re off that frontier it slows down and our strategy right now isn t actually to go out and try to grow those deposits aggressively instead it s to go out and learn exactly the dynamics of how marketing dollars spent give you a return on your investment and the combination of marketing dollars in the physical branch presence affects volume so you won t see as a practical matter i don t think rate impact causing anything to rate impact having causing any change to international expansion in the near term because we re still in the stage of kind of figuring out the levers that drive success in that effort elsewhere inside of deposits we re going to drop them drop rates subject to what the market does erika najarian bank of america merrill lynch analyst that s very helpful and as a follow up as you think about studying those new markets and how you entered those markets is that affirming the decision that we re really in a digitally initiated world and therefore the value of that traditional brick and mortar acquisition for someone like pnc is much lower particularly if it s small in size william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer a couple of things that are showing up very clearly to us the branch builds that we re putting in place are much more successful dramatically more successful than we had assumed and they affect the quality of the customer that you actually book online so our bias and i have that in my comments is probably to go with more branch builds than we builds than we had originally assumed in our national expansion the other thing that s very clear is that this online market is growing we can measure deposits that leave us to go to competitors as well as the deposits that come to us and it s very clear that through time at least in my mind this is going to take a greater greater portion of the market and for banking to be profitable as you see mix shift to interest bearing from non interest bearing and the margin on interest bearing declining in effect for banking to be profitable you re going to continue to see this branch spending in our saturated markets which we ve talked about as we build out the thin so i think this is in motion not just for us but for the whole industry and i don t think there s anything that s going to slow it down erika najarian bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it i think i was unclear in my last question i heard you loud and clear that the branch experience enhances the customer acquisition i meant more that the organic build seems more valuable than the traditional tuck in depository deal william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer oh yes ma am erika najarian bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it thank you go ahead robert q reilly chief financial officer we re going to add to that or william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer no i was just that math becomes it s fairly straightforward when these small depository institutions are trading at multiples of book value robert q reilly chief financial officer and that was one of the things that we wanted to test with this experiment and it is proving out that way erika najarian bank of america merrill lynch analyst perfect thank you operator the next question comes from the line of scott siefers with sandler o neill and partners please proceed scott siefers sandler o neill partners analyst good morning guys thanks for taking the question rob i guess first just kind of a housekeeping one the retirement record keeping business can you maybe quantify the size of the gain that was in other income i guess in a sense it doesn t matter since you ve given guide for other income in the third quarter robert q reilly chief financial officer i can help you with a little bit of the math and you d be able to do it yourself when you take a look at the amg segment information the gain on the sale of the business was it came in two components one was a 60 million gain in other non interest income associated with the transaction was 20 million of expenses the primary driver of that was the write off of the software of our own administrative system that was not part of the sale so a net 40 million gain and again you could see that pretty clearly in the amg segment info in terms of elevated revenue and expenses scott siefers sandler o neill partners analyst yeah robert q reilly chief financial officer and it was and as you pointed out it was part of our second quarter guidance scott siefers sandler o neill partners analyst yeah all right thank you and then maybe bill just sort of a broader question if the fed indeed does go into this rate cutting mode can you talk a bit about what you think sort of the stimulative impact if any would be on your customers i guess the on the consumer side it s a little more self evident but as it relates to your commercial customers i mean would it generate any change in demand or how are you or your customers thinking about that dynamic william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer i don t know that i have any insight into that in theory that s why they would do it as a practical matter i continue to think we re on a we have really low rates today so i struggle to see how another 25 basis points or 50 basis points actually is going to impact what is already pretty low cost of funding for people but we ll see robert q reilly chief financial officer and the psychological aspect of that sometime so scott siefers sandler o neill partners analyst yeah okay perfect thank you guys i appreciate it william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer sure operator the next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc please proceed gerard cassidy rbc analyst good morning bill good morning rob robert q reilly chief financial officer hey gerard william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer good morning gerard cassidy rbc analyst bill you talked a couple of times about the success of the solution branches outside your footprint and they are growing much faster than expected what are you finding is the reason for that success william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer i don t know gerard cassidy rbc analyst that s a fair answer okay william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer no i mean part of it is we design them purposely to be different in terms of the numbers of employees and types of employees so the employees in those branches spend more time than a traditional branch outside of the branch so they re out working events in neighborhoods in centers of influence more than you would see in a traditional branch i think the advertising that is in play in these markets makes people aware of us and our offer and i still think that particularly for large deposits branches matter somebody says look it s a great offer but i m willing to drive the 20 minutes to go see somebody face to face rather than do it digitally that has that s kind of common sense but i think that s been a has had a stronger impact than i otherwise would have suspected gerard cassidy rbc analyst and then circling back to the strong c i loan growth outside your traditional footprint obviously from what you ve said you re not selling or making the loans and prices at a completely different than your competition or underwriting standards the guys on the front line that are making building these relationships for you folks in the c i area what are they telling you why people are coming again i m assuming it s not just the loan is it the treasury management products that you have which are everybody knows are very strong or what s bringing these people to you guys if it s not pricing or underwriting william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer first john you have to remember that we re just kind of starting to see the roll on of this new business as we ve been in these markets for a couple of years our strategy is just to call on people sometimes for several years before we get any business we go into a market we figure out who we want to have as customers and then we just focus on them for however long it takes what you re seeing in terms of our results is mike lyons calls it the wave but basically kind of this catch up with the investments we ve made is we re starting to see growth come from three years of planting seeds if you remember all the way back when we bought rbc we kind of did the same thing right we planted seeds and that effort kind of came alive two and three years later and that s what you re seeing now so it s traditional clients so i would tell you that tm makes a big difference our ability to go in and cross sell when you more often than not you end up leading with capital with credit as part of your intro to the relationship and as you pursue cross sell we just have more to offer in terms of variety of products for treasurers and cfos to choose from we have good products and it s worked for us robert q reilly chief financial officer yeah gerard i d add to that that i agree with all that what i d add is that what we found is the receptivity of potential clients in all these geographies to a pnc calling effort has been very high which 20 years ago was difficult but the receptivity is very high and then once the dialogue occurs it s all the points that bill pointed out we tend to compete very well with our products and services gerard cassidy rbc analyst and then just lastly your federal reserve balances obviously are down year over year quite nicely how low can they go before they just have to be maintained or are you there already robert q reilly chief financial officer well so i think so how low can we go that s a good question i think we are william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer it s a function of lcr they can go down to zero if we wanted to put all the stuff into level one securities robert q reilly chief financial officer that s right that s right william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer one of the issues you saw this quarter was we actually changed the mix on balance of our securities debt to 2a which otherwise would have allowed us to have either less wholesale borrowings and or drop the balance more robert q reilly chief financial officer yeah i think that s all true i think we re essentially at the levels that we expect to be what i would point out though as part of the tailoring proposals as a possible reduction in the lcr levels and if that occurs we can go down substantially our math is much as maybe 10 billion or 20 billion depending on whether it s 70 or 85 coverage gerard cassidy rbc analyst great thank you robert q reilly chief financial officer yeah operator the next question comes from the line of matt o connor with deutsche bank please proceed matt o connor deutsche bank analyst good morning william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer good morning matt o connor deutsche bank analyst i know the period end balances can whip around a little bit but i was just wondering if we look at the securities portfolio the cash you had pretty big increases there that seem like it s being funded with wholesale and just trying to think through like if that as you think about your interest rate positioning or are you pre funding some of your securities or is it just some of that period end noise that i m overthinking william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer yeah there is some mischief between the average and the spot at period end but you are correct that we did because we added some 2a securities we funded that with home loan advances actually and so you see that jump that s all inside of our rate management process we saw value in largely certain types of mbs this quarter and took advantage of it robert q reilly chief financial officer yeah matt o connor deutsche bank analyst okay and i guess i think there was a view out there that the rate curve is maybe overly ambitious in terms of predicting rate cuts and i think folks are still trying to keep some dry powder but if the rate cuts don t materialize or they reverse quickly which could happen how would you think about managing the balance sheet and some of the securities and some of the actions that you ve taken here to what seems like reduce the asset sensitivity a little bit william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer you shouldn t confuse the increase in balances with an assumption that we simply added duration is maybe the best way i could answer that question we saw what we think were irrational prices on certain types of securities that it offered a fairly protected return inside of fairly wide rate moves if rates stay where they are we don t see we ll in fact follow the forward curve there is not a whole lot of reason to want to add duration at this point obviously if because i like you i don t believe that forward curve if that reverses then we ll take a look at it and there is opportunity there robert q reilly chief financial officer but nothing radical william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer yeah matt o connor deutsche bank analyst okay all right yeah thank you operator the next question comes from the line of kevin barker with piper jaffray please proceed kevin barker piper jaffray analyst good morning robert q reilly chief financial officer hey kevin kevin barker piper jaffray analyst last quarter you guys mentioned that you had some expense leverage expense levers you could pull if there was a lot of pressure on rates and if that were to continue are you still seeing some flexibility on the expense side if possible in order to continue to generate operating leverage given the current rate environment robert q reilly chief financial officer yeah hey kevin this is rob i m not sure what the levers that we were talking about before but we can look on the script but i ll answer in the sense that you know we do manage the positive operating leverage we ve had a good first half solid positive operating leverage and we expect that to deliver full year positive operating leverage and that s what we manage to do so on the expense side i feel good about it in terms of what we ve managed if you just go through the categories our personnel expense is up 2 which is consistent with merit that contrast where we were this time last year where we were making a lot of investments in personnel it was much higher occupancy is essentially flat equipment expense is up just a little bit reflecting our technology investments marketing is up that s deliberate discretionary and part of our build out and we expect to continue that but the real savings has been in the all other category which is our second largest behind personnel which is down year over year that s where our cip program shows up the most so i feel good about our expense management what we ve done so far this year and what will we plan to do for the balance kevin barker piper jaffray analyst okay and then shift gears back to some of the loan growth comments i mean consumer loan growth was a focus for you and has consistently lagged the commercial loan growth is there anything there that we can see that maybe develop on the consumer side that will maybe start to emerge and maybe diversify your balance sheet a little bit more between commercial and consumer lending william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer i don t think so i mean the balance the places we are growing are actually growing at reasonable percentages off of smaller balances because we haven t been that larger consumer they re being offset by the continued rundown of home equity and lending which masks some of the underlying growth but at the end of the day our consumer loan growth is always in effect i shouldn t say always but practically always is going to be slower than c i simply because it s on a much smaller base and by the way if you see a dramatic change in that then you ought to start asking questions we re growing at i think an appropriate pace off the base we re in with the products we have as we increase penetration with the clients we have but i don t know that you d see a dramatic turn robert q reilly chief financial officer i don t think it would be dramatic but to just to add to that card and auto are growing nicely and that s all part of our plan residential mortgages are up and that s a function of just higher client activity particularly in the jumbo space while one day the home equity run off will stop running off and then we ll get the benefit of that but but that s the plan kevin barker piper jaffray analyst i mean longer term do you or more broadly do you view having a more balanced commercial versus consumer lending book as ideal or do you feel comfortable with the way it is right now 70 30 give or take william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer so look optically because we are light on consumer we screen poorly efficiency ratio and some other things and our nim is lower because our loan yields are lower that doesn t have anything to do with true economics but optically people screen and say we re perhaps doing something wrong the only way to materially change that would be through some sort of acquisition of some type and we aren t just as an aside consumer lenders who for who come for sale typically have some sort of big problem and we re not necessarily robert q reilly chief financial officer interested in that william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer the people to fix a consumer lending problem i d probably answer that differently if it was a c i problem so i don t see that we have either the need economically or the opportunity to dramatically change that mix given where we re starting from robert q reilly chief financial officer nor do we want to slow down the high quality commercial growth which we re good at kevin barker piper jaffray analyst all right thank you for taking my questions william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer yeah operator the next question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities please proceed mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst hi i just wanted to follow up more on the solution center expansion and understand your thought process a little bit more i thought going back a few years you were looking at a market digital only expansion and you called that an experiment so should we take from this that now as you expand out of market you re only doing that with these solution centers and how many solution centers do you think you need in each of these markets to have the critical mass that you that s necessary william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer that s a fair question mike it s we always talked about going out digitally thin and building branches largely following our c i expansion what s changed is we re going to build more than we had originally assumed so in dallas if i was thinking 5 we re now thinking 10 or 15 those are soft numbers having said all that of course national digital is national and in markets where we have no presence and in fact some of our greatest growth is coming from parts of the country where we don t have any presence in c i or retail and we don t intend to build branches so it will be a mix all i m suggesting here is that certain markets where we had where we thought we d build a couple of branches it s becoming clear that you can actually get a higher return in those markets by building more branches and i don t know if that s a function of just better brand presence a higher return on your marketing or exactly what s driving it but that s exactly why we re doing test and learn in all these different places with different levers to see what gives us the most economic growth mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst and i mean just how do you frame who you are i mean when i go to your website it doesn t say that you re a national retail bank so is your intention to be across the country with solution centers i mean you highlighted i guess four cs here along with yeah william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer that s interesting i didn t know that was on our website i m going to change that this afternoon mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst it says look it says the east it says the midwest it says the southeast and william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer yeah and i think traditionally of course we re following where we have physical footprint it s a practical matter mike our ambition is to be a national retail bank the form that that takes for us and for everybody continues to evolve my own belief is that over time that we ll involve having physical presence in all the msas in this country done over whatever period of time as we continue to thin our saturated markets i don t have a timeline on when that plays out but i have this or we have this belief that fundamentally if you sit in your existing region and simply try to protect your region while you have the large banks coming in so bofa and jpmorgan are in pittsburgh if i simply sit and protect pittsburgh i will lose because they will take share and therefore we have to go out and compete in markets where they have share today and we pull share if you sit in your existing region you ll atrophy through time and so our strategy is to go national execute on it mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst and when you say physical so when you say physical physical presence in all msas do you mean like the top 50 top 20 top 100 and william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer yeah to be determined but assume it s a top 50 but all of that is that isn t next year s plan and it isn t the year after that it s just the practical outcome of the transformation you re seeing in banking where more and more is done digitally the bigger banks are getting larger the inability to simply defend a regional footprint in my view on a cost efficient basis suggests that you need to reach the whole country and pull share where you can pull share that s what we re going to do over time it will evolve as we go and that s why we re doing the test and learn we re doing today so we don t do a massive spend and then have to reel it back in yeah mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst and then last follow up and this is very helpful why not isn t it tougher if you don t have the brand name outside of the market i mean some of the largest banks are already known when they go into market whereas pnc going into i don t know what do you have here houston dallas it s not going to be as well known on the retail side and then why not just jump start the whole process and buy a bank and i know everybody always says we re not going to buy a bank we re not going to buy a bank and but national city your annual report highlights a decade later that was a success so why not accelerate this kind of national retail bank ambition with an acquisition william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer i don t i m not exactly sure what that has to do with brand because the brand build ultimately comes from spend in the local market and national markets as well but you could most definitely accelerate share through an acquisition it issue and you ve heard me talk about this mike if you buy the small bank you re getting a lot of stuff you really don t want at a multiple of book value we want the accounts but we more often than not don t want to have anything to do with the balance sheet and the branches that you get are in the wrong place with the wrong technology with the wrong style and the wrong in place so there s just not a return on it i wish there was if you jump up in scale look if there was another national city less than book value that we can do and then of course we would do it but that s a value question yes that would accelerate what we re doing but today at today s prices and today s opportunities it s a much much lower return than doing what we re doing mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst got it all right thanks a lot operator the next question comes from the line of brian klock with keefe bruyette woods please proceed brian klock keefe bruyette and woods analyst good morning gentlemen robert q reilly chief financial officer good morning brian klock keefe bruyette and woods analyst rob i just had a quick follow up question on the guidance around revenue for the full year it seems like the taking the first half of the year and the guidance for the third quarter it seems like the fourth quarter would imply somewhere around 140 million 150 million of revenue higher than the third quarter guide so i think you have in there there s probably the gain in there related to the mutual fund business that part that you re selling to federated is there anything else in there or is that i think that was like a 52 million sale price if i remember correctly robert q reilly chief financial officer yeah so let me just take a shot at so again so i think the spirit of your question is that we stand by our guidance and feel confident around that there is some volatility in that other non interest income number and that s nothing new and it tends to average out over the course of the year so in the second quarter it was a bit elevated because of all the reasons that i mentioned in addition to the sale of the retirement business so it ran a little bit higher than what we expected and that was included in our guidance so when i look at the third quarter guidance how i do that is a combined what i see in the next 90 days along with patterns that tend to emerge and then beyond that i go by the pattern so probably a little bit less in the third quarter in other non interest income than we had in the second quarter and then in the fourth quarter to your point we do have a sale of the mutual fund business that we ve announced that will be in there that will otherwise elevate that number so you re on the right track yeah brian klock keefe bruyette and woods analyst okay and the rest like you had some good capital markets business so that other piece of it could just be some of the seasonality that might go through robert q reilly chief financial officer yeah that s right yeah that s right brian klock keefe bruyette and woods analyst okay all right thanks for your time appreciate it robert q reilly chief financial officer sure operator the next question comes from the line of saul martinez with ubs please proceed saul martinez ubs analyst hey guys wanted to get your perspective on the sort of the trajectory of deposit cost and deposit betas on the way down because obviously deposit betas were low on the way up you can make the argument that they will be low on the way down but we also wanted your perspective on the timing of when we actually see fed rate cuts start to filter into interest bearing deposit costs because historically if i look at the data there is usually a quarter two quarter lag between when the fed cuts and when you actually start to see the benefit in deposit costs and there is even a little bit of a lag in terms of when deposit migration stops happening into interest bearing account so how do i with if we were to see a july cut how quickly do you think it actually filters into your deposit your overall deposit cost is it is there a one or two quarter lag or do you feel like you should be able to see that filter into the deposit costs which i think was 103 basis point this quarter william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer so remember the wholesale c i deposit rates will kind of drop instantaneously so we re really talking about what happens in retail and i think you will see it take effect all else equal pretty quickly the one thing that concerns me a little bit is if you look at the entire industry there are people who have been pushing on loan to deposit ratios protecting nim by effectively allowing deposits to run off and they are now trying to reverse that so competition for deposits even as rates drop could continue as we ve seen loan growth outpace deposit growth for most of the middle size banks for a period of time now so that s kind of the unknown in my mind in terms of what actually happens to consumer deposit costs robert q reilly chief financial officer and just add to that so it will be driven more by competitive pressures rather than the banks abilities to move quickly william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer yeah saul martinez ubs analyst and do you think the with a greater importance of online banks digital banks today than we ve had in the past also plays into that and maybe limits the ability or willingness of banks to reduce costs especially on the consumer side william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer yeah i think it does i think we have seen the impact of online banks on deposit growth and mix generally and i think that s going to have an impact not just on if rates go down but as we roll forward increasingly over time i think you ll see betas actually be faster and faster because the online bank rate is more deposits migrate toward that becomes real time saul martinez ubs analyst right william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer yeah i don t have a timeline for that i just i it s happening right you can t ignore it saul martinez ubs analyst right quick follow up on commercial credit obviously you made clear that the uptick in npas you re not overly worried about that but are there any segments or geographies or size of companies that you feel have a little bit more strain is there anything you re keeping a closer eye out for in terms of potential credit weakness william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer it s the traditional stuff there is some real estate on the margin on the retail side that everybody has talked about but it s fine there s transportation companies are struggling for a variety of costs at the margin but we re not over exposed to that so there is a bunch of little stuff but there is nothing inside of to rob s point i went through every single ad to our watchlist and they all had their own idiosyncratic story all in separate industries all with a reasonable explanation that largely had nothing to do with the economy saul martinez ubs analyst right ok thank you very much william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer sure robert q reilly chief financial officer yeah operator the next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies please proceed ken usdin jefferies analyst hey guys just thanks just one a follow up on tailoring so bill having heard all the commentary you made about just the long term environment for the sector how would you start to prioritize the potential benefits from that capital free up if even you go forward and say there is no value opportunities for traditional banks how do you start to strategize and prioritize about what the best and incremental uses of that capital if a deal is not the right amount the right usage at the time thanks william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer well i think look you re going to get the standard answer of course we invest in our business and we ve been investing a lot in our business for the last multiple period of years and that will continue but we have an ability for the foreseeable future in my view to generate capital in excess of what we can intelligently deploy in growth and so we get into a question of dividend and share buyback and i guess i would suggest you just look at our actions this year to give to foreshadow the way we think about and what we might be doing going forward ken usdin jefferies analyst yeah and is there anything left in the kit that you don t have on the non bank side that you ve been getting out of some businesses as you ve called up and streamline some other things but is there anything that you re still looking forward to deepening or the aspects of things that you don t have that you still need to offer as you again round out that product offering william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer there is a lot of stuff we look at at the margin inside of payments and other things we re doing in the c i space on advisory the issue in the payment space is finding value there given the multiple you pay and our need to be able to scale whatever that business model is to justify the multiple we look but we haven t really hit on anything of any size but we ll continue to look robert q reilly chief financial officer but there s no material william s demchak chairman president and chief executive officer there s not a hole yeah kevin barker piper jaffray analyst got it all right thanks guys robert q reilly chief financial officer yeah thank you

dollar turns into consolidation in asian session but it s able to maintain most of this week s gain the greenback s fate remains heavily dependent on whether fed will cut interest rates later in the

powell reiterates pledge to act as appropriate fed chair jerome powell s speech in paris on tuesday was largely similar to what he s said recently he reiterated the pledged to act as appropriate to sustain the expansion with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective in the baseline outlook fed expected growth to remain solid labor markets to stay strong and inflation to move back up and run near 2 percent however uncertainties about this outlook have increased particularly regarding trade developments and global growth powell also noted the influences between monetary policies in different countries financial markets trade and confidence channels and he noted pursuing our domestic mandates in this new world requires that we understand the anticipated effects of these interconnections and incorporate them into our policy decision making fed evans on basis of inflation alone a couple of rate cuts could be needed chicago fed president charles evans probably most dovish fomc member said on the basis of inflation alone i could feel confident in arguing for a couple of rate cuts before the end of the year he said in a cnbc interview yesterday that in order to get inflation up to 2 25 over the next three years i need 50 basis points of more accommodation and maybe that s not quite enough though he also acknowledged that the economy is doing well and we are ten years into an expansion but after missing the inflation target for a decade two and a quarter or a little bit more would be about appropriate fed kaplan tactical rate cut could address risks seen in bond markets dallas fed president robert kaplan said yesterday that the best argument for him to support rate cut is the shape of the yield curve and a tactical reduction of a quarter point could address the risks seen by bond investors he also said that inflation is likely to remain low because of the change in the economy and the link between wages and prices he added businesses are not able to pass on higher costs to customers because of stiff competition they have to absorb lower profits so they don t lose market share separately san francisco fed president mary daly said she s not leaning one way or the other on july interest rate decision and she will learn a lot in the next two months regarding whether rates would be lower by year end on the one hand she noted it s too early to tell if additional stimulus was needed and she saw no clouds looming on consumer spending and labor market on the other hand daly noted business felt uncertain she

downturn associated with the escalation in the us china trade dispute and a further escalation of global trade tensions could pose a significant risk to the outlook for japan also recent imposition of export restrictions on korea has increased geopolitical tensions boe cunliffe could see stockpiling cycle build up again in q3 on brexit in an interview with newcastle journal yesterday boe deputy governor jon cunliffe said i haven t picked up a strong sense that the economy is contracting and people are seeing big drops in demand q2 will likely be weak due to unwinding of stocks but he added with q1 and the second quarter of this year you won t get a very accurate read on the underlying nature of the economy additionally there is a brexit decision point coming up on october 31 and we don t know whether we ll leave or stay or whether there ll be an extension he added we could see that stockpiling cycle build up again looking ahead inflation data will be major focus today uk will

calgary july 17 2019 prnewswire the kinder morgan canada limited tsx kml board of directors has declared a dividend for the second quarter of 2019 of 0 1625 per restricted voting share 0 65 annualized payable on august 15 2019 to restricted voting shareholders of record as of july 31 2019 kml s restricted voting share dividends are eligible dividends for canadian income tax purposes i congratulate every kml employee for their focus and dedication to business during the strategic review that concluded in may as previously announced said kml board chairman and ceo steve kean the kml pipelines and terminals segments performance for the quarter was very strong kml continues to be a valuable entity with assets that are underpinned by multi year take or pay contracts with high quality customers and stable cash flows noted dax sanders kml chief financial officer kml reported second quarter income from continuing operations of 21 6 million a decrease of 1 9 million from the second quarter of 2018 the quarter over quarter variance in income from continuing operations was negatively impacted by the recognition of a non recurring gain on an asset sale during the second quarter of 2018 distributable cash flow dcf from continuing operations was 28 3 million down 22 percent compared to the comparable prior year period dcf from continuing operations was negatively impacted by a 9 million increase in cash tax payments due to the change from a net operating loss to a taxable position as a result of the trans mountain sale income from continuing operations and dcf both benefited from greater contributions from ongoing operations in the pipelines and terminals segments versus the same period in 2018 in the second quarter kml generated earnings per restricted voting share from continuing operations of 0 12 kml produced dcf from continuing operations of 0 24 per restricted voting share relative to our declared 0 1625 per restricted voting share dividend resulting in 2 8 million in excess coverage over the dividend for the first half of 2019 kml generated net income of 42 9 million adjusted ebitda of 104 8 million and dcf of 50 7 million overview of business segments due to the recognition of the gain on the sale of an edmonton area pipeline lateral in the second quarter of 2018 earnings in our terminals segment were down 5 percent in the second quarter of 2019 compared to that prior period excluding that gain recognition contributions from the segment were actually up 15 percent compared to the second quarter of 2018 noted john schlosser kml president earnings contributions from the edmonton area terminals were up nearly 17 percent compared to the second quarter of 2018 driven primarily by storage capacity additions at our new base line terminal joint venture volume at our edmonton area terminals was down 1 8 million barrels or 8 percent year over year as mandated production curtailments continue to compress pricing differentials and pressure crude by rail economics the take or pay nature of our contracts largely insulates segment earnings from short term volume fluctuations contributions from our vancouver wharves facility were flat compared to the second quarter of 2018 continued schlosser also this quarter with all material permits secured we began construction activities on the distillate storage expansion project at the wharves facility during this 43 million capital project we will construct two new distillate tanks with combined storage capacity of 200 000 barrels and enhance railcar unloading capabilities the project is supported by a 20 year initial term take or pay contract with an affiliate of a large international integrated energy company and we expect to place it in service late second quarter of 2021 pipeline segment earnings were up 1 1 million or 11 percent compared to the second quarter of 2018 primarily due to increased volumes on cochin 2019 outlook kml is on track to meet its 2019 budget which contemplates declaring dividends of 0 65 annualized per restricted voting share generating adjusted ebitda of 213 million and generating dcf from continuing operations of approximately 109 million representing dcf per restricted voting share of 0 90 kml also plans to invest approximately 35 million in expansion projects versus 32 million contemplated in the budget and consistent with the budget to end the year with a net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio of approximately 1 3 times treating 50 percent of kml s preferred equity as debt we do not provide forecasted income from continuing operations the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to the non gaap financial measures dcf from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda due to the impracticality of quantifying certain amounts required by gaap such as realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses and potential changes in estimates for certain contingent liabilities corporate news normal course issuer bid the kml board has authorized a stock buyback program that will allow it to opportunistically repurchase up to two million of kml restricted voting shares the toronto stock exchange tsx has accepted kml s notice of intention to make a normal course issuer bid ncib through which kml may purchase up to 1 999 902 restricted voting shares during the 12 month period commencing july 22 2019 and ending july 21 2020 the number of shares authorized for purchase represents 10 percent of kml s public float based on 34 944 993 restricted voting shares and excluding 10 percent shareholders as of july 9 2019 under the ncib purchases will be made on the open market through the facilities of the tsx and or alternative canadian trading systems at the market price at the time of acquisition as well as by other means as may be permitted by tsx rules and applicable securities laws including by private agreement purchases made by private agreement under an issuer bid exemption order issued by a securities regulatory authority will be at a discount to the prevailing market price as provided in such exemption order kml has also entered into an automatic share purchase plan aspp in relation to purchases made in connection with the ncib to allow it to purchase restricted voting shares under the ncib when kml would ordinarily not be permitted to purchase shares due to regulatory restrictions and customary self imposed blackout periods pursuant to the aspp kml will provide instructions during non blackout periods to its designated broker which instructions may not be varied or suspended during the applicable blackout period purchases by kml s designated broker will be in accordance with stock exchange rules applicable securities laws and the terms of the aspp and all purchases made under the aspp will be included in computing the number of restricted voting shares purchased under the ncib the aspp has been pre cleared by the tsx the actual number of restricted voting shares that may be purchased under the ncib and the timing of any such purchases will be determined by kml the average daily trading volume through the facilities of the tsx during the most recently completed six month period was 228 201 restricted voting shares consequently daily purchases through the facilities of the tsx will be limited to 57 050 restricted voting shares other than block purchase exceptions all restricted voting shares acquired by kml under the ncib will be cancelled kml believes that opportunistically purchasing its own shares represents an attractive opportunity that is in the best interests of the company and its shareholders preferred share dividend in addition to the above described dividend declared on the restricted voting shares kml s board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 0 328125 per series 1 preferred share 1 3125 annualized and 0 3250 per series 3 preferred share 1 30 annualized each payable on august 15 2019 to series 1

as required by applicable law to update the forward looking statements included in this release non gaap financial measures kml s financial information has been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap in addition to using measures prescribed by gaap this news release includes references to dcf both in the aggregate and per share net income before interest expense taxes depreciation depletion and amortization dd a and adjusted for certain items adjusted ebitda segment earnings before dd a and certain items segment ebda before certain items adjusted earnings net debt cash and adjusted net debt cash all of which are financial measures that do not have any standardized meaning as prescribed by gaap non gaap measures dcf adjusted ebitda segment ebda before certain items and adjusted earnings should not be considered alternatives to gaap net cash provided by operating activities net income or segment ebda respectively computed under gaap or any other gaap measures and such non gaap measures have important limitations as analytical tools our computations of these non gaap measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others accordingly the use of such terms may not be comparable to similarly defined measures presented by other entities and investors should not consider these non gaap measures in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of results reported under gaap management compensates for the limitations of these non gaap measures by reviewing our comparable gaap measures understanding the differences between the measures and taking this information into account in its analysis and its decision making processes discontinued operations are included in our non gaap measures in the accompanying tables for the three and six months ended june 30 2018 the non gaap measures dcf from discontinued operations and adjusted ebitda from discontinued operations are reconciled to income from discontinued operations the most directly comparable gaap measure in notes 2 and 4 to the preliminary earnings contribution by business segment tables non gaap measures from continuing operations reflect our ongoing operations and have been presented as dcf from continuing operations adjusted ebitda from continuing operations and adjusted earnings from continuing operations in addition dcf per restricted voting share presented herein reflects our january 4 2019 one for three reverse stock split and is presented as dcf from continuing operations per split adjusted restricted voting share for all periods presented the most comparable gaap measure to the above non gaap measures from continuing operations is income from continuing operations and the accompanying tables and notes thereto include reconciliations of the above non gaap measures to income from continuing operations in addition our aggregate dcf and adjusted ebitda are presented in notes 2 and 4 to the preliminary earnings contribution by business segment tables certain items are items that are required by gaap to be reflected in net income but typically either i do not have a cash impact for example unrealized and realized foreign exchange gains and losses on the kmi loans and asset impairments or ii by their nature are separately identifiable from our normal business operations and in our view are likely to occur only sporadically for example certain gains or losses on asset sales divestiture costs legal settlements and casualty losses dcf is net income before dd a adjusted for i income tax expense and cash income taxes paid refunded ii sustaining capital expenditures and iii certain items dcf is an important performance measure used by us and by external users of our financial statements to evaluate our performance and to measure and estimate our ability to generate cash earnings after servicing our debt and preferred stock dividends paying cash taxes and expending sustaining capital that could be used for discretionary purposes such as distributions or expansion capital expenditures kml uses this performance measure and believes it provides users of its financial statements a useful performance measure reflective of our ability to generate cash earnings to supplement the comparable gaap measure dcf should not be used as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities computed under gaap we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to dcf is net income dcf per split adjusted restricted voting share is dcf divided by average outstanding split adjusted restricted voting shares including stock awards that participate in dividends segment ebda before certain items is used by management in its analysis of segment performance and management of our business the company believes that segment ebda before certain items is a useful measure of operating performance because it measures segment operating results before dd a and certain expenses that are generally not controllable by the operating managers of the respective business segments such as general and administrative expense interest expense income tax expense general and administrative expenses include such items as employee benefits insurance rentals certain litigation expenses and shared corporate services including accounting information technology human resources and legal services segment ebda before certain items is calculated by adjusting segment ebda for the certain items attributable to a segment as applicable which are specifically identified in the footnotes to the accompanying tables if any adjusted ebitda is used by the company and external users of its financial statements in conjunction with net debt to evaluate certain leverage metrics adjusted ebitda is ebitda adjusted for certain items as applicable we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda is net income the company evaluates adjusted ebtida in total and does not allocate adjusted ebitda amongst equity interest holders as it views adjusted ebitda as a measure against our overall leverage adjusted earnings is net income before certain items adjusted earnings is used by us and certain external users of our financial statements to assess the earnings of our business excluding certain items as another reflection of our ability to generate earnings we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to adjusted earnings is net income net debt cash and adjusted net debt cash as used in this news release are non gaap financial measures that management believes are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our leverage individually and in conjunction with adjusted ebitda net debt cash is calculated by adding 50 percent of our outstanding preferred capital and subtracting cash and cash equivalents from debt adjusted net debt cash is net debt cash including 50 percent of our outstanding preferred capital and the cash component as of december 31 2018 reduced by the amount of cash distributed as a return of capital on january 3 2019 to our voting shareholders we believe the most comparable measure to net debt cash and adjusted net debt cash is debt net of cash and cash equivalents as reconciled in the notes to the accompanying preliminary consolidated balance sheets page

despite rising downward pressure from both home and abroad china s economy grew steadily in the first half of 2019 indicating its strong resilience and great potential to secure long term stable development china s economy grew 6 3 percent year on year in the first six months this year the national bureau of statistics nbs said on monday although the headline growth saw a slight retreat it meets market expectations and falls within china s annual target range of 6 6 5 percent the hard won increase was achieved against the backdrop of slower global economy growth with increasing uncertainties the international monetary fund in april cut its outlook for global growth to 3 3 percent the lowest since the 2008 financial crisis meanwhile washington s protectionist trade measures continue to chill market confidence and business investment and weigh down the growth of global free trade however such a complex circumstance has only strengthened china s determination to stick to the path of reform and opening up a key source of power that has fueled its economic development for decades at home china has continued to press ahead with structural reforms and market transition to make the economy more balanced and optimized rather than resorting to flood like stimuli to handle downward pressure on growth china has been increasingly relying on a drip irrigation method to support the real economy and shore up domestic consumption thanks to these efforts consumption now plays a major role in driving economic growth with final consumption contributing to 60 1 percent of economic expansion in the first six months to encourage innovation a major driver of high quality growth the chinese government has taken a slew of measures such as offering preferential tax policies to innovators and ensuring fair competition these efforts have produced desired results nbs data show that high tech manufacturing output in h1 rose by 9 percent over a year earlier 3 percentage points higher than the overall industrial growth to fight the spectre of rising protectionism that is hindering global economic recovery china is calling on nations worldwide to uphold multilateralism and preserve the rules based multilateral trading system beijing has chosen to stay committed to further opening up its market to overseas investors and actively deepening its cooperation with partners around the world over the past years china has fulfilled its promise by broadening market access creating a more attractive investment environment expanding imports and strengthening protection of intellectual property rights earlier this year china s national people s congress passed the foreign investment law a landmark legislation that will provide stronger protection and a better business environment for overseas investors according to china s ministry of commerce the actually utilized foreign investment in china rose 7 2 percent from a year ago to reach 478 33 billion yuan 69 6 billion u s dollars during the january june period and more than 20 000 new foreign funded enterprises were established a testimony of china s huge appeal to worldwide capital nevertheless harder tests still lie ahead and china still needs to summon even greater courage to cope with challenging global economic circumstances and to initiate bolder and broader economic and financial reforms so as to meet its growth target the good thing is china was neither a stranger to nor a flincher before difficulties along its path to the world s second largest economy over the past 40 years this valuable experience coupled with beijing s strong determination to stick to reform and opening up provides a solid foundation for its effort to achieve a more sustainable development
today s session starts with banks and ends with a faang bank of america corp bac and several other banking firms highlight the earnings picture this morning while anticipation builds ahead of netflix inc nflx results after the close remember that for nflx the first faang company to report this quarter subscriber numbers are arguably more important than its quarterly financial performance because they provide an indicator of where the company is heading especially as competition heats up also there seems to be some risk aversion creeping back into the picture after president trump s comments about the china trade situation yesterday see more below small caps out performed large caps yesterday maybe a sign of some investors seeking names less exposed to trade battles this morning bac became the latest big bank to surpass wall street s earnings estimates as interest income rose but shares edged lower in pre market trading revenue looked like it was just shy of the average wall street estimate which could explain the red numbers like several other banks that reported earlier this week bac s earnings in q2 reflected strong consumer demand with spending by customers up 5 bac said in a press release profit in consumer banking rose 13 in q2 to lead all of bac s businesses the company said this reflected strength in deposits and loans also in a sign that maybe corporate america isn t as shy about spending as some recent data seem to indicate bac reported that it saw consistent borrowing and activity from our commercial and corporate clients bac wasn t the only bank reporting early wednesday others included u s bancorp usb and pnc financial services group pnc and both of those came in better than expected getting out of the teller line and up into the sky united continental holdings ual results after the close yesterday also looked very solid with earnings and revenue both beating third party consensus and the company raising guidance one analyst raised the price target for ual citing strong earnings momentum but shares are up just a sliver in pre market trading early wednesday the stock s gains this year are way behind the broader market on the downside railroad company csx csx saw shares crumble more than 7 in pre market trading after the company cut its outlook and cited weak shipping volumes it looks like trade tensions with china could be taking a toll for csx earnings and revenue both missed wall street s projections besides nflx this afternoon brings earnings from ibm common stock ibm and ebay inc ebay microsoft corporation msft bows tomorrow along with morgan stanley ms on the data side news from the housing market continues to be less than stellar both housing starts and building permits fell in june both coming up short of analysts estimates on the plus side single family home building did increase consider keeping in mind that home building is a factor in gross domestic product gdp growth so we might see some analysts lower their already soft q2 gdp projections based partly on this news china worries back in picture stocks began tuesday by marching to new record highs only to pull back late morning after president trump said there s a long way to go on china trade talks while it s arguable that most investors probably already knew this hearing it straight from a presidential tweet helped bring the matter into sharper focus though the u s threat to raise tariffs further was temporarily withdrawn when the two countries presidents met last month it still looms in the background if talks go south with this situation still such an elephant in the room it s hard to imagine stocks really pushing out of the current range where is that range in the s p 500 index spx there appears to be a band of support between 2940 and 2954 according to research firm cfra below that there s the 50 day moving average of 2894 which has often been a support point in the recent past the top of the range would probably be around all time highs near 3015 anyway the spx was coming off five days in a row of being higher and it s just hard to continue that momentum tuesday s slow low energy performance might be because people just couldn t find fresh reasons to buy bank results unspectacular but underneath something to watch banks had a mixed day tuesday following earnings that weren t bad but not overwhelmingly good from three of the big names jpmorgan chase co jpm and goldman sachs group inc gs finished with 1 or better gains while wells fargo co wfc slipped on the surface the bank earnings didn t look too spectacular underneath however they told a story about the consumer in fact you might want to call tuesday the day of the consumer first of all the bank earnings showed mortgage applications up across the board also credit card spending was up significantly debit card spending was down but credit cards were up additionally balances were up those are big numbers calling out the solidity of the u s consumer it goes beyond the banks as transportation companies are reporting full trucks and trains though csx earnings were a notable exception to reinforce it more retail sales for june were better than analysts had expected helping back up what bank earnings indicated about consumers another less positive way to look at bank earnings is to say maybe the consumer is getting a bit over leveraged this would be more of an issue in a rising rate environment but not so much with the fed expected to chop rates later this month that said treasury yields briefly hit one month highs above 2 14 for the 10 year treasury note tuesday after the strong retail sales data the dollar also appeared to get a boost from the data and rose to two year highs vs the british pound as brexit worries continued to flare this week s big bank earnings showing consumer strength could make it even more interesting to see what regional banks report they face a strong headwind from low rates eating into their profit margins but the question is whether they might be able to make up for it with more mortgage loans also the big banks reporting this week aren t too focused on auto loans but regional banks have a big market with those and might see a bounce if people start buying more cars does this mean the retail sector might also do well when it comes to earnings yes but with a caveat the retail sector can t really be seen as a single entity because every major business is so different some brick and mortar retailers likely will continue to struggle with the same online competitive forces that have been hitting them for years others especially some of the big boxes seem primed to continue doing well the heart of retail earnings is still a few weeks away but amazon com inc amzn is due next week another thing worth noting about tuesday was a midday plunge in crude oil after the trump administration said iran might be ready to negotiate about its missile program the quick drop in crude on this news does seem to point up how geopolitics played a big role in the commodity s recent run higher though falling u s stockpiles also get some credit catalysts anyone if you re looking for a potential catalyst that could give this rally more legs earnings seem like the place to focus especially since a rate cut this month is pretty much baked into prices already unfortunately for anyone who wants to see stocks move higher most analysts expect earnings to fall 1 to 3 this quarter from a year ago according to some calculations that would be the second straight quarter of falling earnings or what s often called an earnings recession if that s how things turn out it s probably not much of a base for additional stock market gains however in many recent quarters the trend has been for companies to do better overall than analysts initially had thought with evidence of that building as earnings season advances so each week as we fill in the boxes for s p 500 earnings reports it could be important to watch whether earnings to that point are outpacing estimates if strength starts to build it might become that catalyst or maybe not because in one way the bar moves a bit higher this quarter with all the recent stock buyback activity which hit an all time record in 2018 and is currently on pace to exceed that total this year there s a sense that some people want to see how organic earnings did that means they might look at how strong a company s earnings might have been if it hadn t been buying back stock other one time events like tax credits or sales of a business that temporarily boost results could receive a fish eye from some this issue came up with citigroup inc s c earnings earlier this week the quarterly results received an assist from c s investment in tradeweb an electronic trading platform that helped offset declines in the company s investment banking and fixed income and equity markets revenues however some analysts pointed out that the company s 14 cent earnings beat would have been just two cents without that investment and the stock couldn t generate much momentum jp morgan chase found itself in a similar boat on tuesday when analysts pointed out that 23 cents of the quarterly earnings beat came from tax credits jpm still surpassed expectations even with the tax situation factored out but by a whole lot less this skepticism about companies getting an assist on their results from one time impacts appears to be a growing theme this time around so investors might want to stay on the watch for more of the same as earnings season rolls along two sides to earnings equation one metric people often look at during earnings season is earnings beats which measure whether a company surpassed third party consensus estimates for earnings per share and revenue the fact that many analysts already predict weak earnings for q2 means companies might not get all that much credit for beating low estimates but could get punished harshly for missing also there s a sense that with 70 or more of s p 500 companies tending to beat earnings expectations every quarter some firms might be adjusting their numbers to do better than wall street expects if you feel this way consider looking at revenue and revenue growth the other side of the coin because revenue simply is what it is and can t be tinkered with to emphasize what companies might want you to see since we re on the topic of revenue one complaint heard on wall street after three of the big banks reported yesterday was that revenue didn t surpass analysts projections by as much as earnings per share if this complaint persists in coming weeks it could signal dissatisfaction with company performance and raise new worries about economic health even if earnings per share continue to beat going away for the holidays let s hope your travel plans don t get hampered by continued problems with boeing co s ba 737 max because concerns are growing that the troubled jet might not be back in the skies until next year usa today reported two major u s airlines are pushing back their expectations on when the plane might be ready again and now target november we ll see if they stick to that while the airlines have done a pretty good job keeping people moving despite the max issue travel volume tends to rise in december meaning lack of these airplanes could slow the flow to borrow an airline term airline shares as measured by the new york stock exchange s arca airline index are roughly flat over the last year but up sharply from late may it might be a good idea to consider monitoring any impact on the airline names as we approach late summer to see if ba s issues start to bring pressure the index took a pounding in march when the max planes got grounded on the home front today s housing starts and building permits for june follow tuesday s fair but unimpressive housing market index from the national association of home builders nahb the july index headline came in at 65 which is well into positive territory anything above 50 and up from 64 in may that said it was down from 68 a year ago hurt by weakness in the midwest market it s interesting that despite all the headlines about lower mortgage rates there hasn t been much of a lift for the nahb index the last three months and the nahb said that might partly reflect lack of affordability labor shortages and rising construction costs some of which reflect more expensive materials from china due to tariffs play into high home prices while prices are near all time highs they ve actually moderated slightly from a year ago but anything above 300 000 probably doesn t sound cheap to most people we ve been saying for a while that the consumer seems healthy when it comes to the little things which could help explain why fast food chains like mcdonald s corp mcd and chipotle mexican grill inc cmg are doing well when it comes to big items like homes and cars however the

positive us retail sales for june supported gains for the us dollar versus other major currencies and the price of the usd jpy pair moved towards 108 37 after testing 107 80 support at the beginning of yesterday s session and is now stable around 108 25 at the time of writing the pair is currently neutral awaiting any updates and is closer to further bearish pressure if it stabilizes below 108 00 support technical indicators underscore the pair reaching into oversold areas but still lack incentives to start a major bullish correction as pressure on the us dollar is mounting with the near date of us interest rate cuts for the first time in 10 years to counter the consequences of slowing world economic growth and its impact on the us economy jpy remains the preferred safe haven for investors as global trade and political tensions continue to be supported by the fierce tariff war between the united states and china the war has contributed to slowing the economic growth of the world s second largest economy to its lowest level in at least 26 years in the quarter ending in june financial markets expect the us central bank to cut us interest rates when the federal reserve meets later this month us inflation figures came in higher than expected but did not affect the market s direction to prepare for us interest rate cuts soon technically the general trend of the usd jpy is still closer to move within its downtrend channel as long as it holds below the 110 00 psychological top and the nearest support levels are currently at 107 65 and 106 40 respectively which confirm the continuation of the bearish trend in the event of an upward reversal the nearest resistance levels are currently 108 85 109 55 and 110 20 respectively buying from levels below 108 support remains the best approach in this market on the economic data front the us dollar is on a date with the announcement of us housing numbers building permits and housing starts the pair will react with caution and interest to renewed global geopolitical concerns as the japanese yen is considered one of the most important safe havens

beijing ap china s economic growth sank to its lowest level in at least 26 years in the quarter ending in june adding to pressure on chinese leaders as they fight a tariff war with washington the world s second largest economy grew 6 2 over a year ago down from the previous quarter s 6 4 government data showed monday hopes for an early growth rebound faded after president donald trump raised tariffs on chinese imports in may to turn up pressure on beijing over the aggressive tactics it s using to challenge american technological dominance now economists say the slowdown might extend into next year weaker chinese activity carries global repercussions china is the world s second biggest export market behind the united states countries that feed raw materials to chinese factories from chilean copper to indonesian coal are especially vulnerable to decelerating growth in china the proportion of south african output going to china for instance has shot up from 2 in the mid 2000s to 15 now according to a study by the mckinsey global institute then there s the democratic republic of the congo which sends 45 of its exports to china according to united nations data cited in the mckinsey report in addition emerging market countries are increasingly dependent on chinese investment among major economies australia sent 35 of its exports to china in april brazil 30 and south korea 24 according to the peterson institute for international economics a child plays with a balloon at a clothing store having a promotion sale in beijing monday july 15 2019 china s economic growth sank to its lowest level in at least 26 years in the quarter ending in june adding to pressure on chinese leaders as they fight a tariff war with washington ap photo andy wong besides hurting countries that export raw materials to beijing the chinese slowdown could come back to squeeze american companies like procter gamble and general motors that sell into the vast chinese consumer market slowing demand in china could depress their revenue earnings and stock market value said mary lovely a syracuse university economist who studies trade eventually weaker stock prices could undermine u s consumer confidence and the american economy she said president trump is probably happy that he s starting to tank the chinese economy lovely said but it s a case of be careful what you wish for ihs markit foresees world economic growth slowing this year to 2 8 from 3 2 in 2018 a decelerating china is certainly part of that said sara johnson ihs executive director for global economics but the world faces other problems too for one thing trump s tariffs on imports from a host of countries and the retaliation they have drawn from america s trading partners are crimping world trade and investment manufacturers worldwide are also sitting on unsold stockpiles of goods and growth will likely slow as they pare their inventories johnson said trump and president xi jinping agreed last month to resume negotiations in a fight that has battered both american and chinese exporters but economists warn their truce is fragile because they still face the same array of disputes that caused talks to break down in may the trade war is having a huge impact on the chinese economy edward moya of oanda said in a report as trade negotiations struggle for meaningful progress we are probably not near the bottom for china s economy chinese leaders have stepped up spending and bank lending to keep growth within this year s official target range of 6 to 6 5 and avert politically dangerous job losses but they face an avalanche of unexpectedly bad news including plunging auto sales in the second half of the year the external environment may still be more complicated said a government spokesman mao shengyong at a news conference quarterly growth was the lowest since china began reporting such data in 1993 according to an employee of the press office of the national bureau of statistics dong hui in 2009 the nbs reported growth of 6 1 for the first three months of that year however dong said that later was revised up to 6 4 jittery consumers are putting off major purchases

disrupted sales of goods from soybeans to medical equipment and rattled financial markets the biggest factor in the latest chinese economic weakness is lackluster activity in construction and industry

terminals segments performance for the quarter was very strong kml continues to be a valuable entity with assets that are underpinned by multi year take or pay contracts with high quality customers and stable cash flows noted dax sanders kml chief financial officer kml reported second quarter income from continuing operations of 21 6 million a decrease of 1 9 million from the second quarter of 2018 the quarter over quarter variance in income from continuing operations was negatively impacted by the recognition of a non recurring gain on an asset sale during the second quarter of 2018 distributable cash flow dcf from continuing operations was 28 3 million down 22 percent compared to the comparable prior year period dcf from continuing operations was negatively impacted by a 9 million increase in cash tax payments due to the change from a net operating loss to a taxable position as a result of the trans mountain sale income from continuing operations and dcf both benefited from greater contributions from ongoing operations in the pipelines and terminals segments versus the same period in 2018 in the second quarter kml generated earnings per restricted voting share from

earnings contributions from the edmonton area terminals were up nearly 17 percent compared to the second quarter of 2018 driven primarily by storage capacity additions at our new base line terminal joint venture volume at our edmonton area terminals was down 1 8 million barrels or 8 percent year over year as mandated production curtailments continue to compress pricing differentials and pressure crude by rail economics the take or pay nature of our contracts largely insulates segment earnings from short term volume fluctuations contributions from our vancouver wharves facility were flat

interest expense taxes depreciation depletion and amortization dd a and adjusted for certain items adjusted ebitda segment earnings before dd a and certain items segment ebda before certain items adjusted earnings net debt cash and adjusted net debt cash all of which are financial measures that do not have any standardized meaning as prescribed by gaap non gaap measures dcf adjusted ebitda segment ebda before certain items and adjusted earnings should not be considered alternatives to gaap net cash provided by operating activities net income or segment ebda respectively computed under gaap or any other gaap measures and such non gaap measures have important limitations as analytical tools our computations of these non gaap measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others accordingly the use of such terms may not be comparable to similarly defined measures presented by other entities and investors should not consider these non gaap measures in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of results reported under gaap management compensates for the limitations of these non gaap measures by reviewing our comparable gaap measures understanding the differences between the measures and taking this information into account in its analysis and its decision making processes discontinued operations are included in our non gaap measures in the accompanying tables for the three and six months ended june 30 2018 the non gaap measures dcf from discontinued operations and adjusted ebitda from discontinued operations are reconciled to income from discontinued operations the most directly comparable gaap measure in notes 2 and 4 to the preliminary earnings contribution by business segment tables non gaap measures from continuing operations reflect our ongoing operations and have been presented as dcf from continuing operations adjusted ebitda from continuing operations and adjusted earnings from continuing operations in addition dcf per restricted voting share presented herein reflects our january 4 2019 one for three reverse stock split and is presented as dcf from continuing operations per split adjusted restricted voting share for all periods presented the most comparable gaap measure to the above non gaap measures from continuing operations is income from continuing operations and the accompanying tables and notes thereto include reconciliations of the above non gaap measures to income from continuing operations in addition our aggregate dcf and adjusted ebitda are presented in notes 2 and 4 to the preliminary earnings contribution by business segment tables certain items are items that are required by gaap to be reflected in net income but typically either i do not have a cash impact for example unrealized and realized foreign exchange gains and losses on the kmi loans and asset impairments or ii by their nature are separately identifiable from our normal business operations and in our view are likely to occur only sporadically for example certain gains or losses on asset sales divestiture costs legal settlements and casualty losses dcf is net income before dd a adjusted for i income tax expense and cash income taxes paid refunded ii sustaining capital expenditures and iii certain items dcf is an important performance measure used by us and by external users of our financial statements to evaluate our performance and to measure and estimate our ability to generate cash earnings after servicing our debt and preferred stock dividends paying cash taxes and expending sustaining capital that could be used for discretionary purposes such as distributions or expansion capital expenditures kml uses this performance measure and believes it provides users of its financial statements a useful performance measure reflective of our ability to generate cash earnings to supplement the comparable gaap measure dcf should not be used as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities computed under gaap we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to dcf is net income dcf per split adjusted restricted voting share is dcf divided by average outstanding split adjusted restricted voting shares including stock awards that participate in dividends segment ebda before certain items is used by management in its analysis of segment performance and management of our business the company believes that segment ebda before certain items is a useful measure of operating performance because it measures segment operating results before dd a and certain expenses that are generally not controllable by the operating managers of the respective business segments such as general and administrative expense interest expense income tax expense general and administrative expenses include such items as employee benefits insurance rentals certain litigation expenses and shared corporate services including accounting information technology human resources and legal services segment ebda before certain items is calculated by adjusting segment ebda for the certain items attributable to a segment as applicable which are specifically identified in the footnotes to the accompanying tables if any adjusted ebitda is used by the company and external users of its financial statements in conjunction with net debt to evaluate certain leverage metrics adjusted ebitda is ebitda adjusted for certain items as applicable we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda is net income the company evaluates adjusted ebtida in total and does not allocate adjusted ebitda amongst equity interest holders as it views adjusted ebitda as a measure against our overall leverage adjusted earnings is net income before certain items adjusted earnings is used by us and certain external users of our financial statements to assess the earnings of our business excluding certain items as another reflection of our ability to generate earnings we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to adjusted earnings is net income net debt cash and adjusted net debt cash as used in this news release are non gaap financial measures that management believes are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our leverage individually and in conjunction with adjusted ebitda net debt cash is calculated by adding 50 percent of our outstanding preferred capital and subtracting cash and cash equivalents from debt adjusted net debt cash is net debt cash including 50 percent of our outstanding preferred capital and the cash component as of december 31 2018 reduced by the amount of cash distributed as a return of capital on january 3 2019 to our voting shareholders we believe the most comparable measure to net debt cash and adjusted net debt cash is debt net of cash and cash equivalents as reconciled in the notes to the accompanying preliminary consolidated balance sheets page

president alfa s consolidated second quarter operating and financial results were in line with our expectations and remain on track to achieve full year guidance supported by sequential ebitda growth across our businesses underlying performance was in line or better than expected in all subsidiaries with respect to the individual companies sigma was able to mitigate the impact of higher pork prices brought about by the african swine fever in 2q19 and sustained ebitda growth driven by better margins in mexico u s and latam even though u s pork prices decreased in june the risk of further volatility remains and sigma will continue working diligently to address this situation after getting off to a slow start to the year alpek posted a solid recovery in 2q19 even as feedstock prices declined alpek s underlying performance when adjusted for the non cash inventory loss related to lower feedstock prices was in line supported by better than expected reference polyester and polypropylene margins results from nemak are also in line with expectations which anticipated lower volume in all regions from a combination of softening industry conditions and demand from certain oem customers as part of its ongoing operating efficiency initiatives nemak recently announced that it is preparing to cease operations at a small plant in canada by mid 2020 through the first half of the year axtel has posted better than expected ebitda driven by operating efficiencies whereas newpek reported a smaller ebitda loss quarter on quarter supported by higher oil prices versus 1q19

calgary july 17 2019 prnewswire the kinder morgan canada limited tsx kml board of directors has declared a dividend for the second quarter of 2019 of 0 1625 per restricted voting share 0 65 annualized payable on august 15 2019 to restricted voting shareholders of record as of july 31 2019 kml s restricted voting share dividends are eligible dividends for canadian income tax purposes i congratulate every kml employee for their focus and dedication to business during the strategic review that concluded in may as previously announced said kml board chairman and ceo steve kean the kml pipelines and terminals segments performance for the quarter was very strong kml continues to be a valuable entity with assets that are underpinned by multi year take or pay contracts with high quality customers and stable cash flows noted dax sanders kml chief financial officer kml reported second quarter income from continuing operations of 21 6 million a decrease of 1 9 million from the second quarter of 2018 the quarter over quarter variance in income from continuing operations was negatively impacted by the recognition of a non recurring gain on an asset sale during the second quarter of 2018 distributable cash flow dcf from continuing operations was 28 3 million down 22 percent compared to the comparable prior year period dcf from continuing operations was negatively impacted by a 9 million increase in cash tax payments due to the change from a net operating loss to a taxable position as a result of the trans mountain sale income from continuing operations and dcf both benefited from greater contributions from ongoing operations in the pipelines and terminals segments versus the same period in 2018 in the second quarter kml generated earnings per restricted voting share from continuing operations of 0 12 kml produced dcf from continuing operations of 0 24 per restricted voting share relative to our declared 0 1625 per restricted voting share dividend resulting in 2 8 million in excess coverage over the dividend for the first half of 2019 kml generated net income of 42 9 million adjusted ebitda of 104 8 million and dcf of 50 7 million overview of business segments due to the recognition of the gain on the sale of an edmonton area pipeline lateral in the second quarter of 2018 earnings in our terminals segment were down 5 percent in the second quarter of 2019 compared to that prior period excluding that gain recognition contributions from the segment were actually up 15 percent compared to the second quarter of 2018 noted john schlosser kml president earnings contributions from the edmonton area terminals were up nearly 17 percent compared to the second quarter of 2018 driven primarily by storage capacity additions at our new base line terminal joint venture volume at our edmonton area terminals was down 1 8 million barrels or 8 percent year over year as mandated production curtailments continue to compress pricing differentials and pressure crude by rail economics the take or pay nature of our contracts largely insulates segment earnings from short term volume fluctuations contributions from our vancouver wharves facility were flat compared to the second quarter of 2018 continued schlosser also this quarter with all material permits secured we began construction activities on the distillate storage expansion project at the wharves facility during this 43 million capital project we will construct two new distillate tanks with combined storage capacity of 200 000 barrels and enhance railcar unloading capabilities the project is supported by a 20 year initial term take or pay contract with an affiliate of a large international integrated energy company and we expect to place it in service late second quarter of 2021 pipeline segment earnings were up 1 1 million or 11 percent compared to the second quarter of 2018 primarily due to increased volumes on cochin 2019 outlook kml is on track to meet its 2019 budget which contemplates declaring dividends of 0 65 annualized per restricted voting share generating adjusted ebitda of 213 million and generating dcf from continuing operations of approximately 109 million representing dcf per restricted voting share of 0 90 kml also plans to invest approximately 35 million in expansion projects versus 32 million contemplated in the budget and consistent with the budget to end the year with a net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio of approximately 1 3 times treating 50 percent of kml s preferred equity as debt we do not provide forecasted income from continuing operations the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to the non gaap financial measures dcf from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda due to the impracticality of quantifying certain amounts required by gaap such as realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses and potential changes in estimates for certain contingent liabilities corporate news normal course issuer bid the kml board has authorized a stock buyback program that will allow it to opportunistically repurchase up to two million of kml restricted voting shares the toronto stock exchange tsx has accepted kml s notice of intention to make a normal course issuer bid ncib through which kml may purchase up to 1 999 902 restricted voting shares during the 12 month period commencing july 22 2019 and ending july 21 2020 the number of shares authorized for purchase represents 10 percent of kml s public float based on 34 944 993 restricted voting shares and excluding 10 percent shareholders as of july 9 2019 under the ncib purchases will be made on the open market through the facilities of the tsx and or alternative canadian trading systems at the market price at the time of acquisition as well as by other means as may be permitted by tsx rules and applicable securities laws including by private agreement purchases made by private agreement under an issuer bid exemption order issued by a securities regulatory authority will be at a discount to the prevailing market price as provided in such exemption order kml has also entered into an automatic share purchase plan aspp in relation to purchases made in connection with the ncib to allow it to purchase restricted voting shares under the ncib when kml would ordinarily not be permitted to purchase shares due to regulatory restrictions and customary self imposed blackout periods pursuant to the aspp kml will provide instructions during non blackout periods to its designated broker which instructions may not be varied or suspended during the applicable blackout period purchases by kml s designated broker will be in accordance with stock exchange rules applicable securities laws and the terms of the aspp and all purchases made under the aspp will be included in computing the number of restricted voting shares purchased under the ncib the aspp has been pre cleared by the tsx the actual number of restricted

interest expense taxes depreciation depletion and amortization dd a and adjusted for certain items adjusted ebitda segment earnings before dd a and certain items segment ebda before certain items adjusted earnings net debt cash and adjusted net debt cash all of which are financial measures that do not have any standardized meaning as prescribed by gaap non gaap measures dcf adjusted ebitda segment ebda before certain items and adjusted earnings should not be considered alternatives to gaap net cash provided by operating activities net income or segment ebda respectively computed under gaap or any other gaap measures and such non gaap measures have important limitations as analytical tools our computations of these non gaap measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others accordingly the use of such terms may not be comparable to similarly defined measures presented by other entities and investors should not consider these non gaap measures in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of results reported under gaap management compensates for the limitations of these non gaap measures by reviewing our comparable gaap measures understanding the differences between the measures and taking this information into account in its analysis and its decision making processes discontinued operations are included in our non gaap measures in the accompanying tables for the three and six months ended june 30 2018 the non gaap measures dcf from discontinued operations and adjusted ebitda from discontinued operations are reconciled to income from discontinued operations the most directly comparable gaap measure in notes 2 and 4 to the preliminary earnings contribution by business segment tables non gaap measures from continuing operations reflect our ongoing operations and have been presented as dcf from continuing operations adjusted ebitda from continuing operations and adjusted earnings from continuing operations in addition dcf per restricted voting share presented herein reflects our january 4 2019 one for three reverse stock split and is presented as dcf from continuing operations per split adjusted restricted voting share for all periods presented the most comparable gaap measure to the above non gaap measures from continuing operations is income from continuing operations and the accompanying tables and notes thereto include reconciliations of the above non gaap measures to income from continuing operations in addition our aggregate dcf and adjusted ebitda are presented in notes 2 and 4 to the preliminary earnings contribution by business segment tables certain items are items that are required by gaap to be reflected in net income but typically either i do not have a cash impact for example unrealized and realized foreign exchange gains and losses on the kmi loans and asset impairments or ii by their nature are separately identifiable from our normal business operations and in our view are likely to occur only sporadically for example certain gains or losses on asset sales divestiture costs legal settlements and casualty losses dcf is net income before dd a adjusted for i income tax expense and cash income taxes paid refunded ii sustaining capital expenditures and iii certain items dcf is an important performance measure used by us and by external users of our financial statements to evaluate our performance and to measure and estimate our ability to generate cash earnings after servicing our debt and preferred stock dividends paying cash taxes and expending sustaining capital that could be used for discretionary purposes such as distributions or expansion capital expenditures kml uses this performance measure and believes it provides users of its financial statements a useful performance measure reflective of our ability to generate cash earnings to supplement the comparable gaap measure dcf should not be used as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities computed under gaap we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to dcf is net income dcf per split adjusted restricted voting share is dcf divided by average outstanding split adjusted restricted voting shares including stock awards that participate in dividends segment ebda before certain items is used by management in its analysis of segment performance and management of our business the company believes that segment ebda before certain items is a useful measure of operating performance because it measures segment operating results before dd a and certain expenses that are generally not controllable by the operating managers of the respective business segments such as general and administrative expense interest expense income tax expense general and administrative expenses include such items as employee benefits insurance rentals certain litigation expenses and shared corporate services including accounting information technology human resources and legal services segment ebda before certain items is calculated by adjusting segment ebda for the certain items attributable to a segment as applicable which are specifically identified in the footnotes to the accompanying tables if any adjusted ebitda is used by the company and external users of its financial statements in conjunction with net debt to evaluate certain leverage metrics adjusted ebitda is ebitda adjusted for certain items as applicable we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda is net income the company evaluates adjusted ebtida in total and does not allocate adjusted ebitda amongst equity interest holders as it views adjusted ebitda as a measure against our overall leverage adjusted earnings is net income before certain items adjusted earnings is used by us and certain external users of our financial statements to assess the earnings of our business excluding certain items as another reflection of our ability to generate earnings we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to adjusted earnings is net income net debt cash and adjusted net debt cash as used in this news release are non gaap financial measures that management believes are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our leverage individually and in conjunction with adjusted ebitda net debt cash is calculated by adding 50 percent of our outstanding preferred capital and subtracting cash and cash equivalents from debt adjusted net debt cash is net debt cash including 50 percent of our outstanding preferred capital and the cash component as of december 31 2018 reduced by the amount of cash distributed as a return of capital on january 3 2019 to our voting shareholders we believe the most comparable measure to net debt cash and adjusted net debt cash is debt net of cash and cash equivalents as reconciled in the notes to the accompanying preliminary consolidated balance sheets page

today s session starts with banks and ends with a faang bank of america corp nyse bac and several other banking firms highlight the earnings picture this morning while anticipation builds ahead of netflix inc nasdaq nflx results after the close remember that for nflx the first faang company to report this quarter subscriber numbers are arguably more important than its quarterly financial performance because they provide an indicator of where the company is heading especially as competition heats up advertisement advertisement also there seems to be some risk aversion creeping back into the picture after president trump s comments about the china trade situation yesterday see more below small caps out performed large caps yesterday maybe a sign of some investors seeking names less exposed to trade battles this morning bac became the latest big bank to surpass wall street s earnings estimates as interest income rose but shares edged lower in pre market trading revenue looked like it was just shy of the average wall street estimate which could explain the red numbers like several other banks that reported earlier this week bac s earnings in q2 reflected strong consumer demand with spending by customers up 5 bac said in a press release profit in consumer banking rose 13 in q2 to lead all of bac s businesses the company said this reflected strength in deposits and loans also in a sign that maybe corporate america isn t as shy about spending as some recent data seem to indicate bac reported that it saw consistent borrowing and activity from our commercial and corporate clients advertisement advertisement bac wasn t the only bank reporting early wednesday others included u s bancorp nyse usb and pnc financial services group nyse pnc and both of those came in better than expected getting out of the teller line and up into the sky united continental holdings nasdaq ual results after the close yesterday also looked very solid with earnings and revenue both beating third party consensus and the company raising guidance one analyst raised the price target for ual citing strong earnings momentum but shares are up just a sliver in pre market trading early wednesday the stock s gains this year are way behind the broader market story continues on the downside railroad company csx nasdaq csx saw shares crumble more than 7 in pre market trading after the company cut its outlook and cited weak shipping volumes it looks like trade tensions with china could be taking a toll for csx earnings and revenue both missed wall street s projections besides nflx this afternoon brings earnings from ibm common stock nyse ibm and ebay inc nasdaq ebay microsoft corporation nasdaq msft bows tomorrow along with morgan stanley ms on the data side news from the housing market continues to be less than stellar both housing starts and building permits fell in june both coming up short of analysts estimates on the plus side single family home building did increase consider keeping in mind that home building is a factor in gross domestic product gdp growth so we might see some analysts lower their already soft q2 gdp projections based partly on this news china worries back in picture advertisement advertisement stocks began tuesday by marching to new record highs only to pull back late morning after president trump said there s a long way to go on china trade talks while it s arguable that most investors probably already knew this hearing it straight from a presidential tweet helped bring the matter into sharper focus though the u s threat to raise tariffs further was temporarily withdrawn when the two countries presidents met last month it still looms in the background if talks go south with this situation still such an elephant in the room it s hard to imagine stocks really pushing out of the current range where is that range in the s p 500 index spx there appears to be a band of support between 2940 and 2954 according to research firm cfra below that there s the 50 day moving average of 2894 which has often been a support point in the recent past the top of the range would probably be around all time highs near 3015 anyway the spx was coming off five days in a row of being higher and it s just hard to continue that momentum tuesday s slow low energy performance might be because people just couldn t find fresh reasons to buy advertisement advertisement bank results unspectacular but underneath something to watch banks had a mixed day tuesday following earnings that weren t bad but not overwhelmingly good from three of the big names jpmorgan chase co nyse jpm and goldman sachs group inc nyse gs finished with 1 or better gains while wells fargo co nyse wfc slipped on the surface the bank earnings didn t look too spectacular underneath however they told a story about the consumer in fact you might want to call tuesday the day of the consumer first of all the bank earnings showed mortgage applications up across the board also credit card spending was up significantly debit card spending was down but credit cards were up additionally balances were up those are big numbers calling out the solidity of the u s consumer advertisement advertisement it goes beyond the banks as transportation companies are reporting full trucks and trains though csx earnings were a notable exception to reinforce it more retail sales for june were better than analysts had expected helping back up what bank earnings indicated about consumers another less positive way to look at bank earnings is to say maybe the consumer is getting a bit over leveraged this would be more of an issue in a rising rate environment but not so much with the fed expected to chop rates later this month that said treasury yields briefly hit one month highs above 2 14 for the 10 year treasury note tuesday after the strong retail sales data the dollar also appeared to get a boost from the data and rose to two year highs vs the british pound as brexit worries continued to flare this week s big bank earnings showing consumer strength could make it even more interesting to see what regional banks report they face a strong headwind from low rates eating into their profit margins but the question is whether they might be able to make up for it with more mortgage loans also the big banks reporting this week aren t too focused on auto loans but regional banks have a big market with those and might see a bounce if people start buying more cars advertisement advertisement does this mean the retail sector might also do well when it comes to earnings yes but with a caveat the retail sector can t really be seen as a single entity because every major business is so different some brick and mortar retailers likely will continue to struggle with the same online competitive forces that have been hitting them for years others especially some of the big boxes seem primed to continue doing well the heart of retail earnings is still a few weeks away but amazon com inc nasdaq amzn is due next week another thing worth noting about tuesday was a midday plunge in crude oil after the trump administration said iran might be ready to negotiate about its missile program the quick drop in crude on this news does seem to point up how geopolitics played a big role in the commodity s recent run higher though falling u s stockpiles also get some credit catalysts anyone if you re looking for a potential catalyst that could give this rally more legs earnings seem like the place to focus especially since a rate cut this month is pretty much baked into prices already unfortunately for anyone who wants to see stocks move higher most analysts expect earnings to fall 1 to 3 this quarter from a year ago according to some calculations that would be the second straight quarter of falling earnings or what s often called an earnings recession if that s how things turn out it s probably not much of a base for additional stock market gains advertisement advertisement however in many recent quarters the trend has been for companies to do better overall than analysts initially had thought with evidence of that building as earnings season advances so each week as we fill in the boxes for s p 500 earnings reports it could be important to watch whether earnings to that point are outpacing estimates if strength starts to build it might become that catalyst or maybe not because in one way the bar moves a bit higher this quarter with all the recent stock buyback activity which hit an all time record in 2018 and is currently on pace to exceed that total this year there s a sense that some people want to see how organic earnings did that means they might look at how strong a company s earnings might have been if it hadn t been buying back stock other one time events like tax credits or sales of a business that temporarily boost results could receive a fish eye from some this issue came up with citigroup inc s nyse c earnings earlier this week the quarterly results received an assist from c s investment in tradeweb an electronic trading platform that helped offset declines in the company s investment banking and fixed income and equity markets revenues however some analysts pointed out that the company s 14 cent earnings beat would have been just two cents without that investment and the stock couldn t generate much momentum jp morgan chase found itself in a similar boat on tuesday when analysts pointed out that 23 cents of the quarterly earnings beat came from tax credits jpm still surpassed expectations even with the tax situation factored out but by a whole lot less this skepticism about companies getting an assist on their results from one time impacts appears to be a growing theme this time around so investors might want to stay on the watch for more of the same as earnings season rolls along 2019 07 17 chart jpg figure 1 yields dollar on upswing after falling sharply at times over the last month as the market built in 100 chances of a fed rate cut by the end of july both the 10 year treasury yield candlestick and the dollar purple line began to climb back this week on stronger u s retail sales data and a bigger than expected rise in june inflation data source cboe global markets ice chart source the thinkorswim platform from td ameritrade for illustrative purposes only past performance does not guarantee future results advertisement advertisement two sides to earnings equation one metric people often look at during earnings season is earnings beats which measure whether a company surpassed third party consensus estimates for earnings per share and revenue the fact that many analysts already predict weak earnings for q2 means companies might not get all that much credit for beating low estimates but could get punished harshly for missing also there s a sense that with 70 or more of s p 500 companies tending to beat earnings expectations every quarter some firms might be adjusting their numbers to do better than wall street expects if you feel this way consider looking at revenue and revenue growth the other side of the coin because revenue simply is what it is and can t be tinkered with to emphasize what companies might want you to see since we re on the topic of revenue one complaint heard on wall street after three of the big banks reported yesterday was that revenue didn t surpass analysts projections by as much as earnings per share if this complaint persists in coming weeks it could signal dissatisfaction with company performance and raise new worries about economic health even if earnings per share continue to beat going away for the holidays let s hope your travel plans don t get hampered by continued problems with boeing co s nyse ba 737 max because concerns are growing that the troubled jet might not be back in the skies until next year usa today reported two major u s airlines are pushing back their expectations on when the plane might be ready again and now target november we ll see if they stick to that while the airlines have done a pretty good job keeping people moving despite the max issue travel volume tends to rise in december meaning lack of these airplanes could slow the flow to borrow an airline term airline shares as measured by the new york stock exchange s arca airline index are roughly flat over the last year but up sharply from late may it might be a good idea to consider monitoring any impact on the airline names as we approach late summer to see if ba s issues start to bring pressure the index took a pounding in march when the max planes got grounded on the home front today s housing starts and building permits for june follow tuesday s fair but unimpressive housing market index from the national association of home builders nahb the july index headline came in at 65 which is well into positive territory anything above 50 and up from 64 in may that said it was down from 68 a year ago hurt by weakness in the midwest market it s interesting that despite all the headlines about lower mortgage rates there hasn t been much

beijing ap china s economic growth sank to its lowest level in at least 26 years in the quarter ending in june adding to pressure on chinese leaders as they fight a tariff war with washington the world s second largest economy grew 6 2 over a year ago down from the previous quarter s 6 4 government data showed monday hopes for an early growth rebound faded after president donald trump raised tariffs on chinese imports in may to turn up pressure on beijing over the aggressive tactics it s using to challenge american technological dominance now economists say the slowdown might extend into next year weaker chinese activity carries global repercussions china is the world s second biggest export market behind the united states countries that feed raw materials to chinese factories from chilean copper to indonesian coal are especially vulnerable to decelerating growth in china the proportion of south african output going to china for instance has shot up from 2 in the mid 2000s to 15 now according to a study by the mckinsey global institute then there s the democratic republic of the congo which sends 45 of its exports to china according to united nations data cited in the mckinsey report in addition emerging market countries are increasingly dependent on chinese investment among major economies australia sent 35 of its exports to china in april brazil 30 and south korea 24 according to the peterson institute for international economics besides hurting countries that export raw materials to beijing the chinese slowdown could come back to squeeze american companies like procter gamble and general motors that sell into the vast chinese consumer market slowing demand in china could depress their revenue earnings and stock market value said mary lovely a syracuse university economist who studies trade eventually weaker stock prices could undermine u s consumer confidence and the american economy she said president trump is probably happy that he s starting to tank the chinese economy lovely said but it s a case of be careful what you wish for ihs markit foresees world economic growth slowing this year to 2 8 from 3 2 in 2018 a decelerating china is certainly part of that said sara johnson ihs executive director for global economics but the world faces other problems too for one thing trump s tariffs on imports from a host of countries and the retaliation they have drawn from america s trading partners are crimping world trade and investment manufacturers worldwide are also sitting on unsold stockpiles of goods and growth will likely slow as they pare their inventories johnson said trump and president xi jinping agreed last month to resume negotiations in a fight that has battered both american and chinese exporters but economists warn their truce is fragile because they still face the same array of disputes that caused talks to break down in may the trade war is having a huge impact on the chinese economy edward moya of oanda said in a report as trade negotiations struggle for meaningful progress we are probably not near the bottom for china s economy chinese leaders have stepped up spending and bank lending to keep growth within this year s official target range of 6 to 6 5 and avert politically dangerous job losses but they face an avalanche of unexpectedly bad news including plunging auto sales in the second half of the year the external environment may still be more complicated said a government spokesman mao shengyong at a news conference quarterly growth was the lowest since china began reporting such data in 1993 according to an employee of the press office of the national bureau of statistics dong hui in 2009 the nbs reported growth of 6 1 for the first three months of that year however dong said that later was revised up to 6 4 jittery consumers are putting off major purchases depressing demand for autos home appliances and other goods i don t think the country s economy is as good as it looks said peng tao a 26 year old delivery courier who said he makes 5 000 6 000 yuan 750 870 a month china has been surely hurt more in the trade war said peng i am not very happy about job prospects because there just aren t many opportunities out there the international monetary fund and private sector economists have cut this year s chinese growth forecast to as low as 6 2 a further marked decline after last year s three decade low of 6 6 growth in retail sales slowed to 8 4 in the first half of 2019 down 0 1 percentage points from the first quarter the government reported growth in factory output decelerated to 6 in the first half down 0 1 percentage points from the first quarter auto sales reported earlier fell 7 8 in june extending a yearlong contraction in the industry s biggest market chinese exports to the united states fell 7 8 in june from a year ago urban families the ruling communist party is counting on to help propel consumer driven growth to offset weak trade are being squeezed by rising living costs and slower wage growth qiu wanli who works for an insurance company in the northwestern region of xinjiang said her family has little left over each month after paying a mortgage and expenses for her 3 and 6 year old daughters and two elderly relatives the burden to support the family is fairly heavy said qiu 30 we rarely travel and have no plans to because of financial conditions the fight between the two biggest global traders has disrupted sales of goods from soybeans to medical equipment and rattled financial markets the biggest factor in the latest chinese economic weakness is lackluster activity in construction and industry according to julian evans pritchard of capital economics he said that was likely to worsen because a boom in real estate development is fading combined with increasing headwinds from u s tariffs and weaker global growth we expect this to culminate in a further slowdown in economic growth over the coming year evans pritchard said in a report ___ wiseman contributed from washington ___ national bureau of statistics www stats gov cn
the house of representatives is about to pass a bipartisan health care and tax bill wednesday to get rid of a long hated part of the affordable care act the cadillac tax the cadillac tax levies a 40 percent tax on the most expensive employer sponsored health insurance plans those worth about 11 200 for individuals and 30 100 for families starting in 2022 the tax on businesses would hit the part of the plan above the price threshold it was supposed to go into effect in 2018 at a lower price threshold but was delayed repealing the tax would cost the united states an estimated 197 billion over 10 years according to an analysis by the joint committee on taxation the house bill the middle class health benefits tax repeal act of 2019 has more than 350 co sponsors and is expected to pass with bipartisan support while senate republicans have shown interest in the bill it s not clear whether senate majority leader mitch mcconnell will bring the bill up for a vote the cadillac tax has been a controversial provision in obamacare from the beginning and almost by design its passage resulted in some strange ideological bedfellows in 2008 john mccain campaigned on it obama s advisers endorsed it sen marco rubio included a cadillac tax in his 2015 obamacare repeal proposal but in the 2016 presidential election both hillary clinton and sen bernie sanders called to repeal it advocates for repealing the cadillac tax include conservative chambers of commerce and big business but the issue remains divisive among democrats and republicans even within their own parties the cadillac tax was always controversial and unpopular the point of this tax was to encourage employers to offer less expensive health insurance sarah kliff explained why for vox in 2015 traditionally the government doesn t tax employer sponsored insurance this has created a huge incentive for companies to spend more money on generous insurance plans and less on cash wages this in turn pushes up health care costs across the system when workers have expensive plans with no copays or deductibles they re likely to use lots of health care including trips to the doctor they don t really need the economists and policy advisers under the obama administration who supported the cadillac tax argued that by encouraging companies to scale back insurance benefits businesses would in turn give employees a wage increase there s some evidence that could happen and they said it would only hit the wealthiest executives most generous union plans and major companies which there s not much evidence to support at the end of the day the cadillac tax was literally designed to encourage companies to make insurance plans worse not necessarily terrible but just to reduce benefits and control costs the cadillac tax is one of the most important tools we have to control health care cost growth in the private sector the committee for a responsible federal budget a deficit reduction think tank said in a statement repealing it will drive up health care costs while adding more than 1 2 trillion to the debt over the next two decades and reducing wages by trillions over that time period that said according to a 2018 study by the kaiser family foundation increases in deductibles for insured workers have outpaced any real wage increases for employees so it makes sense that both businesses that would have to pay the tax and labor unions who negotiate generous health benefits for their members argued against it the cadillac tax had some fundamental flaws advocates for the tax s repeal point out a few fundamental problems with it first it s not just rich corporate bosses getting robust health care package it s teachers state workers and other employees who aren t necessarily ultra high earners as kliff writes that the cadillac tax is a blunt instrument there s no adjustment for example for people who live in places where health care is really expensive so the threshold is the same in the midwest where health insurance is pretty cheap as it is in remote states like alaska where it s more expensive to deliver health care it s the same for teachers as it is for bankers for someone who has a chronic disease that really does require many doctor visits and for someone who is perfectly healthy second the way the tax is set up means it could affect more and more plans down the line as written the price threshold under the cadillac tax rises with the rate of inflation so in 2022 an analysis by the kaiser family foundation found 21 percent of employers would face the tax but by 2030 46 percent of employers would be hit that s because health care costs typically grow faster than the economy while in 2017 health care spending grew at nearly the same rate as the economy last year the government projected that health care spending would rise by an average of about 1 percentage point faster than economic growth annually through 2026 that means that down the road the cadillac tax would no longer be on just the most expensive plans it would hit much more than that
watch now if the federal reserve follows through on strong hints that it will be cutting interest rates in late july it will do so in the face of a powerful consumer a record breaking stock market and an increasingly difficult case to make for easier monetary policy justifying a policy easing against that kind of a backdrop might be tricky for the fed even though markets fully expect a cut this month plus perhaps two more before the end of the year the central bank is not normally in the business of easing into an economy that is showing few signs of a recession generally holding fire until more pronounced signs of a slowdown are in view but this is not a normal time in the world of monetary policy and the fed is likely to follow though despite the solid economic signals it just doesn t smell right given the strength of the economic data said chris rupkey chief financial economist at mufg union bank the consumer is back in a big way you really have to ask yourself why they are going to cut rates indeed the latest data points to solid consumers who accounted for 67 4 of economic activity in the first quarter retail sales rose 0 4 in june according to commerce department figures that easily topped the 0 1 expected gain on a year over year basis sales increased 3 4 watch now this really takes the cake in terms of just how strong the consumer is rupkey said the fed has their story and they re sticking to it so despite the data despite the strong jobs numbers they believe this is an insurance cut a risk management cut is necessary for two factors one is the slowing global economy and no 2 is the fact that inflation has been below the 2 target for so long given those two factors i expect them to go if not you re going to hear a whole lot of ruckus out of the white house fed chairman jerome powell in a speech tuesday outlined a laundry list of factors concerning officials along with the usual suspects the slowing global economy and the back and forth trade battle between the u s and china he also cited debt ceiling negotiations in congress a potentially messy brexit and the fed s nagging inability to bring inflation up to the 2 target level it feels is healthy in a growing economy fed speakers pointing to cut

among president trump s more bizarre nominations for office has to be his nomination of judy shelton to fill one of the federal reserve board governor vacancies it is not so much that shelton manages to hold two contradictory views of monetary policy at the same time it is rather that her strident advocacy of the return to the gold standard is totally inconsistent with the trump administration s economic policy approach it would also seem to be a non starter given president trump s my way or the highway attitude to international economic policy issues normally a person would be in favor of either an easy monetary policy to stimulate the economy or a hard monetary policy to exert discipline on the government either way one would not expect her to hold both views at the same time yet ms shelton does exactly that she does so by fully supporting trump s repeated calls for lower u s interest rates while at the same time advocating the urgency of returning soon to the gold standard she promotes the gold standard as a means to discipline budget policy and to prevent financial market bubbles a generous interpretation of shelton s simultaneously holding contradictory monetary policy views is not that she is intellectually confused but rather that in order to win the president s nomination she is simply pandering to trump s desire for low interest rates in the run up to the 2020 presidential election if that is the case the senate should not go along with her nomination on the grounds that if confirmed she would be more inclined to please the president than to make the difficult interest rate decisions that would be in the nation s long term interest the less generous interpretation is that shelton is confused and does not see the contradiction between advocating low interest rates while also supporting the gold standard if that is indeed the case the senate should block her confirmation on the grounds that she lacks the intellectual rigor to properly fulfill her role as a fed governor sadly shelton s strident views on the gold standard do not allow one to easily dismiss the less generous view that she is intellectually confused in advocating the return to gold it seems to have escaped shelton s noticed that the last time that the u s dollar was linked to gold it ended in tears it did so in 1971 when president nixon was ignominiously forced to break dollar s gold link as a result of budget profligacy associated with very large vietnam related budget deficits in a world of free capital movements those deficits made it increasingly impossible for the u s government to honor its commitment to continuously supply gold to dollar holders at the promised rate of us 35 dollar an ounce the distinguishing characteristic of president trump s economic policy has been a very large unfunded tax cut at a time of considerable economic strength and a 50 year record low unemployment rate according to the congressional budget office over the next ten years that tax cut will add 1 5 trillion to the national debt and lead to an average budget deficit of over 4 25 percent of gdp for as far as the eye can see a question that shelton is not asking herself is this if in 1971 budget profligacy forced nixon to abandon the dollar s gold link why would trump s budget irresponsibility not do the same today shelton also seems to be glossing over how difficult it would be for trump to convince the rest of the world to join the united states to return to some sort of gold linked fixed exchange rate system she also seems to underplay how difficult it will be for countries to agree upon the appropriate exchange rates at which their currencies should be fixed to one another in 1944 when the united states lead the world to the bretton woods fixed exchange rate arrangement its world standing and trustworthiness could not have been higher does shelton really think that this is still the case after two years of a divisive u s import tariff policy and of president trump s seeming disdain for international cooperation in sum trump might find in shelton a useful and pliable fed governor who will do his low interest rate bidding in the run up to the 2020 election but it would seem to be highly questionable whether shelton is qualified to serve effectively and independently on the federal reserve s board accordingly it would be a big mistake for the senate to confirm her nomination desmond lachman is a resident fellow at the american enterprise institute he was formerly a deputy director in the international monetary fund s policy development and review department and the chief emerging market economic strategist at salomon smith barney
the fund which has warned that the us china trade war could cost the global economy about us455 billion 648 billion next year said recent trade policy actions were weighing on global trade flows eroding confidence and disrupting investment but they had done nothing to reverse external imbalances thus far instead of tit for tat tariffs surplus and deficit countries should work to revive liberalisation efforts and strengthen the rules based multilateral trading system that has been in effect for the past 75 years the imf said it is imperative that all countries avoid policies that distort trade imf chief economist gita gopinath told reporters higher tariffs have been associated with increased prices for consumers and are weighing on global trade investment and growth including by eroding confidence and disrupting global supply chains she repeated the fund s estimate that the tariffs applied in the us china trade war could shave 0 5 per cent off global economic growth in 2020 global trade growth was slowing which showed that the trade disputes were not simply causing manufacturers to shift production away from china as trump has claimed but that the overall trade system was suffering from the tariffs she said gopinath also noted that disputes over technology such as the us decision to put chinese technology company huawei on its entity list could also fracture global supply chains raising concerns about investment and productivity companies on the entity list cannot buy parts and components from us companies without government approval advertisement the fund said short term financing risks were generally contained since debtor positions were concentrated in reserve currency issuing economies but risks remained for the global economy an intensification of trade tensions or a disorderly brexit outcome with further repercussions for global growth and risk aversion could affect other economies that are highly dependent on foreign demand and external financing it said countries with deficits like the united states and britain should pare back spending in a growth friendly manner while those with big surpluses like germany the netherlands and korea should boost public infrastructure investment and discourage excessive saving it said germany s current account surplus was excessive running about 4 per cent to 5 per cent larger than warranted luis cubeddu chief of the imf s research department told reporters there s a need to ease fiscal policy in germany there is fiscal space to do that he said urging spending on infrastructure while the report assessed the euro s valuation as appropriate for the euro zone as a whole it said the euro s real effective exchange rate was 8 per cent to 18 per cent too low for germany s fundamentals given its high current account surplus the report said that while china s yuan was broadly in line with its fundamentals imf models showed wide divergences with desired policies from an 11 5 per cent undervaluation to an 8 5 per cent percent overvaluation due to uncertainties over beijing s policy outlook gopinath said the imf had looked carefully at exchange rates but saw no evidence that changes had much impact on trade flows particularly in countries that invoiced trade in the us dollar structural changes such as improving access to credit and better transportation infrastructure could be more useful in the short term she said reuters

james ok so now onto the presentation which as always is available on our website and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation starting on page 1 the firm reported record net income of 9 7 billion and eps of 2 82 on revenue of 29 6 billion with a return on tangible common equity of 20 included in these results are tax benefits of 768 million related to the resolution of a number of tax audits adjusting for this as well as a few other notable items that largely offset we delivered an 18 rotce this quarter underlying performance for the quarter was strong with highlights including client investment assets in consumer banking up 16 largely driven by net new money flows in card 11 growth in sales and 8 growth in outstanding no 1 in global ibcs year to date gaining share across all products and regions steady results in the commercial bank with net income of 1 billion while continuing to invest in the business and in asset and wealth management record long term inflows aum and client assets overall for the firm total loan growth was 2 year on year but down 1 sequentially important to note here that these variances include the impact of loan sales in home lending as we continue to optimize our usage of capital and liquidity across the firm credit performance remained strong across businesses and we delivered another quarter of positive operating leverage now on to page 2 and some more detail about our second quarter results revenue of 29 6 billion was up 1 2 billion or 4 year on year as net interest income was up approximately 900 million or 7 on balance sheet growth and mix as well as higher rates and noninterest revenue was up approximately 300 million year on year largely driven by the absence of the card rewards liability adjustment results in the prior year excluding that variance and the other offsetting notable items i mentioned noninterest revenue was about flat with strong performance in consumer across auto lease home lending production and consumer and business banking offset by lower markets revenue and ib fees as previously guided expenses of 16 3 billion were up 2 related to continued investments in our businesses partially offset by a reduction in fdic charges of approximately 250 million credit remains favorable with credit costs of 1 1 billion down 5 year on year in consumer credit costs of 1 1 billion were flat but higher net charge offs were offset by net reserve releases and in wholesale credit performance remained favorable with a net charge off rate of 8 basis points which was fully reserved for in prior quarters once again we do not see any signs of broad based deterioration across our portfolios both consumer and wholesale now on to balance sheet and capital on page 3 we ended the second quarter with a cet1 ratio of 12 2 up more than 10 basis points versus last quarter in the quarter the firm distributed 7 5 billion of capital to shareholders and as you know the fed did not adjust to our 2019 ccar capital plan we are pleased to have significant flexibility with gross repurchase capacity of up to 29 4 billion over the next four quarters and the board announced its intention to increase the common dividend to 0 90 per share effective in the third quarter now on to page 4 in consumer and community banking ccb generated net income of 4 2 billion and an roe of 31 loans were down slightly year on year driven by home lending down 7 reflecting the loan sale i just mentioned however card loan growth was healthy up 8 business banking loans were up 2 and auto loans and leases were flat we saw strong deposit and investment growth year on year with deposits up 3 and client investment assets up 16 growing across both cyclical and digital channel card sales were up 11 as growth remained strong across key products and across the franchise active mobile users were up 12 year on year given continued engagement and our new features for example customers had opened over 2 million checking and savings accounts digitally activated over 60 million chase offers and our enrollment in credit journey now exceeds 18 million revenue of 13 8 billion was up 11 this increase included two notable items that largely offset first the current quarter includes a negative msr adjustment in home lending driven by updates to our model inputs and in the prior year as i mentioned we had a rewards liability adjustment in cards of approximately 330 million consumer and business banking was up 11 on higher deposit nii driven by margin expansion home lending was down 17 although excluding the msr adjustment i just mentioned revenues would have been up 4 driven by higher net production revenue on better margins and higher volumes largely offset by lower nii on spread compression and lower balances in cards merchant services and auto was up 18 excluding the previously noted rewards liability adjustment revenue was up 11 driven by higher card nii on loan growth and margin expansion and the impact of higher auto lease volumes expenses of 7 2 billion were up 4 driven by continued investments in the business and higher auto lease depreciation largely offset by efficiencies and lower fdic charges of note the overhead ratio was 52 and we delivered significant positive operating leverage on credit this quarter included a reserve release in the home lending purchase credit impaired portfolio of 400 million reflecting improvements in delinquencies and home prices which was partially offset by a reserve build in cards of 200 million this is primarily driven by growth and to a lesser extent mix as the newer vintages naturally seasoning and become a larger part of the portfolio net charge offs were up 212 million excluding the recovery on a loan sale in home lending in the prior year net charge offs were up 80 million driven by card as we continue to grow the portfolio now turning to the corporate and investment bank on page 5 cib reported net income of 2 9 billion and an roe of 14 on revenue of 9 6 billion as a reminder our performance was particularly strong last year which featured record or near record revenues in overall ib fees and equity markets with that in mind for the quarter ib revenue of 1 8 billion was down 9 year on year in a market that was also down advisory debt underwritings and equity underwriting fees were down 15 13 and 11 respectively reflecting lower levels of deal activity as well as a 10 year record share in equity underwriting in the prior year it s worth noting on a year to date basis we continue to rank no 1 overall and have gained share across all products and regions benefiting from our continued investments in bankers in advisory we grew share in announced deal volumes and announced more deals than any other bank in debt underwriting we also ranked no 1 benefiting from our strong lead left position in leveraged finance and in equity underwriting we have seen significant pickup in activity since the first quarter and we continue to benefit from our leadership positions in tech and healthcare where there has been some robust activity looking forward the overall ib pipeline is healthy though lower compared to the elevated activity we saw last year and with fewer acquisition financing and refinancing opportunity with our underwriting dialogue with clients remains active and we expect strong deal flow to continue moving to markets total revenue was 5 4 billion which was flat year on year our results include a notable gain in fixed income from the ipo of tradeweb excluding this gain markets revenue would have been down 6 year on year against a strong second quarter performance last year fixed income markets was down 3 on an adjusted basis with relative weakness in emea partially offset by increased client activity in north america rates and agency mortgage trading due to the changing rate environment equity markets was down 12 against a record second quarter last year but due to client activity and a tough compare contributed to a year on year decline in equities derivatives that said cash and primes remained stable with client balances in prime reaching an all time high treasury services and securities services revenues were 1 1 billion and 1 billion down 4 and 5 year on year respectively with organic growth being more than offset by deposit margin compression as a reminder similar to last quarter deposit margin was primarily impacted by the funding basis compression rather than client betas and at the firmwide level there is an offset sequentially treasury services was flat and securities services was up 3 on higher balances and fees finally expenses of 5 and a half billion were up 2 compared to the prior year with higher legal expenses partially offset by lower performance based compensation expense and the comp to revenue ratio for the quarter was 28 now moving on to commercial banking on page 6 commercial banking reported net income of 1 billion and an roe of 17 revenue of 2 2 billion was down 5 year on year predominantly driven by lower investment banking activity due to our outperformance last year and lower nii on slightly lower deposit balances also worth noting here gross ib revenue of 1 4 billion was up 8 year to date on strong syndicated lending and m a advisory activity and we continue to address slowly toward our long term 3 billion target deposit balances was down 1 year on year and importantly up 1 sequentially as balances have largely stabilized in total although we continue to see migration from noninterest to interest bearing deposits expenses of 864 million were up 2 year on year driven by ongoing investments in banker coverage and technology loans were up 1 and c i loans being flat or up 3 adjusted for the continued runoff in our tax exempt portfolio the story here remains unchanged we saw solid growth in areas where we ve been investing including expansion market with specialized industries offset by lower acquisition related and short term financing activity cre loans were up 2 with modestly higher activity in commercial term lending where clients are taking advantage of lower long term rates offset by declines in real estate banking where we continue to be selective given where we are in the cycle finally credit costs were 29 million with a net charge off rate of 3 basis points now onto asset and wealth management on page 7 asset and wealth management reported net income of 719 million with pre tax margin and roe of 27 revenue of 3 6 billion for the quarter was flat year on year as the impact of higher average market levels was offset by lower investment valuation gains expenses of 2 6 billion were up 1 year on year as continued investments in advisors and technology were partially offset by lower distribution fees for the quarter we saw record net long term inflows of 36 billion driven by fixed income and we had net liquidity inflows of 4 billion aum of 2 2 trillion and overall client assets of 3 trillion both records were up 7 driven by cumulative net inflows into long term and liquidity products as well as higher market levels globally deposits were up 2 sequentially and up 1 year on year and similar to the commercial bank balances in total have largely stabilized finally we had record loan balances up 7 with strength in both wholesale and mortgage lending now onto corporate on page 8 corporate reported net income of 828 million including the vast majority of the tax benefits that i mentioned earlier revenue was 322 million up 242 million year on year due to higher net interest income driven by higher rates and balance sheet mix partially offset by net losses on legacy private equity investments versus net gains in the prior year and expenses of 232 million were down 47 million year on year finally turning to page 9 and the outlook on this page i ll just comment on nii which should not be surprising given the changes to the rate environment as you can see we re updating our 2019 full year nii outlook to about 57 and a half billion the reduction is based on multiple scenarios which assumes among other things lower long end rates and up to three rate cuts this year which is consistent with current market sentiment and as a reminder this compares to a rate scenario that has seen zero cuts at the time of first quarter earnings so to wrap up the u s consumer remains healthy overall credit is in great shape and the earning power of the company is evident we delivered strong returns this quarter and the diversification and scale of our business model positions us well to outperform in any environment understanding there is some macro uncertainty and potential headwinds from the rate outlook we still expect to grow the franchise and we ll continue to strategically invest in our businesses in technology bankers and beyond and with that operator please open the line for q a questions answers operator our first question comes from jim mitchell of buckingham research jim mitchell buckingham research analyst hey good morning i noticed that card loan growth was particularly strong this quarter i just wanted to get a sense as to what you feel is driving that uptick and do you think how sustainable is it 8 year over year growth jen piepszak chief financial officer sure so on current loan growth we feel very good about what we re seeing there as we talked about at investor day we have a real opportunity with our existing customers and we talked about how our existing customers have about 250 billion of borrowing off us about 100 billion of that is squarely within our existing buyback so you can think of this as highly targeted to high quality existing customers and for the first time we re actually seeing loan growth in cards as the majority of it coming from existing customers versus new customers and so we re really shifting the paradigm there and we feel great about being able to harvest the opportunity that we talked to you about at investor day jim mitchell buckingham research analyst all right should we expect just sort of you to continue to reduce the mortgage footprint in this rate environment jen piepszak chief financial officer so on the mortgage business i would say it was a good quarter on the back of the rally and so we did see volumes increase and we saw some margin expansion as well and so obviously highly rate dependent but i would say the structural challenges in that business remain unchanged and so we continue to focus on optimizing the balance sheet across capital and liquidity and so looking at loan sales and thinking about derisking the portfolio from a servicing perspective so good quarter on the back of the rally but it doesn t change the overall structural challenges jim mitchell buckingham research analyst ok thanks operator our next question is from erika najarian of bank of america erika najarian bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi good morning hi so i just wanted to go back to what you were saying earlier in that your guide or your guide lower is including up to three rate cuts this year which would suggest to me that your net interest income is quite defensive in the face of rate cuts i guess my first question is could you give us your primary assumption for that 500 million swing particularly on deposit pricing jen piepszak chief financial officer ok sure so first of all i ll take you back to the first quarter where our guidance was 58 billion plus and we talked about some pressure on the long end at that point that pressure has persisted and in fact increased and so we pulled the impact of the long end through in terms of our outlook and then on the short end the range of outcomes are obviously quite broad and so we thought about a range of outcomes of one to three rate cuts and so you can think about if it s one cut 57 and a half billion plus and if it s more 57 and a half billion minus and then based on current advice you can think about the third quarter being 100 to 150 million below the second quarter and then a bit more than that in the fourth quarter given we would have a full quarter at that point oh and then in terms of betas i mean largely speaking you can think of betas as being symmetric and so on the consumer side we saw little reprice on the way up and so there is not a lot of opportunity on the way down on the wholesale side if you look at large institutional businesses like treasury services and securities services we are largely at full reprice there and so there should be opportunity there and then in places like the commercial bank and asset and wealth management we are still ahead of what the model would have assumed but we have started to see reprice tick up there but importantly i would say we re not going to lose any valuable customer relationships over a few ticks of beta and so we ll see how it goes jamie dimon chairman and chief executive officer it s all embedded with your assumption jen piepszak chief financial officer and it s all embedded in erika najarian bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it and just going back to jim s question i noticed that investment securities balances continue to go up and mortgage loans were down another 5 should we think about this as part of the overall you re saying optimizing capital and liquidity and therefore as we think about it going forward we could also expect to see perhaps some release in rwa growth and some release in the continued reserve release as part of the optimization jen piepszak chief financial officer sure so on the rwa side yes that is precisely why we are doing it and so when you see the loan sales in home lending yes they are offset in securities purchases which are more efficient from a capital perspective as well as a liquidity perspective so yes having said that on reserves i mean reserves are not necessarily going to be impacted directly by that because of course that will depend on the environment and the mix of the portfolio that remains jamie dimon chairman and chief executive officer and i would just say that our standardized capital ratio is a 12 2 advanced is 13 advanced is obviously a far more important relevant economic number it simply does not make sense to own all mortgages when you can frame by standardizing and can t securitize erika najarian bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it thank you operator our next question comes from mike mayo of wells fargo mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst hi so the efficiency ratio went from 56 to 55 year over year and i guess that s with some accelerated tech spending so do you plan to keep this pace of tech spending going and what s the current update on that tech spending where is it connecting where is it not connecting because i think you said it accelerated for a couple of years and maybe we d see more results in 2020 2021 jamie dimon chairman and chief executive officer can i just take that one so it s about 11 and half billion dollars today i think it was a little bit lower last year if we had to say where it is today for next year it would be something like 11 and a half and i think it s becoming more efficient when you re having tech it s something that s becoming cheaper all the time and then you re also investing money all the time which we re going to do regardless of the environment so we re not going to cut things we re trying to build like my rewards programs and change my loan and the credit journey because there is a resumption to something like this so daniel and gordon will tell you right now that they think they get more efficient spend and that we shouldn t but we will you have to spend to win in this business and we re very efficient which is very core to how we spend in technology we re going to do it regardless of the environment and we ll try to get more efficient in tech spend too jen piepszak chief financial officer that s right and our investments in technology create capacity in terms of productivity to continue to invest and we ve talked a lot about ai machine learning it s early innings there and there is a lot that we re going to be able to do assuming that s there and become more productive and then cloud developers can become more productive using the cloud jamie dimon chairman and chief executive officer look it s amazing our forward costs with all the things around the world today are down because of techniques with ai and big data and stuff like that and so it s hardly about you invest you look at our client investment asset grew 16 portion of it is you invest and obviously you invest requires hundreds of millions of dollars to build so you ve got to put all these things in perspective about how you try and make the decisions going forward mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst and then follow up jamie you mentioned the environment all the things taking place in the world how is the environment now i mean on the one hand you have trade war you have lower interest rates your capital markets which are down for the big banks you have a lot of pessimism on the other hand you highlighted your results what s when you take the temperature of the environment what s the temperature jamie dimon chairman and chief executive officer it s not that bad uncertainty is a constant but one thing in life as you know is going to be uncertain going forward and geopolitical tension is kind of a constant those things may be a little bit higher now than normal but we i think what we see is global growth is north of 3 you re kind of expecting i think it would be 2 and a half percent this year the consumer in the united states is doing fine business sentiment is a little bit worse mostly probably driven by the trade war and if you travel around the world you know that japan is growing and europe is growing a little bit and brazil has got to negative four and zero a lot of countries have opportunity to expand they are doing great but they should be doing better over the next 20 30 so i wouldn t get too pessimistic obviously the fed will react to with the database they always say it s more important at this point on than just what the fed does if the fed is cutting rates and we re going into recession that s not a good rate cut if the fed actually raises rates one day because we re booming that s not so bad mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst all right thank you operator our next question comes from glenn schorr of evercore isi glenn schorr evercore isi analyst hi thanks i m not sure if i missed it but i think total average loans were up 2 year on year but that was impacted by the loan sales can you tell us either size of loan sales or what average loan growth was up year on year without that jen piepszak chief financial officer so yes there s a few things going on in loan growth as you say it glenn so we have the loan sales we also have the runoff of the tax exempt portfolio so you can think about loan growth probably closer to 4 if you adjust for those items and importantly as we always say loan growth is an outcome not an input and we feel good about the loan growth that we re seeing in terms of the areas where we re investing and then and for the full year you can think about a number if you adjust for the loan sales and ex cib of 2 to 3 full year glenn schorr evercore isi analyst ok appreciate that and then just curious on the noninterest bearing deposits only being down 2 year on year we ve seen a lot bigger numbers of some peers is that just strength of jpmorgan franchise or are you doing anything actively to manage that lack of mix shift jen piepszak chief financial officer so as i said we are seeing balances stabilize in the commercial bank and awm we are still seeing some migration from noninterest bearing to interest bearing but largely we re seeing those balances stabilize and then we do of course have continued growth in the consumer bank and the second quarter is typically seasonally high in the consumer bank so we have some growth in noninterest bearing there and even in the consumer bank where we ve seen growth decelerate that s largely as a result of consumer spending so that feels healthy as well glenn schorr evercore isi analyst ok maybe last one on appreciate the guide on 2019 because it s a half if you look forward into 2020 with no incremental rate cuts is it remotely linear in other words if we think about if the ongoing rate in current environment persists into next year after the two or three cuts this year are we looking at a billion or is it way too complex to oversimplify like that jen piepszak chief financial officer yeah it s probably more complicated glenn and so just given the range of outcomes are as broad as they are and importantly if we re looking at cuts that are insurance cuts that sustain the expansion versus cuts that may be in response to a broader economic slowdown there are other things that we would be talking about so we re not going to give further guidance on the 2020 until we know more glenn schorr evercore isi analyst ok thank you appreciate it operator our next question is from gerard cassidy of rbc gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst thank you good morning when you take a look at your merchant services business you had some really strong growth year over year i think it was up 12 and then your card volumes excluding the commercial card were also up very strong can you share with us what s driven that strong growth that double digit rate of growth jamie dimon chairman and chief executive officer thanks for noticing jen piepszak chief financial officer i would say that is firing on all cylinders so it s brand it s people it s products it does certainly help to have the backdrop of a healthy u s consumer as well and in fact retail sales this morning looked strong so we can expect that to continue gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst is it more the market as you just referenced the retail sales they were strong is it more that or are you guys also seeing gains in market share that gives you an added boost jen piepszak chief financial officer yes we have taken share in a little bit of share in card as you know we re no 1 in sales there i think importantly what s helpful in card is that we don t even need to take share to grow just given the secular tailwind that we have in the card business on the electronification of cash and we re taking share in merchant environment jamie dimon chairman and chief executive officer we expect to do take more share in the future gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst speaking of the future can you guys give us some color on what your first read of libra is that the facebook announcement about the process of payments system that they re going to initiate jamie dimon chairman and chief executive officer yeah so just to put it in perspective gerard we ve been talking about blockchain for seven years and very little has happened and we then turned to libra three years ago so i wouldn t spend too much time on it we don t mind competition and the request has always been the same the governments are we want level playing field and governments further insist that people who hold money or move money all the liquidity in the world where they have right amount of controls in place no one wants to aid in fact terrorism or criminal activities and that can be true for everybody involved in this not only basically doing either kyc bsa for a long period of time and those fears i think would just become for everybody at one point and they should gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst thank you operator our next question is from john mcdonald of autonomous john mcdonald autonomous research analyst hi i wanted to ask about the ccar and you ve got a big authorization this year how did you approach the ccar plan this year in relation to your long term cet1 target of 11 and 12 that you talked about jen piepszak chief financial officer sure so as we think about capital distribution first we would start by always saying that we prefer to use our capital to invest and grow our businesses and then to have a competitive and sustainable dividend and only then to return excess capital to our shareholders and so we are pleased with the approval and the additional capacity to return that 29 4 billion to shareholders having said that we are still targeting the upper end of the 11 to 12 range we re always going to want to have a management buffer because as i had said our first priority will always be to invest and grow our businesses and then of course there remains a lot of uncertainty in terms of the regulatory capital framework and then importantly we wouldn t actually need to make that decision for a few more quarters given the way the capital distribution plan is laid out over four quarters but as of now we are still targeting the upper ends of 11 to 12 john mcdonald autonomous research analyst ok thanks jen and any updated thoughts on cecl or could you remind us what your thoughts on initial impact there jen piepszak chief financial officer sure so it hasn t changed from investor day our range continues to be 4 to 6 billion and we re prepared for the january 1 implementation jamie dimon chairman and chief executive officer this is jim so ccar is one test a year on stress we do 120 a week and so we are always prepared for stress ccar has us losing 20 or 30 billion over nine consecutive quarters i just want to remind you all that the nine quarters after lehman the real stress event we made 20 to 30 billion and ccar assumes you re going to grow your balance sheet it assumes you re going to continue with dividends and stuff like that we have plenty of capital i mean our capital cup run it over and we deployed that capital and remember the thing in every branch is for every branch you tend to use 10 million of capital so 400 branches of that should be 4 billion in capital so it restrains on growth also restrains on capital usage and ability to finance the u s economy so we re really optimistic about our ability to somehow use our capital including our instamed acquisition we just did which i think closes sometime soon operator our next question is from betsy graseck of morgan stanley betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst hey good morning jamie you mentioned about blockchain we ve been hearing about it for seven years and not much has happened but i think you at jpm have built a blockchain solution for at least your correspondent banks and i guess i wanted to understand where you think you re planning on taking that right now just aml and kyc use case but is that something that you think you could deliver more functionality over time jamie dimon chairman and chief executive officer no we think the blockchain is real but the reason it takes so long is that people have to agree with protocol people write a lot of codes to get into it but the one you re referring to ian which is information network of banks so right now banks transfer a lot of information among each other think of trade finance and correspondent bank and stuff like that so i think we have like 120 banks signed up we re going to have so right now it s for bank wholesale use needing information you ll all have the same information you can move things but eventually you re going to move money quicker with data so yes we re optimistic about that and we re going to roll it out as soon as we can and constantly test it to make sure it s secured and all that i remind people when it comes to moving money jpmorgan chase moves 6 trillion a day quite securely and quite cheaply you want to look at the problem you re trying to solve but people would generally say well we didn t have real time payments that were true and now we do effectively sell for p2p and now we do effectively real time payments in tch so we are building the things that the future is going to want apis blockchain ledgers that have much more data a real time movement of money that also goes through floor checks etc so we re quite optimistic about it it will just take a while to get everyone using it one day it will have to be opened up to a broader customer set possibly betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst so one of the things that s coming out in these senate and house financial services banking committee meetings is this desire for real time payments desire for a cheaper solution for payments and that s supposedly what libra was going to offer but to your point it seems like you re already doing that the question is how do we think about the outlook for interchange and is there what s your strategy toward interchange pricing here as we go over this period jamie dimon chairman and chief executive officer this is a race there is real time p2p free safe and secure sell so when people say really that s not cross border so there are people who might want to do that cross border remember cross border meant much much more than actual use of debit card credit card payment systems here and we ve obviously built a real time payment solution it s actually already in use and to me the issue there is to diminish fraud you have to make sure that real time payments is also put through effectively real time code checks and stuff like that so in the united states credit cards debit cards these are people who love these cards the beneficiaries are consumer you guys remember that s why we re here to serve and someone is going to pay eventually for services provided but people like their credit cards they use their credit cards more than they use their debit cards maybe i don t remember that s why you mentioned debit cards betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst yeah when you get rewarded that s great jamie dimon chairman and chief executive officer and jpmorgan now you re getting more free stuff you get free you can buy and sell stock for free we just gave you a very good we just got rolled out here in a few accounts but global investing very cheap very clear so we re going to take and give our clients more and better advancement cheaper all the time and now we package that with sapphire banking or sapphire card or discounts and mortgages that are not always made to be seen but the future is very bright because if we can do more for our customers that s a very good thing jen piepszak chief financial officer and don t forget on credit cards you get charge back rights and you get flows jamie dimon chairman and chief executive officer right and you get if you go online and you re a chase customer you get your fico score for free you re going to be able to you got to tell customers the great potential how they can improve their fico score you get offers like the chase i mean you don t really market but it s really taken off jen piepszak chief financial officer sure so the chase offers we talked about that at investor day it s like a really powerful flywheel where we can we can deliver value to our large merchant clients in terms of being able to bring a very large customer base to them and then we can deliver that value to our customers at zero cost to us and so as i said in the presentation we ve had over 60 million chase offers activated and so this is really powerful and benefits not just our consumers but our large merchant clients at zero cost to us betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst so a message of more efficient less cost maybe needs to get heard on the hill as well jamie dimon chairman and chief executive officer yeah and we talked about it a lot of time and a lot of people understand that and of course we always want to do a better job for our consumers which we have been referring betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst yeah i guess the final question here is just on the under banked is there something or is there an offer that you have for them or are you considering that because that i m just thinking about where fintech is trying to exploit you and i know it s a catchphrase under banked that is being used by libra it doesn t necessarily to me seem like it s solving anything for them but maybe you ve got a better solution that we just don t focus on jamie dimon chairman and chief executive officer yes so we have some of the stream in chase we have 25 of branches around my neighborhoods when we go to those neighborhoods we do some plans we re doing more and more financial education i think this is really important i just mentioned the fico score but maybe there might be other things we can do we do chase chats to get people into the branch educate them about saving fico scores we think we can do this to get a mortgage or buy a house and stuff like that and then we have a product which really is great called secure banking and think of it as a card where it s the full thing you can overdraft i think it s 4 95 a month you can use atm you can have direct deposit you can do online mobile payments and stuff like that so we think it s a great product for the under banked and i think that s going to have 25 and we ll kind of push that a little bit more so we always and then we also have special i call it venture banking the entrepreneur color fund we re making loans to entrepreneurs of color which are not traditional bank loans but help you grow your businesses so we find a lot of ways to do it and really a lot of i wish they were at the forefront of that fintech of course all these firms are trying to eat your lunch and i think that s good it s called american capitalism and we have to stay on our toes to compete but we are like jim had said cards which we rolled out last year announced last year change my plan and change my loan so that people can view their credit balance immediately to do what they want to do and do it well we rolled out zelle p2p that s good for everybody so if you have a bank account you can move money to your friends and relatives rather than pay the 10 money changer fees and stuff like that so we re already trying to do a better job for american consumers we think we ll do a great job for them and when they do have complaints we ll fix it jen piepszak chief financial officer that s right and you mentioned the 25 in in terms of our branch footprint in our expansion market that s 30 betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst thanks operator our next question is from ken usdin of jefferies ken usdin jefferies analyst thanks a lot good morning just wanted to ask on the balance sheet last year so you ve seen a huge jump in the trading related assets and i know you had the accounting changed as you mentioned in the supplement but could you talk about is that related to market share gains is it related to just specific strategies with regard to managing liquidity and it doesn t seem to be equally growing on the asset side in the trading liability so just can you explain the dynamics behind that and how that adds to your net interest income story jen piepszak chief financial officer sure so in terms of the balance sheet growth that you saw quarter over quarter that was primarily related to our balance sheet and tens of businesses in markets businesses and then we were down on a spot basis quarter over quarter but we start with deposit growth and so we have had strong deposit growth and so you see that reflected on the balance sheet side as well as you would have seen securities balances as well and some of that is adding duration and some of that is short duration securities that are higher yielding than ioer and yes ken usdin jefferies analyst ok so it is part of the liquidity management strategy ok and jen did you say what the amount of the gains that you had on the loan sales this quarter jamie dimon chairman and chief executive officer just if you get a higher return on reit body you get ioer you re going to do that if you get a higher return using standardized capital on securities or on home loans you re going to do that and that s what we re seeing in some of these banks jen piepszak chief financial officer that s right the street i should have mentioned do the home sales and home lending ken usdin jefferies analyst right ok got it that makes sense and did you say can you tell us what the amount of the gains on the loan sales this quarter were if they were above trend jen piepszak chief financial officer we haven t disclosed the amounts of the gains and we had some loan sales in the fourth quarter the first quarter and the second quarter the first and second quarter in terms of the notional amount the first quarter was about 7 billion and the second quarter was about 9 billion so just a little bit more jamie dimon chairman and chief executive officer beginning of the second quarter is that net it showed up in different places but not material jen piepszak chief financial officer yeah yeah ken usdin jefferies analyst got it and lastly just any thoughts on the investment banking pipeline and just continuation of the outlook across the buckets there of banks jen piepszak chief financial officer sure so in terms of the investment banking pipeline i ll just remind you that the third quarter is typically a seasonally lower quarter and so sequentially you should think about ib fees being down a bit that said the pipeline is healthy although off a record performance last year which is assumption of a resurgent to more normal levels of activity as well as some overhang from macro uncertainty in m a still feels very healthy and it s still a stage where company are looking for synergistic opportunities for growth especially in north america and perhaps europe a bit more muted ecm we had a very strong second quarter so that will taper off in the second half a bit but i would say deals are getting done well in the current environment and then dcm dcm will be more subdued reflecting a slowdown in acquisition financing activity as well as refinancing opportunities but albeit with a good backdrop for new issuance given the rate environment operator our next question is from matt o connor of deutsche bank matt o connor deutsche bank analyst good morning so i realize rate expectations can change quickly but how do you think about managing the company in a rate environment that follows the curve that s out there for three to four cuts and you said earlier you would have cut back on technology but are other areas in expenses you think about managing the balance sheet and liquidity a little bit different jen piepszak chief financial officer sure so in terms of balance sheet management we manage the balance sheet in both directions it s a negatively convexed balance sheet and so all else being equal as rates are declining we would naturally drift shorter driven both by assets and liabilities so you would expect us to add duration which we did this quarter but we re not going to change the way we run the company because of the rate environment we re going to continue serving our clients investing with discipline and managing the balance sheet across all dimensions that being capital liquidity and duration and then in terms of expenses again we re not going to change the way we run the company because of interest rate environment and i ll just say again that the range of outcomes are very broad here and so if we end up with insurance cuts it s a temporary headwind and if we end up with cuts in response to a broader economic slowdown there will be a lot more to talk about but as jamie always says we re not going to change the way we run the company because of the macro environment that said in a broader slowdown obviously there are natural levers on our volume related expenses and we redecision a large part of our investment portfolio on an annual basis we will always continue to invest in the things that we think are important but we would have that opportunity depending upon the opportunity to take a look at that jamie dimon chairman and chief executive officer remember in a real recession there are always opportunities to reduce your costs and vendors pull all those themselves they will give you better deals and stuff like that there are also huge opportunities to spending money wisely our sapphire card was birthed in 09 and you could imagine that this healthy growth might be a great opportunity but we re not going to take it and so i think you got to be very careful related to marketing money you need better spends in a downturn the returns on it immediately double matt o connor deutsche bank analyst and you talked about the capital and your thought process there obviously the authorization of the buybacks is a very big number is it your expectations that you will use it all or is that still to be determined based on balance sheet growth stock price and the environment jen piepszak chief financial officer i would say still to be determined our first choice will always be to use our excess capital to invest and grow our business so it s still to be determined and as you know it s over four quarters and so we have time to think about it but obviously we have the flexibility matt o connor deutsche bank analyst is the timing of that even or is there a flexibility there too jamie dimon chairman and chief executive officer it has been in the past but we can change that every day operator our next question is from saul martinez of ubs saul martinez ubs analyst hey good morning a couple of questions first on the nii outlook beyond this year and i fully appreciate you re not giving guidance beyond this year but you do have the guidance from investor day out there of a sustainable nii of 58 to 60 billion that was set in a very very different rate environment if we were to see multiple rate cuts how do we think about that guidance and how i mean what are some of the moving parts that might get you perhaps to the lower end of that 58 to 60 billion is it simply dependent on how the economy responds deposit pricing if you can just kind of outline what you think some of those moving parts are jen piepszak chief financial officer sure so the guidance we gave at investor day steady state 58 to 60 i would say largely still stands importantly because when we talked about that at investor day we weren t assuming any further benefit from rate so we were assuming that any incremental increases in rates would be offset and repriced and so the majority of that growth was going to come from balance sheet growth and mix and if you remember the slides there were a number of arrows on the slide even at that time which was obviously a different rate environment we were implying that there were a number of different paths to get there and so that obviously continues to be true and so there may be a different path to get there and may take a little bit longer but we still believe in that steady state number because we still believe in the growth of the franchise saul martinez ubs analyst ok ok that s helpful if i can change gears a little bit you recently announced that you re closing finn or you closed finn and i think the stated logic is you learned that millennials don t need a separate brand or experience but can you just elaborate on the logic there and what you learned from that experience because it does seem to maybe fly in the face of what some other entities or what financial institutions are doing with their digital banking strategy jamie dimon chairman and chief executive officer go ahead jen jen piepszak chief financial officer i was just going to say we learned a lot in finn that we learned the importance of power to change brands it certainly means that we don t need a separate brand we also learned about a number of features that our customers love and we were able to reuse those features and port them over to the chase mobile app and so i think we always need to be testing and learning and doing things like this and not afraid to shut them down when we ve learned what we needed to learn and can serve our customers through the primary chase mobile app jamie dimon chairman and chief executive officer we ve learned a lot how to do digital account openings only digital because we do have a retail banking center the line that you already have so a lot of other things there we re always going to be learning some kind of skunkworks and learning from things like that and so we don t look at those kind of things like failures at all that is how you learn and jeff bezos will tell you mistakes are good mistakes are what make you smarter and better and so i hope we make some really good mistakes that can teach us all of our businesses at one point the people doing finn did a great job they re embedded and by the way you can open a chase account now and never go into a branch and you could open an account or take up an account it takes minutes to open an account so we ve got much better at digital only but we got it separated from the physical branch system jen piepszak chief financial officer yes the digital account opening is now about 25 of our new account activity jamie dimon chairman and chief executive officer and we ll be doing in small business and merchant processing and all these various things saul martinez ubs analyst got it thanks very much operator our next question is from eric compton of morningstar eric compton morningstar analyst good morning thanks for taking my question so this question kind of ties into some of the items already mentioned longer term kind of tech focused and also related to finn so there has been some press recently about reasons for closing down the finn app and one of the items i was mentioned was some of the difficulties banks can potentially run into with their legacy platforms which for the most part are built on cobol which has been around since the 60s and depending on who you talk up to these legacy platforms can either be like huge problems for banks or not really a big deal so i guess from the outside at least for me it can be kind of hard to tell what really is going on there so my question is as you compete with fintech firms who are building new platforms from scratch how do you strategically view dealing with your own legacy platforms is there a need to kind of redo these things eventually in order to actually compete with newer tech over time do these legacy platforms really hamstring you in any way or is the hype around those issues really overdone and if so why thanks jamie dimon chairman and chief executive officer the hype has been around now for the better part of the decade right and we seem to be doing fine but it is true and some of these legacy platforms is also the reason why we have 50 million customers but it is true that over time these platforms would be reformulated and refactored to be cloud eligible and things like that and those things are more efficient so your costs will go down your error rates will go down so the way i look at it a little bit is we run like 6 000 or 7 000 applications over time those will be modularized and being refactored to be cloud eligible either by private cloud or a public cloud and yes they will be more efficient we also have tons of new digital platforms ai built around these things that do the customer service outside that they see they go over accounts in minutes it is a frequent journey that we can modify so many things in days and weeks as opposed to years because you re not muddled with the old legacy system and so it s a little bit of both but those numbers are embedded in our tech spend the refact rate embedded data centers are getting better in ai all these things are in those numbers operator and we have no further questions at this time jamie dimon chairman and chief executive officer well thank you very much jen you did a great job look forward to all of you in a quarter thank you jen piepszak chief financial officer thanks james operator duration 66 minutes call
