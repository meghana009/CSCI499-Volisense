the debates about mmt are expanding there are weird offerings springing up each day i read something yesterday about how mmt is really just marxism in disguise and therefore a plot to overthrow entrepreneurship well in a socialist society there will still be a monetary system most of the critiques just get to their point quickly mmt is about wild printing presses undermining the value of the currency that should summarise 25 years of our work nicely but there are also other developments on a global scale a few weeks ago there was a lengthy debate in the japanese parliament during a house of representatives committee hearing considering whether the october sales tax hikes should continue the finance minister taro aso was confronted by committee members who indicated that it was useless denying that modern monetary theory mmt was some abstract theory that was wrong because the japanese are already doing it the minister told the hearing that mmt was dangerous and would undermine financial markets if anyone said otherwise an interesting discussion took place it highlighted some key features of mmt it also indicates that progress is being made in the process of education aimed at giving people a better understanding of how the monetary system that we live within operates the true agenda the reuters report may 17 2019 brainard modern monetary theory would pose risks in diminishing fed s authority is only three paragraphs long but tells us a lot about the true agenda behind the myth of central bank independence the article was reporting on comments made by us federal reserve governor lael brainard about modern monetary theory mmt it said that the set of ideas known as modern monetary theory could poses risks in shifting authority over the economy from the federal reserve to congress or other institutions more tied to political considerations she was quoted as saying putting those responsibilities in an institution that has a lot of oversight but a little bit of independence there are some virtues to that and to the extent that moves to a different setting there may be risks the risk that the voice of the people exercised through their elected representatives might actually determine policy settings and those politicians will have to take responsibility for their actions and not be able to deflect such to unelected and largely unaccountable cabals like central bank committees the neoliberal way is to depoliticise economic policy that is shorthand for compromising democracy the japanese mmt laboratory the japanese diet parliament has been debating whether the planned sales tax rise on october 1 2019 should go ahead or not i have written about the japanese experience with sales tax rises before 1 japan is different right wrong fiscal policy works august 15 2017 2 japan returns to 1997 idiocy rules november 18 2014 3 japan s growth slows under tax hikes but the oecd want more september 16 2014 4 japan signs of growth but grey clouds remain may 21 2015 5 japan thinks it is greece but cannot remember 1997 august 13 2012 everytime they hike sales taxes it ends in misery spending falls and economic activity comes to a crashing halt they saw that in 1997 and again in 2014 in april 2014 the abe government raised the sales tax from 5 per cent to 8 per cent after the sales tax hike there was a sharp drop in private consumption spending as a direct result of the policy shift at the time i predicted it would get worse unless they changed tack it certainly did get worse consumers stopped spending and the impact of static consumption expenditure was that business investment then lags here is the history of real gdp growth annualised since the march quarter 1994 to the march quarter 2015 the red areas denote sales tax driven recessions in both episodes these recessions were followed by a renewed bout of fiscal stimulus monetary policy was loose throughout in both episodes there was a rapid return to sustained growth as a result of the fiscal boost nothing could be clearer and the debate is back on the table in the parliament however this time the debate has introduced mmt understandings which make it more interesting and bring out some really important aspects of our work the debates prompted the wall street journal may 15 2019 article we re already doing it japan tests unorthodox economic doctrine behind paywall to write but in japan mmt is at the center of a policy battle with imminent consequences whether to proceed with an oct 1 sales tax hike designed to trim the deficit the government plans to increase the sales tax from 8 to 10 per cent and has wheeled out an array of mainstream macroeconomic arguments about the evils of fiscal deficits to justify the decision in his annual speech on fiscal policy by minister of finance aso at the 198th session of the national diet january 28 2019 the finance minister said that the government was making steady efforts to achieve economic revitalization and fiscal consolidation secure a stable source of funds by raising the consumption tax rate in october this year the context of these remarks was the the declining birthrate and aging population and the need to establish a social security system oriented to all generations and secure its sustainability so the usual suspects government cannot afford to pay pensions as the society ages and thus needs to cut deficits to increase its capacity to fund said pensions the finance minister taro aso was quoted in the wsj article as saying that it could loosen our fiscal discipline and be extremely dangerous he also claimed that he didn t want japan to turn into a test site for foreign economic theories well i am sorry to say that japan has been a great laboratory for demonstrating the underlying principles of mmt for decades now given that it has been the first nation to really explore what we might think of as the extremes of fiscal and monetary policy relatively high and sustained fiscal deficits relatively high gross public debt to gdp ratios zero interest rates negative 10 year japanese government bond yields low inflation to deflation in chapter 2 of our new mmt textbook macroeconomics published by macmillan march 2019 which is titled how to think and do macroeconomics we have a section what should a macroeconomic theory be able to explain and in that discussion we discuss japan s persistent fiscal deficits the glaring counterfactual case we state consult almost any other macroeconomics textbook and you will find the following propositions stated in some form or another as inalienable fact 1 persistent fiscal deficits push up short term interest rates because the alleged need to finance higher deficits increases the demand for scarce savings relative to its supply 2 these higher interest rates undermine private investment spending the so called crowding out hypothesis 3 persistent fiscal deficits lead to bond markets demanding increasing yields on government debt 4 the rising public debt to gdp ratio associated with the persistent fiscal deficits will eventually lead bond markets to withdraw their lending to the government and the government will run out of money 5 persistent fiscal deficits lead to accelerating inflation and potentially hyperinflation which is highly detrimental to the macroeconomy to the we knew it all along crew or the mmt is crazy crew or derivations they have to confront the fact that the 5 mainstream propositions are all disproven by the realities that japan provides japan has run a persistent deficit since 1992 a massive build up of private indebtedness associated with a real estate boom accompanied the five years of fiscal surpluses from 1987 to 1991 the boom crashed spectacularly in 1991 and was followed by a period of lower growth and the need for higher deficits the convention in japan is that the national government matches its fiscal deficit with the issuance of bonds to the non government sector principally the private domestic sector unsurprisingly given the institutional practice of issuing debt to the private bond markets to match the fiscal deficits the debt ratio has risen over time as a reflection of the ongoing deficits that the japanese government has been running to support growth in the economy and maintain relatively low unemployment rates if the mainstream macroeconomic propositions summarised above correctly captured the way the real world operates then we should have expected to see rising interest rates increasing bond yields and accelerating inflation in japan given the persistent fiscal deficits did the persistent fiscal deficits in japan drive up interest rates and government bond yields the answer is clearly no the overnight interest rate in japan which is administered by the central bank the bank of japan has stayed exceedingly low and has not responded adversely to the persistent fiscal deficits long term 10 year bond yields interest rates on government debt have also stayed very low and not responded adversely to the persistent fiscal deficits if investors considered the government debt had become increasingly risky to purchase they would have demanded increasing yields to compensate for that risk there is no such suggestion that bond market investors have become wary of japanese government bonds to be found here the corollary is that the investors have also not signalled any unwillingness to purchase the debt demand for the bonds remains high and yields remain low for example the most recent 10 year bond auction was on may 3 2019 issue no 353 carried a nominal coupon rate yield of 0 1 per cent there was 2 200 billion yen on offer and the ministry of finance recorded 7 609 5 billion competitive bids for the debt the yield at the lowest accepted price was 0 00 you can access all data auction results for jgbs in terms of inflation after the property boom crashed and the japanese government began to run persistent and at times large fiscal deficits the inflation rate has been low and often negative there is clearly no inflationary bias in the modern japanese economy as persistently predicted by the mainstream economic theories the conclusion is obvious first despite persistent deficits and a rising public debt to gdp ratio along with a downgrade of japan s credit rating by international ratings agencies including fitch in april 2015 international bond markets have not punished the japanese government with high ten year interest rates on public debt nor has the central bank lost control of the overnight interest rate second the persistent deficits have not led to high rates of domestic inflation it is clear that the mainstream macroeconomic explanation of the relationships between fiscal deficits interest rates bond yields and inflation rates is unable to adequately capture the real world dynamics in japan such a categorical failure to provide an explanation suggests that the mainstream theory is seriously deficient in later chapters of the textbook we provide a detailed mmt explanation of these empirical outcomes the point is that the body of work we now call mmt has an impeccable record of capturing the dynamics of the japanese monetary system and provided sound explanations for the data movements so mr aso japan is already testing mmt thank you the diet records if you go keep tabs on the discussions in the japanese house of representatives the diet you will have come across some interesting discussions last month surrounding the sales tax debate the 198th national assembly finance and finance committee 12th met on wednesday april 17 2019 taro aso was in attendance as were a host of finance ministry officials the transcript of proceedings 第198回国会 財務金融委員会 第12号 平成31年4月17日 水曜日 makes interesting reading and is where the wsj report comes from even though the report was 2 weeks after the hearing the finance minister was asked by a committee member there has been a lot of debate about mmt in the united states those who are proposing it say that japan is doing mmt currently the bank of japan is carrying out a lot of fiscal actions and keeping interest rates low they say that japan is a good example of the principles of mmt do the ministers agree with that he replied money monetary theory mmt for short this is often spoken about now by politicians various people i don t think we need to explain the theory here there are many people in the us many officials including larry summers who are against it but to do it in japan and think about that kind of reaction the market would have i do not intend to make japan an experimental site for it to which a committee member responded by the way mmt stands for modern monetary theory so please do not continue to make a mistake but it remains that mmt proponents are saying that the japanese government and the bank of japan have been demonstrating the principles of mmt for many years does the minister think that they are mistaken aso replied as i said before we are not experimenting with modern monetary theory committee question but do you think it is a sound theory please tell us whether you have a positive or negative impression aso wavered a committee member then said i think mmt is just an excuse to delay fiscal consolidation and i think it is an outrageous argument as finance minister i think you should be more resolute in your rejection it seems like you are vague about it if so i think that confidence in japanese finances will fluctuate do you think that is okay aso japanese public finances are not shaky interest rates are not rising in the current situation and our finances are fine in the medium to long term we are reducing bond issuance by more than 10 trillion trillion yen we have transmitted to the market our intent to consolidate and there has been no adverse market response no sudden fall in government bond tenders and no rise in interest rates we must continue in this direction which is why we have to increase the consumption tax committee member the point is that the government has controlled the market and has kept interest rates low so that the government could make the debt environment easier and fiscal consolidation has been delayed this is the essence of mmt and it says that japan demonstrates best practice in other words mmt proponents say that the japanese government should postpone fiscal consolidation aso wavered committee member we repeat the same point as a finance minister do you think that mmt is correct or do you think it is wrong please answer only that point aso i think i cannot follow such a dangerous story and so it went in the news brief 衆議院財務金融委員会ニュース april 17 2019 which reported on the committee proceedings it was stressed that it was necessary for the minister to show a resolute attitude in rejecting mmt so that the market confidence in japanese government finances was not undermined it was also stressed that if people started to follow mmt then the environment for fiscal consolidation would not be favourable i found this exchange really interesting think about it in relation to lael brainard s fear that if politicians get hold of fiscal policy then they might pursue more expansive social programs the amazing thing about the japanese discussion is that mmt provides a superior understanding of the dynamics of their monetary system it is not a matter of adopting mmt mmt should not been seen as a regime that you apply or switch to or introduce as i have noted regularly mmt is rather a lens which allows us to see the true intrinsic workings of the fiat monetary system it helps us better understand the choices available to a currency issuing government and the consequences of surrendering that currency issuing capacity as in the eurozone it lifts the veil imposed by neoliberal ideology and forces the real questions and political choices out in the open an mmt understanding means that statements such as the government cannot provide better services because it will run out of money are immediately known to be false such an understanding will change the questions we ask of our politicians and the range of acceptable answers that they will be able to give in this sense an mmt understanding enhances the quality of our democracies by providing a detailed analysis of the link between fiscal policy and bank reserves for example mmt clearly helps us understand why the japanese interest rates and bond yields have been maintained at very low levels indefinitely even though the fiscal deficits have been relative large for decades you do not get that understanding from reading a mainstream macroeconomics text book their predictions were completely wrong because their monetary framework inasmuch as there is one is deeply flawed basically articulating a fictional world when mainstream economists say there is nothing new about mmt or we knew it all along they are simply lying and trying to cover their deep ignorance of the operations of the monetary system i challenge anyone to produce a mainstream textbook current or past that provides the deep insights about reserve operations fiscal deficits and can explain the japanese situation so poor mr aso he thinks if he admits all that then the financial markets will go crazy yet the financial markets already know all this stuff while they may not call the reality they trade in mmt the fact is that it is they haven t been scared off in the last several decades and will not be if anyone dares to admit the obvious mmt is all around us get used to it during the japanese government discussions it was also highlighted that the bank of japan has been buying up an increasing proportion of government bonds which means that there is no real need for the bond market auctions anyway another central mmt proposition this prompted a government member to tell mr aso that you re totally wrong we re already doing it finally the other feature of the committee discussions was in that the proponents of mmt in the house of representatives spanned the ideological range there are two groups who are opposed to the sales tax rise and have invoked mmt as a defense 1 ruling party conservatives 2 communist party members one mp said that mmt is gaining popularity in the us and europe it was a public backlash against austerity policies and the accumulated dissatisfaction has finally exploded the same applies to japan the point is that mmt is agnostic about policy bar its preference for an employment buffer rather than an unemployment buffer to discipline inflation in general it makes no sense to talk about an mmt type prescription or an mmt solution to make that mmt understanding operational in a policy context a value system or ideology must be introduced mmt is not intrinsically left leaning a right leaning person would advocate quite different policy prescriptions to a left leaning person even though they both shared the understanding of how the monetary system operates that is highlighted by these recent debates in the japanese parliament where conservative politicians and communist party members have invoked mmt understandings to argue against sales tax hikes designed to reduce the fiscal deficit conclusion progress is being made now mmt is entering parliamentary debates and is the subject of condemnation motions and all the rest of it things are moving along nicely and i hope mr aso can sleep well once he works out that mmt is all around him and the sky remains well above his head that is enough for today c copyright 2019 william mitchell all rights reserved
just over a year ago on the 3rd of may 2018 i gave some advice on here to argentina about its ongoing economic and currency crisis the problem is twofold firstly you can end up chasing your own tail like a dog what i mean by this is that markets can expect more interest rate rises each time the currency falls and usually that is exactly what it does next why is this well if anticipating a 27 25 return on your money is not doing the job is 30 25 going to do it unlikely in my view as we note that the currency has fallen 5 this week events accelerated later that day as the argentine central bank the bcra did this this article came to late for the bcra it would appear as just before 5 pm uk time they raised interest rates to 33 25 i would place a link bit nobody seems to have told the english version of their website yet that backed up my point and that theme just carried on as this from reuters on april fools day highlights argentina has established an interest rate floor of 62 5 percent the central bank said in a statement on monday as the country looks to rein in stubborn inflation and ease concerns about a run on the local peso currency as of yesterday the interest rate was 71 44 which must feel somewhat bizarre to ordinary argentine s in a world of low and indeed negative interest rates another sign of trouble is the gap to deposit rates which were 51 94 yesterday the argentine peso let me hand you over to the buenos aires times argentina s peso the worst performing emerging market currency this year could see more volatility as investors learn how to connect the latest pieces of the country s complex political puzzle so far this year the peso has slumped by about 16 percent against the us dollar and equity assets have been shaky as you can see the situation has continued to deteriorate in fact there has been something of a double whammy as interest rates have soared above 70 and the peso has gone from 21 52 versus the us dollar when i wrote my post to 45 2 as i type this indeed things are so bad that even bitcoin supporters are trolling the situation if an argentinian had bought bitcoin at the highest point of the biggest bubble in history in 2017 he would have been better off than leaving his money in his argentinian bank account so tell me again how bitcoin is a horrible store of value josusanmartin of course you can look at that the other way which is that he has gone to the outer limits of cherry picking by choosing the argentine peso inflation inflation inflation the currency fall was always going to led to inflation and the situation is such that as the buenos aires times reports the government has resorted to direct controls the government agreed with leading supermarkets that the price of 60 essential products of the food basket will be frozen for at least six months the list includes 16 manufacturing companies of rice sugar milk yoghurt flour tea and coffee among others whose products will be available at 2 500 outlets as from april 22 at the same time the macri administration agreed with slaughterhouses to offer beef cuts at 149 pesos per kilo 120 000 kilos weekly which will be available at the central market and at other retail outlets i am pleased that they are focusing on such an important area that is regarded by central bankers as non core i fear however that this is a sign that some people are in real trouble however the statement below is something of a hostage to fortune we are entering into a new phase currency instability is now something of the past which guarantees a lower inflation rate economy minister nicolás dujovne said at a press conference moving to the present situation there is this the government plan was announced in the same week as march s inflation data of 4 7 percent was revealed sending alarm bells ringing among macri administration officials prices have now increased 11 8 percent increase in the first quarter of the year and 54 7 percent in the last 12 months as you can see we now have a triple play of economic woe with high interest rates a devalued currency and high inflation fourmidable let us advance on the economic situation with trepidation and an apology to manchester city for appropriating their current punchline a chill is in the air from this consumption in supermarkets also dropped 8 7 percent in march compared to the same period last year accumulating a 7 3 percent decline so far this year according to a report by the consultancy scentia buenos aires times the oecd has updated its economic forecasts this morning and in spite of its efforts to cheer lead for the present imf programme it has downgraded economic growth from the 1 5 of march to 1 8 now this is something we have become familiar with in imf programmes as we note that last summer the government was forecasting 1 5 growth for this year this comes on top of the 2 5 contraction in 2018 so recession and depression consequently the oecd finds itself reporting that the unemployment rate has risen by 2 since 2017 to 9 1 100 year bond here is bloomberg from yesterday argentine bond spreads against us treasuries rose 19 basis points to 962 double the average for latin america the country s five year credit default swaps also rose 1 3 percent to 1 274 basis points there was a bit of a rally today but in general the bonds of argentina trade about 9 3 over their us equivalents however bonds in peso s yield more highly with the 9 year being at 23 the 100 year bond is trading at 68 5 but i suppose you have 98 or so years left to get back to 100 comment those who have followed the recent history of the international monetary fund will find the statement below awfully familiar the authorities policies that underly the fund supported arrangement are bearing fruit the high fiscal and current account deficits two major vulnerabilities that led to the financial crisis last year are falling economic activity contracted in 2018 but there are signs that the recession has bottomed out and a gradual recovery is expected to take hold in the coming quarters managing director christine lagarde there are similarities with her shock and awe description for greece as i note the oecd 2 1 economic growth forecast for next year is the same number as was forecast for it at this stage i also note that the exports fairy is expected to make an appearance although so far the trade adjustment in the first quarter of 2019 has involved them falling slightly and imports falling by around 27 again familiar and as japan showed us yesterday the import plunge will flatter the next set of gdp numbers there is a different situation in that the currency has devalued although argentina rather than defaulting on some of its debt is finding the foreign currency part of it ever more expensive whilst it is in the teeth of a fiscal contraction even the financial times is questioning the imf and christine lagarde when the imf completed its third review of argentina s economy in early april managing director christine lagarde boasted that the government policies linked to the country s record 56bn bailout from the fund were bearing fruit the imf has strongly supported the present government even former senior fund officials are concerned by the organisation s exposure to argentina and the potential fallout should its biggest ever programme implode of course we do not know who will win the election in october but we face a situation of economic crisis which follows other crises in argentina also most of us unlike the ft live in a world where lagarde lost her credibility years ago in truth this was always going to be a really difficult gig along the lines of when neil young decided to stop playing his hits and just play his new unpopular album as the comment below suggests what is really needed is long term reform which is exactly what the imf has not provided in greece argentina has signed 22 agreements with the imf most of which ended with bitterness on both sides clearly neither side has heard the phrase once bitten twice shy donald in the ft

crew or the mmt is crazy crew or derivations they have to confront the fact that the 5 mainstream propositions are all disproven by the realities that japan provides japan has run a persistent deficit since 1992 a massive build up of private indebtedness associated with a real estate boom accompanied the five years of fiscal surpluses from 1987 to 1991 the boom crashed spectacularly in 1991 and was followed by a period of lower growth and the need for higher deficits the convention in japan is that the national government matches its fiscal deficit with the issuance of bonds to the non government sector principally the private domestic sector unsurprisingly given the institutional practice of issuing debt to the private bond markets to match the fiscal deficits the debt ratio has risen over time as a reflection of the ongoing deficits that the japanese government has been running to support growth in the economy and maintain relatively low unemployment rates if the mainstream macroeconomic propositions summarised above correctly captured the way the real world operates then we should have expected to see rising interest rates increasing bond yields and accelerating inflation in japan given the persistent fiscal deficits did the persistent fiscal deficits in japan drive up interest rates and government bond yields the answer is clearly no the overnight interest rate in japan which is administered by the central bank the bank of japan has stayed exceedingly low and has not responded adversely to the persistent fiscal deficits long term 10 year bond yields interest rates on government debt have also stayed very low and not responded adversely to the persistent fiscal deficits if investors considered the government debt had become increasingly risky to purchase they would have demanded increasing yields to compensate for that risk there is no such suggestion that bond market investors have become wary of japanese government bonds to be found here the corollary is that the investors have also not signalled any unwillingness to purchase the debt demand for the bonds remains high and yields remain low for example the most recent 10 year bond auction was on may 3 2019 issue no 353 carried a nominal coupon rate yield of 0 1 per cent there was 2 200 billion yen on offer and the ministry of finance recorded 7 609 5 billion competitive bids for the debt the yield at the lowest accepted price was 0 00 you can access all data auction results for jgbs in terms of inflation after the property boom crashed and the japanese government began to run persistent and at times large fiscal deficits the inflation rate has been low and often negative there is clearly no inflationary bias in the modern japanese economy as persistently predicted by the mainstream economic theories the conclusion is obvious first despite persistent deficits and a rising public debt to gdp ratio along with a downgrade of japan s credit rating by international ratings agencies including fitch in april 2015 international bond markets have not punished the japanese government with high ten year interest rates on public debt nor has the central bank lost control of the overnight interest rate second the persistent deficits have not led to high rates of domestic inflation it is clear that the mainstream macroeconomic explanation of the relationships between fiscal deficits interest rates bond yields and inflation rates is unable to adequately capture the real world dynamics in japan such a categorical failure to provide an explanation suggests that the mainstream theory is seriously deficient in later chapters of the textbook we provide a detailed mmt explanation of these empirical outcomes the point is that the body of work we now call mmt has an impeccable record of capturing the dynamics of the japanese monetary system and provided sound explanations for the data movements so mr aso japan is already testing mmt thank you the diet records if you go keep tabs on the discussions in the japanese house of representatives the diet you will have come across some interesting discussions last month surrounding the sales tax debate the 198th national assembly finance and finance committee 12th met on wednesday april 17 2019 taro aso was in attendance as were a host of finance ministry officials the transcript of proceedings 第198回国会 財務金融委員会 第12号 平成31年4月17日 水曜日 makes interesting reading and is where the wsj report comes from even though the report was 2 weeks after the hearing the finance minister was asked by a committee member there has been a lot of debate about mmt in the united states those who are proposing it say that japan is doing mmt currently the bank of japan is carrying out a lot of fiscal actions and keeping interest rates low they say that japan is a good example of the principles of mmt do the ministers agree with that he replied money monetary theory mmt for short this is often spoken about now by politicians various people i don t think we need to explain the theory here there are many people in the us many officials including larry summers who are against it but to do it in japan and think about that kind of reaction the market would have i do not intend to make japan an experimental site for it to which a committee member responded by the way mmt stands for modern monetary theory so please do not continue to make a mistake but it remains that mmt proponents are saying that the japanese government and the bank of japan have been demonstrating the principles of mmt for many years does the minister think that they are mistaken aso replied as i said before we are not experimenting with modern monetary theory committee question but do you think it is a sound theory please tell us whether you have a positive or negative impression aso wavered a committee member then said i think mmt is just an excuse to delay fiscal consolidation and i think it is an outrageous argument as finance minister i think you should be more resolute in your rejection it seems like you are vague about it if so i think that confidence in japanese finances will fluctuate do you think that is okay aso japanese public finances are not shaky interest rates are not rising in the current situation and our finances are fine in the medium to long term we are reducing bond issuance by more than 10 trillion trillion yen we have transmitted to the market our intent to consolidate and there has been no adverse market response no sudden fall in government bond tenders and no rise in interest rates we must continue in this direction which is why we have to increase the consumption tax committee member the point is that the government has controlled the market and has kept interest rates low so that the government could make the debt environment easier and fiscal consolidation has been delayed this is the essence of mmt and it says that japan demonstrates best practice in other words mmt proponents say that the japanese government should postpone fiscal consolidation aso wavered committee member we repeat the same point as a finance minister do you think that mmt is correct or do you think it is wrong please answer only that point aso i think i cannot follow such a dangerous story and so it went in the news brief 衆議院財務金融委員会ニュース april 17 2019 which reported on the committee proceedings it was stressed that it was necessary for the minister to show a resolute attitude in rejecting mmt so that the market confidence in japanese government finances was not undermined it was also stressed that if people started to follow mmt then the environment for fiscal consolidation would not be favourable i found this exchange really interesting think about it in relation to lael brainard s fear that if politicians get hold of fiscal policy then they might pursue more expansive social programs the amazing thing about the japanese discussion is that mmt provides a superior understanding of the dynamics of their monetary system it is not a matter of adopting mmt mmt should not been seen as a regime that you apply or switch to or introduce as i have noted regularly mmt is rather a lens which allows us to see the true intrinsic workings of the fiat monetary system it helps us better understand the choices available to a currency issuing government and the consequences of surrendering that currency issuing capacity as in the eurozone it lifts the veil imposed by neoliberal ideology and forces the real questions and political choices out in the open an mmt understanding means that statements such as the government cannot provide better services because it will run out of money are immediately known to be false such an understanding will change the questions we ask of our politicians and the range of acceptable answers that they will be able to give in this sense an mmt understanding enhances the quality of our democracies by providing a detailed analysis of the link between fiscal policy and bank reserves for example mmt clearly helps us understand why the japanese interest rates and bond yields have been maintained at very low levels indefinitely even though the fiscal deficits have been relative large for decades you do not get that understanding from reading a mainstream macroeconomics text book their predictions were completely wrong because their monetary framework inasmuch as there is one is deeply flawed basically articulating a fictional world when mainstream economists say there is nothing new about mmt or we knew it all along they are simply lying and trying to cover their deep ignorance of the operations of the monetary system i challenge anyone to produce a mainstream textbook current or past that provides the deep insights about reserve operations fiscal deficits and can explain the japanese situation so poor mr aso he thinks if he admits all that then the financial markets will go crazy yet the financial markets already know all this stuff while they may not call the reality they trade in mmt the fact is that it is they haven t been scared off in the last several decades and will not be if anyone dares to admit the obvious mmt is all around us get used to it during the japanese government discussions it was also highlighted that the bank of japan has been buying up an increasing proportion of government bonds which means that there is no real need for the bond market auctions anyway another central mmt proposition this prompted a government member to tell mr aso that you re totally wrong we re already doing it finally the other feature of the committee discussions was in that the proponents of mmt in the house of representatives spanned the ideological range there are two groups who are opposed to the sales tax rise and have invoked mmt as a defense 1 ruling party conservatives 2 communist party members one mp said that mmt is gaining popularity in the us and europe it was a public backlash against austerity policies and the accumulated dissatisfaction has finally exploded the same applies to japan the point is that mmt is agnostic about policy bar its preference for an employment buffer rather than an unemployment buffer to discipline inflation in general it makes no sense to talk about an mmt type prescription or an mmt solution to make that mmt understanding operational in a policy context a value system or ideology must be introduced mmt is not intrinsically left leaning a right leaning person would advocate quite different policy prescriptions to a left leaning person even though they both shared the understanding of how the monetary system operates that is highlighted by these recent debates in the japanese parliament where conservative politicians and communist party members have invoked mmt understandings to argue against sales tax hikes designed to reduce the fiscal deficit conclusion progress is being made now mmt is entering parliamentary debates and is the subject of condemnation motions and all the rest of it things are moving along nicely and i hope mr aso can sleep well once he works out that mmt is all around him and the sky remains well above his head that is enough for today c copyright 2019 william mitchell all rights reserved

april bumping japan to second place only for the third month in history japan s dominant share has fallen considerably as australia s lng exports have expanded china s share of australia s lng has grown significantly claiming the lion s share of australia s lift in lng output since 2015 current lng contracts suggest that japan will retain its position as the number one destination for australian lng china is not far off in second place but the contest is shaping up to be closer than contracts suggest prior to april china eclipsed japan as the main buyer of australian lng in november and december last year many attributed that result to china s buying of spot lng cargoes during the cold winter months to secure gas for power generation but the result in april suggests that china s buying of spot lng may be enough to eclipse japan regardless of seasonal demand that opens the door for china to overtake japan consistently as australia s largest buyer of lng australian

evan halper los angeles times tns they keep piling up sometimes trillions of dollars at a time the competition among 2020 democratic presidential hopefuls to be bold in confronting vexing social and economic challenges has created a mountain of policy promises the rising price tag has implications the contenders prefer to sidestep candidates breezy assurances that everything from four years of college to first class medical care to cash payments for the middle class can be had for free unless you are one of those very wealthy americans targeted to foot the bill have concerned even liberal economists these big ambitious proposals are so expensive it is not possible to pay for them by just taxing the rich said howard gleckman a senior fellow at the urban brookings tax policy center they are going to require taxing middle income people but talking about that just doesn t fly politically democrats have always favored big investment in government but it s been decades since so many in the primary field have pushed so much spending with so little constraint the fiscal abandon with which the gop powered its huge tax cut package running up the red ink by hundreds of billions of dollars has moved democrats to also aggressively test budget boundaries revised thinking on the danger of deficits is giving them some cover economists who championed restraint in the obama and clinton white houses now argue that the current economic climate of low interest rates which shows signs of persisting mitigates the danger of deficit spending politicians and policymakers should focus on urgent social problems not deficits jason furman who headed the council of economic advisors in the obama white house and lawrence summers the clinton administration s treasury secretary wrote in a recent piece for foreign affairs low interest rates are forcing a lot of people to reevaluate things furman said in an interview the economic argument against big government deficits is that the need to borrow money to pay the bills will crowd out private investment driving up interest rates and ultimately slowing economic growth the fact that interest rates have remained persistently low despite rising deficits shows that s not happening high levels of government spending may be needed right now to keep the economy healthy say furman summers and their allies including olivier blanchard the former chief economist at the international monetary fund that case has been eagerly embraced by the democratic presidential candidates too eagerly for the economists in fact whose argument is filled with nuance that most of the 2020 hopefuls are choosing to overlook neither furman nor summers has given anything close to a seal of approval to the way many of the top tier candidates are framing what the nation can afford it is one of these unfortunate things where the economists are writing with all kinds of caveats that are being ignored by the politicians said alan auerbach chair of the economics department at the university of california berkeley promises to roll back the trump tax cuts don t come close to covering the bill by the time the proposal for a many trillion dollar green new deal hit congress and most of the 2020 hopefuls scrambled to sign on leading contenders were already drafting policies that eclipsed the cost of the tax law the additional levies on the wealthy and corporations that some candidates promote wouldn t do the trick either democratic economists agree you can do a lot with those said furman but not as much as people are promising the detailed plan massachusetts sen elizabeth warren offers to pay for her ambitious agenda provides a case in point warren makes her proposals to pay for her plan part of her pitch she would leave the burden entirely on the rich keeping with her vow to tap the corporate titans and family dynasties that she argues exploit a shrinking middle class can we talk about how to pay for it warren enthusiastically said on a recent cnn town hall after rattling off her proposal for free college taxing the super wealthy just 2 cents on every dollar they amass over 50 million would cover an astonishing government expansion she said we can do universal child care for every baby zero to 5 universal pre k universal college and knock back the student loan debt burden for 95 of our students and still have nearly a trillion dollars left over warren said the reality is not so easy and not just because of the long odds against passing any such wealth tax through congress or the legal issues about whether such a tax would pass constitutional muster warren s projections for what the wealth tax would generate are extremely optimistic twelve countries had such wealth taxes in 1990 and all but three have abandoned them because they didn t create the windfall projected as summers among others has pointed out countries that dropped their wealth taxes did so in part because of the difficulties involved in tracking down and valuing the assets of the super wealthy how much is that art collection worth who really owns that small tropical island and in part because other forms of taxation proved more efficient in paying for social welfare spending most european countries spend more on social programs than the u s but they also levy hefty consumption taxes that hit people at all income levels the candidate is undeterred this month warren vowed more spending from the wealth tax 100 billion to confront opioid abuse one of warren s opponents california sen kamala harris sometimes mocks those who chafe at the potential price tag for her big plans after promising a refundable tax cut that would put 500 per month into the pockets of families earning less than 100 000 per year harris at one appearance earlier this spring shifted into her impersonation of a naysayer projecting a nasally know it all voice well how are you going to pay for it the audience laughed i will tell you how harris said on day one we are going to repeal that tax bill that benefited the top 1 and the biggest corporations of america that s how a full repeal of the trump tax cut could cover the cost of harris tax plan but only if provisions in the trump tax bill that cut middle class taxes were also scrapped and harris acknowledges separate tax hikes would be required to fund her other signature proposal which would boost teacher pay nationwide an average of 13 500 a year costing 315 billion over a decade and then there are the even bigger plans the green new deal that most democrats say they support could cost in the range of 1 trillion per year depending on which version people espouse medicare for all which sen bernie sanders and some democrats back would increase government spending by as much as 30 trillion over a decade sanders and other backers say higher taxes would be offset by eliminating health insurance premiums while that might be true for the economy as a whole depending on how generous medicare for all benefits would be some individuals would definitely pay more former vice president joe biden has unveiled more modest plans so far but they still involve hefty spending which biden like the others insists won t cost anyone who isn t very rich we can do this all without punishing anybody biden said during his campaign kickoff tour in iowa by eliminating hundreds of billions of dollars in loopholes for the super wealthy and it is not going to again punish anybody sometimes the democrats will argue the big ticket spending will pay for itself by stimulating the economy it s a familiar argument to gleckman as it sounds much like the gop s trickle down economics democrats long reviled only the left s aspiration is that enormous government spending not enormous tax cuts will pay for itself the idea that you can spend with impunity and it will pay for itself is as outrageous as saying you can cut taxes and it will pay for itself he said for every government program that pays for itself i can give you a bridge to nowhere and raise you an airplane that doesn t fly
alberta s major exports these days seem to be piles of misinformation denial blame and propaganda on the state owned trans mountain pipeline according to some of the more ridiculous claims environmentalists are to blame for bitumen price discounts vancouverites are being punished for their orca loving ways with high gasoline prices and climate change really doesn t matter their politicians don t dare admit the reality that combined overproduction of bitumen and u s tight oil brought down the global price of oil with a thundering crash in 2014 in the world we inhabit now oil business as usual has died given that we all have and love our alberta relatives and friends here s a brief guide on how to reply to some of the false claims being traded like crypto currency among alberta s political columnists liberals new democrats and the united conservatives false alberta claim american oil companies are financing anti pipeline groups so albertan oil will keep going south and not reach chinese markets where it can get higher prices there is no evidence to support this wild and silly conspiracy theory which one tyee reader asked us to debunk the facts are these over decades the u s has built more than half of the world s heavy oil refining capacity in the midwest and gulf coast for a variety of reasons asia owns but 23 per cent of global capacity to refine heavy oil it s not willing to pay more for bitumen than the u s because it costs more to ship it there alberta s low royalty policy encouraged the industry to strip and ship diluted bitumen instead of adding value by building more upgrading facilities and complex refineries the province s dependence on u s markets and pipelines is a direct product of what was billed in 2006 as alberta s give it away strategy as mexican and venezuelan supplies of heavy crude decline the demand for canadian bitumen will actually increase in u s refinery markets contrary to alberta s propaganda claims not all heavy oil is discounted and canada often gets good value for its junk crude in u s markets even last year when discounts really hit hard the price of canadian heavy oil in houston often traded at a premium to west texas intermediate according to a prominent u s research firm canadian heavy oil imports will be increasingly in demand in the united states however the pace of canadian heavy oil growth is set to slow owing to the declining level of oil sands projects china the world s largest oil importer gets lots of heavy and high carbon oil from russia and venezuela unless replaced with cleaner forms of energy imports of contaminating oil will make it impossible for china to achieve its environmental goals according to world energy magazine false alberta claim carbon dioxide isn t a pollutant so opines calgary herald columnist chris nelson the federal environment minister talks as though carbon dioxide is a pollutant raw sewage into the st lawrence now that s pollution in the real world facing catastrophic climate shifts the oil and gas sector accounts for 27 per cent of canada s national greenhouse gas emissions or more than the transportation sector it remains the largest single growing source of carbon pollution in the nation since the industrial revolution humans have increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration by more than one third and that s destabilizing the climate which in turn is forcing mass migrations and unsettling economies nasa scientists call this dramatic carbon surge the most important long lived forcing of climate change sea level rises and ocean acidification as a result most scientists view the dramatic atmospheric increases in carbon dioxide as pollution false alberta claim two years of pipeline obstruction have put b c over the barrel with gasoline prices only an expansion of the trans mountain pipeline can ease the shortage and ease gasoline prices in the lower mainland this one appears on social media and none of it is really true but the refinery market picture is complicated and not terribly transparent first the primary purpose of the trans mountain expansion project is to export more heavy oil its application says nothing about bringing more refined products to b c or lowering gasoline prices most of the gasoline consumed in b c the nation s fourth largest market for refined fuels is made by four alberta refineries and moved along the existing 65 year old trans mountain pipeline less than 10 per cent of the province s gasoline comes from refineries in washington state an historical note when the trans mountain pipeline was built in the 1950s vancouver supported four refineries but as the line exported more oil to u s refineries local refining died off in the 1990s with the exception of parkland formerly chevron in burnaby the vancouver market has no ready access to refined products brought by sea so it is a price taker economist robyn allan calculates that neither taxes nor scarcity of supply fully explain why the region has some of canada s highest gasoline prices a study by the canadian centre for policy alternatives suggests alberta refineries have been price gouging vancouver consumers since 2010 because they can do so due to lack of local competition according to energy analyst david hughes the shipment of refined products on trans mountain pipeline fell from 18 per cent of capacity to 10 per cent in 2018 he doesn t know the reason everyone agrees that there needs to be more transparency and regulatory oversight on gasoline pricing to prevent price gouging to date high prices have had a predictable effect b c s per capita consumption of refined petroleum goods is 11 per cent below the national average false alberta claim canada s social and economic welfare depends on bitumen a growing oil and gas industry is the most vital economic lever in canada s economy and helps us build hospitals and schools writes columnist nelson in the calgary herald that s a big laugh despite 47 per cent growth in canada s oil and gas production since 2000 largely from the tar sands royalty payments to government have declined 59 per cent notes respected energy analyst david hughes so too has the industry s proportional contribution to gdp according to data from natural resources canada taxes paid by the oil and gas industry since 2006 have dropped from 12 billion to 6 billion selling off our oil and gas resources for declining revenues is a bad business model notes hughes false alberta claim alberta s oil is morally clean alberta s oil is ethical and among the most ethically regulated industries in the world trumpets former journalist now b c based oil and mining advocate stewart muir in the globe and mail there is light oil and heavy oil but no refinery has ever begged for ethical oil that s because it doesn t exist if alberta has done such a moral job of regulating its resources what happened to its rainy day fund and if the industry has behaved so ethically why will alberta and canadian taxpayers likely be on the hook for cleaning up and decommissioning 260 billion worth of abandoned wells pipelines and gas plants how ethical is it to allow an industry to set aside funds of 1 6 billion to cover hundreds of billions of dollars in liabilities new research says that carbon dioxide emission intensities for oil sands facilities are 13 to 123 per cent larger than those estimated using publicly available data is that an ethical development false alberta claim without the trans mountain expansion alberta will languish in the doldrums lots of albertans think this but the u s not china has 55 per cent of the world s heavy oil refineries the completion of the line 3 pipeline by 2020 and keystone xl pipeline by 2022 will allow alberta to export 1 2 million barrels a day to the u s gulf coast where bitumen will replace declining imports of mexican and venezuelan heavy crude those two lines make trans mountain which can t be built until 2022 unnecessary and uneconomic analyst hughes poses a good question if canadians had a choice of completing two industry funded projects over relatively flat north american prairie or one costly taxpayer funded project over the rockies through one of canada s most populated cities which would they choose false alberta claim every day canada is losing 30 to 40 million because the nation lacks sufficient pipeline capacity to get our diluted bitumen to world markets these numbers are a complete fiction does stephen king go around whining he is losing money because he hasn t written a bestselling book yet no and what industry would last a month with these kind of fictional losses to illustrate the grandiosity of the claim just consider the finances of suncor one of canada s largest bitumen miners if the industry were losing so much money every day you d expect suncor to be bleeding too but that s not what its financial statements say in fact suncor has been recording tidy profits for years because it mines upgrades and refines bitumen into a variety of refined products the company also hedges against oil price volatility and heavy oil discounts even with mandated provincial cuts in production the company produced 396 000 barrels of bitumen in the first quarter of 2019 with net earnings of 1 4 billion compared to 789 million in 2018 husky and imperial oil the province s other big producers also reported healthy returns this year we delivered more funds from operations compared to the first quarter of 2018 despite alberta government quotas on our oil production and even with global oil prices pretty much on par in canadian dollar terms boasted husky ceo rob peabody so don t try bullying british columbians with fictional losses produced by fictional pipelines alberta s three major bitumen producers make money regardless of pipeline politics because they do everything alberta failed to do they hedge add value and refine false alberta claim our turn off the taps legislation will cause utter havoc in the lower mainland and b c s unicorn worshippers will be very sorry good luck with that b c represents 20 per cent of the market for refined petroleum goods for alberta do you think imperial oil and suncor really want to lose that market share is flagellation a good way to ease a headache wait a minute maybe alberta premier jason kenney is a foreign funded environmental radical hell bent on trashing the oil sands false alberta claim alberta needs to get more oil to china because its authoritarian government will pay more for ethical bitumen than u s gulf coast refiners mexico tried that route and it didn t get a higher price for its heavy maya crude just check the prices here at oilprice com and don t forget about the law of supply and demand if the trans mountain expansion gets built and exports more than 500 000 barrels of heavy crude to asia oversupply will drop bitumen prices not inflate them notes economist robyn allan why would increasing the supply of heavy oil to china increase the price asks allan former head of b c crown corporation icbc energy companies want to spend 232 billion on additional oil and gas pipeline capacity in north america to meet demand growth in asia but a new report by global energy monitor notes that there is no guarantee asia markets will drink all of these exports the current surge in pipeline construction may prove to be fleeting as the legal system public opinion and financial markets increasingly challenge the fossil fuel industry false alberta claim u s funded environmentalists have kept alberta crude landlocked and crippled the province by preventing access to asian markets so says activist vivian krause to rooms full of rapturous oil executives and other oil sands supporters but alberta s bitumen has always been landlocked and it will always be subject to volatile discounts due to its low quality and transportation costs regardless of what environmental protesters do or say as hughes notes oil shipped on the trans mountain expansion to asia would lose 5 per barrel compared to pipelines under development due to higher premiums paid on the u s gulf coast and higher shipping costs to asia krause a pro pipeline advocate and blogger is right about u s funding for some environmental groups but she forgets to explain that most canadian environmental campaigns targeting fossil fuels or not have always involved u s funding and she doesn t provide any perspective by adding up the tens of millions of dollars that industry and governments have spent advocating for expanded oil sands production krause implies that the oil sands campaign had something to do with a conspiracy to protect u s oil production forgetting that fracked tight u s oil is a vastly different product than canada s heavy sour crude no conspiracy existed the campaign largely focused on bitumen s distinct character such crude has higher energy costs and an extreme carbon footprint compared to conventional oils alberta s remains one of the world s dirtiest oils with emissions 102 to 204 per cent higher than average u s refinery crude on a well to tank basis that includes all the emissions from mining upgrading and refining that s why alberta s oil was targeted period and given that oil sands production has increased 376 per cent since 2000 and overall oil and gas production has grown by 47 per cent in canada the alleged foreign funded attack has been damn ineffective notes analyst hughes one alberta claim that may be credible b c s premier is a hypocrite columnist don braid made this charge in the calgary herald in b c premier john horgan won t support the 10 billion trans mountain expansion but is championing and subsidizing lng export terminals and fracking he is a hypocrite actually by those terms horgan is a hypocrite the carbon footprint of fracked gas is large and ugly in addition the economics of the fracking industry are so poor that the industry requires enormous subsidies from taxpayers in the form of low royalties free water tax credits and cheap electricity from the unfinished and scandal plagued site c dam neb reconsideration report a new low for failing agency read more had braid really warmed to his theme he might have added this about b c s premier regarding the trans mountain pipeline expansion economist allan notes that horgan is not really fighting it as he promised with every tool in the tool box had he pushed for a provincial environmental assessment he could have killed the project but he refused to do that horgan is just sending out signals that he is fighting and that is all he is doing says allan but saying this would undercut the script in alberta which requires horgan to play the villainous wrecker of pipeline dreams truth can be painful add it all up and such truths become far too inconvenient for spreaders of self pitying myths in alberta global market forces rather than some grand conspiracy of foreign environmentalists and b c politicians are hurting bitumen sales even if they get their pipeline the trends bode ill for the province s oil dependent economy time for albertans to face facts and get on with living in a reality based 21st century
the united states recently raised the tariffs on 200 billion of chinese goods from 10 percent to 25 percent while targeting another 300 billion worth of chinese imports for potential punitive tariffs as was to be expected the yuan depreciated from 6 7 toward 6 9 against the us dollar mainly on renewed trade tensions china responded by imposing duties on 60 billion of us goods starting june 1 in other words instead of retaliating hard china chose a mild response that highlights the importance of talks the us administration may still be gloating over its misguided tariff stance yet the movement of the yuan may not be to the liking of the white house since it is likely to offset the tariff impact tariffs impact on chinese and asian currencies until the us tariff escalation china s currency was around 6 80 against the us dollar that however was predicated on the expectation that cooler heads would prevail in the white house and a broad scale trade war was avoidable but when the us opted for tariff escalation markets reacted quite expectedly for now the chinese currency has only reversed its appreciation year to date as the us prepares to raise and broaden tariffs even more the yuan could depreciate further but that is the white house s choice not beijing s preference indeed the us tariffs have paced the yuan s fluctuations since the start of the sino us trade dispute in light of these facts the claim that china is depreciating the yuan is simply flawed depreciation is precisely what china seeks to avoid when exports shrink a light depreciation of the currency is of no help and if the yuan depreciates significantly in a short period of time it would foster worries about capital flight us tariffs to blame for yuan depreciation that s why the chinese government has done precisely the reverse to avoid steeper depreciation and capital outflows the people s bank of china the country s central bank recently set a stronger than expected daily fixing of the exchange rate the depreciation of the yuan is in line with that of other emerging asia currencies that have taken hits including the indonesian rupiah singaporean dollar malaysian ringgit the indian rupee and the exhausted won of the republic of korea by the same token the us tariff hike is likely to cause negative spillover effects among the same currencies ironically those countries that may suffer most of the pain the rok and vietnam are also targets for the next tariff war and to think the rok is a close us ally in asia in the future the us seems intent on targeting europe japan the rok and the emerging economies in southeast asia us will be a collateral damage of its tariff wars a year ago larry kudlow director of us national economic council was still gung ho about us supremacy in the tariff dispute but recently he admitted that american consumers would pay for the us tariff wars in the us his reversal is seen as betrayal of american public and rightly so as the washington post put

while earnings growth could be shaved off by 3 percent auto sales are a barometer of what s to come in 2019 chinese auto sales could decline by 3 percent but in the us by almost 4 percent in 2020 us sales could remain in the red but chinese sales could increase according to us data unsurprisingly several us lawmakers are finally slamming the us tariff hike on chinese products in just a year or two the us administration has committed some of the worst trade policy mistakes in postwar us history the resulting economic pain will spread in the us as products shipped from china arrive in about three weeks us uses yuan as a scapegoat to distract public attention for a decade or two washington has periodically used the yuan as a scapegoat to distract public spotlight away from rising economic challenges in the us yet the yuan s value has been largely in line with fundamentals since the mid 2010s as the international monetary fund has affirmed however the us administration has a more intimate interest in currency manipulation the controversial plaza accord of 1985 led the us france west germany the united kingdom and japan to depreciate the us dollar relative to the japanese yen

the canadian economy is closely tied to the fortunes of the united states it s neighbor to the south canada is a far smaller nation with a total population of only 37 28 million compared to 329 million in the us however canada s total land mass is 3 855 million miles squared compared to 3 797 million miles squared in the us canada is the world s second largest country by land mass and it is rich in natural resources the nation is a leading producer of mineral fuels including crude oil gems and precious metals wood and agricultural commodities when most people think of canada brutally cold winters hockey and maple syrup come to mind however canada is a wealthy nation that exports over 75 of its natural resources and finish products to the leading consumer nation the united states last week canada and the us finally agreed on a replacement for the north american free trade agreement which had been a thorn in their side for the past year the invesco currency shares canadian dollar trust nysearca fxc reflects the price action in the canadian versus the us dollar the new nafta under the trump administration while the trade dispute between the us and china escalated recently the us agreed with canada and mexico to lift tariffs on metal imports which resolved a yearlong roadblock that stood in front of a new and improved nafta treaty the us lifted tariffs on aluminum and steel and canada and mexico canceled all retaliatory duties on us goods paving the way for the usmca or the united states mexico canada agreement on trade that will replace nafta upon ratification by congress canada insisted on the elimination of tariffs the trump administration was under pressure from members of congress that represent farmers ranchers and business groups as canadian and mexican retaliation put tariffs on us pork cheese and milk exports the agricultural sector continues to suffer because of trade disputes with the chinese and europeans canada and mexico insisted that they would not agree to a new deal unless the tariffs on steel and aluminum were lifted the us duties weighed on the canadian economy because it is the leading buyer of american steel in the world almost 90 of canadian steel and aluminum exports go to the us the us tariffs were likely to cost the canadian economy over 3 billion each year now that the tariffs are gone each side is comfortable with the deal president trump said i m pleased to announce we ve just reached agreement with canada and mexico in a statement from mexican president andres manuel lopez obrador the government said mexico reached a highly satisfying agreement with the united states canadian leader justin trudeau hailed the breakthrough on tariffs as pure good news he said that he and president trump agreed that tariffs were harming workers and consumers on both sides of the border now that the leaders of the three countries have agreed the trade deal will go to the legislatures in canada and mexico ratification is not likely to run into any roadblocks congress must ratify the trade deal given the political divisiveness in the us an assumption that the house of representatives will simply sign off on the deal and hand the president a victory on trade and fulfillment of a campaign pledge from 2016 could be a leap of faith with twenty three candidates from the other side of the political aisle lining up to take on the incumbent president in the us in 2020 the political schism is not going to narrow between now and election day if anything it will widen and the opposition party will do everything in its power to thwart executive power given the recent initiatives in the house that it is concentrating on impeachment before the ratification of a new trade agreement with the us s neighbors to the north and south the most likely challenger to president trump will be former vice president joe biden who currently has a commanding lead in the polls with over a year to go before the formal nomination of a candidate it will be interesting to see if the house takes time out of its agenda to ratify a trade agreement that benefits the nation and its neighbors in the current political environment oil is boosting the c and the new agreement helps the news on friday may 17 was positive for the value of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar recently the dollar has been moving higher against all other world currencies after trading to a short term low at 96 87 on the dollar index on may 1 the us currency index closed last friday at 97 824 as it was moving towards the mid april peak at 98 085 as of the end of last week the dollar index has moved 0 98 higher since the first day of may while many other currencies including the euro pound australian dollar and brazilian real have moved significantly lower since may 1 the canadian dollar has done better source cqg the daily chart of the june canadian dollar versus us dollar futures contract shows that c moved closed at 0 74445 on may 1 and was at 0 74315 on may 17 or 0 42 lower as it outperformed the dollar index since may 1 while the c had traded to a low at 0 7404 last friday the news on the trade agreement lifted the value of the currency at the end of the session at the same time the strength in oil prices has provided stability for the canadian dollar as the nation is a significant producer of the energy commodity fxc is the etf for the canadian currency the removal of tariffs on the metals and new agreement which allows us agricultural products to flow over the border to the north creates a win win for both canada and the us the current situation in the middle east which could keep the price of oil elevated is likely to bolster the value of the canadian dollar over the coming days and weeks source cqg the c has been trending lower against the us dollar since september 2017 when it traded to a high at 0 8291 at 0 74315 on may 17 the c declined by 10 4 at least part of the decline had been the result of the trade dispute that weighed on the value of the canadian currency the new usmca and strength in the oil market could cause the canadian dollar to recover over the coming weeks and months the invesco currency shares canadian dollar trust does an excellent job replicating the price action in the canadian dollar versus the us dollar currency relationship the fund summary for fxc states the investment seeks to track the price of the canadian dollar net of trust expenses the fund seeks to reflect the price of the canadian dollar the sponsor believes that for many investors the shares represent a cost effective investment relative to traditional means of investing in the foreign exchange market fxc is a liquid tool with 121 08 million in net assets and an average of 34 130 shares changing hands each day source barchart since september 2017 fxc dropped from 81 49 to 73 48 per share or around 10 which is close to the same move seen in the futures market the new trade deal and a strong oil price could provide stability to the us versus c relationship over the coming weeks as canada is also a significant producer of agricultural and other commodity products a rebound in the commodities market could also propel the currency higher as it can be a proxy for the raw material asset class in 2007 08 and 2011 when commodity prices hit highs the c hit

editor the tribune the petrodollar is a system where oil is sold in united states dollars exclusively in 1944 as a consequence of the bretton woods conference the us dollar backed by gold became the world reserve currency prior to that it was the british pound in 1971 us president richard nixon unilaterally cancelled the international convertibility of us dollars to gold from 1972 to 1974 the us made a series of agreements with saudi arabia which led to them selling oil in us dollars only in 1975 because of saudi arabia s influence the organisation of petroleum exporting countries opec agreed to sell oil exclusively in us dollars oil is the world s most traded and strategic commodity the us dollar status as the premier world reserve currency is tied to the petrodollar the petrodollar allows the us government to gain revenue by issuing bonds at lower interest rates than they would otherwise be able to do consequently the us government can run a higher budget deficit than most other countries and still be considered the world s most successful and powerful economy this allows the us debt to be 22 3 trillion dollars which is 105 of its gdp and the us is still considered having a successful economy the us is currently running a deficit of us 1 2 trillion annually and its is expected to increase today oil is not only sold in us dollars although over 90 is still sold in us dollars on december 8 2008 iran announced she had converted all of its oil payments exports in non us dollar currencies in 2014 quatar agreed to sell china oil in yuan in 2015 china and the united arab emirates created a currency swap agreement in 2016 india and iran transacted oil sales in indian rupees on march 26 2018 china launched its oil futures priced in yuan and the chinese oil futures contract is growing at a significant pace the iran nuclear deal is a threat to the petrodollar because it aggravated saudi arabia the world s largest exporter of oil on july 14 2015 in vienna the joint comprehensive plan of action better know as the iran nuclear deal was signed between iran the five permanent members of the united nation security council china france russia united kingdom united states plus germany and the european union on january 16 2016 the agreement was implemented this deal infuriated saudi arabia saudi arabia and iran are rivals on october 4 2017 saudi arabia s king salman bin abdelaziz al saudi visited russia for the first time in history presumably because they are not pleased with the iran nuclear deal on october 13 2017 us president donald trump announced the us will not make the certification provided for under us domestic law required to give effect to the iran nuclear deal on may 8 2018 announced us withdrawal from the iran nuclear deal on october 30 2000 the united nation granted saddam hussein permission to sell oil in euro in march 2003 his government was overthrown by us soldiers and he was eventually killed some people believe that in 2011 muammar al gaddafi s plan to quit selling libyan oil in us dollars demanding payment instead in gold backed dinars a single african currency made from gold was the real reason us supported malitia killed him it is probably more complex than that s4 venezuela has the world s largest oil reserve but is not even in the top 10 oil exporters if china and russia help venezuela to become the number one exporter of oil the petrodollar is dead the us will do everything in her power to prevent that the us needs to back its dollar with gold or else it will be vulnerable to pressure from saudi arabia russia and china nothing lasts for ever brian ellis plummer nassau may 12 2019

takeaways from the sic there are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way who nods at them and says morning boys how s the water and the two young fish swim on for a bit and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes what the hell is water david foster wallace this is water turning and turning in the widening gyre the falcon cannot hear the falconer things fall apart the centre cannot hold mere anarchy is loosed upon the world the blood dimmed tide is loosed and everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned the best lack all conviction while the worst are full of passionate intensity william butler yeats the second coming i told the above fish story as we opened the strategic investment conference this week most investors and fellow citizens have no idea what water we are swimming in they swim in a pool of agreed upon commonly understood narratives and that s all well and good until the water changes it is very important to know your water and what to do when it changes currently the narrative says that central banks and governments have our backs and will do whatever it takes to make everything including the water go on as usual call it kicking the can down the road or whatever metaphor you like but most investors extrapolate the recent past into the far future and that s usually the right move the cautious optimist usually wins which in our current social and political circumstances means that the one most important thing to know is what could change the narrative that was the sic theme this year i chose almost every speaker specifically for their ability to help us think the unthinkable i think most thinking investors whether professional or managing their own portfolios sense a shift in the zeitgeist what ben hunt calls the widening gyre referring to the yeats poem as an artist and a poet yeats presaged the 1920s and 1930s trauma that led to world war ii we understand that things are changing but the question we should ask ourselves is change to what we know that whatever happens won t be rainbows and unicorns yet if you are truly aware of what s going on in the world you have to be optimistic about humanity about the potential explosion of creativity in the midst of turmoil opportunity and crisis both beckon and i believe both will happen at the same time this will require a particularly delicate balance in both our lives and our portfolios the conference itself first recognize that i am writing stream of consciousness late on thursday night at the end of the conference i am emotionally overwhelmed intellectually sated and trying to assimilate probably the most stimulating and overpowering of 16 annual events dear gods i love it when a plan comes together there were speakers that discussed the next 6 12 months and others who looked out over the horizon both were equally important david rosenberg was his usual brilliant self with scores of slides making his case for recession and bear market he has been my opening speaker for 10 years and i joked that i am going to keep inviting him back until he gets it right his slide decks are simply brilliant rosie focused on the fed overshooting the neutral rate actually tightening as we go into recession with a combination of balance sheet reduction and interest rate increases something i ve also been ranting about his deck was worth the price of admission i ll give you one more chart with staggering implications on a topic other speakers also mentioned corporations are using record profits to increasingly borrow cheap debt and buy back their own shares this increases the p e ratio and creates the appearance of strength and growth even when neither is actually happening it is as dr woody brock told us later a bastardized form his words of capitalism that adam smith would not recognize if rosie was a shotgun mark yusko was a high velocity machine gun with 100 slides in his deck it reminded me of the joker who on seeing one of batman s miraculous escapes asked the world where does he get all those cool toys where does mark get all those cool charts more than one speaker pointed out how the us dollar could go higher but not necessarily for good reasons and not for ones that we would like at least those of us in the us but it comes with the territory when yours is the world s reserve currency again a common theme was that the dollar s reserve status is by default as there is no other realistic option it s the cleanest dirty shirt in the laundry carmen reinhart was a revelation arguably the world s leading expert on government debt she co authored with ken rogoff the definitive book on government debt and debt crises this time is different now with a different set of collaborators and what must be a battalion of grad students she is studying every government debt issue since the battle of waterloo it turns out there are similar characteristics between emerging market government debt with all its write downs and defaults and high yield corporate debt there are ways to make a significant premium over the risk free rate in the q a i mischievously asked her how has the fact that you arrived in the united states in 1966 at 10 years old with your mother and father and three suitcases from cuba affected your outlook and analysis her answer paraphrasing i talk with my students and colleagues about crises but there are various degrees of crises there are times when the crises are cataclysmic and we need to understand the difference at 10 years old i watched them take truckloads of men to be executed by firing squad that was a cataclysmic crisis the audience reacted viscerally to carmen s thoughts the only question i had for myself was why did it take 16 years for me to get her to my conference lacy hunt gave his best presentation ever that was not just my analysis but that of many long term conference attendees he presented two theorems first federal debt acceleration leads to lower not higher interest rates this is because the economic stimulus effectiveness ends quickly but the debt overhang causes weaker business conditions that reduce loan demand similarly monetary easing eventually leads to lower not higher interest rates debt productivity falls making the velocity of money decline so monetary policy becomes asymmetric and inefficient these are not intuitive to most people so lacy walked through algebraic proof of both theorems he also showed empirical evidence comparing government debt to interest rates in the us uk eurozone and japan since 2007 all the graphs looked almost identical these theorems are ominous if true because they show it is almost impossible for higher savings to both absorb the debt load and sustain consumer spending and business investment the only solution is prolonged austerity but the slightly good news is that in this scenario the us will likely stay the world s strongest economy simply because it has the best combination of debt productivity and demographics somewhat analogous to the cleanest dirty shirt in the laundry i was actually blown away that bill white the former chief economist for the bank of international settlements had never met lacy they were both fans of each other when lacy finished i had bill come on the stage and they engaged in a vigorous conversation about lacy s analysis it was one of the intellectual highlights of not only that conference but my life i can only say 47 wows bill gave his own presentation on thursday along with carmen reinhart and the inimitable howard marks of oaktree capital the final panel really was the fitting ending to a soaring conference i could go on and on about the other speakers the panels on china and europe were simply amazing housing emerging markets lots of china louis gave was his usual brilliant self george friedman forced us to step back and look at the bigger picture real estate people were begging for more after that session i moderated a conversation between neil howe and george friedman on the political outlook for 2020 and beyond i know both of their underlying cyclical arguments so i expected some fireworks i didn t realize they would both describe for different reasons the same kind of social tension in our near future on realizing this i just sat there stunned for a second i literally was speechless and i guess it showed on my face as the audience laughed i genuinely try not to be surprised on stage as i do a lot of prep work with each speaker they still left me reeling i can guarantee you that i m going to review neil howe s slide deck and george s speech more than a few times trying to assimilate it into my outlook i don t want you to think the conference was more bearish than it was there were actually numerous positive investment themes and opportunities attendee reaction was the most positive any of us from mauldin economics can remember every year long time attendees and more than a few have been there 10 times say that it is the best conference ever but 2019 seems to have set a new high bar i can guarantee you that you will see the impact of this sic in my writing i also know i will read every transcript at least once and probably several times some of the presentations were so insightful that you need a few passes to be able to really absorb the information at the end of one panel which did not mention cryptocurrencies the implications of what they said hit me so hard that i quipped almost thou persuadest me to buy bitcoin that was just one of a dozen portfolio changing takeaways that i gleaned i will confess as i write this late thursday night i m a little tired after a week of intense presentations and meetings i plan to sleep late for the next few mornings before shane and i return to puerto rico on saturday i m particularly pleased that more than 60 of the attendees at this conference were repeat they are now old friends and all say it s the best conference they attend every year many many people told me they ll be back next year talk about high bars i know i am raving but it was just that damn good i ve been to three hog callings and two county fairs and no event in my life has ever touched this one nothing but a list speakers nobody pays to get on my stage my speaker budget would choke a horse or at least it chokes me but you can t argue with the results now i know you wish you could ve been there i wish you had been there too your personal presence would have made it even better but the next best thing is a virtual pass every attendee this year got a free virtual pass as part of their admission price most of them have told me they re going to be going back and listening to their favorite speakers click here to order your virtual pass my friend simon hunt one of my go to china insiders said that it was the single best conference he has ever attended in his life and both of us have lived a long time and done hundreds of conferences i have to admit that i take a deep personal satisfaction that many sic speakers don t just fly in and fly out they stay for the experience both to meet other speakers and meet our attendees who are without a doubt some of the world s most interesting people and the speakers who couldn t stay very long all wanted a virtual pass as part of their fee personal confession i really don t watch speeches on the internet very often i read faster than people can talk which is why i insisted that our virtual pass be not just video but audio and full transcripts and slides depending on the speed at which you read you could attend this conference in a day but some of the presentations simply must be seen to be grasped the nuances just don t come out in print at mauldin economics i am talent not management i don t set prices or do the marketing and i certainly don t run a conference shannon staton and her team are simply the best i thank them for all their hard work they made this happen and with that i will hit the send button it is almost midnight and i m sitting in a hotel room dictating into the computer while my poor suffering wife shane kibitzes on my wording and wishes i would finish so she can go to sleep because she has an early day and i do not then again she is the energizer bunny and i am not i have had one of the most awesome weeks of my life next week will be great too as i spend time relaxing and pondering this one i hope you have a great week too take some time to think about the coming changes to our world and our own personal lives i believe it will be more glorious and at the same time more upsetting than anything we have experienced so far but we will do more than muddle through the 2020s are going to be awesome so much potential so much possibility sure if you project the recent past into the future you are not going to be happy but if you think about it and put a plan into action what an incredible future we are going to experience your friends don t let friends buy and hold analyst

the united states recently raised the tariffs on 200 billion of chinese goods from 10 percent to 25 percent while targeting another 300 billion worth of chinese imports for potential punitive tariffs as was to be expected the yuan depreciated from 6 7 toward 6 9 against the us dollar mainly on renewed trade tensions china responded by imposing duties on 60 billion of us goods starting june 1 in other words instead of retaliating hard china chose a mild response that highlights the importance of talks the us administration may still be gloating over its misguided tariff stance yet the movement of the yuan may not be to the liking of the white house since it is likely to offset the tariff impact tariffs impact on chinese and asian currencies until the us tariff escalation china s currency was around 6 80 against the us dollar that however was predicated on the expectation that cooler heads would prevail in the white house and a broad scale trade war was avoidable but when the us opted for tariff escalation markets reacted quite expectedly for now the chinese currency has only reversed its appreciation year to date as the us prepares to raise and broaden tariffs even more the yuan could depreciate further but that is the white house s choice not beijing s preference indeed the us tariffs have paced the yuan s fluctuations since the start of the sino us trade dispute in light of these facts the claim that china is depreciating the yuan is simply flawed depreciation is precisely what china seeks to avoid when exports shrink a light depreciation of the currency is of no help and if the yuan depreciates significantly in a short period of time it would foster worries about capital flight us tariffs to blame for yuan depreciation that s why the chinese government has done precisely the reverse to avoid steeper depreciation and capital outflows the people s bank of china the country s central bank recently set a stronger than expected daily fixing of the exchange rate the depreciation of the yuan is in line with that of other emerging asia currencies that have taken hits including the indonesian rupiah singaporean dollar malaysian ringgit the indian rupee and the exhausted won of the republic of korea by the same token the us tariff hike is likely to cause negative spillover effects among the same currencies ironically those countries that may suffer most of the pain the rok and vietnam are also targets for the next tariff war and to think the rok is a close us ally in asia in the future the us seems intent on targeting europe japan the rok and the emerging economies in southeast asia us will be a collateral damage of its tariff wars a year ago larry kudlow director of us national economic council was still gung ho about us supremacy in the tariff dispute but recently he admitted that american consumers would pay for the us tariff wars in the us his reversal is seen as betrayal of american public and rightly so as the washington post put it the white house s top economic adviser gives lie to its tariff war rhetoric here are the inconvenient truths a broad scale trade war could penalize 0 5 percent to 0 8 percent off real us gdp growth while earnings growth could be shaved off by 3 percent auto sales are a barometer of what s to come in 2019 chinese auto sales could decline by 3 percent but in the us by almost 4 percent in 2020 us sales could remain in the red but chinese sales could increase according to us data unsurprisingly several us lawmakers are finally slamming the us tariff hike on chinese products in just a year or two the us administration has committed some of the worst trade policy mistakes in postwar us history the resulting economic pain will spread in the us as products shipped from china arrive in about three weeks us uses yuan as a scapegoat to distract public attention for a decade or two washington has periodically used the yuan as a scapegoat to distract public spotlight away from rising economic challenges in the us yet the yuan s value has been largely in line with fundamentals since the mid 2010s as the international monetary fund has affirmed however the us administration has a more intimate interest in currency manipulation the controversial plaza accord of 1985 led the us france west germany the united kingdom and japan to depreciate the us dollar relative to the japanese yen and deutsche mark by intervening in the currency markets it was that exchange rate manipulation that played a key role in japan s subsequent containment asset bubbles deflation and secular stagnation and it is the same dream that seems to fuel the us trade hawks fantasies about china s containment and stagnation yet china is not japan dreams are just dreams and the white house is in for an

they keep piling up sometimes trillions of dollars at a time the competition among 2020 democratic presidential hopefuls to be bold in confronting vexing social and economic challenges has created a mountain of policy promises the rising price tag has implications the contenders prefer to sidestep candidates breezy assurances that everything from four years of college to first class medical care to cash payments for the middle class can be had for free unless you are one of those very wealthy americans targeted to foot the bill have concerned even liberal economists advertisement these big ambitious proposals are so expensive it is not possible to pay for them by just taxing the rich said howard gleckman a senior fellow at the urban brookings tax policy center they are going to require taxing middle income people but talking about that just doesn t fly politically democrats have always favored big investment in government but it s been decades since so many in the primary field have pushed so much spending with so little constraint the fiscal abandon with which the gop powered its huge tax cut package running up the red ink by hundreds of billions of dollars has moved democrats to also aggressively test budget boundaries revised thinking on the danger of deficits is giving them some cover economists who championed restraint in the obama and clinton white houses now argue that the current economic climate of low interest rates which shows signs of persisting mitigates the danger of deficit spending advertisement politicians and policymakers should focus on urgent social problems not deficits jason furman who headed the council of economic advisors in the obama white house and lawrence summers the clinton administration s treasury secretary wrote in a recent piece for foreign affairs low interest rates are forcing a lot of people to reevaluate things furman said in an interview the economic argument against big government deficits is that the need to borrow money to pay the bills will crowd out private investment driving up interest rates and ultimately slowing economic growth the fact that interest rates have remained persistently low despite rising deficits shows that s not happening high levels of government spending may be needed right now to keep the economy healthy say furman summers and their allies including olivier blanchard the former chief economist at the international monetary fund advertisement that case has been eagerly embraced by the democratic presidential candidates too eagerly for the economists in fact whose argument is filled with nuance that most of the 2020 hopefuls are choosing to overlook neither furman nor summers has given anything close to a seal of approval to the way many of the top tier candidates are framing what the nation can afford it is one of these unfortunate things where the economists are writing with all kinds of caveats that are being ignored by the politicians said alan auerbach chair of the economics department at uc berkeley advertisement promises to roll back the trump tax cuts don t come close to covering the bill by the time the proposal for a many trillion dollar green new deal hit congress and most of the 2020 hopefuls scrambled to sign on leading contenders were already drafting policies that eclipsed the cost of the tax law the additional levies on the wealthy and corporations that some candidates promote wouldn t do the trick either democratic economists agree you can do a lot with those said furman but not as much as people are promising the detailed plan massachusetts sen elizabeth warren offers to pay for her ambitious agenda provides a case in point warren makes her proposals to pay for her plan part of her pitch she would leave the burden entirely on the rich keeping with her vow to tap the corporate titans and family dynasties that she argues exploit a shrinking middle class advertisement can we talk about how to pay for it warren enthusiastically said on a recent cnn town hall after rattling off her proposal for free college taxing the super wealthy just 2 cents on every dollar they amass over 50 million would cover an astonishing government expansion she said we can do universal child care for every baby zero to 5 universal pre k universal college and knock back the student loan debt burden for 95 of our students and still have nearly a trillion dollars left over warren said the reality is not so easy and not just because of the long odds against passing any such wealth tax through congress or the legal issues about whether such a tax would pass constitutional muster warren s projections for what the wealth tax would generate are extremely optimistic twelve countries had such wealth taxes in 1990 and all but three have abandoned them because they didn t create the windfall projected as summers among others has pointed out advertisement countries that dropped their wealth taxes did so in part because of the difficulties involved in tracking down and valuing the assets of the super wealthy how much is that art collection worth who really owns that small tropical island and in part because other forms of taxation proved more efficient in paying for social welfare spending most european countries spend more on social programs than the u s but they also levy hefty consumption taxes that hit people at all income levels the candidate is undeterred earlier this month warren vowed more spending from the wealth tax 100 billion to confront opioid abuse one of warren s opponents california sen kamala harris sometimes mocks those who chafe at the potential price tag for her big plans after promising a refundable tax cut that would put 500 per month into the pockets of families earning less than 100 000 per year harris at one appearance earlier this spring shifted into her impersonation of a naysayer projecting a nasally know it all voice well how are you going to pay for it advertisement the audience laughed i will tell you how harris said on day one we are going to repeal that tax bill that benefited the top 1 and the biggest corporations of america that s how a full repeal of the trump tax cut could cover the cost of harris tax plan but only if provisions in the trump tax bill that cut middle class taxes were also scrapped and harris acknowledges separate tax hikes would be required to fund her other signature proposal which would boost teacher pay nationwide an average of 13 500 a year costing 315 billion over a decade and then there are the even bigger plans the green new deal that most democrats say they support could cost in the range of 1 trillion per year depending on which version people espouse advertisement medicare for all which sen bernie sanders and some democrats back would increase government spending by as much as 30 trillion over a decade sanders and other backers say higher taxes would be offset by eliminating health insurance premiums while that might be true for the economy as a whole depending on how generous medicare for all benefits would be some individuals would definitely pay more former vice president joe biden has unveiled more modest plans so far but they still involve hefty spending which biden like the others insists won t cost anyone who isn t very rich we can do this all without punishing anybody biden said during his campaign kickoff tour in iowa by eliminating hundreds of billions of dollars in loopholes for the super wealthy and it is not going to again punish anybody advertisement sometimes the democrats will argue the big ticket spending will pay for itself by stimulating the economy it s a familiar argument to gleckman as it sounds much like the gop s trickle down economics democrats long reviled only the left s aspiration is that enormous government spending not enormous tax cuts will pay for itself the idea that you can spend with impunity and it will pay for itself is as outrageous as saying you can cut taxes and it will pay for itself he said for every government program that pays for itself i can give you a bridge to nowhere and raise you an airplane that doesn t fly
the monetary policy committee mpc of the central bank of egypt cbe will hold its third regular meeting this year to discuss the fate of interest rates which is the most prominent indicator of the direction of interest rates on the egyptian pound in the local market the committee s meeting this time comes amid strong expectations that it will be stabilised at the same levels reached on 14 february despite the decline in the rate of headline and core inflation at the end of april at its 14 february meeting the committee decided to reduce the basic interest rates by 1 to 15 75 for deposits 16 75 for lending and 16 25 for credit discount and main operation on 28 march the cbe disagreed with market expectations and decided to fix those prices at this level despite expectations of a reduction the cbe reported drop in core inflation to 8 1 year over year y o y in april from 8 9 in march the monthly core inflation rate was 0 4 in april from 0 5 in march the central agency for public mobilization and statistics capmas said that the annual inflation of consumer prices index cpi in cities fell to 13 y o y in april compared with 14 2 in march the cpi scored 308 1 points for april 2019 registering a rise of 0 4 compared to march 2019 mohamed abdel aal a member of the board of directors of the suez canal bank and a banking expert said that the changes in the international and domestic markets support the cbe s trend to stabilise its interest rates and weakens the trend to reduce them he expected the cbe to cut interest rates in the fourth quarter q4 of 2019 abdel aal added that despite the decline in inflation during the month of april yet removing subsidies and freeing the price of gasoline scheduled for implementation starting next july will lead to increased inflation again he pointed out that the exchange rate of the pound is stable and significantly improving which may push the cbe to stabilise interest rates so as not to pressure the local currency by raising or lowering interest rates adding that the interest rate must be attractive to foreign investors in government debt instruments according to abdel aal the cbe may also want to maintain the remarkable return on household savings to compensate for high inflation rates and avoid possible inflationary pressures especially as the country moves to liberalise energy prices in accordance with the agreed timetable with the international monetary fund in the second half of this year in addition to rising global oil prices furthermore abdel aal pointed to the existence of external factors which could affect the monetary policy of egypt including the escalating trade war between the united states and china which may push inflation to rise in the us which may force the federal reserve to raise the interest rate on the dollar which may be then force the cbe to raise the interest rate tarek metwally a banking expert who predicted interest rates to remain unchanged on thursday also agreed noting that the probability of keeping rates unchanged is greater than a cut in rates as the government moves to lift subsidies on fuel in june a report by the research department of hc securities said that the mpc of the cbe will set the interest rate at its meeting scheduled for thursday the research also expected the cbe to keep interest rates unchanged at its next three meetings so that the market absorbs the first and second impact cycles to increase fuel prices while monthly inflation was exceptionally low in april it is expected to rise in may due to increased consumer demand during ramadan sara saada macroeconomic analyst at the company s research department said however hc expects the cbe to resume its interest rate cuts by the end of q3 or in q4 of 2019 as prices stabilise but the reduction decision remains subject to the market s position at the time in a research note issued by pharos holdings it expected the pound interest to be stabilised at thursday s meeting but also expected 100 basis points bps rate cut to 200 bps in q4 of this year it pointed out that the monthly inflation figures were less than expected pointing out that the discounts on food items by the government contributed to curbing inflation pharos expected the annual inflation rate to rise again in the coming months due to the removal of fuel subsidies and for the headline inflation to increase by 3 in june and september in conjunction with the beginning of the school year which tends to come with 1 inflation increase on an annualized basis pharos sees inflation as between 12 5 and 13 5 the investment bank shuaa also predicted that the cbe will keep interest rates unchanged until the end of the year with ramadan and eid followed by fiscal controls expected to continue inflationary pressures in contrast investment bank beltone said there was a chance to cut the pound s interest rate further by 100 bps at the mpc meeting on thursday in our view the recent cut in interest rates ahead of february s forecast aimed to boost investor confidence by sending a strong confidence message in the current monetary policy as well as confidence in the local currency course however the most likely scenario is to cut interest rates by 100 bps by the end of the year amid the repercussions of inflationary pressure as the automated fuel pricing mechanism is applied fitch ratings had forecast that the cbe would cut interest rates again by 100 bps during the rest of 2019 the agency said in a report that the risks of further easing monetary policy maintains substantial risks
kuala lumpur malaysia may 21 ips after the failure and abuses of privatization became apparent public private partnerships have since been promoted ostensibly to mobilize private finance for the public purpose in all too many cases ppps have socialized costs and losses while ensuring private financial gains after the failure and abuses of privatization and contracting out services from the 1980s there has been renewed appreciation for the role of the state or government earlier promoters of privatization have taken a step backward only to take two more forward to instead promote public private partnerships ppps ppps for most purposes ppps are essentially long term contracts underwritten by government guarantees with which the private sector builds and sometimes runs major infrastructure projects or services traditionally provided by the state such as hospitals schools roads railways water sanitation and energy jomo kwame sundaram ppps are promoted by many governments associated with the organization for economic co operation and development oecd and some multilateral development banks especially the world bank as the solution to the financing shortfall needed to achieve development including the sustainable development goals sdgs since the late 1990s many countries have embraced ppps in many areas ranging from healthcare and education to transport and infrastructure with mixed consequences they were less common in developing countries but that is changing rapidly with many countries in asia latin america and africa now introducing enabling legislation and initiating ppp projects ppps are now an increasingly popular means to finance mega infrastructure projects but dams highways large plantations pipelines and energy or transport infrastructure can ruin habitats displace communities and devastate natural resources typically social and environmental legislation is weakened or circumscribed to attract investors for ppps there are also a growing number of dirty energy ppps devastating the environment undermining progressive environmental conservation efforts and exacerbating climate change ppps have also led to forced displacement repression and other abuses of local communities indigenous peoples displaced farmers and labourers among others ppp financing more public than private nevertheless experiences with ppps have been largely although not exclusively negative and very few ppps have delivered results in the public interest there has been some supposed success with infrastructure ppps mainly due to financing arrangements generally ppps for hospitals and schools have much poorer records compared to infrastructure one can have good financing arrangements due to preferential interest rates for a poor ppp project nevertheless private finance all over the world still accounts for a small share of infrastructure financing however good financing arrangements will not make a bad ppp project any better ppps typically involve public financing for developing countries to attract bids from influential private companies often from abroad blended finance export financing and new supposed aid arrangements have become means for foreign governments to support powerful corporations bidding for ppp contracts abroad especially in developing countries incredibly such arrangements are increasingly counted as overseas development assistance as north south south south or triangular development cooperation like privatization ppps often increase fees or charges for users ppp contracts often undermine the public interest in other ways with generous host government incentives and other privileges often compromising and undermining the state s obligation to regulate in the public interest ppps can limit government capacity to enact new legislation and other policies such as strengthened environmental or social regulations that might adversely affect or constrain investor interests ppps public pain private gain ppp contracts are typically complex negotiations are subject to commercial confidentiality making it hard for civil society and parliamentarians to provide checks and balances in the public and national interest such limited transparency significantly increases the likelihood of corruption and undermines democratic accountability it is important to establish the circumstances required to achieve efficiency gains and to recognize the longer term fiscal implications of ppp related contingent liabilities shifting public debt to government guaranteed debt does not really reduce government debt liabilities but obscures accountability as it is taken off budget and is no longer subject to parliamentary let alone public scrutiny hence ppps are more likely to be abused because they are typically off balance sheet so that they do not show up as government debt giving the illusion of easy money or credit despite claims to the contrary ppps are typically riskier for governments than for the private companies involved as the government may be required to step in to assume costs and liabilities if things go wrong ppps also undermine democracy and national sovereignty as such contracts tend not to be transparent and subject to unaccountable international adjudication due to investor state dispute settlement isds commitments rather than national or international courts under world bank proposed ppp contracts for example national governments can even be liable for losses due to strikes by workers government procurement one alternative of course is government or public procurement in many instances ppps have become the most expensive financing option and much less cost effective than transparent competitive government procurement they cost governments significantly more in the long run than if the government procures on an open competitive basis or if projects are directly financed by government borrowings generally ppps are much more expensive than government procurement despite government subsidized credit however with a competent government doing good work government procurement can be efficient and low cost with a competent government and accountable consultants efficient government procurement has generally proved far more cost effective than ppp alternatives it is therefore important to establish when and why meaningful gains can be achieved through ppps and when these are unlikely

public private partnerships fad fails after the failure and abuses of privatization became apparent public private partnerships have since been promoted ostensibly to mobilize private finance for the public purpose in all too many cases ppps have socialized costs and losses while ensuring private financial gains kuala lumpur malaysia may 21 2019 ips after the failure and abuses of privatization and contracting out services from the 1980s there has been renewed appreciation for the role of the state or government earlier promoters of privatization have taken a step backward only to take two more forward to instead promote public private partnerships ppps ppps are essentially long term contracts underwritten by government guarantees with which the private sector builds and sometimes runs major infrastructure projects or services traditionally provided by the state such as hospitals schools roads railways water sanitation and energy ppps are promoted by many governments associated with the organization for economic co operation and development oecd and some multilateral development banks especially the world bank as the solution to the financing shortfall needed to achieve development including the sustainable development goals sdgs since the late 1990s many countries have embraced ppps in many areas ranging from healthcare and education to transport and infrastructure with mixed consequences they were less common in developing countries but that is changing rapidly with many countries in asia latin america and africa now introducing enabling legislation and initiating ppp projects ppps are now an increasingly popular means to finance mega infrastructure projects but dams highways large plantations pipelines and energy or transport infrastructure can ruin habitats displace communities and devastate natural resources typically social and environmental legislation is weakened or circumscribed to attract investors for ppps there are also a growing number of dirty energy ppps devastating the environment undermining progressive environmental conservation efforts and exacerbating climate change ppps have also led to forced displacement repression and other abuses of local communities indigenous peoples displaced farmers and labourers among others ppp financing more public than private nevertheless experiences with ppps have been largely although not exclusively negative and very few ppps have delivered results in the public interest there has been some supposed success with infrastructure ppps mainly due to financing arrangements generally ppps for hospitals and schools have much poorer records compared to infrastructure one can have good financing arrangements due to preferential interest rates for a poor ppp project nevertheless private finance all over the world still accounts for a small share of infrastructure financing however good financing arrangements will not make a bad ppp project any better ppps typically involve public financing for developing countries to attract bids from influential private companies often from abroad blended finance export financing and new supposed aid arrangements have become means for foreign governments to support powerful corporations bidding for ppp contracts abroad especially in developing countries incredibly such arrangements are increasingly counted as overseas development assistance as north south south south or triangular development cooperation like privatization ppps often increase fees or charges for users ppp contracts often undermine the public interest in other ways with generous host government incentives and other privileges often compromising and undermining the state s obligation to regulate in the public interest ppps can limit government capacity to enact new legislation and other policies such as strengthened environmental or social regulations that might adversely affect or constrain investor interests ppps public pain private gain ppp contracts are typically complex negotiations are subject to commercial confidentiality making it hard for civil society and parliamentarians to provide checks and balances in the public and national interest such limited transparency significantly increases the likelihood of corruption and undermines democratic accountability it is important to establish the circumstances required to achieve efficiency gains and to recognize the longer term fiscal implications of ppp related contingent liabilities shifting public debt to government guaranteed debt does not really reduce government debt liabilities but obscures accountability as it is taken off budget and is no longer subject to parliamentary let alone public scrutiny hence ppps are more likely to be abused because they are typically off balance sheet so that they do not show up as government debt giving the illusion of easy money or credit despite claims to the contrary ppps are typically riskier for governments than for the private companies involved as the government may be required to step in to assume costs and liabilities if things go wrong ppps also undermine democracy and national sovereignty as such contracts tend not to be transparent and subject to unaccountable international adjudication due to investor state dispute settlement isds commitments rather than national or international courts under world bank proposed ppp contracts for example national governments can even be liable for losses due to strikes by workers government procurement one alternative of course is government or public procurement in many instances ppps have become the most expensive financing option and much less cost effective than transparent competitive government procurement they cost governments significantly more in the long run than if the government procures on an open competitive basis or if projects are directly financed by government borrowings generally ppps are much more expensive than government procurement despite government subsidized credit however with a competent government doing good work government procurement can be efficient and low cost with a competent government and accountable consultants efficient government procurement has generally proved far more cost effective than ppp alternatives it is therefore important to establish when and why meaningful gains can be achieved through ppps and when these are unlikely

session because of rally in stocks and treasury yields on the other hand sterling is recovering mildly as traders takes profit on short positions uk prime minister theresa may is set to scheduled to announce her new brexit deal at 1500gmt for now we d view the above moves as temporary firstly the move by us commerce department was mainly for housekeeping purpose only that is it s for preventing sudden disruptions on the internet telecom on the us side it s by no means an end to us china trade tension more importantly given the hard line rhetorics from both sides we re not seeing any chance of a deal in that 90 days window secondly may has repeated history of delivering nothing special on brexit pound could be back under pressure should may disappoint again the more sustainable underlying move is in australian dollar rba governor philip lowe was clear in his speech that they re going to considering cutting interest rate in june meeting even if rba chooses to wait again in june it looks inevitable that they ll still deliver the rate cut in august the uncertainty lies only in timing aussie will likely stay pressured ahead in the currency markets aussie is rightly below the weakest one for today so far yen follows as second weakest then new zealand dollar canadian dollar is the strongest one followed by sterling and then dollar technically 55 day ema at 110 84 is a key level to watch in usd jpy as long as it holds further decline is expected and yen will likely resume recent broad based rise sooner or later though sustained break would probably pull other yen

they were below normal the 10 balance was the worst since october 2016 but stayed broadly in line with long run average of 13 anna leach cbi deputy chief economist said with investment down stockpiling up and the threat of a no deal ever present we desperately need parliament to thrash out a viable deal in the national interest where the cross party talks failed parliament must succeed or continued economic paralysis will see us hurtle ever closer to disaster ecb de guindos slower growth momentum increases tail risks ecb vice president luis de guindos urged eurozone banks to build extra capital buffers to mitigate the risk of unexpected shocks he said the slower growth momentum we are seeing increases the risk of tail events in other words shocks that are unlikely to occur but would have a significant impact on the financial system and the economy if they did the continued build up of buffers could therefore be justified especially in those countries where the long upturn may have led to an underestimation of credit risk or where private indebtedness is particularly high or rising boj kuroda persisting us china trade war has widespread impact of global and japanese economies boj governor haruhiko kuroda warned of the impact of us china trade war again in the parliament today he said if trade tensions persist they would have a widespread impact on global and japanese economies via business sentiment and market developments and we hope the united states and china engage in constructive discussions finance minister taro aso also told the parliament that we re seeing some manufacturers delaying capital expenditure plans however corporate profits are high and the fundamentals supporting domestic demand remain solid rba to consider cutting interest rate at june meeting in a speech delivered today rba governor philip lowe said the central bank will consider the case for cutting interests in the upcoming meeting in two weeks time n june after weak inflation reading and surge in unemployment rate in q1 rba might pull ahead the anticipated rate cut s for the second half lowe said accumulating evidence is that the australian economy can support an unemployment rate of below 5 per cent without raising inflation concerns such judgement is also consistent with the experience overseas meanwhile recent flow of data suggests it s less likely that current policy settings are sufficient to deliver lower unemployment there are few options ahead to lower unemployment rate these include further monetary easing additional fiscal support and structure policy changes but he emphasized relying on just one type of policy has limitations so each of these is worth thinking about lowe concluded the speech noting a lower cash rate would support employment growth and bring forward the time when inflation is consistent with the target given this assessment at our meeting in two weeks time we will consider the case for lower interest rates more on rba us grants housekeeping temporary exemptions on restrictions on huawei the us commerce department announced limited exemptions on products of chinese telecom giant huawei the move is seen as for keeping the house in order so as to prevent internet computer and cell phone systems from crashing under the move huawei and its 68 non us affiliates will be granted 90 days temporary general license to have limited engagement in transactions involving the export reexport and transfer of items with the arrangement this license will allow operations to continue for existing huawei mobile phone users and rural broadband networks the commerce department said it will evaluate whether to extend the exemptions beyond 90 days oecd lowers global growth forecast on trade tension but upgrades us oecd lowered global growth forecast to 3 2 in 2019 down from march projection of 3 3 chief economist laurence boone warned that the fragile global economy is being destabilized by trade tensions and growth is stabilizing but the economy is weak and there are very serious risks on the horizon governments need to work harder together to ensure a return to stronger and more sustainable growth on us china trade war oecd warned that an intensification of trade restrictions would have significant costs the new tariffs and measures announced this month could reduce gdp growth in us and china by 0 2 0 3 on average by 2021 and 2022 under the scenarios of additional 25 tariffs on essentially all remaining bilateral trade between us and china the short term costs are considerably higher and broader global trade could be reduced by 1 by 2021 us gdp could dropped by 0 6 while china gdp could drooped by 0 8 however it should also be noted that gdp growth projection was revised up by 0 2 to 2 8 in 2019 and by 0 1 to 2 3 in 2020 oecd said in the absence of further shocks the economy is on track to continue its solid expansion and grow somewhat faster than the rest of the oecd on average summary of new growth projections 2019 global at 3 2 down from 3 3 march forecast 2020 global at 3 4 unchanged 2019 us at 2 8 up from 2 6 2020 us at 2 3 up from 2 2 2019 eurozone at 1 2 up from 1 0 2020

be limited by 55 day ema now at 110 83 to bring another fall on the downside below 109 81 minor support will turn bias back to the downside for 109 02 break there will extend the decline from 112 40 to retest 104 69 low however sustained trading above 55 day ema will indicate completion of the fall from 112 40 and bring retest of this high in the bigger picture usd jpy is staying inside falling channel from 118 65 currently development suggests that rebound from 104 69 is only a corrective move and fall from 118 65 is not completed yet decisive break of 104 69 will extend the down trend

china economy to get more stimulus to fight trade war tariffs official drops hint help may come the debate over whether china needs a new round of stimulus to offset weakening economic growth has returned following disappointing april economic data and the threat by the united states to expand tariffs to cover all chinese imports that debate will intensify with the news that wang yang a member of the ruling communist party s policymaking politburo standing committee told taiwanese businessmen at a meeting in beijing on thursday that the trade war in the worst case scenario could cut chinese growth by a full percentage point this year this would push the growth rate below the government s target rate of between 6 0 per cent and 6 5 per cent rate for this year without additional stimulus help the economy grew by 6 4 per cent in the first quarter of 2019 the same rate as in the previous quarter some analysts expect the government to be forced to expand fiscal and monetary stimulus to maintain employment levels its top policy priority others argue that while the government may fine tune existing stimulus measures no major new stimulus should be expected the government has been mostly tight lipped about its policy plans however on friday meng wei spokesperson for the national development and reform commission ndrc china s central planning agency seemed to suggest that further stimulus was possible if economic conditions warranted we must adhere to our bottom line thinking maintain strategic strength and further improve stabilising the six key aspects employment finance exports foreign investment investment and sentiment at the same time fully study the impact of the implementation of the tariff increases and promptly introduce countermeasures as needed to ensure that the economy operates within a reasonable range she said last july the policymaking politburo ordered the government to focus on these six key aspects of economic stabilisation following the first round of us trade tariffs that month this resulted in the government adopting a series of economic stimulus measures over the following six months the phrase six key aspects appeared in every politburo statement until last month when it was dropped after better than expected first quarter economic growth meng s use of the six key aspects may suggest that the government is now ready to revisit its stimulus programme if growth continues to slow the debate among private sector analysts returned after a series of weak data for april the last month before the tariff rate will rise from 10 per cent to 25 per cent on us 200 billion worth of chinese imports retail sales industrial production and fixed asset investment all dropped below market expectations in contrast to the stronger than expected growth in the first quarter according to figures released by the national bureau of statistics on wednesday industrial production growth slowed sharply to 5 4 per cent in april from 8 5 per cent in march while retail sales growth fell to 7 2 per cent the lowest rate in 16 years from 8 7 per cent the month before investment expanded 6 1 per cent in the first four months of the year down from 6 3 per cent in the january to march period and confounding analysts expectations for an increase other april data were also weaker exports unexpectedly dropped 2 7 per cent last month raising worries that the hit on trade sector will become more severe in addition the official purchasing managers index fell bank lending was weaker than expected and vehicle sales dropped for the 10th month in a row these data clearly confirm a double dip and indicate that growth has yet to truly bottom out said lu ting chief china economist at nomura although headline activity data may pick up slightly in may due in part to front loading of exports to the us to avoid possible further tariffs we expect beijing to significantly ramp up easing or stimulus measures to stabilise financial markets and bolster growth he wrote in a research note the severity of the trade war has escalated quickly after washington published the procedures for levying tariffs of up to 25 per cent almost all of the remaining chinese imports valued by the us at around us 300 billion china has already taken a series of proactive fiscal policy steps this year such as implementing a 2 trillion yuan us 289 7 billion tax cut higher spending and allowing local governments to issue 2 15 trillion yuan of special purpose bonds to fund new infrastructure projects however julian evans pritchard senior china economist at capital economics said monetary policy will probably take the lead in additional stimulus this time given budget constraints on local governments economic momentum risks weakening again in the near term as the prop from this year s fiscal front loading faded he said others doubt beijing is ready to enact any major new stimulus particularly given the effect this would have on the country s already high level of debt analysts at advisory firm trivium argued that the conventional wisdom that sub par economic data combined with increased uncertainty over the trade war would lead to more stimulus is wrong we have stated over and over in recent months that chinese stimulus would disappoint the analysts said in a note we still believe that at the april politburo meeting which always discusses the economy top policymakers were adamant that they would stay the course despite lingering downward pressure on the economy and the yet to be resolved trade war policy will not fundamentally change until the politburo sends a new signal larry hu chief china economist at macquarie capital said the government would likely continue its efforts to spur bank lending to small businesses which are suffering the most in the trade war but the room for conventional policy easing is limited at the current stage and policymakers are only likely to boost stimulus if the economy deteriorates in the second half of the year he said chinese officials have tried to shore up market confidence by stressing that the country s economy remains fundamentally solid and insisting that policymakers have sufficient capacity to deal with external problems the manoeuvring room for macroeconomic policy operations is relatively large and we still have ample policy tools statistics bureau spokesperson liu aihua said on wednesday last week the people s bank of china pboc attributed lower than expected april bank lending to seasonal factors and said it would not engage in any major monetary policy loosening in the period ahead rather pboc officials said they would fine tune policy in line with economic developments this week the central bank sought to maintain market liquidity by renewing 200 billion yuan of one year lending to banks via its medium term lending facility and issuing 20 billion yuan of central bank bills in hong kong which was interpreted by analysts as a move to prop up the yuan exchange rate which has declined against the us dollar since the us tariff announcement while policy fine tuning is on the way the chinese leadership has clearly endeavoured to prop up employment which is vital to social stability on the day that beijing fought back with tiered tariff hikes on us 60 billion worth of american imports it convened a national televised conference on employment in a written notice premier li keqiang vowed to achieve the government s target of creating at least 11 million new jobs this year and enhance targeted help for graduates demobilised soldiers and migrant workers the official employment figures which largely exclude migrant workers look solid so far about 4 59 million new jobs were created in the first four months of the year 42 per cent of the annual target while the surveyed urban unemployment rate edged down by 0 2 percentage point to 5 0 per cent in april the central government have ordered coastal provinces

the us dollar continued its steep incline in pakistan reaching a new all time high in the interbank and open market on tuesday in the open market the dollar rose by rs 3 and was being sold for rs 154 the buying rate of the dollar in the open market was rs 152 50 with an increase of rs 2 72 the dollar reached rs 151 92 in the interbank market the sliding rupee has caused alarm in pakistan which is already facing inflation likely to average over 7 percent for the year and surging costs for fuel and power which are both heavily influenced by the dollar exchange rate the rupee has been falling against the dollar following an agreement with the international monetary fund imf on a 6 billion loan with expected strict conditions including a market determined exchange rate the announcement of the latest assistance has eroded the value of the rupee by 8 5 percent the rupee s official exchange rate is supported by the central bank under a de facto managed float system and many analysts consider the currency to be overvalued according to data from the state bank of pakistan sbp the central bank s foreign exchange reserves as of may 3 stood at 8 984 billion equivalent to less than three months of import payments the sbp which lifted interest rates by 150 basis points on monday to 12 25 said it was watching the foreign exchange market closely and would act in the case of unwarranted volatility it said the recent slide reflects the continuing resolution of accumulated imbalances of the past and some role of supply and demand factors traders believe the interest rate hike coupled with the devaluation of the rupee would drive many industrialists out of business the government is implementing the imf s terms before the deal is even signed pakistan people s party senator sherry rehman said in a statement on tuesday this is also evident in the unabated increase in the dollar rate which has seen the rupee plummet in the open market basically the sudden spike of the dollar against the rupee is due to the impact of the imf deal plus a shortage of dollars in the market said saad hashemy chief economist and director of research at topline securities in karachi the imf agreement still needs to be ratified by the fund s board in washington with inflation running at more than 8 percent a weaker currency is likely to add to pressure on household budgets particularly on power and gas bills where the government faces growing pressure to allow regulated prices to rise since the beginning of this fiscal year the rupee has lost more than 21 percent of its value to the dollar the pakistani currency has also depreciated by rs 0 50 to rs 40 70 against the saudi riyal and rs 0 40 to rs 41 50 against the arab emirate dirham we were expecting that the rupee would hit 153 by the end of current year but that level has been achieved much before said samiullah tariq the head of research at arif habib limited there is too much volatility in the market and we are unable to understand what is on their government s mind the buying activity in the open market is comparatively low amid high demand for the greenback said malik bostan the president of forex association of pakistan a panic like situation can be seen in the interbank market the decline in the rupee s value during the past two weeks and the lagged impact of previous bouts of depreciation have pushed up the prices of almost all essential items including flour dates meat fruit etc during ramazan

burning out his fuse up there alone says michael wilson it looks like it s gonna be a long long time so here s my question for this month how fast can we expect a country s economy to grow and what happens if it grows faster it s an old conundrum and it puts me in mind of the time forty years ago when i asked my boss why people complained that japan s trade surplus was too high son he explained wearily it s because it means everybody else s deficit is too high sooner or later all the money is going to end up in the country with the surpluses and that s risky for everybody and it stops the other countries from growing as they should in a balanced international way pesky pushbacks he had a point and what strikes me about president donald trump s recent insistence that the us economy could take off like a rocket ship if only the federal reserve would relax its tight lending policies is that if it sounds too good to be true it probably is there are automatic pushbacks that will immediately come into force if the fed lowers its interest rates a weaker dollar sharply higher inflation and unsaleable us bond dividends for a start it isn t clear at present whether mr trump understands the logic of these relationships at all if not we may be looking at a steep learning curve but heck we have to start somewhere the point in america s case is that economic growth is already going at full tilt thank you very much 3 4 in third quarter 2018 slowing to a projected 2 6 in 2019 in the industrialised world only poland comes close to that america s unemployment rate is a mere 3 8 the euro area was 7 8 in january and britain 4 us retail spending grew by 2 8 annually in january and the us national retail federation is forecasting a mighty 2019 rise of between 3 8 and 4 4 what strikes me about president donald trump s recent insistence that the us economy could take off like a rocket ship if only the federal reserve would relax its tight lending policies is that if it sounds too good to be true it probably is and by that reckoning conventional wisdom says that the last thing it needs right now is another set of booster rockets you could get away with 4 gdp growth and more in developing countries like china 6 5 india 6 6 parts of south east asia or chile and peru but that s because they all have huge untapped resources of household demand that will allow for great latitude before market saturation sets in and everyone has a fridge and a car but america nope let s wind back the argument by 15 months or so to the point where president trump was whingeing that his brand new appointee to the federal reserve chairmanship jay powell was obstructing us prospects by talking about gradually raising bank rates so as to head off what the fed saw as an unhealthily high rate of economic growth trump had fallen out with his last fed chair the obama appointed janet yellen for making a very similar case but he had assumed that his own man would be more loyal i ll concede that my assessment of the president s economic and political acumen has not always been flattering alas he has spent much of the last six months railing instead about powell last december he declared that he was not even a little bit happy with the federal reserve chairman and he was even reported to be canvassing opinions on whether his appointee could be sacked before his first year was out so it came as no surprise in early april when mr trump demanded a cut in us interest rates together with the sell off of the bonds which the fed had bought back during the quantitative easing programme of the last decade all of this he said would put the soaring economy into some sort of interstellar overdrive now i ll concede that my assessment of the president s economic and political acumen has not always been flattering at its core trump s belief is that america s trade and diplomatic relationships are a one dimensional matter of america versus the rest with all power reverting to the winner of each one on one gladiatorial round the concept of a multilateral growth pattern that depends on mutual and international support is alien to his zero sum thinking in trump s mind when one country wins another country loses and by the same amount the international system can t be bigger than the sum of its parts instead the point of the exercise is to fight for the biggest part seizing the controls some observers have seen mr trump s insistence on escaping the bounds of fiscal gravity as part of a general need to tighten his personal control and never mind the awkward details his personal power seems to have grown in the last month since the mueller report on russian collusion turned out an inconclusive report that his supporters have claimed has exonerated him the us supreme court is now packed with rightist judges who the president has personally appointed the foreign affairs departments are headed by figures who can be relied on to bash china and iran salute north korea and ignore africa the security agencies with whom he disagrees on just about everything have been all but sidelined and the homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen resigned in april after only 18 months in office just as the president announced a tougher run on the mexican border so what could be more natural now than for the white house to seize control of us fiscal policy as well why not ditch the insubordinate fed chairman and direct central bank policy from the oval office and never mind the namby pamby moaners who caution about the need to proceed carefully there are more worries here than we might suppose the political independence of central banks is a shibboleth of the free trading world and an important guarantor of policy stability through thick and thin through left wing and right wing governments i ll grant you that britain didn t get formal independence for its own bank of england until 1997 but even before that its impartiality was a touchstone of london s international credibility no foreigner would want to buy sterling paper unless it was backed by a solid and sensible policy committee with the freedom to make up its own mind would they unfortunately as we ve said the really bad news for us old time trump doubters is that america s economy appears to be in rather good shape at the moment so does president trump have what it takes to steer a national fiscal policy he certainly seems to think so perhaps he might like to check the experience of the turkish president recep tayyip erdogan who has been there before him erdogan like trump also supervised an improbably fastgrowing domestic economy without any proper knowledge of economic principles although that was some years ago but he has been having a crash course with a capital c in the last couple of years on the one hand he has recently been moved to stop his central bank from raising interest rates in an effort to halt the galloping inflation it caused and to head off intense pressure on the turkish lira and on the other he has caused consternation by ordering the country s small shops not to raise their retail prices in response to much higher wholesale prices because of the aforementioned weakening currency with unemployment riding above 12 the population appears to have given him short shrift at the time of writing midapril the turkish leader was trying to annul local elections which he had inconveniently lost not even mr trump would be tempted to try that one sugar rush unfortunately as we ve said the really bad news for us oldtime trump doubters is that america s economy appears to be in rather good shape at the moment we sceptics may carp about the expected plunge in corporate profitability this year and a lot of us don t trust the shiller cape ratios which are still close to their all time highs and we don t see anything good coming for us industrial output or for its farming as long as trump s trade tariffs continue to hurt the nation s producers but we d be fools to deny that on the face of it president trump is having a good run of luck the last year has been generally excellent for us equities which are one of the prez s favourite measures of his economic success when the indices are rising and one of his favourite punchbags when they re not we british curmudgeons are inclined to dismiss all this protesting that america is enjoying a nutrient free sugar rush that s come from the 1 6 trillion of tax giveaways that the trump administration handed out two years ago we dismiss trump s claim that his sugar pill has generated any kind of lasting or fundamental growth in the us economy we draw comfort from the fact that a large proportion of the sugar pill has been used by wall street s listed companies to buy back about 1 trillion worth of shares and debt obligations indeed on those figures it doesn t look as though very much of the tax breaks have gone back into net business investment at all we sceptics might also add that america s current spending boom has been substantially paid for by expanding the level of consumer debt and more worryingly by a dramatic increase in high risk sub prime borrowing but unfortunately for us sceptics that wouldn t alter the fact that us jobs are being created somehow or other the psychology of infectious optimism is a very complex thing what of the bond markets but we digress where does trump s economic growth programme go from here we hardly need to wonder with the 2020 presidential elections coming up fast and with most analysts expecting that the first phase of the prez s booster rockets are now approaching burnout what could be more logical than to sweeten up the national mood with another well timed burst of government paper ballistics all of it paid for by the nation s grandchildren just as the last lot was that of course would be a political master stroke but it wouldn t be entirely without problems chinese purchases of us government bonds would slow to a halt for a start and that in turn would send us bond yields soaring within a few weeks if it went on for long or if the president doubled down against china it might even weaken the dollar s supremacy i was going to say endanger but upon reflection i doubt that the euro could muster enough cred at the moment to seriously threaten it i could go on but we d be well into the realms of speculation so let s move on to a few solid facts by looking at who actually owns the us government debt that trump controls at the end of 2018 according to data from the federal reserve foreign countries held 6 27 trillion of us government debt and that s about four months gdp by the way naturally the us holds other countries bonds in turn but it s the influence patterns that i m interested in here of this 6 27 trillion 1 123 trillion was held by china plus another 196 billion by hong kong 1 042 trillion was held by japan 303 billion by brazil 280 billion by ireland and 273 billion by the united kingdom the eurozone s other holdings are vanishingly small even germany holds only 70 billion according to these figures although belgium luxembourg and non member switzerland are all in the 200 billion zone don t forget also the 211 billion held in the secretive cayman islands what does all that suggests it suggests that mr trump doesn t depend on keeping the fiscal peace with europe nearly as much as he does with china which holds 21 of his country s government paper that s a takeaway that may yet give the president a bad dose of indigestion don t lose sight of that international perspective donald whatever you do
the association of bureau de change operators of nigeria abcon has urged the federal government to leverage trade war between the u s and china to further strengthen the naira and develop the economy alhaji aminu gwadabe president of abcon said this in a statement issued on monday in lagos according to him the trade tension has led to a higher crude oil price which is good for the naira and the economy the trade war between the united states of america and china has led to higher crude oil brent prices which is good for the naira and the nigerian economy since the beginning of april this year oil prices have remained above 70 dollars per barrel as the trade war rages the u s sanctions on iran and venezuela have tightened the supply of crude oil to the market and put upward pressure on oil prices gwadabe said the abcon chief noted that washington had last week raised tariffs on 200 billion dollars worth of chinese imports to 25 per cent from previous rate of 10 per cent pushing prices of affected consumer goods higher he urged the federal government and the central bank of nigeria cbn to introduce programmes that would support growth and development opportunities in the country gwadabe said that with the exchange rate stability being witnessed in the market the cbn should strive toward achieving a single digit interest rate that would stimulate economic activities and business growth on currency swap deal gwadabe said that russia and the asian countries were already utilising their yuan swap agreement with china to strengthen their local currency a strategy he said nigeria was also expected to pursue the abcon boss advised the cbn management to deepen currency swap pact with china and diversify commodity exports to the u s in other to diversify foreign exchange earnings for the country according to him nigeria should focus on diversifying its foreign exchange earnings through the promotion of diaspora remittances for economic buffer and foreign reserves accretion he said this was obtainable in india and the united arab emirates where migration remittances had lifted their economies according to him effort should also be intensified by fiscal authorities in empowering the youths through job creation and higher productivity the financial expert explained that bdcs nationwide were committed to transparent foreign exchange transactions within the ambit of the law he commended the cbn management for promoting a sustainable exchange rate stability policy that was in consonance with its price stability mandate gwadebe said there was an option for the cbn to either abandon the exchange rate stability mandate to accumulate foreign reserve and allow the naira to depreciate as was the case when the local currency dropped to n530 to a dollar nearly two years ago he said the cbn had been able to create a people focused bank promoting macro economic objectives such as low inflation and a stable exchange rate with focus on promoting inclusive growth and reducing unemployment in the country the abcon president added that the apex bank had also increased its lending to the agricultural and manufacturing sectors this he noted was being done through targeted intervention schemes such as the anchor borrowers programme commercial agricultural credit scheme and the real sector support facility he said that abcon under his leadership would continue to support the cbn s progressive policies including the investors and exporters i e forex window which had attracted 48 billion dollars worth of transactions to the economy this has supported the rise in external reserves to 45 billion dollars in april 2019 from 23 billion dollars in october 2016 he said with improved availability of foreign exchange the exchange rate at the i e fx window had remained stable over the past 24 months at an average n360 per dollar according to him the parallel market exchange rate has appreciated from n530 per dollar in february 2017 to n360 per dollar today he listed other growth support interventions initiated by the cbn as the n222 billion micro small and medium enterprise development fund msmedf among others gwadabe noted that in most of these interventions loans were granted at a concessionary rate of nine per cent these policies gwadabe said should be sustained and leveraged on at this period of higher oil prices to grow the local currency and promote healthy foreign exchange reserves

monday s stock market session was again marked by heavy falls in tech stocks the trade war was again to blame with the huawei blacklisting by the us heightening tensions a 90 day reprieve and a chinese liquidity injection have helped markets recover but these are only temporary measures the markets have now fallen heavily on mondays for three weeks in a row yet again the trade war was to blame this time the fall out coming after the us clamped down on huawei s operations in the us and with us companies tech stocks were down sharply with apple and semi conductors worst off alphabet google was also dragged into the trade war as their android operating system is used by huawei it was first thought the blacklist would immediately affect operations and all business would be stopped but later president trump provided a 90 day reprieve to us companies doing business with huawei a move which helped calm markets slightly but does little to resolve the underlying problems this comes after a 180 day delay to additional proposed tariffs on the eurozone and japan which is also an issue that could flare up later this year trump has managed to stop the markets from collapsing but the fear is it is just a temporary measure and there looks to be many potential problems ahead actually trump said over the weekend that they had a deal but they changed it this was denied by chinese foreign ministry spokesman lu kang who said we don t know what this agreement is the united states is talking about perhaps the united states has an agreement they all along had extravagant expectations for but it s certainly not a so called agreement that china agreed to meanwhile both countries are watching their stock markets closely as indicators of strength or weakness trump is pressuring the fed to cut rates even inject liquidity through qe4 but so far they have signaled only a pause in the hiking schedule this message was repeated on monday night as fed chair powell said it was premature to make a judgement on rates as the trade negotiations were still highly uncertain this hasn t stopped the market from pricing in cuts and pricing already reflects two cuts in the next 12 months china has been stimulating the economy through monetary stimulus and on monday night it it again injected cash into the system as danske banks reported tuesday morning the central bank offered 80b yuan of seven day funding the biggest single day injection in more than a month it has fuelled hopes that the chinese will stimulate the economy further and chinese stocks are close to 2 higher this morning and both european and us equity futures are pointing higher aud election boost fades the australian dollar was boosted on monday by the weekend news that incumbent scott morrison managed to secure a majority government in the australian election however this early strength soon faded and the release of the rba minutes on tuesday morning reminded the markets that context for the aud is not bullish westpac reports the minutes of the may rba board meeting confirm that the board holds a clear easing bias advertisement as the minutes note financial market pricing implied that the cash rate was expected to be lowered by 25bps within the next three months and again by the end of 2019 the board notes that without an easing in monetary policy over the next six months growth and inflation outcomes would be expected to be less favourable than the central scenario this should come as no surprise given the signals the bank has been putting out in 2019 and the recent cut by rbnz any aud strength is being sold

thirty seven heads of state government representatives and representatives of international organisations gathered in beijing for april s brf deals collectively worth us 64 billion were signed during

inception in 2013 the bri has established itself as a defining feature of the global economy and politics bri induced chinese outbound direct investment totals us 80 billion more than 80 special economic zones and high tech industrial parks have either been built or are under construction creating jobs and billions in extra tax revenue for host governments trade between china and bri partners is flourishing at a time when global trade faces uncertainties between 2013 and 2016 the value of china s merchandise trade with bri countries increased at a faster rate than china s overall foreign trade an important contributor to the rapid growth in trade is enhanced transport connectivity in the past direct rail services between china and europe were inconceivable but thanks to the bri duisburg a lesser known city in germany has become the largest inland port in the world shipping goods from chongqing to duisburg takes 45 days by sea but only about 12 days by rail in 2018 6300 containerised freight trains from china used this route that figure could rise to 10 000 within five years china and bri countries have launched more than 1200 new international air routes and signed 18 transport facilitation agreements to improve the efficiency of commercial border crossing new trade routes are also being created simultaneously though a number of non bri countries have criticised the bri the united states sees the bri as a cover for debt trap diplomacy through which china lures borrowing countries into unrepayable debts to gain political leverage over them the bri is at risk of losing its lustre among several once enthusiastic participants due to a host of practical implementation problems in the wake of the hambantota port handover sri lanka appears disillusioned having

best practices pertaining to project development operation procurement and tendering and bidding with the help of singapore china is establishing a panel of international mediators from bri countries to resolve disputes including cross border disputes arising from projects under the bri china has also listed strengthening development policy synergy with similar initiatives such as asean

in an earlier post i gave you a sneak preview of my interview with chris powell secretary treasurer at gold anti trust action committee gata for 20 years now chris and others at gata have made it their mission to expose collusion by international financial institutions to control the price and supply of gold in an earlier post i gave you a sneak preview of my interview with chris powell secretary treasurer at gold anti trust action committee gata for 20 years now chris and others at gata have made it their mission to expose collusion by international financial institutions to control the price and supply of gold below are highlights from the interview i have to say that during much of our conversation my jaw was on the floor i don t want to say much more than that read on and remember to share widely tell us about gata s background and what it does gata was founded in 1999 to expose and litigate against the longstanding western central bank policy of suppressing the price of gold at first we weren t even sure if it was western banks that were doing it but after a year or so of research and investigation we concluded that the bullion banks were operating surreptitiously as brokers for governments giving cover to their intervention in the gold market at the time we had a law firm advise us that this rigging was very likely authorized by the gold reserve act of 1934 as amended since then and as such there may not be grounds to sue the government directly over gold price manipulation we went ahead and filed suit in 2001 anyway in the u s district court in boston we had a consultant a harvard trained lawyer and gold investor who brought a case against the bank of international settlements bis the u s treasury and various bullion banks one particular hearing i attended that year produced a remarkable admission from an assistant u s attorney in short he said that while the government was not admitting to the complaint it nevertheless had the power and authority to do all the things the suit complained of manipulating the price of gold in other words i made a record of this admission and put out a press release the lawsuit was ultimately dismissed by the judge on technical jurisdictional grounds having lost a little hope of suing the government directly we determined that the best course of action going forward was to try to publicize our findings we re convinced that the gold reserve act gives the u s government particularly the treasury department and the exchange stabilization fund esf the unrestricted authority to intervene in and secretly rig any market in the world our work now is simply to expose this policy to as large an audience as possible on a practical level how does manipulation like this occur on such a global scale it s done largely in the futures markets it s also done in the london over the counter otc market the mechanisms are gold swaps and leases between central banks and bullion banks and through the sale of futures contracts we ve seen a number of flash crashes in the price of gold but lately they ve been happening every few weeks somebody will dump a billion dollars or more of gold futures contracts in new york that can be achieved only by someone with infinite resources and money who also has a powerful interest in suppressing the price of gold nobody interested in making good money would dump that much gold all at once he would sell it gradually over a period of time i think these flash crashes are irrefutable evidence of price suppression click to enlarge are there any public records that point to all of this yes there s all sorts of material in the treasury department and federal reserve archives about gold price suppression being u s policy jelle zijlstra the former president of the netherlands central bank who simultaneously served as president of the bis wrote in his memoirs that the gold price has always been suppressed at the behest of the united states through international action you can go back to the years of the london gold pool in the 1960s where the control of the gold price through international action was a matter of public record operating through the bank of england boe a very remarkable transcript exists of a meeting in april 1974 between secretary of state henry kissinger and thomas enders the assistant under secretary of state for economic and business affairs enders explains to kissinger that u s government policy is to drive gold out of the world s financial system and prevent european governments from remonetizing the metal in any way the purpose of this policy is to support the u s dollar as the world reserve currency and if not the dollar then the international monetary fund s imf special drawing rights sdr the most compelling evidence i believe are letters sent by representative alex mooney of west virginia to the federal reserve treasury department and u s commodity futures trading commission cftc mooney asked the fed and treasury to identify which markets they re secretly trading in and to explain the purposes of this trading fed chair jerome powell essentially refused to answer the question as did the treasury mooney asked the cftc to state whether manipulation trading in the futures markets undertaken by the u s government or its agents or brokers is subject to the cftc s jurisdiction or whether such manipulation is actually legal or exempt from ordinary commodities law the cftc refused to answer the question i think these agencies refusal to answer mooney s questions is quite revealing and notably mainstream financial journalists don t find any of this curious they have a rule never to put a critical question to any central bank about anything theoretically somebody could do it it s being attempted by alternate news agencies and research organizations but you can t get an answer that s a good indication i believe that central banks are doing things they don t want the markets to know about my next question has to do with central banks and their consumption of gold they ve been net buyers since 2010 the united states continues to be the single largest holder of gold of any institution on the planet how do we reconcile that if they own all this gold wouldn t it go against their self interest to suppress its price click to enlarge that seemed to be a paradox to gata some years ago but we don t believe it is any longer to suppress the price of gold you need a certain amount of inventory to knock the market down you can t do it entirely through the naked shorting that they do in the futures market you always need to be bleeding a certain amount of the metal into the market to maintain the appearance of a gold market you can t just be trading paper all the time it s not enough the u s economists paul brodsky and lee quaintance wrote a paper a few years ago that floats a plausible hypothesis of what s going on the two hypothesized that the policy in recent years has been to redistribute world gold reserves among central banks so that those banks that have been overweight in u s dollars and treasuries could hedge themselves in anticipation of an inevitable devaluation of the dollar and revaluation of gold central banks the two allege intervene together in the futures market to drive the nominal price down to facilitate easy acquisition of gold they would prefer to keep the public out of acquiring the metal full disclosure i don t have any particular evidence from government sources that confirms brodsky and quaintance s hypothesis but it certainly fits the facts as we understand them as you likely know a jpmorgan trader is awaiting sentencing right now for his participation in gold price rigging what s your reaction to this his sentencing has been delayed twice now it was delayed again the other day for another six months i m not sure what to make of it to be honest there s some confusion here because a few years ago the chief executive of jpmorgan jamie dimon and the woman who was running its commodities desk at the time blythe masters both gave interviews saying that jpmorgan has no position of its own in the monetary metals markets they were trading them only for clients of course nobody in journalism followed up by asking dimon or masters who the clients were i would have wondered if the bank was acting as the broker for the u s or chinese government that was certainly implied from the answers they gave now this trader john edmonds apparently had to admit that he was rigging the gold and silver markets while trading at jpmorgan he was allegedly doing it with the knowledge and counsel of his superiors and if it were done on behalf of the government presumably it s legal under the gold reserve act but as charles peters former editor of the washington monthly used to say the scandal is never what s illegal the scandal is what s perfectly legal so why is edmonds being prosecuted because he was front running government trades was he doing it just for himself i can t imagine the justice department would be prosecuting him if his trading was being conducted on behalf of the u s government where do you think gold prices would be right now if not for this manipulation what s the true value of gold the true value of gold is whatever our free market wants it to be our attitude toward money is very libertarian let there be free markets and currencies and if governments are intervening they should be transparent about what they re doing having said that the disparagement of gold for years is that its price has not kept up with inflation everything keeps up with inflation that in itself is pretty powerful evidence of government intervention it s not keeping health insurance costs and medical care prices down it s not keeping college tuition down it s not keeping grocery prices down how come gold is the only thing that doesn t keep up with inflation silver too all of the traditional ratios of monetary metals values compared to stock market levels and other prices have been thrown off in recent years because of government intervention click to enlarge so what would those prices be if the traditional ratios were enforced again i can t say for sure but obviously they would be far far higher than they are today and the government knows this if the government ever got out of the futures market and abandoned its manipulation scheme metal prices would remonetize in as little as a week i ll add that if you want the gold or silver price to go up you ve got to buy real physical metal take it out of the banking system and weaken the futures market which is where the manipulation takes place if readers are interested in learning more where should they go they can go to our site gata org

authors pradumna b rana and xianbai ji rsis at the second belt and road forum brf in beijing held from 25 27 april 2019 china acknowledged the criticisms levelled against the belt and road initiative bri and pledged reform we could see a bri 2 0 emerge if these reforms are implemented and cooperation with development partners and stakeholder countries increases thirty seven heads of state government representatives and representatives of international organisations gathered in beijing for april s brf deals collectively worth us 64 billion were signed during the three day summit leaders also issued a joint communique expressing their shared commitment to advancing high quality sustainable and inclusive belt and road cooperation five years since its inception in 2013 the bri has established itself as a defining feature of the global economy and politics bri induced chinese outbound direct investment totals us 80 billion more than 80 special economic zones and high tech industrial parks have either been built or are under construction creating jobs and billions in extra tax revenue for host governments trade between china and bri partners is flourishing at a time when global trade faces uncertainties between 2013 and 2016 the value of china s merchandise trade with bri countries increased at a faster rate than china s overall foreign trade an important contributor to the rapid growth in trade is enhanced transport connectivity in the past direct rail services between china and europe were inconceivable but thanks to the bri duisburg a lesser known city in germany has become the largest inland port in the world shipping goods from chongqing to duisburg takes 45 days by sea but only about 12 days by rail in 2018 6300 containerised freight trains from china used this route that figure could rise to 10 000 within five years china and bri countries have launched more than 1200 new international air routes and signed 18 transport facilitation agreements to improve the efficiency of commercial border crossing new trade routes are also being created simultaneously though a number of non bri countries have criticised the bri the united states sees the bri as a cover for debt trap diplomacy through which china lures borrowing countries into unrepayable debts to gain political leverage over them the bri is at risk of losing its lustre among several once enthusiastic participants due to a host of practical implementation problems in the wake of the hambantota port handover sri lanka appears disillusioned having chosen to stay away from this year s brf several countries like pakistan malaysia myanmar the maldives and bangladesh have sought to review re negotiate cancel or scale down bri commitments citing concerns over cost overrun erosion of sovereignty and reports of corruption malaysia s east coast rail link is back on track but only after china reduced the price tag by about a third at the brf chinese president xi jinping acknowledged the criticisms levelled against his signature policy and pledged to reform it in a number of ways first china will multilateralise the bri xi declared strong support for multilateralism and vowed to work more closely with multilateral development banks in third markets he also attached importance to the bri adopting multilateral rules and international best practices pertaining to project development operation procurement and tendering and bidding with the help of singapore china is establishing a panel of international mediators from bri countries to resolve disputes including cross border disputes arising from projects under the bri china has also listed strengthening development policy synergy with similar initiatives such as asean connectivity 2025 and the eu strategy on connecting europe and asia as the top priority for jointly developing the bri second china will make the bri more sustainable a bri debt sustainability framework similar to those of the international monetary fund and world bank was released to help partner countries in decision making responding to environmental concerns xi made a pledge to launch green infrastructure projects make green investment and provide green financing on the socio political front the brf endorsed the beijing initiative for the clean silk road pushing bri countries into fighting corruption together this step is path breaking as previous bri policy statements rarely referenced anti corruption third china will continue structural reforms including beefing up the enforcement of intellectual property rights stopping involuntary technology transfer and abolishing unreasonable regulations subsidies and practices a successful bri cannot be a one way street where bri partner countries open up to chinese trade and investment while china shuts its doors on them stakeholder countries have also been requested to create an investment friendly environment and to treat chinese enterprises in a fair and friendly manner in light of pushbacks and criticisms during the bri s first five years china has pledged reform this could lead to the emergence of a bri 2 0 if china implements these reforms effectively and cooperation with development partners and stakeholder countries increases this new bri 2 0 will be better positioned to lead to shared prosperity for all participants dr pradumna b

source rbz calls for efficient interbank market the herald may 21 2019 golden sibanda senior business reporter the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz has directed banks to discontinue twinning arrangements for their customers with a view to promote efficient functioning of interbank market and willing buyer willing seller practice in trading of foreign currency banks will also now require prior foreign exchange approval authority for all foreign payments that include dividend and subscription fees following indications some were dipping in clients funds for own obligations moral hazards that include misdirection of foreign currency and twinning of sellers and buyers pairing customers outside the interbank system of foreign currency is widely believed to be one of the major causes of the lukewarm start of the interbank foreign exchange market despite the country having built stocks of forex now marginally short of hitting the us 1 billion the highest since 2009 acute shortage of foreign currency persisted as little foreign currency found its way to the interbank instead banks would make twinning arrangements between strategically positioned clients for instance holders of forex and their suppliers of key raw materials which starved other key sectors of the economy without such special privileges rbz governor dr john mangudya introduced the interbank when he presented his 2019 monetary policy in february this year and at the same time introduced local currency rtgs which is now freely floated and traded on the platform while it was expected that the interbank would resolve issues around allocation and shortage of hard currency it got off to a slow start as exporters tightly held to their funds amid concerns of perceived low interbank rate alternatively the banks would make special arrangements between clients from which they made huge commissions instead of facilitating and promoting trading on the interbank foreign exchange market there is also a general feeling that the central bank is managing the interbank rate to prevent it from freely rising according to market forces which many believe was being done to rein in rampaging inflation rate it was this alleged controlled floating of the foreign currency in comparison to dynamics on the black market which many people believed also hampered the free and market led operation of the interbank market rbz governor dr john mangudya said in a statement last night that all banks were required to stop all twining arrangements forthwith and allow free willing buyer willing seller practice to reflect true market conditions he said banks must ensure that there were no moral hazards in the operation of the interbank foreign exchange market this comes as petroleum marketers will from today have to procure foreign currency for importation of fuel on the interbank foreign exchange market as government moves to enhance efficiencies in the procurement of fuels into the country in this regard all the foreign exchange requirements for banks for their own use that includes dividend payments subscription fees etc would need prior exchange control approval for the proper conduct of the interbank foreign exchange market similarly banks should discontinue twinning arrangements for their customers as this undermines the efficient operation of the interbank foreign exchange market dr mangudya said the new framework will be anchored by us 500 million worth of lines of credit from afreximbank whose drawdown the central bank started yesterday the new forex rules for fuel marketers will also see the government scrapping excise duty on fuel which was introduced in january as part of concerted efforts to bring prices in line with the region to eliminate arbitrage opportunities amid fears some forex allocated at 1 to 1 for key imports may have been abused through arbitrage and speculation cabinet is said to have recently requested an audit of firms that received foreign exchange at us dollar to rtgs parity between october 2018 and february 2019 since the fuel importers will procure fuel on the interbank market as part of niftily refining the fuel procurement process government has ended foreign currency allocations to the country s fuel marketers on a 1 to 1 basis while government adjusted fuel prices to plug arbitrage gaps which contributed to fuel shortage prices of local fuel is believed to still be on the lower side about us 1 per litre at the interbank rate rtgs 3 45 and us60 70 cents per litre using parallel market rates gaps wildly believed to be the result of arbitrage and speculative practices within the country s fuel procurement and distribution industry have resulted in demand and supply mismatch which often manifest in crippling shortages and long queues this may however come to an abrupt end after the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz said at the weekend that it had secured half a billion united states dollars to strengthen and enhance the efficient functioning of the interbank foreign exchange market market intelligence indicated yesterday after the tweeted message by central bank governor hours following wild swings in parallel market exchange rates had calmed nerves and sent rates on gradual downslide as liquidity on the interbank is set to improve but this was not before prices of some basic goods such as cooking oil rice and flour skipped on the back of speculative and profiteering tendencies synonymous with the majority of the country s unscrupulous businesses the interbank market is aimed efficiently allocating and facilitating free trade in foreign currency improve and promote confidence in a market based foreign currency market to increase foreign currency inflows into the economy there has been widespread concern that the 1 to 1 allocation of foreign currency for fuel imports which existed prior to introduction of the free float foreign exchange system and interbank market was not sustainable given foreign currency limitations essentially the government has been significantly subsidising fuel procurement into the country especially as this relates to foreign currency at a time the economy does

after argentina s government defaulted on its debt in 2001 the country was left with a lingering distrust of banks and recent months have seen another economic crisis characterized by the peso s falling to a record low against the us dollar to protect their savings against such volatility it s common for argentines to convert their pesos into dollars and guard them at home in theory buying a stable digital currency instead could give argentines a more convenient way to save than hoarding 100 bills under the mattress that s why cryptocurrencies which are supposed to be controlled by decentralized computer networks instead of centralized institutions might take hold the argentine government s openness to blockchain projects has helped shape buenos aires into a hub for developers but convincing everyday consumers to use cryptocurrencies will require user friendly trustworthy systems with clear advantages over the ubiquitous and familiar dollar ripio is developing what it hopes are easy to use tools for buying selling trading investing and spending cryptocurrencies while its name is likely new to many subway commuters the six year old company which was originally called bitpagos is already a blockchain veteran in 2017 bitpagos shifted its focus away from merchants to consumers and rebranded as ripio it now has 300 000 users in argentina brazil and mexico about 85 of them are in argentina today ripio offers users a cryptocurrency exchange and software wallet for storing their digital assets it has also launched a service that uses so called smart contracts or blockchain based computer programs that can be used to automate complicated financial transactions to facilitate peer to peer lending this service which relies on the ethereum blockchain allows argentines to get loans in local currency without having to pay high fees to a bank ripio will soon unveil a new platform to combine these services and a few new ones alongside educational content like articles videos and tutorials the service is meant to help ripio users access the new economy says juan mendez the company s chief brand officer we understand that the economy is changing that banks are digitizing and we want to be there in that moment to offer access financing and investment options he says the company is betting that crypto assets will play a role alongside more traditional financial services and it wants to provide a central place to find all the options but while these front end tweaks may make cryptocurrencies more appealing to the average consumer that will be only part of the battle convincing everyday consumers in argentina to trust a new form of money is much more than a technological problem after all cryptocurrencies are relatively difficult to understand and use most are also susceptible to wild and unpredictable price fluctuations a relatively new breed of digital coin may be addressing the volatility problem however called stablecoins these are designed to maintain the value of stable government backed currencies like the us dollar in november ripio added a stablecoin called dai to its exchange and wallet to go alongside bitcoin and ether developed by a foundation called makerdao dai uses complex mechanisms based on smart contracts on the ethereum blockchain to stay pegged to the dollar a few other exchanges in the region also offer dai the most notable of which is buenbit an easy to use digital version of the dollar might indeed be compelling to argentines instead of going to buy dollars on the street to store at home ripio customers can now head to the nearest convenience store to load pesos into their wallet to buy dai later on they could even spend them online using ripio s service to change them back into pesos and purchase items from the popular e commerce site mercado libre

associated press washington ap federal reserve chairman jerome powell said monday that the central bank is closely monitoring a sharp rise in corporate debt but currently does not see the types of threats that triggered the 2008 financial crisis in remarks to a banking conference in fernandina beach florida powell said views about riskier corporate debt known as leveraged lending range from this is a rerun of the subprime mortgage crisis to nothing to worry about here he said his view lies somewhere in the middle the risks currently are moderate powell said his comments followed a fed report earlier this month that showed riskier corporate debt had grown by 20 in 2018 to 1 1 trillion prompting the attention of regulators investors are attracted to the riskier corporate debt because it pays higher returns than the very low rates they can receive on safer debt much of this debt is grouped together and used to back securities known as collateralized loan obligations powell said that much of this borrowing because it is financed opaquely outside the banking system has prompted concerns it could pose a new threat to financial stability just as similar debt instruments that bundled sub prime mortgages helped to trigger the 2008 crisis however powell said he believes regulators learned the lessons of the 2008 crisis which brought the worst financial crisis in the united states since the 1930s and pushed the country into the deepest recession since the great depression the financial system today appears strong enough to handle potential business sector losses which was manifestly not the case a decade ago with subprime mortgages powell said powell said one key difference between 2008 and now is that the increase in business borrowing is not being fueled by a dramatic asset price bubble like the housing bubble of the past decade improvements in banking regulation such as annual stress tests for the nation s biggest banks have allowed regulators to make sure banks are in a position to withstand even a serious economic downturn he said powell s speech focused on bank regulation issues rather than the fed s interest rate policies after raising its key policy rate four times last year the fed has left the rate unchanged this year and is projecting no rates hikes for all of 2019 however president donald trump seeking to ensure a strong economy going into the 2020 presidential election has been pressuring the fed to start cutting rates while some economists believe the central bank may begin reducing rates later this year other analysts think the more likely outcome is no rate changes for the entire year during a question and answer period following his speech powell was asked about the recent slowdown in inflation which has fallen further below the central bank s 2 target for annual price increases he said that the central bank is grappling with the issue that inflation pressures today are different than 25 years ago he cited a variety of factors such as the rise in internet sales which help hold down prices the fed is keeping close tabs on these inflation dynamics in deciding how to set interest rate policies he said on another issue powell said the central bank is also closely watching the trade dispute between the united states and china and is prepared to alter interest rate policies if necessary but he noted that at the moment the outcome of the u s china trade negotiations is not known

adjusted net income was 11 7 million or 38 9 lower compared to 1q18 financial operational highlights in our sugar ethanol energy business adjusted ebitda reached 31 2 million in 1q19 marking a 16 8 million decrease year over year adjusted ebitda was positively affected by i the full maximization of ethanol production 97 total trs produced was diverted to ethanol an all time record allowing us to profit from higher relative prices hydrous and anhydrous ethanol traded at a 21 7 and 24 4 premium to sugar during 1q19 respectively ii the high level of cogeneration efficiency 73 2 kwh per ton crushed which allowed us to maximize energy sales capturing attractive prices during the quarter prices reached as high as brl mwh 450 in february and iii the dilution of total production costs on a per ton basis thanks to the enhancements in agricultural and industrial efficiencies and the depreciation of the brazilian reais these positive effects were fully offset by lower crushing activities coupled with the 26 3 million difference registered from the mark to market effect of our commodity hedge position however this also resulted in a 14 3 million higher gain from the mark to market of

our biological asset adjusted ebitda for the farming and land transformation businesses reached 31 9 million in 1q19 13 1 million or 69 6 higher year over year the improvement in financial performance is primarily explained by higher margins in our rice and dairy businesses coupled with the completion of the sale of alto alegre farm which contributed 9 4 million to ebitda in the case of the rice business higher margins were explained by i cost dilution following the depreciation of the argentine peso ii higher selling volumes since we not only processed 15 0 million additional tons of rough rice 50 8 increase but also carried stocks from the previous quarter coupled with iii the ongoing enhancement in agricultural and industrial efficiencies regarding our dairy business higher selling volumes and average prices were responsible for the increase in financial performance indeed as a result of the shortage of raw milk due to weather related issues prices increased margins at our

industrial efficiencies at the same time we started developing commercial relationships with raw milk suppliers and potential customers currently we are operating at half of the targeted capacity and already reached break even the shortage of raw milk in argentina resulted in high domestic prices as a result all the milk is diverted to our chivilcoy facility to produce fluid milk for the domestic

markets seem bent on testing the central bank s resolve not to let the yuan fall too fast and breach the 7 per dollar level given some evidence beijing has been selling u s treasury bonds in favor of gold many are wondering if china will use a weaker yuan both as a bargaining chip and a means to offset higher tariffs on its exports story continues but weaponizing the yuan has its downside aside

listen to this article listen to this article federal reserve chairman jerome powell said monday that the central bank is closely monitoring a sharp rise in corporate debt but currently does not see the types of threats that triggered the 2008 financial crisis in remarks to a banking conference in fernandina beach florida powell said views about riskier corporate debt known as leveraged lending range from this is a rerun of the subprime mortgage crisis to nothing to worry about here he said his view lies somewhere in the middle the risks currently are moderate powell said his comments followed a fed report earlier this month that showed riskier corporate debt had grown by 20 in 2018 to 1 1 trillion prompting the attention of regulators investors are attracted to the riskier corporate debt because it pays higher returns than the very low rates they can receive on safer debt much of this debt is grouped together and used to back securities known as collateralized loan obligations powell said that much of this borrowing because it is financed opaquely outside the banking system has prompted concerns it could pose a new threat to financial stability just as similar debt instruments that bundled sub prime mortgages helped to trigger the 2008 crisis however powell said he believes regulators learned the lessons of the 2008 crisis which brought the worst financial crisis in the united states since the 1930s and pushed the country into the deepest recession since the great depression the financial system today appears strong enough to handle potential business sector losses which was manifestly not the case a decade ago with subprime mortgages powell said powell said one key difference between 2008 and now is that the increase in business borrowing is not being fueled by a dramatic asset price bubble like the housing bubble of the past decade improvements in banking regulation such as annual stress tests for the nation s biggest banks have allowed regulators to make sure banks are in a position to withstand even a serious economic downturn he said powell s speech focused on bank regulation issues rather than the fed s interest rate policies after raising its key policy rate four times last year the fed has left the rate unchanged this year and is projecting no rates hikes for all of 2019 however president donald trump seeking to ensure a strong economy going into the 2020 presidential election has been pressuring the fed to start cutting rates while some economists believe the central bank may begin reducing rates later this year other analysts think the more likely outcome is no rate changes for the entire year during a question and answer period following his speech powell was asked about the recent slowdown in inflation which has fallen further below the central bank s 2 target for annual price increases he said that the central bank is grappling with the issue that inflation pressures today are different than 25 years ago he cited a variety of factors such as the rise in internet sales which help hold down prices the fed is keeping close tabs on these inflation dynamics in deciding how to set interest rate policies he said on another issue powell said the central bank is also closely watching the trade dispute between the united states and china and is prepared to alter interest rate policies if necessary but he noted that at the moment the outcome of the u s china trade negotiations is not known to sign up for free citybusiness daily updates click here

the turkish government has introduced a set of measures to boost economic activity in the country which includes calls on banks to wait at least one day before paying of large scale foreign currency purchases additionally turkish financial enterprises were asked to buy governmental bonds which could provide additional resources for the authorities to enhance fiscal stimulus measures however the authorities attempts to balance the risks of either a deeper recession or steeper lira devaluation have sent confusing signals to the market some economists fear ankara might not be able to effectively manage the double pronged challenge at the time when turkey needs to restore confidence in the lira among households corporates and foreign investors contradicting measures have been announced piotr matys of rabobank in london said such conflicting measures make turkey increasingly unpredictable to foreign investors who will remain reluctant to deploy their capital despite an attractive valuation of turkish assets meanwhile gdp growth figures for the first quarter due to be released in late may are expected to show turkey re emerge from the recession a weaker lira has improved international competitiveness of turkish exports while elevated levels of budget spending over the past few months have supported consumer confidence and household spending despite the rising costs of imports read more ankara mulling over swap deal with russia embraces mir cards turkish minister however fiscal stimulus measures are expected to wrap up later this year while commercial banks are likely to return to their usual business practices after the central bank removes its emergency guidelines in this light the lira s devaluation could continue with its effects on the gdp growth rate in the near to medium term being unclear any further lira weakness will likely have a contractionary impact on activity through reduced corporate profits and the negative impact of a weaker lira on business and consumer sentiment said ugras ulku of the institute of international finance in washington dc
in some way or another you will need to exchange your currency at one point in your life when you start traveling your credit card might not be accepted in all establishments that said it s important that you know how to exchange your money as it is a necessity these days especially if you visit other countries to get the best deal and ensure your safety and security here is a simple guide on money exchange by answering these questions and keeping in mind some tips what and how are currency exchange rates determined currencies similar to other financial products and the stock market are part of a global marketplace called foreign exchange or forex which runs for 24 hours the value of one currency compared to the next fluctuates every second to make a profit and earn from money exchange establishments banks and currency vendors sell it at a rate inclusive of a foreign exchange margin and service fees why does the value of money change exchange rates are simply numbers to know the value of a particular currency however for example the amount of one euro to one pound always and constantly changes every single day drivers that cause these changes in value depends on a few factors that affect the value of a specific currency stability of the country s government stability of the country s economy country s interest rate inflows and outflows of the country s currency country s debt both public and government trade terms with other countries market sentiment political issues within a country state of the country good or bad governance of the country country s inflation rates political sphere elections fiscal and monetary policies natural disasters and calamities what are some basic terms in the exchange market when working with money exchanges there are some technical terms that you should familiarize yourself with here is a simple guide on terms and their meanings sell rate the sell rate refers to the rate at which you can sell your foreign currency in exchange for the local one for example if you go to paris you will exchange your local currency for euros at the sell rate buy rate on the other hand the buy rate is the rate wherein the foreign currency carried by travelers is bought in exchange for the local currency for example if you return to england from the united states you will exchange your pound back to dollars at the buy rate spot rate the spot rate is more known as the interbank rate this is the rate that banks charge another financial institution when trading large amounts of foreign currency businesses usually use the term spot rate when dealing with banks this is not a tourist rate so you cannot buy a foreign currency at this rate similarly the rates usually shown in newspapers or broadcast media are the interbank rates these are not the rates that you use for money exchange as an individual spread the spread is the difference between the sell and buy rates and the spot rate this is where the money changer or bank tucks in their foreign exchange margins commission the commission is what we call the fees that foreign exchange providers charge as service fees to convert one currency to another why do these rates matter changing rates matters because by looking at the exchange rates of each currency you can evaluate whether one currency is stronger or weaker than the other for example you have the currency pair gbp usd for this example gbp will be the base currency while usd will be the quote currency if gbp usd is at 1 5 then 1 gbp will buy you 1 5 usd if it changed to 1 6 the pound would be stronger since it can now buy 1 6 usd instead of just 1 5 usd a stronger currency is good news and will also attract more investors to put their money in their country stronger currencies reflect good governance economic stability and power globally if you want to find out additional information you can learn more by researching this online why do people buy a foreign currency a group of people trade foreign currency in the forex which we call traders they do this because they think they can profit as the rates fluctuate this is very risky especially if you don t know the market in the foreign exchange market prices move by the second and you need to be able to make sales before you lose that window another reason why people buy foreign currency is to travel whenever you travel you need to use the currency of the country you are in for this reason you must exchange your country s currency for the currency you are traveling to you can do this by going to the bank or money changers people who want money immediately or for emergency reasons can make payments via credit card or withdraw from a foreign atm however doing this will cause you more fees which will be discussed later people also buy foreign currencies when their local currencies are becoming weaker what people do is they exchange their local currencies with the stronger ones this way the value of your money is secured where to exchange your money do not ever exchange currency at the airport the convenience of exchanging your money at the airport can be very tempting however you must pay a high price for that convenience which isn t worth it airports know this convenience and charge higher margins for it instead you can exchange it at different channels which will be discussed later credit card transactions and atm withdrawals overseas come at a fee foreign transaction fees depend on the bank whenever you withdraw foreign currency from an atm a better alternative would be exchanging currency at money changer kiosks if you will be getting cash via atm make sure you get a large amount per withdrawal so the fees will be worth it on the other hand using your credit card when traveling may be very convenient which is what most people do to avoid carrying large sums of money however your credit card will also charge you a foreign transaction fee for every purchase to get a good deal comparing credit card transaction fees is important some cards also come with travel related benefits such as discounts on hotels or flights and travel insurance be sure you do your research try to exchange money in pawnshops and money changers money changers in kiosks sometimes found in malls or pawnshops are the best places to exchange currency because there is strong competition with money changers banks and airports these places usually have low margins and fees choose renowned kiosks in the country and famous pawnshops as well this is where your research comes in again tips on money exchange ask your bank to raise your withdrawal limit to avoid carrying a bulk of money for instance being in paris or rome for a week will eliminate your daily withdrawal limit in this situation you won t be allowed to withdraw more money for touring the city and eating meals there you might be in trouble during your vacation if you can t get enough cash so ask your bank to increase your daily withdrawal limits make it a habit to inform your bank whenever you travel overseas this will not only help with the daily withdrawal limit of your atm but it will also make using your credit card very convenient some banks flag your card when used overseas to prevent fraud by telling banks in advance you can prevent this inconvenience from happening compare exchange rates online before you fly you must do your research first on the exchange rates so that you don t get fooled this will give you an idea of how much the exchange rate should be without the exchange margin and additional service fees knowledge is key knowing the exchange rates before you fly will make you wiser when scouting where to have your money changed never use the cash advance feature on your credit cards unless necessary through the use of a foreign atm most credit cards have a feature that allows you to get cash in advance until your credit limit however not only will you be charged a foreign exchange fee but you will also be charged a very high interest rate the moment you avail of this service the cash advance fee in itself is already very high coupled with the atm and foreign exchange fees this will cost you very much beware of this option or feature that your credit card company offers you ask for both small and large denominations when exchanging money you must always ask for smaller bills since there will be times when you will only be charged a small amount this happens when you ride taxis eat in local eateries have street food and purchase from small businesses so preparing for those situations is important by asking for lower bills in other countries such as the philippines or india taxi drivers are notorious for not giving change when you pay them with a large bill they will give you the excuse that they don t have enough change only transact with legitimate money changers walking down the street in another country your face already gives it away that you are from a different country because of this some locals might try to trick you be careful if some local walks up to you in the street and offers you a much lower rate for exchanging your dollars for the local currency chances are that the person is from a black market money changer or some shady organization you can get ripped off easily by these kinds of money changers so as tempting as it can be do not offer cash just to anyone despite the great rates only transact with authorized money changers to be safe get a credit card with no foreign transaction fees even though credit cards charge high they are indispensable tools when traveling to another country you will need your credit card to make some large purchases so the ultimate weapon for this is to get a credit card with no foreign transaction fees yes these credit card types exist and you have to look for them some travel specific credit cards are tailored for people who frequently go from one place to another benefits and features such as higher point to miles conversions travel insurance and travel promotions are also tailored to travel included in these features is the option of no foreign fees apply for a couple of these cards if you are the type of person who travels a lot conclusion money exchanges can be relatively simple to understand whether this is for investments or traveling all you have to do is be

it is a pleasure to be here at this important annual event sponsored and organized by the federal reserve bank of atlanta s center for financial innovation and stability the risks in our financial system are constantly evolving fifteen years ago everyone was talking about whether households were borrowing too much today everyone is talking about whether businesses are borrowing too much this evening i will focus on the implications of the increase in business debt over the past decade and review the steps the federal reserve and other agencies are taking to understand and limit the associated risks in public discussion of this issue views seem to range from this is a rerun of the subprime mortgage crisis to nothing to worry about here at the moment the truth is likely somewhere in the middle to preview my conclusions as of now business debt does not present the kind of elevated risks to the stability of the financial system that would lead to broad harm to households and businesses should conditions deteriorate at the same time the level of debt certainly could stress borrowers if the economy weakens the federal reserve continues to assess the potential amplification of such stresses on borrowers to the broader economy through possible vulnerabilities in the financial system and i currently see such risks as moderate discussion many commentators have observed with a sense of déjà vu the buildup of risky business debt over the past few years the acronyms have changed a bit clos collateralized loan obligations instead of cdos collateralized debt obligations for example but once again we see a category of debt that is growing faster than the income of the borrowers even as lenders loosen underwriting standards likewise much of the borrowing is financed opaquely outside the banking system many are asking whether these developments pose a new threat to financial stability at the federal reserve we take this possibility seriously the fed and other regulators are using our supervisory tools and closely monitoring risks from the buildup of risky business debt business debt has clearly reached a level that should give businesses and investors reason to pause and reflect if financial and economic conditions were to deteriorate overly indebted firms could well face severe strains however the parallels to the mortgage boom that led to the global financial crisis are not fully convincing most importantly the financial system today appears strong enough to handle potential business sector losses which was manifestly not the case a decade ago with subprime mortgages and there are other differences increases in business borrowing are not outsized for such a long expansion in contrast to the mortgage boom business credit is not fueled by a dramatic asset price bubble as mortgage debt was and clo structures are much sounder than the structures that were in use during the mortgage credit bubble could the increase in business debt pose greater risks to the financial system than currently appreciated my colleagues and i continually ask ourselves that question we are also taking multiple steps to better understand and address the potential risks in conjunction with other u s regulatory agencies both domestically through the financial stability oversight council fsoc and internationally through the financial stability board fsb we are monitoring developments assessing unknowns and working to develop a clearer picture we are also using our supervisory tools to hold the banks we supervise to strong risk management standards and we are using our stress tests to ensure banks resilience even in severely adverse business conditions the rise of business leverage let s start with the basic facts many measures confirm that the business sector has significantly increased its borrowing as the economy has expanded over the past decade business debt relative to the size of the economy is at historic highs corporate debt relative to the book value of assets is at the upper end of its range over the past few decades figure 1 and investment grade corporate debt has shifted closer to the edge of speculative grade at the moment the business sector is quite healthy overall business income is strong reflecting healthy profit margins and because interest rates are quite low by historical standards the costs of servicing today s higher levels of debt remain low relative to business income figure 2 despite crosscurrents the economy is showing continued growth strong job creation and rising wages all in a context of muted inflation pressures but if a downturn were to arrive unexpectedly some firms would face challenges not only is the volume of debt high but recent growth has also been concentrated in the riskier forms of debt among investment grade bonds a near record fraction is at the lowest rating a phenomenon known as the triple b cliff in a downturn some of these borrowers could be downgraded into high yield territory which would require some investors to sell their holdings thereby confronting traditional high yield investors with a sudden influx of bonds there have also been sizable shifts within the non investment grade or riskier debt universe higher risk businesses have traditionally funded themselves with a mix of high yield bonds and leveraged loans over time the balance between the two has swung back and forth because of investor demand the interest rate environment and other factors in the past few years leveraged loans have grown far more quickly figure 3 in fact while net new issuance of high yield bonds in 2018 was close to nil leveraged loans outstanding rose 20 percent and now stand at more than 1 trillion so far this year issuance of high yield bonds and leveraged loans has been more balanced in addition underwriting standards have weakened with leveraged loans covenants intended to protect lenders may be an endangered species more loans now feature high debt to earnings ratios and the use of optimistic projections including earnings add backs is becoming more common the rise in riskier business borrowing has been funded principally by nonbank lenders collateralized loan obligations are now the largest lenders with about 62 percent of outstanding leveraged loans figure 4 these lenders are actively managed securitization vehicles that mostly buy higher risk assets like leveraged loans clos in turn are funded by a slice of equity and layers of debt of varying seniority after clos mutual funds are the next largest vehicle for holding leveraged loans with about 20 percent of the market these funds allow investors to redeem their shares daily although the underlying loans take longer to sell as a result investors may react to financial stress by trying to redeem their shares before the funds have sold their most liquid assets widespread redemptions by investors in turn could lead to widespread price pressures which could affect all holders of loans including clos and those that hold clos risks to financial stability using the framework deployed since the crisis as you can see there are similarities to the subprime mortgage crisis as with the mortgage boom the business debt story begins with rapid growth of debt to new highs and a surge in lending to risky borrowers made possible by aggressive underwriting using securitization vehicles but there are also important differences one difference is that financial authorities now closely monitor financial stability vulnerabilities on an ongoing basis armed with lessons learned from the crisis the board of governors meets at least four times a year to assess threats to the financial system and is constantly monitoring developments we use a checklist of potential financial vulnerabilities that we have described elsewhere most recently in the financial stability report we published earlier this month 1 this approach gives us a way to organize and weigh the mass of facts anecdotes and speculation we confront as we monitor financial stability in assessing financial stability risks we constantly consult our four point checklist borrowing by businesses and households valuation pressures leverage in the financial system and funding risk if households or businesses have borrowed too much they will be forced to cut back spending and investing or even default if their incomes fall or the value of the collateral backing their loans declines valuation pressures give us a sense of overall risk appetite and should investors lose that appetite how far prices could fall if lenders face defaulting borrowers and have too little loss absorbing capacity they risk insolvency at best they will cut back on lending to other borrowers dragging the economy down at worst they will fail which can lead to severe economic damage to households and businesses finally when the financial system funds long maturity assets with short maturity liabilities we risk a classic fast burn crisis a bank run or its equivalent involving investors and institutions outside traditional banking 2 in our framework the story of the mid 2000s goes something like this amid a self reinforcing cycle of house price gains and mortgage credit expansion households borrowed and lenders lent far too much and property prices rose far too high financial institutions of all shapes and sizes also borrowed too much and the financial sector was highly susceptible to a run because it funded risky long maturity mortgages with extended chains of fragile and opaque financing structures that ultimately rested on short maturity liabilities let s compare this story with the current situation using our four point checklist beginning with borrowing by businesses and households business debt has grown faster than gross domestic product gdp for several years and today is high but the growth in the ratio of business debt to gdp in the past decade is much less than the growth in household debt to gdp that we saw in the run up to the global financial crisis back then household debt grew from 60 percent of gdp to 90 percent or by half figure 5 at its recent low business debt was 65 percent of gdp now even after rapid growth it is still below 75 percent of gdp overall the increase in business debt relative to the size of the economy is one third the increase in household debt seen in the previous decade business debt rises in expansions it is a steady upward plod in borrowing over the long expansion not a rapid expansion that has now brought business debt to gdp back to historic highs seen this way the current situation looks typical of business cycles the mortgage credit boom was because of its magnitude and speed far outside historical norms 3 as for household debt we see that household debt to income ratios have steadily declined post crisis moreover a high and rising fraction of this debt is rated prime all told household debt burdens appear much more manageable our second factor valuation pressures also points to moderate risks to financial stability valuations are high across several financial markets equity prices have recently reached new highs and corporate bond and loan spreads are narrow both commercial and residential property prices have moved above their long run relationship with rents although price gains slowed substantially last year all of these developments point to strong risk appetite as might be expected given the strong economy but there does not appear to be a feedback loop between borrowing and asset prices as was the case in the run up to the financial crisis while borrowing by businesses has been strong it is not fueling excessive prices or investment in a critical sector such as housing whose collapse would undermine collateral values and lead to outsized losses instead the increase in business borrowing has been broad based across sectors including technology oil and gas production and manufacturing regarding the third factor leverage in the financial system today banks at the core of the financial system are fundamentally stronger and more resilient our post crisis regulatory framework is based on robust capital requirements backed by strong stress tests resulting in much higher levels of capital in the banking system figure 6 these stress tests are a way to estimate the direct and indirect effects of extremely bad macroeconomic and financial developments on our banking system we publish the scenarios that describe the macro and financial developments every year by mid february and release the test results in june in the pre crisis environment supervisors focused more on the most likely outcomes not on these tail risks since we began routine stress testing in 2011 the scenarios we use have featured severe global recessions characterized by major stress in the corporate sector where large numbers of firms default on their loans and bonds as actual economic conditions have improved the scenarios have gotten tougher the most recent stress tests indicate that even after the losses from the scenario capital levels at the largest banks would remain above the levels those banks had before the crisis loss absorbing capacity elsewhere in the financial system is also much improved leverage at broker dealers is far below levels before the crisis and remains low relative to the norms of the past several decades insurers also appear well capitalized as for our fourth factor funding risk the susceptibility of the financial system to runs also appears low in part because of the post crisis regulatory regime large banks hold substantial amounts of highly liquid assets and rely relatively little on short term wholesale funding figure 7 money market funds hold much safer assets and clos which have facilitated the growth of leveraged loans have stable funding investors commit funds for lengthy periods so they cannot through withdrawals force clos to sell assets at distressed prices addressing the risks monitoring and acting overall vulnerabilities to financial stability from business debt and other factors do not appear elevated we take the risks from business debt seriously but think that the financial system appears strong enough to handle potential losses we also know that our dynamic financial system does not stand still we can always learn more about financial markets and we will always act to address emerging risks together with our domestic and international counterparts we are monitoring developments in business debt markets working to develop and share data on how these markets operate studying ways to further strengthen the system and working to ensure that banks are properly managing the business debt risks they have taken on through the fsoc the banking and market regulators coordinate our monitoring of financial conditions in recent meetings the fsoc has discussed leveraged lending in depth we recognize that each regulator directly sees only a part of the larger picture and we are working to stitch these parts together so we can collectively see that larger picture and the risks it holds for example the securities and exchange commission is examining the potential for liquidity strains at mutual funds and the commodity futures trading commission is working to understand the use of derivatives to hedge risks associated with leveraged loans what else are we watching for business debt growth has moderated somewhat since early 2018 but this might be just a pause another sharp increase in debt unless supported by strong fundamentals could increase vulnerabilities appreciably businesses investors and lenders need to focus on these vulnerabilities as will the federal reserve in addition regulators investors and market participants around the world would benefit greatly from more information on who is bearing the ultimate risk associated with clos we know that the u s clo market spans the globe involving foreign banks and asset managers but right now we mainly know where the clos are not only 90 billion of the roughly 700 billion in total clos are held by the largest u s banks that is certainly good news for domestic banks but in a downturn institutions anywhere could find themselves under pressure especially those with inadequate loss absorbing capacity or runnable short term financing the federal reserve is participating in international efforts under the auspices of the fsb to improve our knowledge of these key issues through the fsb we are focused on determining the size of the global leveraged loan market and the holders of the loans as an important step toward a better understanding of the underlying risks beyond monitoring markets and collecting new data several supervisory efforts are also under way to complement the quantitative analysis in our stress tests our supervisors have been qualitatively assessing how well banks are managing the risks associated with leveraged lending through the shared national credit program which evaluates large syndicated loans our supervisors are continuing to work with their counterparts at the office of the comptroller of the currency and the federal deposit insurance corporation to ensure that banks are properly managing the risks of losses they face from participating in the leveraged lending market conclusion let me wrap up with three thoughts first business debt is near record levels and recent issuance has been concentrated in the riskiest segments as a result some businesses may come under severe financial strain if the economy deteriorates a highly leveraged business sector could amplify any economic downturn as companies are forced to lay off workers and cut back on investments investors financial institutions and regulators need to focus on this risk today while times are good second today business debt does not appear to present notable risks to financial stability the debt to gdp ratio has moved up at a steady pace in line with previous expansions and neither fueled by nor fueling an asset bubble moreover banks and other financial institutions have sizable loss absorbing buffers the growth in business debt does not rely on short term funding and overall funding risk in the financial system is moderate third we cannot be satisfied with our current level of knowledge about these markets particularly the vulnerability of financial institutions to potential losses and the possible strains on market liquidity and prices should investors exit investment vehicles holding leveraged loans we are committed to better understanding the areas where our information is incomplete this commitment includes coordination with other domestic and international agencies to understand who is participating in business lending and how their behavior could potentially amplify stress events references adrian tobias daniel covitz and nellie liang 2015 financial stability monitoring annual

the turn for the worse that has transpired with the unforeseen breakdown in us china trade relations over the past two weeks has accelerated a flurry of selling momentum in the offshore yuan the question that continues to linger in financial market headlines following the brutalperiod of late for the chinese currency stands as a matter of when and not if the offshore yuan will weaken beyond 7 against the greenback the usdcnh stands at time of writing marginally close to levels that have previously acted as the last line of defence for the offshore yuan but what if authorities had a trick up their sleeves in the ongoing tit for tat tariffs and allowed the yuan to freely weaken this is a scenario that might still appear as unlikely and one that has not been priced in but it is something that shouldn t be ruled out following the escalation and it is a scenario that would lead to a round of shock for global investors think about it from the perspective of the chinese economy you thought like the majority that a trade deal should by all accounts be concluded by end of the quarter but you now face headwinds from additional tariffs that were not expected just two weeks ago these tariffs are serious headwinds to the chinese economy and a threat that realistically puts a question mark on whether the 6 6 5 government target for economic growth in 2019 should be reassessed china will not be able to match the tariffs that the united states has put on its goods blow for blow and this is something that we have all been aware of since the trade tensions erupted over a year back but china could offset the upcoming economic pressures that the mainland economy will face in light of additional tariffs by allowing the yuan to weaken further the likelihood of the trade tensions extending into the second half of the final year for the decade also highlights the potential that we should be preparing ourselves for an attempt by the dollar index to make another run for 100 the steady climb in the dollar index over the past week or so hasn t been documented that much but i do think investors are hedging on the greenback in anticipation of the trade conflict between the united states and china potentially extending into 2020 100 in the dollar index would be a painful migraine for all currencies in the developing world one which would make the second half of 2019 a troublesome end to the decade for emerging market currencies an advance towards 100 in the dollar index would stand as the final nail in the coffin for even the most doubtful of spectators that the offshore yuan would not be allowed to weaken beyond 7 it would also marginalise buying demand for emerging markets at a time where they have not yet adapted to the incoming external headwinds with restricted buying demand for emerging markets causing pain for currencies stretching from the malaysian ringgit to the south african rand and even as far as the brazilian real upcoming european elections to signal another push for right wing in europe swing lower in euro ahead the euro has opened yet another week with low volatility as traders brace themselves for the upcoming european parliamentary elections things have been quiet for euro volatility in the fx space for a very long time and one must wonder whether the upcoming elections could be what the doctor ordered to inject some life back into a eurodollar that has been asleep for most of the past year i am going to take the contrarian view and look at the upcoming european elections as the warning lights that risk the euro falling to 1 10 for the first time since may 2017 the recent history of european politics suggests that the elections will signal more power moving towards far right political parties and this isn t something that investors will be able to ignore forever if the european elections do threaten the stability of the european union a great deal of concerning views on the outlook of the euro can even lead to the discussion over eurodollar parity making their way again

call i will begin my presentation today with an overview of the highlights of the quarter and then raãºl will take you through our financial results afterwards i will provide an update on our key business segments and our view for the remainder of the year we will then open the call to your questions starting with slide number 3 weâ re navigating a challenging market environment particularly in argentina our largest market and to a lesser extent in brazil in argentina we saw travel dynamics impacted by the sharp currency depreciation which resulted in a negative mix shift towards the massive traffic lower commercial demand and the impact of the fx translation on local currency revenues brazil italy and hawaii were also impacted by currency depreciation in this context we were still able to report an increase in passenger traffic up 4 year on year as we continue to add new routes in airlines with over 20 million passengers traveling across our airports total domestic passengers increased 9 while international and transit passengers declined low single digits year on year excluding inflation accounting and two one time items that raul will discuss shortly comparable adjusted ebitda declined 8 year on year with the margin ex ifric flat at 39 despite the difficult backdrop net margin this quarter in argentina and italy offset quicker performance in our markets with the aim of further strengthening the company s position to capture future growth and add to the passenger travel experience we invested 64 million this quarter spending was mainly focused while enhancing our airport infrastructure in argentina importantly last month we received the approval from the italian ministry of transportation for the master development plan through 2029 for the expansion of florence airport with this step finalized we are on track to commence work in the fourth quarter of 2019 finally keeping with our goal of extending the life of our concessions in april we extend the concession agreement of the punta del este in uruguay for a 14 year period through 2023 turning to slide 4 traffic growth of 4 for the quarter was mainly driven by a pickup in argentina and softer growth in the brazil and armenia which more than offset declines of southern peru and uruguay traffic was negatively impact by difficult macro conditions and sharp fx volatility as already mentioned we also faced tougher comps this quarter as first quarter 2018 benefited from easter holidays which this year took place in april passenger traffic in argentina was up close to 7 year over year compared with 4 in the previous quarter this slide pick up came along with continued mix shift from international to more affordable domestic travel in brazil passenger traffic continued to decelerate and was flat year over year impacted by reduction in less profitable routes by latin america international airline and capacity adjustments at the brazilian carrier with partially offset the benefit from new routes and frequencies total traffic in italy decelerated to nearly 2 year over year from 5 in the fourth quarter impacted by tariff calculations at florence airport due to bad weather conditions partially offset by new routes and airlines in uruguay traffic declined 6 year on year affected by softer travel demand from argentina and cancellation of route to colombia and the impact of currency depreciation and local demand traffic was also weak in peru declining almost 6 as a result of the suspension of operations of a low cost airline last year finally traffic in armenia was up 10 year on year supported by new frequencies to destinations in russia introduced last year while ecuador continue to post a strong performance with traffic up over 7 supported by new international routes and frequencies i will now hand off the call to raul francos who will review operations and financial results please raul go ahead raul francos thank you martin good day everyone as gimena noted at the beginning of our presentation for a better understanding of our performance we will discussion our result excluding the impact of hyperinflation in argentina starting with revenues on slide 5 total revenue growth reflected tough comparison against last year the first quarter of 2018 included the one time recognition of the cpi inflationary effect on airport fees in italy for an amount of 4 9 million which was recovered in other revenues on a companywide basis excluding these one time item and also construction revenues total revenue fell 8 year on year aeronautical revenue declined 6 mainly reflecting the mix shift from international to domestic traffic in argentina and the fx translation impact on the domestic revenues from the strong currency depreciation in italy and in brazil despite traffic growth aeronautical revenue declined impacted by currency depreciation on both the brazilian real and the euro against the u s dollar ecuador posted another quarter of revenue growth and in euro wide the introduction of the new security target more than offset the decline in traffic commercial revenue declined close to 14 year on year mainly affected by lower demand in argentina and the fx translation impact in argentina and brazil in local currency commercial revenues in brazil increased 14 mainly due to higher vip lounge and advertising revenues in italy fuelled by the expansion of a car rental area and remodelling of some commercial areas of our airport coupled with traffic growth commercial revenue increased over 3 despite the depreciation of the euro armenia continued to post positive result on the back of higher fuel demand and prices moving to our cost structure on slide 6 the decline in revenues in our largest market coupled with tough top line comps in italy resulted in lower cost dilution this quarter however given the most of our costs are denominated in local currency the fx depreciation in key markets helped mitigate this impact as a result cost of services ex ifric12 declined almost 7 year over year mainly due to lower maintenance cost in argentina which benefited from currency depreciation as well as lower concession fee and labor cost in our main markets sg a fell almost 11 year over year mainly driven by lower sale taxes and labor costs in argentina this was partially offset by higher bad debt charges in brazil related to brazilian carrier and in argentina arising from commercial tenants also sg a in the first quarter of 2018 included a one time charge of almost 1 million in ipo expenses now please start to profitability on slide 7 adjusted ebitda ex ifric declined nearly 11 to 122 million in the quarter excluding both the nearly 1 million one time ipo we spent and 5 million non recurring revenue recognition in first quarter of 2018 comparable ebitda was 8 lower year over year while the margin remains flat up 39 profit improved in argentina and italy this quarter was more than offset by the weaker performance in the brazil uruguay and ecuador as you can see on the slide 8 our healthy balance sheet provides us with financial flexibility to move ahead on our strategic initiatives net debt at the close of the quarter was relatively flat sequentially at 882 million with net debt to last 12 months adjusted ebitda relatively flat year over year at of two times we re also keep a sound debt profile with around 12 of our debt maturing with the year and 8 of our debt denominated in u s dollar 26 in real and 15 in euros let me now turn the call back to martin who will go over performance of our key business segment and we comment on our outlook martã n eurnekian thank you raul starting with argentina on slide 9 revenues ex ifric were down 14 year over year impacted by difficult market environment which had the following effect on our top line performance first we continue to experience a mix shift when the national to more affordable domestic travel international traffic was down 6 while domestic travel was up 16 year on year supported by the addition of new routes and frequencies by low cost carriers second commercial revenues mainly duty free also declined following the lower international traffic trend and third revenues were also negatively impacted by the decline in cargo volume with higher ex productivity and a sharp reduction in higher margin inputs finally domestic travel and local currency commercial revenues were also impacted by the fx translation effect from the 98 quarterly average year on year peso depreciation in this context adjusted segment ebitda declined 10 by contract ex ifric12 margin expanded nearly 200 basis points year on year to 48 while this is an improvement from the margin contraction experience in the fourth quarter note that we anticipate low cost dilution as the year progresses as cost inflation catches up with currency depreciation making headway in our investment program capital expenditures were 59 million in argentina this quarter investments were mainly centered in the construction of the new departures terminal building and multilevel parking at the ezeiza airport which is on track to begin operations in the third quarter of this year funds were also allocated to the expansion of aeroparque airport and new terminal buildings at regional airports including comodoro rivadavia jujuy and iguazu now moving to italy on slide 10 as i mentioned earlier we saw a year on year slowdown in traffic reflecting several cancellations at florence airport due to bad weather conditions we expect this operational restrictions will be mitigated when the construction of the new runway is completed note however that international traffic was up 3 more than offsetting the 2 decline in domestic travel higher international traffics supported the good performance observed in retail duty free and car rental areas inaugurated in 2018 at florence airport new larger and more profitable duty free stores opened at pisa airport last february and also contributed to solid commercial revenue growth this was partially offset by the 8 quarterly average year on year euro depreciation excluding the one time revenue recognition in the first quarter of 2018 that raul explained there total comparable revenues ex ifric12 were flat year on year impacted by the euro depreciation our italian operations delivered solid underlying profitability supported by higher cost dilution with comparable adjusted ebitda up 25 year on year and the margin ex ifric12 expanding close to 130 basis points to slightly over 6 from 5 in the year ago quarter we invested 3 million in italy this quarter mainly on the master development plan at florence airport with the recent approval of this plan we are now ready to start expansion of this airport in the fourth quarter of this year weâ re also moving along we have plans to expand the terminal building at pisa airport aiming to accommodate anticipated passenger growth and expect work to commence on the fourth quarter of this year now please turn to slide 11 for discussion about brazil traffic continued to decelerate in the brazil ending the quarter flat year on year at 5 million passengers growth from the addition of new domestic and international route was offset by a reduction in the less profitable routes at a leading latin american airline and capacity adjustment at the brazilian airline local currency revenues increased almost 8 year on year commercial revenues were up in the mid teens reflecting our new commercial agreements and higher cargo volume while aeronautical revenues grew in the low single digit this good local currency performance however was offset by the 16 fx depreciation of the brazilian real in the period translating into a decline of 7 in as reported revenues in terms of profitability while cost of services declined reflecting lower concession fee as raul just discussed adjusted ebitda was impacted by weaker revenues and the 1 3 million bad debt charge related to our brazilian carrier this resulted in a 28 year on year decline in adjusted segment ebitda to 3 million and the margin contraction of close to 290 basis points to 10 in the quarter we believe in the long term potential of the country and specifically our two airports having said that in the near term our brazilian operation is impacted by a challenging market environment including fx volatility and recent reductions in gdp growth expectations in addition we will also have to weather the annual payment of the concession fee on the positive side the brasilia airport our main airport in brazil is one of the largest hub in the country and the third biggest airport in brazil now please turn to slide 12 to review our uruguayan operations impacted by week travel demand from argentina and the cancellations of some routes passenger traffic in uruguay declined 6 year over year despite this revenues were flat year over year higher aeronautical revenues driven by a new security fee offset the decrease in traffic and commercial revenues specifically softer demand from argentine passengers resulted in the decline in duty free and car rental revenues which together with the 9 currency depreciation contributed to lower commercial revenues adjusted ebitda in turn was nearly 3 lower to 19 million with margin ex ifric12 contracting 63 basis points to 55 in the quarter now please turn to slide 13 looking ahead as the year progresses our business is expected to track generally in line with overall macro trends argentina our key market is facing more difficult macro environment with gdp growth expectations for the year recently lowered this together with the added volatility from this being a presidential election year suggest a more subdued economic recovery towards year end waiting on the passenger traffic trends and revenue growth domestic travel is anticipated to continue improving throughout the year driven by higher competition amongst airlines and growth in the low cost carriers at the same time inbound international traffic is expected to gradually increase as travelling to argentina becomes more affordable during the week peso but not fully offsetting the decline in outbound traffic by locals in sun we expect to see a single digit increase in total passenger traffic growth in argentina for the year in the field capacity adjustment taking place at the couple of carriers together with the recent reductions in gdp growth for the year are anticipated to weigh on the overall traffic trends and results at the same time traffic in uruguay should adopt the economic performance in argentina while in italy we continue to monitor developments at a national carrier in conclusion while in the near term we faced several headwinds across key markets we maintain a solid balance sheet that supports our strategy for advancing on key capital investment project that better our position for the long term growth and important component of this is our focus on enhancing the passenger travel experience across our portfolio of efforts youâ ve heard us discussed earlier in the quarter that we are improving our airport infrastructure specifically in argentina and italy with programs already underway we have been navigating through a volatile period but believe we are in well position to assume growth as the microenvironment improves this is the end of our prepared remarks we are now ready to take questions operator please open the line for questions question and answer session operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session and our first question today comes from steven trent with citi please go ahead steven trent good morning guys and thanks for taking my questions i just have two quick ones at this point you mentioned the brasilia asset the 28 year on year dollar decline in ebitda i imagine that some of that is coming from the currency movements could you give us any color how much of that decline was driven by that the bad debt charges gimena albanesi hi steve thank you for the question so the bad debt in this quarter was around 1 3 million remember that the fx had a movement so we are using an average of 3 8 in the quarter roughly and that is that was the cash that we had this quarter specifically steven trent great thanks gimena and is there any potential recourse in terms of you guys eventually collecting that money gimena albanesi well we have to see how this situation with these carriers and more forward there is a chance that we re able to collect but so far and according to an accounting rule we have to record this bad debt and let me remind you last quarter we also recorded a bad debt for the same situation steven trent okay very helpful and just one last quick question when i think about aa2000 implied return versus the guaranteed return it seems that in terms of potential levers to get you guys to the returns you could a increase tariffs b reduced capex or c extend aa2000 it is fair to say that the third option would be the path of least resistance from a political perspective and considering the strong domestic traffic growth martã n eurnekian thank you for all questions as we need to reply i would say yes definitely yes the extension would be the easiest one politically but we have to monitor the development of our cash flows and the concession throughout the remainder of the year of the life of it to be able to have a clear idea on where we re going but the answer is yes operator and this will conclude our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to martã n eurnekian for any closing remarks martã n eurnekian i d like to thank everybody for joining us today we really appreciate your interest in our company we look forward to meeting more of you over the coming months and providing financial business updates in the next quarter in the meantime the team remains available to answer any questions that you may have thanks you very much operator the conference is now concluded thank you for attending todayâ s presentation you may now disconnect your lines at this time and have a nice day
