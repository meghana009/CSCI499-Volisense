foreign exchange trading or forex trade is a lucrative business that involves the exchange of currency between millions of people businesses and entities transactions can be as simple as exchanging a few dollars for local currency during travels likewise forex can be as complex as investing in large businesses or depositing money in foreign bank accounts the birth of forex trading currencies used to be pegged to gold in the 20th century countries used to peg their currency to the gold standard this meant that a country s currency was directly tied to the value of gold the system was popular because it meant that with gold backed currency there were fewer chances that incompetent individuals could mess up currency exchange rates however the united kingdom stopped using the gold standard in 1931 and the us did the same two years later governments developed what is called the fiat system instead of issuing paper money that is backed by a tangible entity such as gold money is now backed by the government these changes influenced how international markets interacted with each other globalization travel and the internet made it easier for people to invest in other countries though all currencies serve their purpose there are ten currencies that are more popular than others they are used for different reasons and a basic understanding of these currencies can help you better comprehend other types of currency as well new zealand dollar the new zealand dollar is commonly traded with the australian dollar the new zealand dollar nzd is the official currency of new zealand the pitcairn cook tokelau and niue islands and it is most often exchanged for australian dollars or us dollars the nzd was first pegged to the british pound and then it was pegged to the us dollar until 1985 when the currency stood on its own because of its relationship to the united states the nzd is vulnerable to changes in interest rates set by the us federal reserve in addition the cost of milk and the number of tourists usually causes the nzd s value to increase hong kong dollar the hong kong dollar was pegged to the usd in 1972 hong kong was once a colony of great britain and its early currency systems are indicative of the former colony s relationship to the uk in 1863 the british crown established a mint that would make money just for hong kong but it minted coins that were unpopular with locals hong kong used the japanese yen as currency during world war ii when the japanese occupied china and the yen was illegal to use at the end of world war ii in 1972 the hong kong dollar was officially pegged to the us dollar chinese renminbi the yuan has fluctuated due to political conflicts the currency of mainland china confuses people who are not well versed in forex trade because it goes by two names yuan and renminbi investopedia mentions that the yuan refers to a unit of account but banks discuss transactions in terms of the renminbi the chinese currency has also gone through several ups and downs because of political conflicts with countries that accuse the chinese government of artificially keeping values low to stimulate trade however the international monetary fund imf mentioned that the renminbi would become one of its reserve currencies as of 2016 swiss franc the swiss franc is the legal currency of switzerland the swiss franc is the legal currency of switzerland and was introduced in 1850 at the time it was pegged to the value of gold it is popular to buy the swiss franc during times of economic hardship because it is considered a stable currency today the swiss franc is usually exchanged with the euro us dollar and british pound canadian dollar the canadian dollar is heavily traded against the us dollar canada is one of great britain s commonwealth countries but it stopped using the british pound in 1817 this was a reaction to the strengthening ties with the united states and its growing economic power even so the country was divided about this and several provinces had their own currencies until an 1858 law made the canadian dollar the country s only legal tender today the canadian dollar is one of the top ten most traded world currencies australian dollar australia started using the australian dollar in 1966 xe explains that the british pound was australia s official currency until 1910 when the country created its own currency the australian pound the former currency was pegged to the british pound and the country switched to the australian dollar aud in 1966 because of its high value and stability it is now the fifth most popular banknote to exchange the value of the aud made it a target for counterfeiters so the australian government designed notes made of polymer in 1988 to reduce the likelihood of counterfeit production pound sterling the pound sterling was introduced in 1971 great britain has existed for centuries but the pound sterling was introduced to the country in 1971 the currency is important because its value tends to be stable which allows investors to have an easier time making decisions as there is little risk involved in trading countries around the world tend to hold the pound in high regard and it is considered a safe reserve currency japanese yen the yen is a major reserve currency and it is often traded against the usd japan s national currency is a behemoth in asia and investors often observe the state of the yen to get a better perspective on asia s economy as a whole professional investors also use the yen as a carry trade japan is known for its negative interest rate policy and thus many investors buy yen and later exchange it for currencies that are more valuable allowing them to make a profit on excess interest though the usd is the world s currency the status of the yen means it is asia s currency euro the euro is a major reserve currency the euro is the second most popular currency to trade in the world despite being relatively new the european union made the decision to introduce the euro in 1999 but the currency was not fully adopted until 2002 it quickly became a stable currency and many countries near the european union pegged their currencies to the euro because of its value the us dollar the usd is the official worldwide currency the most widely traded currency in the world is the united states dollar the us dollar became the world s currency just before the start of world war i its position became official during the 1944 bretton woods agreement this created a new financial system under which the us dollar would become an official worldwide currency us dollar strength president richard nixon ended the practice of redeeming dollars for gold because he was not sure if the us had enough gold for all the countries in the world that may someday want to exchange their dollar reserves in 1973 countries were given the option to peg their currency to other stronger currencies however the us dollar remains strong which explains its appeal as a reserve currency for governments around the world

financier speculator statesman presidential adviser 1870 1965 don t put all your eggs in one basket market maxim by david chapman is irrational exuberance back this is how some people are now referring to the bull market that is approaching its eleventh anniversary it is a bull market like no other naturally it depends on how one terms a bull market a bear market is generally defined as a decline of 20 or more so if the market doesn t fall 20 or more the bull continues on that basis the current bull is now 4 000 days old or just shy of 11 years yes there were three corrections along the way the steepest decline saw the dow jones industrials dji lose 19 4 from october to december 2018 the other two corrections occurred in april to october 2011 down 16 8 and in may 2015 to february 2016 down 14 5 other stock market indices may have fallen more than the dji did but our reference point is the dji irrational exuberance was coined by former fed chairman alan greenspan in a 1996 speech ironically that was about when the late 1990s high tech dot com bubble was getting underway the 1990s bull market got underway in october 1990 and topped in january 2000 there was one 19 3 correction in 1998 altogether that bull lasted 3 382 days with a gain of 396 the current bull market is up 349 to date for the record the 1920s bull market that lasted from august 1921 to september 1929 was 2 932 days and gained 497 there was one 18 6 correction in 1923 so are we in a bubble many would argue that we are but then many would also argue that we are in a long term bull market that has years to run with the odd correction along the way with all due respect to the bulls that is the classic this time it is different except usually it isn t while the current bull is now the longest on record it is not the best performing as we noted the 1921 1929 bull gained 497 and the 1990 2000 bull was up 396 but the current one is up only 349 in all fairness the quoted gains are for the dji only the s p 500 is up 396 and the tech laden nasdaq has led the way up 659 the much beleaguered dow jones transportations djt that made its top back in 2018 remains up 399 canada s resource laden tsx composite is up only 136 in the same period gold has been a serious laggard during this period up only 71 but if one goes back to the turn of the century the picture is a little different the best performer since 2000 is gold up 456 the dji is up only 156 the s p 500 up 131 the nasdaq up 143 and the djt up 269 it all depends on what time frame one wishes to look at the 1920s bull was considered the classic bubble of all time the 1990s was also a bubble led by the high tech dot com stocks the nasdaq gained 1370 from 1990 to 2000 what was behind the bubbles the themes were similar a lowering of interest rates an easing of credit requirements to spur borrowing and an increase in the money supply to stimulate the economy in the 1920s the u s and the world had just come out of the war years the pandemic of the spanish influenza and the depression of 1920 1921 the end of the 1980s saw the crash of 1987 and the savings and loans crisis all efforts were made to prevent it from happening again the 2010s haven t been any different we will call this one the central banks bubble we have had historically low interest rates massive easing of credit resulting in the biggest borrowing binge in history and massive monetary stimulation through quantitative easing qe and just plain old massive injections of liquidity the result too much money chasing too few goods the classic definition of inflation except the inflation showed up in a stock market bubble it is the most juiced stock market in history bubbles have appeared everywhere stocks bonds housing art and more everywhere that is except wages for the vast majority of the population despite all the stimulus the stock market has still not returned as much as the 1920s or 1990s bubbles the juiced bull market 2009 source www stockcharts com our chart shows the impact of each phase of qe plus operation twist and more recently the fed s repo program that many are calling qe4 and now comes word that president trump wants another stimulus package that could help give incentive to households to buy stocks and the creation of some sort of tax free account here in canada we already have a tax free savings account tfsa all this is coming with stocks at record highs and unemployment at a 50 year low and of course an election in november nothing like further stimulus to help one get re elected no wonder the bulls say to ignore the background noise coronavirus covid 19 trade wars climate destruction geopolitical conflicts u s china russia iran the deep polarized divisions in domestic politics looming recessions in japan france austria mexico hong kong and italy with the potential for a slowing in china germany and the united kingdom and finally the debt bubble and potential for massive defaults oh and did we mention the locusts devouring parts of africa we are already seeing the negative impact of covid 19 with negative impact on tourism airlines supply chains shipping and more while the number of reported cases is slowing we learn that china is changing its methodology again raising the potential for suspicious numbers there are reports that the cases count is not only understated but grossly understated meanwhile cases are rising sharply in south korea and japan making asia particularly vulnerable to disruption and that flows over into europe and north america u s and canada despite all that there are many who claim this is just temporary and when it ends things will return to normal the question we do have to ask ourselves is when does the system reach the tipping point or as economist nouriel roubini called it the minsky moment when a boom and a bubble turn into a crash and a bust rather than black swans roubini calls them white swans the risks are known unknowns not unknown unknowns the fed balance sheet 2006 present source www stlouisfed org the chart above shows the massive growth of the federal reserve s balance sheet it exploded from around 800 billion in 2007 to over 4 trillion by 2014 never in the history of the fed had its balance sheet exploded so much in such a short period of time all that money has to go somewhere and it did not find its way into main street instead it went into wall street with qt biting a bit and fed hiking interest rates it did play a role in the market decline in 2018 even if it was not the prime reason nonetheless the fed stopped hiking rates then started lowering them and in response to what some believe was a need to put a lid on interest rates they started their repo program in september 2019 the result is the fed s balance sheet is growing once again by the end of 2020 at the current rate the fed s balance sheet could grow by upwards of 1 trillion and where does that money go into wall street printing presses are working overtime even if the repo program is ostensibly to prevent a market collapse because of a problem we suspect in the eu banking system or possibly the japanese banking system they might also want to check the chinese banking system which is also vulnerable because of huge amounts of loans denominated in u s dollars the next chart shows the g4 central bank balance sheets as a of gdp the g4 is u s japan germany and the u k it compares the rise with the rise of the msci world index ex u s as their balance sheets exploded upward the msci followed all that money primarily went into the stock markets not the economies whose growth has been anaemic at best since 2009 many are now falling back into recessions despite years of qe and historically ultra low interest rates including negative rates if this doesn t work then the question is what will add in money flows capital flight out of the eu and japan because of negative interest rates and money flows out of china because of problems in hong kong and covid 19 and you have upward pressure on the u s dollar and more money flows into u s stocks and bonds and yes even some flows into gold g4 central bank balance sheets of gdp vs msci world index source www bloomberg com as some say bull markets do not have an expiration date a truism is that stories of doom and gloom and bear markets are far more popular than stories of growing economies and bull markets but 11 year bull markets have never happened before and when previous bull markets came to an end as they inevitably do sorry this time is not different and then the finger pointing starts as the maxim says don t put all your eggs in one basket chart of the week source www stockcharts com source www stockcharts com we often see similar chart patterns popping up in even unrelated stocks after all there are only so many chart patterns but when we see a similar chart on in this case the nasdaq 20 years apart it catches our attention we found this rather remarkable but does it mean anything only if the ending is the same for the nasdaq in 2000 it topped in march and by october 2002 it had fallen over 80 do we expect that this time not likely but then who knows certainly the rise has not been as steep today as it was back in 1999 to 2000 as well 2020 is an election year just like 2000 the odds of the stock market falling too far in an election year are low after topping in march 2000 the nasdaq did fall roughly 40 into april but the s p 500 was only down about 13 in the same time frame after that the markets recovered into the november election the major drop came in 2001 and 2002 our expectations are similar that the market should hold together in 2020 with the big drop to come in 2021 2022 in 1998 the nasdaq found a bottom in october 1998 was the year of the russian ltcm collapse the subsequent rally saw the nasdaq rise almost 77 into february 1999 a period of four months fast forward to 2018 and following a sharp drop into december 2018 the nasdaq found a bottom and rose for the next five months for a gain of about 32 following the rise into february 1999 the nasdaq consolidated in an upward manner until october 1999 what followed was the final spectacular rise of about 88 into march 2000 this time around the consolidation also lasted until october 2019 and has thus far seen the nasdaq rise about 28 since we do not officially have a top it is possible that the nasdaq does keep rising into march 2020 while the rise is not as spectacular as in 1998 2000 the direction is the same the looks of the two charts are very similar and we have the same complacency that nothing can stop this market that is until it does markets and trends gains losses trends close dec 31 19 close feb 21 20 week ytd

the glossary at the end of this article new highs lows refer to new 52 week highs lows source www stockcharts com another week another all time high and then poof just like that the market tanks on friday in the face of rising numbers for covid 19 outside of china korea is seeing a doubling almost every day in the latter part of the week while a surprise surge is being seen in iran it s a surprise because it isn t as if iran gets visitors from china we are also seeing jumps in italy and japan while numbers are rising outside of china we have heard reports that china is underreporting cases by a considerable amount st louis fed president james bullard believes this is all just temporary it might be and will soon blow over so it is with known unknowns it was actually lousy economic numbers that sunk the markets at the end of the week as a bunch of markit indices came in below expectations and at levels suggesting a recession as well existing home sales fell we cover those more under our bond comment the markets suffered their first loss since the covid 19 crisis broke in late january the s p 500 dropped 1 3 on the week and is now down 1 7 from its all time high set wednesday at 3 393 the s p 500 has not broken any key points that suggest the top is in but friday s action certainly felt like a temporary top could be in confirmations will come when we break 3 300 and will really be confirmed under 3 275 other indices were also down the dow jones industrials dji lost 1 4 and significantly did not make new all time highs even as the s p 500 and the nasdaq did the nasdaq fell the sharpest off 1 6 the dow jones transportations djt surprisingly had a gain of 0 4 strange when airlines are expected to lose billions to the covid 19 scare and does anyone really want to go on a cruise these days airlines could be facing a 29 billion loss because of sharply reduced air travel tourism has taken a pounding especially since the chinese were major tourists everywhere as well millions visited china every year well not so much any more the small cap s p 600 lost 0 9 on the week elsewhere the tsx composite was flat after making new all time highs but a surprise winner was the tsx venture exchange cdnx gaining 2 1 in europe the london ftse was off a small 0 1 the paris cac 40 fell 0 1 as well after making new all time highs and the german dax also made new all time highs then fell 0 6 on the week there are signs the german economy could be falling into recession in asia the indices surprised as china s shanghai index ssec gained 4 2 but the tokyo nikkei dow tkn lost 1 4 strange for the ssec but china is trying to get back to work despite the covid 19 seems that things can t fully grind to a halt the world msci index lost 1 2 on the week most indices have not given sell signals yet but another week down and a sell signal would be in so how much could the market fall if a correction is to get underway we don t believe 2020 will see a major drop largely because it is an election year if we hark back to 2000 it too was an election year the s p 500 fell 13 8 from a high on march 24 2000 to a low on april 14 2000 it tested the 200 day ma before a rebound got underway that effectively lasted until the next high in september 2000 the nasdaq got hit harder losing 40 into may 2000 it too made a feeble recovery into september 2000 a decline to the 200 day ma for the s p 500 now would be a loss of another 300 points or roughly 9 from current levels for more recent election years 2008 was the year of the financial crisis and 2012 was a year of market recovery while 2016 saw the election of trump 2008 was a horrible year while 2012 and 2016 were positive years if we are following a pattern not dissimilar to 2000 where the market topped following a long bull market our expectation is that we would not be hit hard in 2020 but watch out for 2021 once the election is out of the way trump will no doubt want to see the markets rising to help his election chances a correction now would be ideal as it would get it out of the way with still eight months to go before the election it s interesting that with the market making new all time highs again this week we saw a surge in call option buying and huge volumes at discount brokerage firms tesla and shopify have become two popular stocks for the retail crowd to buy with speculative retail traders chasing the latest craze that s the way it is at tops source www stockcharts com the nasdaq took the biggest hit this past week of the major indices losing 1 6 on the week the nasdaq fell 1 8 on friday and is now down 2 from the all time high seen on wednesday we can t say that is a positive sign as the swift decline on friday appeared impulsive we note the divergence between the rsi making a lower high as the nasdaq made a higher high these kinds of divergences are not unusual at significant tops the nasdaq has been the big winner led by the faangs but it is the faangs that could also lead the market down this past week facebook fell 1 9 amazon lost 1 8 the now challenged apple because of problems in china from covid 19 fell a sharp 3 7 netflix only lost 0 1 as people will still watch tv and finally google lost 2 3 as well microsoft lost 3 4 the semiconductor index sox lost 3 4 and a key etf the technology select spdr fund xlk dropped 2 5 if we do have a decline into march as we suspect the tech heavy nasdaq will probably face the biggest decline of the high fliers shopify lost 2 but tesla continued its raging bull up 12 6 tesla is we believe the poster child of high flying tech stocks it could also face the biggest collapse once the bloom wears off despite this week s gain that actually fell short of a new all time high source www stockcharts com we have often noted how the large cap stocks are diverging with the small cap stocks a non confirmation the s p 600 topped way back in august 2018 it has been nowhere near there since even more recently the s p 600 put in a high in january 2020 at 1 046 the high this month was a lower high on the other hand the s p 500 not only went on to take out its high of september 2018 but more recently the s p 500 moved above its january 2020 high divergences and non confirmations are often seen at major turning points no it doesn t mean it happens right away and things may need some time to play out but our experience is that once these divergences show up and are never resolved it usually signifies a potential major turning point we have also noted the non confirmation between the dji and the djt with the dji making new highs not confirmed by the djt source www stockcharts com we have previously noted the negative divergence between the vix volatility indicator and the s p 500 here s another one this is the percentage of stocks above their 200 day ma despite the s p 500 making new all time highs the percentage of stocks above their 200 day ma was making a lower high the most recent high was at 80 96 vs the january 2020 high of 87 17 fewer stocks above their 200 day ma even as the index is making new all time highs is a divergence that we should pay attention to another warning that a top may be at hand cass freight index shipments source www stlouisfed org the cass freight index a measure of north american freight volumes continues to plunge january 2020 freight activity continued to plunge year over year down 9 4 the plunge is comparable to what was seen as the u s slid into the great recession of 2007 2009 it is an indication that despite claims this is not exactly a booming economy nor is it good for sustainable growth maybe we ll get a bounce rebound as the index is hitting a support line but if plunges through and takes out those lows seen in 1996 and 2000 then we could be headed for the 2008 2009 lows source www stockcharts com another week another record high the tsx composite once again saw new all time highs this past week as it was flat on the week actually it lost a tiny 0 03 the tsx touched might be the top of a channel created by drawing a line from the november 2019 high through the january 2020 high with a high of 17 970 the tsx fell short of the 18 000 mark friday s down day left a large engulfing candle on the charts suggesting a potential top our first sign of a top will be a break under 17 750 however confirmation would not come until we break back under 17 500 the sub indices had a mixed week with 7 on the plus side and 7 on the negative side no wonder the tsx was flat on the week the big winner was golds 8 7 while the big loser was information technology 2 7 other significant winners were materials 3 9 and metals mining 2 9 losers included health care 2 6 and consumer discretionary 1 6 a key sector is financials and they fell 0 1 this past week since financials make up almost a third of the tsx we need to see them rising if the tsx is to go up golds do not make up a huge proportion of the tsx composite note that despite the new all time high the rsi is below its previous highs making a negative divergence source www stockcharts com dual trouble we have mused about the fed s repo program we wondered if there are some banks out there in trouble and therefore the fed needs to keep a lid on interest rates one of the biggest suspicions has fallen on deutsche bank db but then this past week hsbc hsbc also known as hong kong shanghai banking corp popped up with the news that they were laying off 35 000 over three years and dumping a 100 billion in assets db took a 7 3 billion hit they are also the bank that bailed out trump but that is another story db has a huge amount of its capital estimated at 30 allocated to businesses that is below their cost of funds as someone noted these two banking behemoths are dying a slow death db has been falling for years and now hsbc is starting to decline as well although at a much slower pace hsbc has been lower in 2009 2009 and 2016 source www stockcharts com capital flight is driving both the u s dollar and u s treasuries capital flight from the eu and japan because of negative interest rates and capital flight from china and hong kong because of covid 19 and protests in hong kong this past week the 10 year u s treasury note fell to 1 46 down from 1 59 the previous week we are now 1 bp below the previous low seen in september at 1 47 and gaining rapidly on the all time low seen in 2016 at 1 37 another low in 2012 was at 1 43 the 30 year u s treasury bond has fallen under 2 00 currently at 1 90 not only is that yield a new 52 week low but it is an all time low here in canada the 10 year government of canada bond cgb has fallen to 1 28 still that is above the last low 1 16 seen in july 2019 and above the all time low of 0 96 set in july 2016 helping push yields lower and also helping push the us index lower on friday were the below expectations markit manufacturing and services indices the markit manufacturing pmi came in at 50 8 just above flashing recession when the market expected a reading of 51 5 the january number was 51 9 the markit services pmi came in at a recessionary 49 4 vs expectations of 53 and last month s 53 4 as well on friday the existing home sales for january fell 1 3 that was actually good as the market had expected a fall of 1 8 we can t help but note junk bond yield spreads that are at 3 49 to the 10 year a month ago they were at 3 15 the below ccc rated spread is 9 85 vs 10 19 a month ago can the 10 year fall further yes it could but we are getting near what we suspect is a bottom the pattern that has formed of making a bottom then a strong counter rally followed by another plunge is a pattern we have seen many times in the past what usually happens is that we see new lows accompanied in this case with extreme bullish sentiment then rates begin to rise again recession watch spread source www stockcharts com are we sliding closer to recession territory the closely watched 2 10 recession spread 2 year u s treasury notes less 10 year u s treasury notes bottomed last august at 4 bp our other closely watched spread 3m 10 3 month u s treasury bills less 10 year u s

analyst tom mcclellan has noted there is a 15 month lag between negative or inverted yield curves and any recession if that s correct then no sign of a recession should show up until later in 2020 but it points to potential problems in 2021 source www stlouisfed org we can t help but notice that the spread between the annual change for cpi and the yield on u s 5 year treasury notes has turned negative it is the same thing with the 10 year and just this past week the 30 year u s treasury bond slipped under the cpi rate negative real interest rates are joy to gold we note in particular two earlier periods the 1970s particularly the period from 1975 to 1980 and the 2000s gold rose sharply in the 1970s and was rising sharply as well in the 2000s before peaking in 2011 the long period between 1980 and 2000 saw positive real interest rates and gold underperformed the spread between cpi and the 5 year started narrowing after 2015 not surprisingly gold s bottom was seen in december 2015 how long this persists is anybody s guess but with the fed trying to push interest rates lower with the repo program plus money flows into u s treasuries negative real rates could persist and that is music to gold s ears source www stockcharts com the us index soared this past week to new 52 week highs and then on friday it all reversed the us index fell 59 bp or 0 6 and closed the week barely up 0 2 the us has been driven higher with money flows out of europe and japan because of negative interest rates and out of china and hong kong dealing with covid 19 and protests in hong kong so is the us index rally over while friday s huge engulfing bearish candle looks terminal we need to see further evidence the up move has been quite steep and it was no surprise that indicators quickly became overbought as well sentiment for other currencies plunged numbers we saw this week had sentiment towards the euro the swiss franc and the aussie dollar down below 10 the japanese yen fell to 16 the euro after making new 52 week lows rebounded closing up 0 1 on the week the swiss franc gained 0 4 however the british pound sterling fell 0 7 while the japanese yen fell 1 7 the canadian dollar managed to eke out a gain of 0 3 one surprise on the week was the ability for gold to rally in the face of the us rally usually gold falls when the us goes up not this time given the steep rise for the us index we need to fall back under 98 50 to confirm to us that a top is in the breakdown level for the us index is now under 96 25 the 0 6 decline for the us index on friday was the steepest sell off this year source www stockcharts com gold enjoyed a very strong up week gaining 62 and hitting a high of 1 652 before settling back to close at 1 648 gold is getting close to the pennant target of 1 667 our longer term target of 1 725 1 750 is also now within sight despite the elation we are sure the gold bugs are feeling there are some notes of caution first the rsi is now well over 70 currently 78 over 70 is overbought and a sign that we could see a pullback the gold commercial cot fell to 24 this past week the lowest level we have ever seen the daily sentiment index at www trade futures com hit 93 this week the large speculators cot net long position is as high as we have ever seen it although its cot was steady at 88 is a top imminent these are cautionary signals and they do not necessarily signal a top gold typically rallies into the annual prospectors and developers association of canada pdac convention to be held march 1 4 2020 that s only a week away if gold is still rallying hard this coming week traders and even investors may wish to think to about some profit taking as the bullish sentiment is rising too fast too soon nonetheless gold is responding to the covid 19 crisis the threat of a global economic slowdown negative yield curves and negative real interest rates there may also be thoughts that the fed and others are running out of bullets to deal with another potential financial crisis qe to infinity is all they can do and have been doing prudence now dictates caution and stops starting at the old highs around 1 613 if we were to reverse and close back below that level by the end of the month we would have signaled a top one thing we have been impressed with is gold s ability to rally despite the sharp rise in the u s dollar this past week despite that beware of a potential top that could come early in the week or towards the end of the week we d prefer to hit our targets of 1 725 1 750 but a failure just below 1 700 could also happen the move overall has been too fast once a correction sets in it could easily last 3 or 4 months source www cotpricecharts com we suppose this shouldn t be a surprise given gold s rise this past week further the numbers are as of wednesday so it doesn t include friday s big move the gold commercial cot fell to 24 this past week from 26 the previous week we ve never really seen it so low so that is a bit worrisome long open interest fell roughly 6 000 contracts while short open interest rose almost 42 000 contracts total open interest leaped 57 000 contracts the large speculators hedge funds managed futures etc was steady at 88 despite long open interest jumping nearly 52 000 contracts and even as short open interest also rose but only just over 6 000 contracts the cot is becoming more bearish source www stockcharts com as gold pushed higher in u s dollars gold was making record highs in canadian dollars euros japanese yen swiss francs australian dollars and a host of other currencies we continue to believe that at some point gold will also make new all time highs in u s dollars gold in some currencies is quite overbought with rsis screaming above 70 but that can persist for some time as it did back in august 2019 before a corrective period set in it s a warning sign not a guarantee of an immediate top there is certainly room for gold in canadian dollars to hit 2 200 and somewhat higher source www stockcharts com silver finally showed some spark with a solid 4 5 gain this past week with an rsi still under overbought levels at 70 silver could have further to run our only concern as we note below is that while gold is making new 52 week highs silver is not silver is still suggesting that it could hit potential targets up to 20 30 20 50 based on the triangle that formed august to december 2019 the flag formation that formed in january february 2020 suggests targets of 19 40 19 50 once silver breaks over 18 60 we could also have potential targets up to 21 80 some words of caution are that besides silver lagging gold the commercial cot for silver is sliding further as well nonetheless the action was positive this past week for silver and we should see higher prices this coming week there is some resistance at 18 90 and again up to the august 2019 high of 19 75 source www cotpricecharts com just as the gold commercial cot fell so did the silver commercial cot falling to 29 from 30 long open interest rose about 1 000 contracts while short open interest jumped just over 9 000 contracts the large speculators cot rose to 78 from 77 like the gold cot the silver cot is also bearish so we have to keep this in mind as gold and silver rise in price source www stockcharts com gold stocks went gangbusters this past week with both the tsx gold index tgd and the gold bugs index hui showing substantial gains and both hitting new 52 week highs the tgd gained 8 7 on the week and is now up 8 3 on the year while the hui jumped 10 8 on the week and finally is in the black for the year up 3 2 the rising triangular pattern that formed on the tgd suggests potential targets up to 312 315 another 10 gain from current levels as we noted with gold some prudent profit taking is suggested the rsi on the tgd is just over 70 but it can as it has in the past get much higher before profit taking kicks in the breakout this past week over 270 came on increased volume suggesting that this move should have some legs but stops are prudent for the tgd the reversal point would come with a break back under 258 source www stockcharts com while we were pleased that both gold and silver enjoyed a good up week with gold breaking out of the top of the channel silver stopped friday at the top of the channel we still expect silver to take it out but what is of concern is that gold is making new highs while silver is not as long as this divergence persists it sounds a note of caution as gold and silver rise source www stockcharts com oil prices were attempting to rebound this past week on hopes that opec would cut production but by week s end that basically fell apart as russia indicated they have no plans to cut production further opec also decided not to move its march meeting forward even as saudi arabia the uae and others continue to discuss production cuts the result was that wti oil prices fell about 1 on friday but still managed to gain 3 5 on the week based on friday s action the rebound rally may be over wti oil broke support in late january trading under 50 new lows below 49 31 could send wti oil prices downward towards the lows of 2018 near 42 with the covid 19 crisis not resolving itself and potentially spreading and increasing in other countries it does not bode well for oil demand that could suffer further drops natural gas ng also managed to bounce back a bit this past week gaining 5 5 however we still see no sign of a bottom forming the energy stocks were mixed with the arca oil gas index xoi down 0 2 while the tsx energy index ten gained 0 9 the best that can be hoped for with wti oil prices here is that they continue to find some support just above 50 the falling mas up around 56 57 remain enticing rebound targets but there is no law it has to reach that high the xoi appears to be forming a bear pennant after finding an initial bottom at 1 094 a break of 1 105 could target the xoi down to 1 045 1 050 based on the broad pattern that formed on wti oil between june july 2019 and the high in january 2020 the potential long term target could be 34 35 only regaining back above 57 could this potential scenario change technical scoop charts and commentary by david chapman chief strategist enriched investing inc phone 416 523 5454 email david davidchapman com dchapman

the number of reported coronavirus cases has now exceeded 80 000 following a surge in cases in south korea and italy however the world health organisation is still not calling it a global pandemic say analysts at lloyds in a tuesday brief to clients panic selling continues to hit the financial markets on tuesday as investors head for the exit says kathy lien bk asset management on wednesday february 26 the dow jones industrial average lost another 800 points which is approximately 3 germany confirmed another case of coronavirus this time from a patient who visited milan while switzerland reported its first case also from italy europe s open borders is becoming a serious problem for virus containment and according to the us center of disease control a pandemic is inevitable they expect the virus to spread in the us and warned that it could take 12 to 18 months before a vaccine is developed though human trials could begin as quickly as 6 weeks markets are selling off because investors realize that the more widespread the virus the longer it will take for economic activity to return to normal we have been warning about this for some time and markets are finally responding monday s open saw equities sharply lower on fears that the coronavirus outbreak in china is now turning into a global pandemic with outbreaks now in italy south korea and japan the outbreaks in countries outside of china over the weekend prompted another shift in the way markets are weighing the covid 19 story say analysts at ing on monday as stock indices in the us opened with sizeable losses following eurostoxx s 4 drop there s the impression this is of greater global concern given the new coronavirus cases we ve seen in italy and korea advertisement coronavirus developments within china with a slowdown in infection rates concerns over disruption to global supply chains have however increased with barriers to restoring chinese output fear over the global impact has also triggered a fresh slide in risk appetite as investors shift into safe assets focus on coronavirus transmission risks the coronavirus has officially been named as covid 19 the latest data from china indicates that the number of cases in china has increased to over 79 500 with the number of deaths above 2 600 the overall mortality rate of the virus appears to be holding broadly stable with no evidence of significant mutation at this stage the virus is however much more contagious than sars and there are major concerns that the virus can be spread before symptoms are visible this transmission would make it much more difficult to control the global outbreak worryingly it seems that the virus can pass from person to person without symptoms making it extremely difficult track regardless of what health authorities do said simon clarke an expert in cellular microbiology at britain s university of reading even if the mortality rate remains low the number of global deaths will be substantially higher than for sars chinese containment efforts bearing fruit the number of coronavirus cases outside china s hubei province has slowed although there is still an important element of uncertainty over the methodologies used chinese president xi attempted to maintain confidence in the outlook in comments over the weekend according to xi the situation is showing a positive trend after arduous efforts but there is no room for weariness and relaxed mentality among officials state television quoted the president as saying the outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia will inevitably have a relatively big impact on the economy and society xi said although he was also keen to impress that the impact would be short term and controllable over the weekend there were some positive developments 24 provinces including beijing and shanghai reported no new cases on sunday and travel restrictions have been lifted in 20 provinces the number of cured and discharged patients within china on a daily basis has exceeded the number of new cases for the sixth successive day the guangdong region has also lowered its alert status which should help boost near term output in the electronics sector china also pumps liquidity aggressively the chinese central bank has continued to pump liquidity into the economy for january when fears were in the early stages new loans increased to a record high of cny3340bn from cny1140bn the previous month the pboc has also cut prime lending rates to 4 05 and will provide emergency loan facilities to support companies these measures have had an impact in underpinning domestic asset prices with the shanghai index significantly above lows recorded when market re opened following the extended new year break chinese production facilities have started to re open following the extended lunar new year break but there have been important difficulties in returning to pre holiday production levels especially with a shortage of labour underlying chinese stresses evident confidence in the chinese economy remains weak and there is increased evidence that china was under pressure ahead of the coronavirus outbreak according to china s beige book the fourth quarter of 2019 stated that late payables and deliverables were at historically bad levels with the worst recorded cash flow results on record the data will increase fears of cash flows difficulties during the current quarter chinese domestic demand remained extremely weak with car sales for example down 92 in the first half of february the international monetary fund reported the 2020 growth forecast of china to be 5 6 from 6 0 in its earlier estimate in january and the lowest level of growth since 1990 s p global ratings has forecast that china s 2020 growth could fall to 4 4 percent if the coronavirus hit continues through april standard chartered analysts forecast chinese growth to dip to 2 8 in the three months to march before bouncing back to 6 5 in the second quarter is it too little too late to stop international spread overall the number of cases outside china has increased to over 2 000 in 28 countries with fears that international containment efforts have been in sufficient there has been a rapid increase in cases in south korea over the past few days to above 760 with most cases concentrated in the daegu region image coronavirus cases outside china within europe there has been a sharp jump in cases in northern italy to over 150 emergency lockdowns are now in place in over 10 italian cities with a population of over 50 000 affected by the move another hotspot has been iran with the first cases reported on wednesday but this has now increased to 43 at this stage there is no evidence of major infection rates in the us nevertheless the world health organisation who has warned that the window for preventing a global pandemic was closing rapidly and it may already be too late the who also expressed concerns over the number of cases that had no clear link to the epicentre s outbreak in china triple threat to the global economy fears increase the global economy will face multiple threats from the coronavirus outbreak with supply chain difficulties a slide in chinese tourism and wider global damage if cases outside china continue to increase sharply there has already been evidence of notable stresses within global manufacturing as supply chains are disrupted within the latest uk pmi business confidence data there were a number of reports from service providers that the covid 19 outbreak had weighed on overseas bookings and resulted in the cancellation of some orders particularly those based in mainland china manufactures also commented on a headwind from extended shutdowns in china moreover suppliers delivery times index signalled the largest month on month slide in supply chain performance since the survey began in 1992 within germany s pmi data there were some reports from surveyed firms of a lack of availability of inputs weighing on output levels concerns about the impact of the coronavirus on supply chains and the health of the global economy were reflected in lower manufacturers expectations for output over the next 12 months from here on a lot will depend on how fast china can resume production and contain negative implications for supply chains and global economic growth said stephen innes asia pacific market strategist at axicorp tourism badly affected chinese tourists are an extremely important element in global demand especially in asia and the drop in visits will have notable impact new zealand is continuing to bar entry to visitors that have travelled from or through china south korean airlines said they are suspending flights to daegu give the jump in cases and there will inevitably be damage to the regional economy especially with a slide in tourism according to ing if we assume that tourism to and from china basically grinds to a halt in 2020 and extra regional tourism also diminishes then the cost to the region from lost tourism revenues alone is approximately 105 115 billion if this doesn t sound sufficiently scary bear in mind that tourism is just one of the channels through which the coronavirus can weaken the gdp growth of asian countries grappling with this epidemic excluding the direct chinese impact if the global spread of the virus cannot be contained there will inevitably be a larger impact on the global economy as knock on effects continue to increase and demand is damaged there have been numerous event cancellations with the cancellation or postponement of more than 24 exhibitions and conferences worldwide including the mobile world congress risk appetite dips sharply fears over the global outlook have had a significant impact on market sentiment and risk appetite has weakened again since thursday s new york close confidence in the overall global outlook was also undermined by a much weaker than expected us pmi report equity markets retreated on friday and there have been sharp losses on monday with us s p 500 futures declining by close to 3 while the german dax index has registered a decline of over 3 0 last week goldman sachs chief global equity strategist peter oppenheimer warned in the nearer term we believe the greater risk is that the impact of the coronavirus on earnings may well be underestimated in current stock prices suggesting that the risks of a correction are high there has been renewed demand for us treasuries with the 10 year bond yield below 1 40 the lowest level since july 2016 while the yield curve is the most inverted since october 2019 in a tweet marc andré fongern head of research at maf global forex commented that according to media reports the virus seems to be spreading considerably most notably in south korea consequently a peak in the number of new cases is not yet in sight while markets may gradually become more jittery demand for the usd looks set to remain buoyant globally the key issue remains whether a humanitarian crisis can be prevented the virus has been keeping markets in suspense for weeks now much longer than initially thought accordingly investors risk appetite might decline even further the omens are not particularly good today said ray attrill head of fx strategy at national australia bank in sydney the presumption was that we would see intermediate supply chains quickly reconnected and i think the market s had to go through a period of questioning that logic oil prices have declined sharply again with brent below 56 0 p b although it remains above lows of 53 0 p b recorded in early february currency markets look to differentiate risks after an initial panic phase markets have started to pick winners and losers from the crisis the market reaction to the coronavirus appears to be evolving beginning to differentiate the currencies vulnerable to the virus from the rest barclays analysts said in a note given fears over the global outlook commodity currencies have come under renewed pressure the australian currency has also been undermined by fears over the bush fire impact with renewed speculation that the reserve bank of australia will cut interest rates further the australian dollar has declined to fresh 10 year lows with aud usd trading around 0 6600 the canadian dollar has also lost ground again with usd cad near 1 3300 demand for defensive assets increases given the slide in equity markets and fears over the outlook demand for defensive assets has increased gold has attracted strong support with a rapid advance to a 7 year high above 1 690 per ounce the price of gold has also increased to record highs in euro and yen terms image gold price chart the swiss franc has maintained a strong tone with eur chf near 3 year highs just above 1 0600 cryptocurrencies have seen volatility but bitcoin is close to 10 000 but yen no longer seen as a safe haven traditionally the japanese yen exchange rates have been seen as a key defensive asset in times of global economic stress with capital repatriated to japan concerns over the japanese economy have however had an important impact with the currency not seen as offering defensive qualities the usd jpy exchange rate strengthened to 10 month highs above 112 00 before fading confidence dipped sharply after the very weak fourth quarter data with a 1 6 quarterly gdp decline even before the coronavirus outbreak there will inevitably be further vulnerability in the first quarter of 2020 as the coronavirus takes effect japan s pmi business confidence indicators both dipped below the 50 expansion threshold for february with a sharp dip in services the euro zone is also vulnerable given the importance of exports to china especially for germany and the euro remains close to 34 month lows with eur usd trading just above 1 0800 sterling markets have been mixed with the economy slightly less vulnerable than the euro zone area but gbp usd has retreated to near 1 2900 while the euro sterling rate has held above 0 8300 us dollar still seen as the best of a bad bunch the us dollar did retreat after friday s pmi data but the us currency has secure solid underlying support the currency remains close to 3 year highs on a trade weighted basis image us dollar index chart overall yields remain attractive given the very low interest rates seen in other major economies crucially markets have also seen the us economy as less vulnerable given the relatively small size of the traded good sector according to comments from nordea the corona virus and continued weak chinese figures will likely keep usd cny elevated until sometime during q2 this is generally good news for long usd positions against eur aud gbp etc as well we see a strong usd against most currencies in our forecast until at least mid year the corona virus more of an issue for the eur than the usd given that the eur is closer linked to world trade the wuhan virus also increases the risk of a trade war 2 0 since china simply cannot comply with the deal due to current shutdown our main market take away is that the us out performance narrative will likely stay intact since e g germany is relatively worse off than us due to the chinese close down in their view therefore the dollar will be stronger for longer barclay s capital added u s dollar assets provide relative attractiveness in fact our economists forecast no impact on u s growth from covid 19 with relatively few domestic incidents and a low dependency on china s economy
even before the coronavirus sprang upon an unprepared china the credit cycle was tipping the world into recession the coronavirus makes an existing situation immeasurably worse shutting down china and disrupting global supply chains to the point where large swathes of global production simply cease the crisis is likely to be a wake up call for complacent investors who are content to buy benchmark bonds issued by bankrupt governments at wildly excessive prices a recession turned by the coronavirus into a fathomless slump will lead to a synchronised explosion of debt issuance for which there are no genuine buyers and can only be monetised the adjustment to reality will be catastrophic for government finances and their currencies this article explains why the collapse in overpriced financial assets and fiat currencies is likely to be rapid perhaps giving ordinary people in some jurisdictions an early prospect of a return to gold and silver as circulating money introduction my last article suggested that both financial assets and currencies would collapse together the basis of this supposition is twofold first central bank policies are binding together the rise in financial assets with the maintenance of value in fiat currencies therefore if one falls they both fall and secondly there is historical precedence for this when one examines the mississippi bubble 300 years ago the timing for such a collapse appears to be imminent every day more and more data confirm that the global economy is sliding into recession so far people have been ignoring this important development but now that it is becoming hard to ignore no doubt the coronavirus will be blamed this is a mistake because the factors leading to a slump principally the end of the expansionary credit cycle combining with trade protectionism against chinese imports by president trump echo developments leading up to the wall street crash in october 1929 if that point is accepted then clearly the world could be on the edge of a very deep slump exacerbated but not caused by the virus the new case for gold rickards james best price 0 25 buy new 6 99 as of 11 36 utc details the coronavirus has all but closed down china s economy it threatens to become a pandemic with serious consequences for all other national economies and their fiat currencies the central issue flowing from the upcoming monetary crisis centres on the rating of government debt almost all welfare driven states are in debt traps they think price inflation is under control because their colleagues in the statistics departments tell them so allowing them to continue to run increasing budget deficits with apparent impunity central banks do not realise that very soon they will be the only buyers of their governments debt which they will pay for with newly minted money the irony of repeating the mistakes of germany s reichsbank in 1918 23 will be completely lost to them and the path of escalating failure will only encourage the pace of printing to be accelerated the latest bombshell coronavirus is a trigger perhaps for the markets to regain control from the statist price riggers this has to be the first step to fixing broken economies the panglossians in the ranks of the banking and investment communities will be rudely awakened to find themselves staring down the barrel of economic reality only then is there a chance that neo keynesian lies will be discarded by one and all and a retreat towards sound money commence there is unlikely to be much time even without the downhill kick of coronavirus a bear market in bonds could be a devastating event on its own in a period of less than a year inflation of fiat currencies and interest rate suppression have been the principal agents for ramping bond prices which tells us that their collapse will undermine currencies as well giving complacent investors a double hit but what are we to measure a decline of fiat currencies against sound money of course gold and silver with other stores of value such as bitcoin favoured by tech savvy millennials who will be quick to observe and understand the debauchment of fiat money and the sooner we throw out fiat currencies the sooner we can revert to sound money which is gold changing values for government bonds we shall take as our primary example the us bond market because fiat currency fans believe that other than individual time values it is the risk free investment yardstick the ten year us treasury bond yields less than 1 6 but its future pricing raises some serious issues before addressing risk we should note that time preference theory tells us that possession of cash is always worth more than its non possession the discount of that future value is not significant if you part with it to buy a ten year ust with a view to trading it out in the next few days but if you buy it with a view to holding it as an investment then its discounted future value does become relevant we cannot know what this time preference is because it can only be realised in an unfettered market not a market manipulated by the fed s actions but with history as our guide an annualised discounted value of about two per cent for a 10 year bond can be used as a rough guide figure 1 which is a long term chart of the yield on this bond appears to indicate there is a solid floor in the region of 1 4 represented by the horizontal line joining points at july 2012 july 2016 and august 2019 this floor is about half a per cent less than our estimated time preference value with its yield currently 1 56 there appears to be very little upside in the price and we can understand why and if we accept government estimates of cpi u all items index rising at 2 5 year to january the yield should be closer to 4 and must therefore be heavily suppressed at current levels that is not all while the general level of prices is an economic concept it is not measurable a fact which allows the bureau of labour statistics along with all other nations who use standardised cpis to effectively goal seek an official figure for its rate of change two independent analysts chapwood index and shadowstats confirm each other that a more realistic rate for monetary depreciation of the us dollar is not 2 but about 10 annually but for the moment investors believe the price inflation lie because they want to when they begin to realise the official rate is pure fiction then one would expect government bonds to reflect a far higher redemption yield in other words any upside in bond prices is strictly limited while the downside is substantial as an illustration a 10 year bond at the current yield would have to fall from par to 47 40 to yield a more realistic gross 10 to redemption clearly the us treasury market is badly mispriced to estimate the likelihood of the fed losing control of bond pricing we should also take into account the state of the us government s finances because we have not yet incorporated future currency debasement risks in our calculations with a starting budget deficit in the current fiscal year estimated by the congressional budget office at 1 027bn a recession let alone a slump will make government finances considerably worse for the years 2020 2022 the cbo expects real gdp to grow at an average 2 per annum in the very near future due to the coronavirus alone that is likely to be revised sharply downwards if not by the cbo but by market participants as further evidence of a looming slump becomes too hard to ignore all we need to know for now is the revision of economic prospects will be significant based on recent evidence of recessionary trends and the potential impact of the coronavirus the current stage of the credit cycle indicates the banks are in the process of withdrawing circulating credit hitting smes particularly hard unemployment will rise along with bankruptcies and this assumes little or nothing for the effect of coronavirus but even if coronavirus is contained to china and east asia us corporations supply chains will cease to function requiring both time and bank credit to relocate neither are available in the short term and in the current credit climate and this is an election year when any president s financial and economic prudence are at their lowest ebb and his administration is most inclined to throw money at any and all economic problems without a recession other things being equal the cbo s forecasting assumptions and the effect on government debt outstanding might be taken to be credible by gullible investors but expressed in the economist s jargon not all else is equal and we can already see why these forecasts are going horribly wrong the question then is what the effect on markets will be when these errors are realised and prices for financial assets are adjusted for reality the adjustment will follow the current period of complacency us treasury bond prices have recently risen partly on a safe haven basis but certainly with an enduring belief in the state s economic management equities are at or close to all time highs on a relative value to bond yields argument and an expectation that any recession will be shallow further monetary easing is expected to support the economy and maintaining the long term prospect of a resumption to decent economic growth further monetary easing is seen to be bullish concerns about the dollar are broadly absent there is embedded in investor psychology part one of triffin s dilemma that concludes otherwise irresponsible fiscal policies will allow the provider of the world s reserve currency to run deficits to increase its supply to foreigners always hungry for scarce dollars which they reinvest in us treasuries and if there is a recession the argument goes then there will always be a further flight to the safety of dollars and us treasuries part two of triffin s dilemma ends in crisis which broadly is what we now face investors are yet to take note putting the effects of the coronavirus to one side for the moment in their private capacity businessmen and their bankers are usually the first to see that economic optimism is misplaced businessmen are battling in deteriorating trading conditions and bankers with their internal market intelligence and its impact on risk assessment the authorities particularly the fed who have made the mistake of believing in their own statistics and of falling hook line and sinker for keynesian stimulation theories will be next one can envisage the setup having seen from its own internal information the economy is not performing as hoped the fed decides to call in the management of the g sib banks to hear their concerns gather intelligence and reassure them they are on the case afterwards we can imagine the following conversation banker a well what did you make of that banker b the fed must be worried to feel the need to reassure us things must be worse than we thought bankers a b thinking i ll report back to my board that the fed is very worried and we must urgently reduce our loan book before our competitors do it has happened before none of this would occur in an economy which is based on sound money and free markets only susceptible to one off disasters such as war and the coronavirus instead the us economy is managed on the basis of maintaining the crumbling confidence of consumers and the uninterrupted provision to them of credit after many years of being bailed out economic actors have become fully dependent on confidence being maintained and have no alternative plan in the case of its failure but failure is now becoming evident the central question therefore devolves upon the future credit rating of the us government assuming the fed is losing control of the overall monetary situation and pricing returns to being set by markets how do you rate a very large borrower with the following credit profile no surplus of income over expenses since 2001 current trend is for further deterioration with no end in sight net present value of future liabilities mandated by law is independently estimated kotlikoff to be over 200 trillion current income taxes etc of 3 6 trillion gives a ratio of income to future expense of well over 50 times tax income will almost certainly decline raising this ratio further net interest cost at unrealistically low interest rates is 38 of last year s deficit a more realistic interest rate could have an immediate and catastrophic effect on finances management seems unjustifiably optimistic that future revenue will pick up in the absence of a management that agrees to radically alter course there can only be one answer do not lend it any money and eliminate all existing exposure when they wake up this should and therefore will be the reality facing not just the banks but all holders of us treasuries including foreigners without sound reasons to be invested in them consequently the switch from the current state of suppressive control to realistic pricing of government debt will be both vicious and rapid the only foreigners likely to delay selling existing us government debt are some governments either under the us government s cosh or not wishing to exacerbate the situation with cross border trade collapsing others have no good reason to hold dollars and dollar denominated debt let alone extend their exposure furthermore in recent years large hedge funds have made hay out of being short euros and yen and long dollars and us treasury debt through fx swaps those trillion dollar positions need to be unwound as well which will put additional pressure on the dollar and the bond markets at anything close to these yields the only buyer will be the fed which as well as new issuance will have to absorb foreign sales and those of distressed hedge funds for these reasons the monetisation of debt will almost certainly have to be on a far larger scale than following the lehman crisis there is no price for government debt in these circumstances because the higher the interest rate the worse the numbers become nor will there be any value in the currency used to buy it because if the government is effectively bust its unbacked currency will also be worthless other governments with substantial future welfare commitments are in a similar position high debt to gdp ratios will become a debt trap on a combination of recession fuelled budget deficits and realistic funding costs in the eu and japan government funding costs have even further to travel from under the zero bound meanwhile there is an air of complacency with a general assumption that the next crisis will lead to yet lower rates as has been the case with every credit crisis for the last forty years but as figure 1 the chart of the ten year us treasury above clearly showed after a long decline in yields the world s reserve currency benchmark yield is now struggling to go any lower zero or even negative dollar rates imposed by the fed cannot alter that fact this is important because central banks have tried everything that they can think of to restore economic growth and have run out of ideas led by the bank for international settlements they are now pleading with their governments to borrow more while rates are cheap in the hope that greater budget deficits will stop the world from sliding into recession other central banks are in the same boat the debt devil tempts and the weak follow and debtor hell is the highest reward he can offer the response by all g20 members to a sliding global economy will obviously be a bis sanctioned coordinated burst of deficit spending leading to a synchronised expansion of government bond supply and fiat money to pay for it it is proving impossible even for a free trader like boris johnson to resist the political imperative to build new hospitals train thousands of new nurses and policemen and throw money at a new wildly over budget railway connecting the north of england to london which incidentally will probably empty the north of northerners seeking their fortunes in london instead of spreading london s wealth northwards most of this spending is classified as investment but the fact is that without a commensurate increase in personal savings it is inflationary spending perhaps the dollar will not be the first to slide given the shutting down of china s economy by the coronavirus the yuan surely will be the first to suffer in the foreign exchanges a process that appears to be starting but this might galvanise the people s bank into positive action to stabilise the currency which it can do by tying it to gold in doing so it would do humanity a favour by leading the way early towards a sound money solution to the unfolding financial and economic crisis which with the coronavirus threatens to be potentially much worse than anything recorded in modern times the reason the dollar is likely to be next to slide is the exposure foreigners have to it the equivalent of more than one year s gdp it is comprised of about 4 trillion in bank deposits and 19 4 trillion of us securities according to the last available tic figures for the short term perhaps china s imploding economy taking germany s and others with it encourages the investor s myth that the dollar is a safe haven the trade weighted index has strengthened in recent weeks on the back of both the yuan and euro weakening and us treasury yields have declined as well it is a situation unlikely to survive deteriorating economic conditions for much longer in addition to foreign sellers speculative positions of perhaps several trillion dollars in currency swaps held by large hedge funds will have to be reversed if and when the dollar is undermined by foreign selling that would lead to temporary buying of euros and yen when that short term effect is over presumably these currencies will then suffer the combination of collapsing values for government bonds and stockmarket values at the same time as the currencies themselves fall measured against gold silver and bitcoin sound money alternatives signal the fiat crisis an unfolding crisis from the combined effects of the turn of the credit cycle and the coronavirus can be expected to hit individual fiat currencies both sequentially and generally this article has made some suggestions over a likely sequence yuan dollar euro and yen but how things actually unfold is for the moment a matter of speculation from the turmoil ahead of us the clear winners are likely to be gold and silver and supply constrained hedges such as bitcoin in real terms gold is still under priced relative to the dollar based on their relative quantities this is illustrated in figure 2 which is of gold adjusted by the increase in the fiat money quantity this chart should contradict any thoughts that the recent increase in the price of gold might be overdone the truth is that the devastating bear market in the gold price following the spike in 1980 has almost eliminated gold from investment portfolios in favour of inflation beneficiaries if that long period is coming to an end investors will attempt to switch their allocations from inflation beneficiaries and bonds with rising yields in favour of inflation protection for this reason the rise in the dollar gold price could be very dramatic particularly when a further acceleration of global monetary debasement is taken into account and this is before we see official cpi measures move much above their 2 goal sought targets for both gold and silver we can expect initial moves reflecting their eventual replacement of failing fiat as the trusted money in circulation in the case of silver it is worth mentioning that its original price relationship under bimetallic standards only become discarded when silver was generally dropped as money in favour of gold alone in the 1870s when fiat fails it is likely that silver will regain a secondary monetary role and its remonetisation will have a substantial impact on its purchasing power from a current gold silver ratio of 87 times a move towards the old ratio of approximately 15 times means that for speculators buying into the sound money argument silver is likely to be the catch up form of sound money bitcoin during previous currency hiatuses the problem of failing fiat money has always been evidenced in the rising prices of precious metals since the last financial crisis there has arisen a new category of store of value in thousands of different cryptocurrencies while most of them appear to be akin to quack monetary remedies the first cryptocurrency to be devised with its innovative blockchain technology is sufficiently understood by a growing band of followers to be firmly established as a form of money bitcoin is currently not ideally suited as a means of settling transactions or for making value comparisons between one good against another settlements are severely restricted relative to the superior scalability offered by credit and debit cards where bitcoin scores is as a store of value in learning about bitcoin and why it works a new generation of tech savvy millennials have become aware of the way their governments debauch their currencies as a means of secretly transferring wealth from them as individuals to the state the banks and their favoured borrowers bitcoin supporters are an intelligent educated mob angry at their governments abuse of their fiat currencies in all populations there is therefore a marginally greater recognition of the fragility of state currencies and therefore the abandonment of them by the general public is likely to develop over a shorter time period than experience of previous instances would suggest conclusion the straws in the wind listed in this article point to a more rapid collapse of financial asset values and currencies than generally thought by sound money theorists who have long anticipated this outcome doubts about the timing have been settled to a degree by the sudden development of the coronavirus which has already imploded china s economy disrupting global supply chains and the provision of consumer goods to the extent the coronavirus has had a hand in the forthcoming destruction of fiat currencies and keynesian mythology we can take some comfort that it will have brought forward the eventual reintroduction of gold and gold standards the path is not straightforward there will be destruction of financial asset values and the economic consequences for ordinary people will be dire we can expect widespread civil unrest and political instability western governments and their advisers are not familiar with the arguments in favour of gold having spent half a century dismissing it this fact favours the new economies which have not discarded gold which include russia china and many other asian nations some governments such as india might attempt to confiscate their citizens gold but in general the collapse of western economic fallacies could lead to asia s economic superiority it will be a rough ride for the rest of us us treasury tic figures for portfolio holding are as at june 2018 they are due to be updated 28 february to june 2019 and given the rise in stockmarkets could be recorded somewhat higher the estimate

devaluation cannot be stopped 81 24 02 2020 9 15 121 831 the belarusian ruble depreciates against the dollar even during the tax week before the reduction of oil supplies from russia the belarusian ruble usually strengthened during the tax week against the background of the sale of foreign currency earnings by exporters however last week the ruble fell against the dollar again hitting the record of 2016 wrote banki24 by friday trading resulted in the official exchange rate of 2 2120 byn against 1 usd thus february 21 the belarusian ruble hit the multi year low against the american currency until last friday the belarusian ruble had the worst position in february 2016 then the official rate fell to 2 2069 byn per 1 usd so why did the belarusian ruble weaken so much in february and what will happen to it then banki24 by tried to find answers to these questions firstly the dollar index is about to hit the all time high the dollar index is the ratio of the dollar to a basket of 6 currencies the euro eur japanese yen jpy pound sterling gbp canadian dollar cad swedish krone sek and swiss franc chf the higher the dollar index the stronger the dollar is against other currencies thus for this reason the belarusian ruble is in a weak position against the american currency secondly the state of the belarusian economy and absence of structural reforms contribute to the vulnerability of the belarusian ruble unless structural reforms are carried out our goods with a few exceptions will remain poorly competitive on foreign markets if the belarusian ruble is not weakened to a basket of currencies at least by the size of annual inflation the explanation of the need for creeping devaluation is as follows for exports not to lose price competitiveness it is necessary to achieve a weakening of the national currency in parallel with rising prices in the economy otherwise export goods from belarus will be more expensive in their national currencies for external consumers this is especially important in the russian market where belarusian goods are forced out by competitors from russia while our exporters receive less foreign currency earnings in the ruble equivalent if our ruble is stronger compared to the russian one things are not too well in the domestic market either belstat records a permanent decrease in the share of domestic goods in retail turnover the ill considered policy of the previous management of the national bank which pegged the belarusian ruble to the dollar without looking at the russian currency led to a collapse in the exchange rate in winter 2014 2015 the authorities decided to ignore the laws of the economy to create a brief illusion of stability and predictably failed the consequences of that failure are still affecting belarusians top officials have no will for economic reforms this means that the structure of the belarusian economy will remain the same while the neighbours will slowly rise consequently belarusian goods will increasingly lose out in competition even in the market of the eurasian economic union defeat in such a struggle poses a threat because belarus can no longer disassociate itself from the rest of the eeu members with prohibitive duties if belarus joins the wto it will lose the opportunity to protect the domestic market by non market methods from the absolute majority of the world s countries unless reforms in the economy are carried out imports of goods will continue to chronically exceed exports in this situation a strong ruble kills exports and contributes to import growth since net exports are a component of gdp they also harm economic growth the latest example of the impact of revaluation without accompanying reforms is in ukraine the strengthening of hryvnia at the end of 2019 caused the gdp growth rate of this country to drop to 1 5 in the 4th quarter against 4 1 4 6 in 2 3 quarters the seasonally smoothed gdp of ukraine grew only by 0 1 in october december finally the deficit of foreign currency proceeds from the sale of oil products and potash fertilizers negatively affects the belarusian ruble exchange rate the issue of oil supplies to mozyr and naftan refineries which in january february receive three times less raw materials than in 2019 has not been settled exports of oil products from belarus have been blocked while refineries provide the domestic market since july 2019 there has been no long term contract for the supply of potash fertilizers to china previously china was among the top 3 markets for belarusian potash consumers in 2020 even the official assessment of potash exports is 0 5 million tons lower than the fact for 2019 all these considerations form a vector along which the belarusian ruble will move downwards the speed and scale of this process is highly dependent on the availability of agreements on oil imports if russia and belarus do not agree in the next few weeks it is likely to take 2 3 2 35 byn for 1 usd in march the national bank promised long ago that it will not waste reserves for anything short term effect of currency interventions will only drain the currency pot of the authorities but will not change the general trend

unlike the asia pacific whose security structure has been based on military alliances our region has avoided such alliances consequently the security structure of the asia pacific cannot be duplicated in the indian ocean by ranil wickremesinghe starting with the mohenjo dara harappa civilization over 4 millennia ago trade and commerce have played a decisive role in the integration of the indian subcontinent and south east asia the mauryan empire became a catalyst for promoting regional trade buddhism removed the restriction on sea travel though kingdoms rose and fell trade remained consistent political alliances were made and broken on the basis of trade in the ninth century the pallavas came to an agreement with the anuradhapura kingdom in sri lankan and the sumatran sri vijaya empire to control trading in the bay of bengal this was challenged by their commercial rivals the chola who defeated the pallavas the sri lankans and finally sri vijaya with the traders travelled the missionaries taking with them the cultures languages and religions of the indian sub continent including hinduism buddhism and jainism during the time of the buddha tapassu and bhallika the first trader converts to buddhism carried the message of the new faith to sri lanka kaundinya a brahman commenced the indianisation of the funan kingdom formed around the mekong river in southeast asia the proliferation of culture alongside trade led to the creation of robust networks a good example of that was the multinational network of the nattukottai chettiars which spanned sri lanka myanmar thailand malaysia singapore and south vietnam until the mid 20th century they had over 1500 businesses in myanmar before world war ii the integrated financial network of the nattukottai chettiars has yet to be matched in the asean and the bimstec countries the total geographical extent of this region was never clearly defined the south and the south east asia are social constructs of recent origin invented mainly by uk and usa for instance the world war ii allies created the south east asia command comprising myanmar malaysia singapore indonesia and thailand to better conduct the war in asia the term south asia was first used by the us state department in 1950 to refer to former british colonies in the indian sub continent thus arose the political construction of two regional groups which now dominates and perhaps divides the bay of bengal region the request for regional groupings in the region have emerged from time to time sixty years ago the leaders of india pakistan sri lanka myanmar and indonesia met in april 1954 for the colombo powers meeting to discuss cooperation within their common region within the indian sub continent an initiative for a regional grouping was first taken up by president ziaur rahman of bangladesh in december 1977 i remember questioning president jayewardene as to whether the proposed association will be a success if we can get india and pakistan to the table keep them talking and avoid a war that will be sufficient he replied finally the heads of the 7 governments of the sub continent countries met in dhaka in 1985 and formed saarc south asian association for regional cooperation from this arose the south asia preferential trade agreement in 1995 followed by the south asia free trade agreement in 2006 however you will agree with me that neither of these agreements has resulted in a meaningful degree of economic integration with an intra regional trade amounting to only 5 of the total trade today both agreements have been unsuccessful in promoting trade in 1997 india and thailand took the initiative to form bimstec the bay of bengal initiative for multi sectoral technical and economic cooperation the first summit was held only in 2004 and subsequent summits held intermittently bimstec has neither a clear vision nor actionable goals it took 10 years after the first summit to establish the bimstec secretariat which is still underfunded the bimstec trade record on economic integration is also insignificant an agreement in 2004 to conclude an fta by 2006 is still pending on the other hand south east asia started a slow but successful march towards regional integration starting with asean the association of south east asian nations the asean free trade area was established in 1992 the ultimate goal is an asean economic community thereafter the broader constellation of the asia pacific economic community apec was formed in 1989 consisting of 21 member economies including asean china japan republic of korea australia usa canada mexico and chile to promote multilateralism and trade integration in the asia pacific the first asia pacific trade agreement the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership one of the most transformational trade agreements with inter locking commitments was signed by 11 of the asia pacific countries ratification by singapore japan vietnam australia new zealand and mexico has now activated the cpapp the most recent agreement is the regional comprehensive economic partnership rcep an asian dominated trade agreement that brings together asean the 3 east asian nations as well as australia and new zealand though shallower than cpatpp it enables china to join the non american members of the cpatpp in a trade integration scheme as a result of these successive agreements tariffs have fallen substantially and remain low services in many sectors have been liberalized and market access conditions substantially improved however overarching all these groupings is the belt and road initiative bri which the hsbc has referred to as globalisations next chapter as you know this china centric multilateral globalisation framework promotes both physical and economic connectivity and thereby significantly increases the economic presence of the chinese current large scale infrastructure projects funded under bri in the south asian region include 3 ports and the 3 economic corridors which connect china with pakistan with nepal and with myanmar the bri projects in our region will thus recast regional connectivity while giving china access to the indian ocean via gwadar and kyaukphyu ports parallel to the bri are the chinese free trade agreements expanding chinese economic partnerships beyond the rcep today the asia pacific is the largest economically integrated region in the world a series of trade agreements covering four continents forms its integration architecture these cover australia new zealand the whole of east asia other than north korea and the entirety of the america pacific coast excluding the usa the bri can be seen as dovetailing into the rcep what remains is for the usa to join the cpatpp which is likely to happen within a decade these agreements also affect us in the subcontinent for example the cpatt reduced tariff on apparel export between members in particular tariff reductions on items such as 1 male trousers hs 620342 2 brassieres hs621210 may lead to exporters like sri lanka and bangladesh losing their staple markets in canada australia and japan to vietnam a fellow member of cpatt unfortunately for us south asia remains the least economically assimilated region in asia and it faces a dilemma to be connected or to be left out of these new and expanding asia pacific configurations of productivity and trade effective integration in trade and security within our region gives us the members the ability to determine our architecture for the next few decades as an integrated regional grouping we will have the strength to negotiate agreements favourable to us with the rcep and other trade groupings we were the first to gain independence during the first phase of british decolonization this combined with our strategic location in the subcontinent enabled our nations to punch above our weight in the global fora yet today we are at the risk of being left out of this productivity network no doubt individual nations can bargain for admission to rcep but becoming an appendage in that forum will mean the loss of voice and weight in this region moreover our region will also lose its identity and the leading position amongst the indian ocean nations the consequences for india will be even greater a loss of prestige and predominance especially if bimstec and saarc loses its economic importance and therefore its political relevance if india loses its clout in this region then it will be a critical setback to its aspirations for a global role therefore all of us require an outcome which enables us to control our destiny consequently regional economic and security integration continues to be the best option as noted earlier our two regional groupings have hitherto made no headway the postponement of the kathmandu saarc summit in 2017 due to heightened indo pakistan tension has brought saarc to a standstill but saarc s stagnation is not entirely due to the uri terrorist attack there have been similar periods of acrimonious relations between members previously and these were not confined to india and pakistan i believe that the core issue holding us back from a regional grouping is the inertia towards regional integration we wish for trade agreements based solely on reducing tariff rates without the required economic restructuring this is an outlook starting from the bombay plan prepared by 8 leading industrialists in pre independent india in 1944 the plan was based on the premise that indigenous industries could not compete in a free market and 7 required government intervention hence the development of a supportive government economic bureaucracy but nearly 80 years later indian companies themselves have proved this to be a false premise by their ability to compete both in the domestic and export markets these inward looking theories and political stances have led to south asia has less than 1 of the net worth of the world s total production of exports while south east asia has 8 you will agree that 1 is a figure that is not sufficient to sustain south asian economic growth the growth in our countries are driven by domestic demand therefore our imports far outstrip our exports leading to increasing trade deficits it is doubtful as to whether this scenario is sustainable in a highly competitive world more to the point an energetic growth scenario is required if the 150 million young people entering the job market in the region by 2030 are to be found employment therefore in the medium term we need to transit into exportled growth to galvanise regional economic development and dynamism it is worthwhile noting that imf reports estimate a productivity boost of 20 over 20 years for india if it accelerates structural reforms including the elimination of trade and investments barrier in such a scenario the spill over effect in bangladesh and sri lanka will possibly see gdp increases by 3 furthermore the total region would contribute 35 to global growth by 2040 at least three recent reports by multilateral agencies have dealt exhaustively with the subject of integrating regional economies and making them competitive these are i south asia ready for take off imf ii a glass half full the promise of regional trade in south asia world bank and iii exports wanted world bank as noted earlier saarc is deadlocked while bimstec is not a substitute for saarc it is nevertheless a starting point for integration furthermore it has immense untapped potential by 2030 the entire bimstec population will exceed 1 7 billion at present bimstec has 3 7 of global trade the current intra regional trade is us 40 billion according to the report reinvigorating bimstec by the federation of indian chambers of commerce and industry it is estimated that the actual trade potential of regional integration by bimstec countries could be us 250 billion bimstec also has the added advantage of being a bridge to asean unlike asean the bimstec countries of bangladesh bhutan india myanmar nepal sri lanka and thailand are asymmetrical to one another no doubt this could be construed as a hurdle to integration the population the land area and the gdp of india exceeds the combined equivalent of the other countries many times over furthermore economic unevenness between members prevent the uniform restructuring that is required for genuine economic reintegration therefore if regional integration is to succeed in bimstec the initial effort should be confined to a core group of nations which have complementary economies india sri lanka bangladesh and thailand which have a combined gdp of us 3 5 trillion having a deeper assimilation will not be disadvantageous to india in 2018 india had a surplus of us 9 billion in the trading transactions with the other three partners therefore a four pronged economic integration road map eirm is proposed below to accelerate this integration first it is imperative that the four countries come to grips with economic structural reforms traditionally our countries have been averse to competition in south asia the indexes for tariff and non tariff barriers on imports are two to nine times higher than for imports from the rest of the world even the average of cost of trade within south asia is much higher than the corresponding figure for asean and naft amcta therefore any successful regional trade integration has to address the issues of para tariffs and non tariff barriers when our government came into power in 2015 sri lanka had over 6 000 tariffs line effected by para tariff by 2018 we had eliminated over 2000 such tariff lines similarly one third of the south asian inter regional trade is governed by a sensitive list which has to be reduced drastically other pertinent issues to be addressed include those relating to rules of origin and the norms of value addition anti dumping rules and countervailing measures for subsidies and common national regulations the removal of tariffs is a more complex process needing the examination of adjustment costs vs efficiency costs in some sectors domestic stakeholders will require time for adjustment a series of trade adjustment programmes must provide technical and financial assistance for any affected enterprises these sectors can be held up until the end while trade creating sectors and complementary sectors can be given priority to begin with second e commerce exceeds 10 of retail sales in many countries yet it was below 2 in our region commercial internet transactions have been identified as a fast growing sector in world bank s unleashing e commerce for south asian integration a 3 stage regional strategy it is a vital part of this initial road map so as to utilise its potential for regional integration third it may also be important to conceptualise an economic sub region consisting of the five southern indian states and sri lanka which has a population of 300 million people and a combined gdp of over us 500 billion more than sweden an economic sub region including a broad band corridor will optimise the complementarities accelerating regional economic integration kerala is building a new port near trivandrum an adb funded feasibility study is proposing a further expansion of the colombo port with an extension to the north that can make it the largest trans shipment port in the region an offshore financial centre is also planned for colombo therefore the proposed sub region will be attractive for shipping logistics offshore finance it and for maximising on the opportunities of the global value chain a similar sub region is currently being planned between india and bangladesh coronavirus has 11 highlighted the need for a second workshops of the world these two economic sub regions together with thailand are ideally suited for this purpose bangalore as an it centre will also enable the transition to the 4th industrial revolution the fourth leg of the four pronged eirm is tourism a sector which can animate the integration process the bay of bengal is the largest bay in the world dotted with famous cities and scenic beaches including the andaman islands and phuket cruise tourism catering to millions of the emerging asian middle classes is a new commercial opening for the region the bay of bengal has the potential to rival both the caribbean and the mediterranean of course the implementation of the bay of bengal cruise tourism will require detailed planning financing and efficient coordination in addition to bimstec members maldives malaysia and singapore are other cruise destinations that must be invited to join such an initiative this eirm must be i market driven and ii able to provide a deeper integration than the rcep i would suggest that the negotiations for such an agreement be concluded in 2 years if not the talks should be abandoned a signal in that we have failed if we are to succeed a mechanism with the apex body meeting bi annually should be instituted with the mandate of preparing the eirm the apex body should consist of the heads of governments of the 4 participating countries the 12 secretary general of bimstec and the high level head of eirm task force consisting of special representatives appointed by member governments this apex mechanism will need to have a sunset clause leading to the dismantling of the mechanism on a specified date by then provisions will be made for a new permanent mechanism in charge of the eirm once the eirm agreements are signed it should then allow for other members of bimstec and saarc to become signatories to the agreements expanding regional connectivity is a pre requisite for the success of the eirm conversely it is anticipated that the enactment of eirm would accelerate and cement the networks of regional connectivity clearly the pressing need for regional cooperation and connectivity cannot be met by one single country or one single institution we must also take note of the other connectivity enterprises in the region in addition to the chinese belt and road initiative india herself has undertaken two ambitious connectivity projects as you know the kaladan multimodal transport project and the india myanmar thailand trilateral highway japan s quality infrastructure investment qii partnership has also funded a number of projects including i the east west economic corridor ii the thilawa and dawei special economic zone 13 iii the bay of bengal industrial growth belt iv the delhi mumbai and chennai bangalore industrial corridors v the mumbai ahmadabad high speed rail vi the colombo port development the asian development bank has also taken the initiative with the 10 year south asia sub regional economic cooperation programme for infrastructure which is anticipated to a strengthen multimodal cross border transport networks b improve trade facilitation and c enhance electricity trading however it must be recognised that the present bimstec secretariat is too bureaucratic understaffed and not equipped for monitoring this type of undertakings therefore the secretariat will have to be restructured and upgraded with the head of the secretariat being equivalent to ministerial level the secretariat could then be in a position to coordinate and fast track the connectivity plans and projects within bimstec there is no doubt that asia s huge appetite for connectivity and related infrastructure merges with the critical issue of asian security this has resulted in the polarization of two conceptualisations of security strategies for the asian region one is centred on bri china s asia for asians strategy and the pla far sea forces concept is based on a network of partnerships which is poised to tilt the balance of power in asia the usa and its allies have responded to this with the indo pacific and the quad in an attempt to safeguard the existing balance of power consequently today the asia pacific has to contend somewhat paradoxically with a security architecture linked to usa and an economic architecture involving china unlike the asia pacific whose security structure has been based on military alliances our region has avoided such alliances consequently the security structure of the asia pacific cannot be duplicated in the indian ocean moreover there are difference of opinion as to the exact definition and demarcation of the indo pacific the us concept of the indo pacific extend only up to the west coast of the indian sub continent in contrast our countries stand by the iora definition of the indian ocean and envisage an indo pacific starting from east africa to the pacific coast of the americas when it comes to security a major source of concern to the littoral states of the indian ocean is the increasing presence of naval ships belonging to outside stakeholders the sea lines of communication in the indian ocean the lifelines of global commerce must be open for peaceful use the indian prime minister narendra modi is advocating an open and inclusive indo pacific sri lanka has taken the initiative in promoting a code of conduct on the freedom of navigation in the indian ocean based on unclos the united nations convention on the law of the sea we have also proposed the need to formulate an enforcement machinery these proposals include the 15 safeguarding of undersea cables a lifeline as vital as the sea lanes the first 1 5 diplomatic track meeting was held in colombo on 11 october 2018 on the whole there is a need to avoid security polarization within our region security cooperation need to be based on agreed threats within the region rather than political posturing the mounting multi dimensional regional trade arising from economic integration should not be thwarted by war or other security disruptions consequently terrorism piracy human smuggling narcotics and the presence of non state actors are recognised as regional threats and have become the basis for security cooperation in the region progress has already been made on security coordination in the bay of bengal bimstec members have agreed to cooperate on the bimstec convention on cooperation in combating international terrorism transnational organised crime and illicit drug trafficking and have established a joint working group however to become effective bimstec members must overcome their indifferences and ratify the convention in addition to the convention on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters maritime security has also been added to the agenda of the bimstec national security chiefs annual meetings india has also hosted the first bimstec military exercise on boosting inter operationality amongst intranational forces to contain terrorism another security initiative the trilateral maritime security cooperation between india sri lanka and maldives provide joint cooperation in patrolling the exclusive economic zone and combating piracy the bay of bengal littoral states have also participated in the milan naval exercises hosted by the indian navy the biennial indian ocean naval symposium and the annual galle dialogue also provide opportunities for navy chiefs of bimstec and saarc littoral states to discuss maritime security threats at least the building blocks for regional security in bimstec are falling in to place another security initiative the trilateral maritime security cooperation between india sri lanka and maldives provide joint cooperation in patrolling the exclusive economic zone and combating piracy the bay of bengal littoral states have also participated in the milan naval exercises hosted by the indian navy the biennial indian ocean naval symposium and the annual galle dialogue also provide opportunities for navy chiefs of bimstec and saarc littoral states to discuss maritime security threats at least the building blocks for regional security in bimstec are falling in to place nevertheless saarc is not fully functional and will not be so until the summit meetings are held moreover the indo pakistan tensions have led to our region being identified as a possible site for nuclear conflict this itself indicates the urgent necessity to restore normalcy hence the indo pakistan disputes affecting the saarc though a bilateral issue need to be resolved by the two countries at a level which permits the summits to take place this also requires solutions to the underlying issues of terrorism including cross border terrorism here we must reflect on how economic integration in the asia and pacific has acted as a disincentive for conflict the outstanding issues are still retained 17 within the present architectures available for example our region should follow a similar approach only regional integration both economic and security leading to a linkage with the existing asia pacific network will enable us to create rapid economic growth to escape the middle income trap and lead us to prosperity this will also make us the first economically integrated region in the indian ocean hence we will be able to take leadership in promoting trade integration in the indian ocean and ensure security of the sea lines of communications in conclusion then let us be bold in conceptualising one vast global productivity and connectivity network from east africa to the shores of the pacific region of the americas we have the possibility of becoming the 4th global trading bloc and increasing our voice and weight in the global fora we must not miss it

feb 24 2020 lbo the security structure of the asia pacific cannot be duplicated in the indian ocean as the region has avoided such alliances unlike the asia pacific whose security structure has been

speech made by hon ranil wickremesinghe former prime minister of sri lanka at the 4th edition of the huddle organised by the hindu on sunday 23 february 2020 at itc gardenia hotel bangalore india economic and strategic integration in the region starting with the mohenjo dara harappa civilization over 4 millennia ago trade and commerce have played a decisive role in the integration of the indian sub continent and south east asia the mauryan empire became a catalyst for promoting regional trade buddhism removed the restriction on sea travel though kingdoms rose and fell trade remained consistent political alliances were made and broken on the basis of trade in the ninth century the pallavas came to an agreement with the anuradhapura kingdom in sri lankan and the sumatran sri vijaya empire to control trading in the bay of bengal this was challenged by their commercial rivals the chola who defeated the pallavas the sri lankans and finally sri vijaya with the traders travelled the missionaries taking with them the cultures languages and religions of the indian sub continent including hinduism buddhism and jainism during the time of the buddha tapassu and bhallika the first trader converts to buddhism carried the message of the new faith to sri lanka kaundinya a brahman commenced the indianisation of the funan kingdom formed around the mekong river in southeast asia the proliferation of culture alongside trade led to the creation of robust networks a good example of that was the multinational network of the nattukottai chettiars which spanned sri lanka myanmar thailand malaysia singapore and south vietnam until the mid 20th century they had over 1500 businesses in myanmar before world war ii the integrated financial network of the nattukottai chettiars has yet to be matched in the asean and the bimstec countries the total geographical extent of this region was never clearly defined the south and the south east asia are social constructs of recent origin invented mainly by uk and usa for instance the world war ii allies created the south east asia command comprising myanmar malaysia singapore indonesia and thailand to better conduct the war in asia the term south asia was first used by the us state department in 1950 to refer to former british colonies in the indian sub continent thus arose the political construction of two regional groups which now dominates and perhaps divides the bay of bengal region the request for regional groupings in the region have emerged from time to time sixty years ago the leaders of india pakistan sri lanka myanmar and indonesia met in april 1954 for the colombo powers meeting to discuss cooperation within their common region within the indian sub continent an initiative for a regional groupingwas first taken up by president ziaur rahman of bangladesh in december 1977 i remember questioning president jayewardene as to whether the proposed association will be a success if we can get india and pakistan to the table keep them talking and avoid a war that will be sufficient he replied finally the heads of the 7 governments of the sub continent countries met in dhaka in 1985 and formed saarc south asian association for regional cooperation from this arose the south asia preferential trade agreement in 1995 followed by the south asia free trade agreement in 2006 however you will agree with me that neither of these agreements has resulted in a meaningful degree of economic integration with an intra regional trade amounting to only 5 of the total trade today both agreements have been unsuccessful in promoting trade in 1997 india and thailand took the initiative to form bimstec the bay of bengal initiative for multi sectoral technical and economic cooperation the first summit was held only in 2004 and subsequent summits held intermittently bimstec has neither a clear vision nor actionable goals it took 10 years after the first summit to establish the bimstec secretariat which is still underfunded the bimstec trade record on economic integration is also insignificant an agreement in 2004 to conclude an fta by 2006 is still pending on the other hand south east asia started a slow but successful march towards regional integration starting with asean the association of south east asian nations the asean free trade area was established in 1992 the ultimate goal is an asean economic community thereafter the broader constellation of the asia pacific economic community apec was formed in 1989 consisting of 21 member economies including asean china japan republic of korea australia usa canada mexico and chile to promote multilateralism and trade integration in the asia pacific the first asia pacific trade agreement the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership one of the most transformational trade agreements with inter locking commitments was signed by 11 of the asia pacific countries ratification by singapore japan vietnam australia new zealand and mexico has now activated the cpapp the most recent agreement is the regional comprehensive economic partnership rcep an asian dominated trade agreement that brings together asean the 3 east asian nations as well as australia and new zealand though shallower than cpatpp it enables china to join the non american members of the cpatpp in a trade integration scheme as a result of these successive agreements tariffs have fallen substantially and remain low services in many sectors have been liberalized and market access conditions substantially improved however overarching all these groupings is the belt and road initiative bri which the hsbc has referred to as globalisations next chapter as you know this china centric multilateral globalisation framework promotes both physical and economic connectivity and thereby significantly increases the economic presence of the chinese current large scale infrastructure projects funded under bri in the south asian region include 3 ports and the 3 economic corridors which connect china with pakistan with nepal and with myanmar the bri projects in our region will thus recast regional connectivity while giving china access to the indian ocean via gwadar and kyaukphyu ports parallel to the bri are the chinese free trade agreements expanding chinese economic partnerships beyond the rcep today the asia pacific is the largest economically integrated region in the world a series of trade agreements covering four continents forms its integration architecture these cover australia new zealand the whole of east asia other than north korea and the entirety of the america pacific coast excluding the usa the bri can be seen as dovetailing into the rcep what remains is for the usa to join the cpatpp which is likely to happen within a decade these agreements also affect us in the subcontinent for example the cpatt reduced tariff on apparel export between members in particular tariff reductions on items such as 1 male trousers hs 620342 2 brassieres hs621210 may lead to exporters like sri lanka and bangladesh losing their staple markets in canada australia and japan to vietnam a fellow member of cpatt unfortunately for us south asia remains the least economically assimilated region in asia and it faces a dilemma to be connected or to be left out of these new and expanding asia pacific configurations of productivity and trade effective integration in trade and security within our region gives us the members the ability to determine our architecture for the next few decades as an integrated regional grouping we will have the strength to negotiate agreements favourable to us with the rcep and other trade groupings we were the first to gain independence during the first phase of british de colonization this combined with our strategic location in the subcontinent enabled our nations to punch above our weight in the global fora yet today we are at the risk of being left out of this productivity network no doubt individual nations can bargain for admission to rcep but becoming an appendage in that forum will mean the loss of voice and weight in this region moreover our region will also lose its identity and the leading position amongst the indian ocean nations the consequences for india will be even greater a loss of prestige and predominance especially if bimstec and saarc loses its economic importance and therefore its political relevance if india loses its clout in this region then it will be a critical setback to its aspirations for a global role therefore all of us require an outcome which enables us to control our destiny consequently regional economic and security integration continues to be the best option as noted earlier our two regional groupings have hitherto made no headway the postponement of the kathmandu saarc summit in 2017 due to heightened indo pakistan tension has brought saarc to a standstill but saarc s stagnation is not entirely due to the uri terrorist attack there have been similar periods of acrimonious relations between members previously and these were not confined to india and pakistan i believe that the core issue holding us back from a regional grouping is the inertia towards regional integration we wish for trade agreements based solely on reducing tariff rates without the required economic restructuring this is an outlook starting from the bombay plan prepared by 8 leading industrialists in pre independent india in 1944 the plan was based on the premise that indigenous industries could not compete in a free market and required government intervention hence the development of a supportive government economic bureaucracy but nearly 80 years later indian companies themselves have proved this to be a false premise by their ability to compete both in the domestic and export markets these inward looking theories and political stances have led to south asia has less than 1 of the net worth of the world s total production of exports while south east asia has 8 you will agree that 1 is a figure that is not sufficient to sustain south asian economic growth the growth in our countries are driven by domestic demand therefore our imports far outstrip our exports leading to increasing trade deficits it is doubtful as to whether this scenario is sustainable in a highly competitive world more to the point an energetic growth scenario is required if the 150 million young people entering the job market in the region by 2030 are to be found employment therefore in the medium term we need to transit into export led growth to galvanise regional economic development and dynamism it is worthwhile noting that imf reports estimate a productivity boost of 20 over 20 years for india if it accelerates structural reforms including the elimination of trade and investments barrier in such a scenario the spill over effect in bangladesh and sri lanka will possibly see gdp increases by 3 furthermore the total region would contribute 35 to global growth by 2040 at least three recent reports by multilateral agencies have dealt exhaustively with the subject of integrating regional

noted earlier saarc is deadlocked while bimstec is not a substitute for saarc it is nevertheless a starting point for integration furthermore it has immense untapped potential by 2030 the entire

conceptualisations of security strategies for the asian region one is centred on bri china s asia for asians strategy and the pla far sea forces concept is based on a network of partnerships which is poised to tilt the balance of power in asia the usa and its allies have responded to this with the indo pacific and the quad in an attempt to safeguard the existing balance of power consequently today the asia pacific has to contend somewhat paradoxically with a security architecture linked to usa and an economic architecture involving china unlike the asia pacific whose security structure has been based on military alliances our region has avoided such alliances consequently the security structure of the asia pacific cannot be duplicated in the indian ocean moreover there are difference of opinion as to the exact definition and demarcation of the indo pacific the us concept of the indo pacific extend only up to the west coast of the indian sub continent in contrast our countries stand by the iora definition of the indian ocean and envisage an indo pacific starting from east africa to the pacific coast of the americas when it comes to security a major source of concern to the littoral states of the indian ocean is the increasing presence of naval ships belonging to outside stakeholders the sea lines of communication in the indian ocean the lifelines of global commerce must be open for peaceful use the indian prime minister narendra modi is advocating an open and inclusive indo pacific sri lanka has taken the initiative in promoting a code of conduct on the freedom of

combating piracy the bay of bengal littoral states have also participated in the milan naval exercises hosted by the indian navy the biennial indian ocean naval symposium and the annual galle dialogue also provide opportunities for navy chiefs of bimstec and saarc littoral states to discuss maritime security threats at least the building blocks for regional security in bimstec are falling in to place of course successful regional integration both economic and security is dependent on saarc becoming fully functional at the highest levels yet irrespective of the saarc summits official and ministerial discussions take place the people to people contacts are strong funding is received meetings of the saarc non governmental organizations are held regularly the secretariat carries on its work and a new secretary general from sri lanka will assume office soon nevertheless saarc is not fully functional and will not be so until the summit meetings are held moreover the indo pakistan tensions have led to our region being identified as a possible site for nuclear conflict this itself indicates the urgent necessity to restore normalcy hence the indo pakistan disputes affecting the saarc though a bilateral issue need to be resolved by the two countries at a level which permits the summits to take place this also requires solutions to the underlying issues of terrorism including cross border terrorism here we must reflect on how economic integration in the asia and pacific has acted as a disincentive for conflict the outstanding issues are still retained within the present architectures available for example our region should follow a similar approach only regional integration both economic and security leading to a linkage with the existing asia pacific network will enable us to create rapid economic growth to escape the middle income trap and lead us to prosperity this will also make us the first economically integrated region in the indian ocean hence we will be able to take leadership in promoting trade integration in the indian ocean and ensure security of the sea lines of communications in conclusion then let us be bold in conceptualising one vast global productivity and connectivity network from east africa to the shores of the pacific region of the americas we have the possibility of becoming the 4th global trading bloc and increasing our voice and weight in the global fora we must not miss it
briefing highlights no longer the best dollar global markets tumble on coronavirus blockades to hit growth key this week best dollar no more a major foreign bank no longer expects canada s loonie to be the best dollar this year société générale was referring in a revised forecast to the loonie against the australian and new zealand dollars and how the currencies will fare against the u s greenback global fixed income strategist kit juckes and his colleague foreign exchange derivatives strategist olivier korber revised their projections because u s economic outlooks have been better than expected and notably the yen and other asian currencies have been affected by the coronavirus trade sensitive currencies should recover at the margin given alleviated bearish risks concerning the chinese yuan mr juckes and mr korber said the cad is no longer expected to be the best dollar but only see modest performance against the greenback antipodeans dollars should see modest resilience with the aud still outperforming a standstill nzd they were referring to the three currencies by their symbols mr juckes and mr korber projected the loonie will be at about 75 8 u s cents in the second quarter ending the year at almost 77 us cents and picking up another half cent in the first three months of 2021 bank of montreal chief economist douglas porter noted that the canadian and australian dollars had been nearly inseparable for about eight years until mid 2018 when the latter began to sag sharply while the former held its own this came as australia s central bank became an early and enthusiastic leader of the rate cut parade trimming its benchmark as did others while the bank of canada held firm the australian dollar has suffered of late because of china s coronavirus related economic challenges and australia s trade connections sinking again today which obviously could affect how forecasts play out in its latest forecast last week cibc world markets projected the loonie will weaken after a short lived rally sliding to 73 5 us cents in the fourth quarter the recent global risk off environment driven by fears surrounding the coronavirus has seen the flight to safe haven assets and a depression in oil prices economic analyst taylor rochwerg said in her forecast but if fears abate and sentiment eventually improves in the next few months oil prices should rebound and the loonie will likely be dragged along for the ride given that the loonie should close out the first quarter slightly stronger than where it is now however that rebound will likely be short lived as softness in gdp growth continues and strength in the labour market wanes accordingly ms rochwerg said moreover that will likely be compounded by the repercussions of the coronavirus on global supply chains and production and potentially current rail disruptions that could be enough reason to see the bank of canada cut interest rates by 25 basis points in april coronavirus issues would affect the australian dollar too but a rate cut by the bank of canada which some observers expect at some point would also soften up the loonie also affecting the canadian currency will be the strength of the u s dollar and observers expect it to remain buoyed by global uncertainties the usd should remain upbeat but looks vulnerable over the next two weeks on month end and u s political risks said mark mccormick global head of foreign exchange strategy at td securities read more stocks sink stocks are tumbling across the globe as the toll from the coronavirus mounts economists revise forecasts analysts are marking down their projections for economic growth in the wake of the rail blockades rail blockades could reduce canadian gdp growth by 0 2 of a percentage point in q1 20 potentially more if a resolution isn t found soon royal bank of canada senior economists nathan janzen and josh nye said in a recent forecast the disruptions add to a growing list of transitory or one off factors that have impacted canada s economy they added economic activity should eventually rebound from temporary factors but downside surprises are more likely at this stage in the economic cycle stephen brown senior canada economist at capital economics in turn projected the blockades will eat into february gdp to the tune of 0 25 per cent even if they end soon growth should at least get a similar sized boost in march assuming the blockades are lifted but the combined effects of the weaker data and the protests suggests that growth will be closer to 1 5 per cent annualized in the first quarter of the year rather than near 2 per cent as we had previously assumed bmo s mr porter also cited the mounting toll many initially pointed to the eight day cn strike last november as a recent example a 4 per cent drop in rail activity that month directly cut gdp by much less than 0 1 per cent he said but because of its lengthier nature and with no immediate end in sight the blockade may be a bigger drag read more key this week it s largely about the economy and the commercial banks where the former is concerned analysts expect statistics canada to report lame economic growth in the fourth quarter as cibc senior economist royce mendes put it in his lookahead to friday s report canada s economy didn t exactly ride into the new year in style expect to see annualized growth of about 0 2 or 0 3 per cent a sharp slowdown from the third quarter s 1 3 per cent it s true that there were some idiosyncratic forces at play an auto strike south of the border which affected canadian supply chains a rail strike here at home a pipeline disruption and challenging weather conditions mr mendes said but a cooling in household spending has been the most concerning aspect of the economic slowdown which was unlikely materially affected by those forces and has been ongoing since at least the second quarter of 2019 as for the commercial banks they speed up their reporting of financial results this week after royal bank of canada s strong quarter last week bank earnings season kicks into high gear and will set much of the tone for the tsx given that banks have a 21 per cent weight in the index said derek holt bank of nova scotia s head of capital markets economics we ll also get a couple of provincial budgets from alberta and nova scotia read more
by ranil wickremesinghe starting with the mohenjo dara harappa civilization over 4 millennia ago trade and commerce have played a decisive role in the integration of the indian sub continent and south east asia the mauryan empire became a catalyst for promoting regional trade buddhism removed the restriction on sea travel though kingdoms rose and fell trade remained consistent political alliances were made and broken on the basis of trade in the ninth century the pallavas came to an agreement with the anuradhapura kingdom in sri lankan and the sumatran sri vijaya empire to control trading in the bay of bengal this was challenged by their commercial rivals the chola who defeated the pallavas the sri lankans and finally sri vijaya with the traders travelled the missionaries taking with them the cultures languages and religions of the indian sub continent including hinduism buddhism and jainism during the time of the buddha tapassu and bhallika the first trader converts to buddhism carried the message of the new faith to sri lanka kaundinya a brahman commenced the indianisation of the funan kingdom formed around the mekong river in southeast asia the proliferation of culture alongside trade led to the creation of robust networks a good example of that was the multinational network of the nattukottai chettiars which spanned sri lanka myanmar thailand malaysia singapore and south vietnam until the mid 20th century they had over 1500 businesses in myanmar before world war ii the integrated financial network of the nattukottai chettiars has yet to be matched in the asean and the bimstec countries the total geographical extent of this region was never clearly defined the south and the south east asia are social constructs of recent origin invented mainly by uk and usa for instance the world war ii allies created the south east asia command comprising myanmar malaysia singapore indonesia and thailand to better conduct the war in asia the term south asia was first used by the us state department in 1950 to refer to former british colonies in the indian sub continent thus arose the political construction of two regional groups which now dominates and perhaps divides the bay of bengal region the request for regional groupings in the region have emerged from time to time sixty years ago the leaders of india pakistan sri lanka myanmar and indonesia met in april 1954 for the colombo powers meeting to discuss cooperation within their common region within the indian sub continent an initiative for a regional grouping was first taken up by president ziaur rahman of bangladesh in december 1977 i remember questioning president jayewardene as to whether the proposed association will be a success if we can get india and pakistan to the table keep them talking and avoid a war that will be sufficient he replied finally the heads of the 7 governments of the sub continent countries met in dhaka in 1985 and formed saarc south asian association for regional cooperation from this arose the south asia preferential trade agreement in 1995 followed by the south asia free trade agreement in 2006 however you will agree with me that neither of these agreements has resulted in a meaningful degree of economic integration with an intra regional trade amounting to only 5 of the total trade today both agreements have been unsuccessful in promoting trade in 1997 india and thailand took the initiative to form bimstec the bay of bengal initiative for multi sectoral technical and economic cooperation the first summit was held only in 2004 and subsequent summits held intermittently bimstec has neither a clear vision nor actionable goals it took 10 years after the first summit to establish the bimstec secretariat which is still underfunded the bimstec trade record on economic integration is also insignificant an agreement in 2004 to conclude an fta by 2006 is still pending on the other hand south east asia started a slow but successful march towards regional integration starting with asean the association of south east asian nations the asean free trade area was established in 1992 the ultimate goal is an asean economic community thereafter the broader constellation of the asia pacific economic community apec was formed in 1989 consisting of 21 member economies including asean china japan republic of korea australia usa canada mexico and chile to promote multilateralism and trade integration in the asia pacific the first asia pacific trade agreement the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership one of the most transformational trade agreements with inter locking commitments was signed by 11 of the asia pacific countries ratification by singapore japan vietnam australia new zealand and mexico has now activated the cpapp the most recent agreement is the regional comprehensive economic partnership rcep an asian dominated trade agreement that brings together asean the 3 east asian nations as well as australia and new zealand though shallower than cpatpp it enables china to join the non american members of the cpatpp in a trade integration scheme as a result of these successive agreements tariffs have fallen substantially and remain low services in many sectors have been liberalized and market access conditions substantially improved however overarching all these groupings is the belt and road initiative bri which the hsbc has referred to as globalisations next chapter as you know this china centric multilateral globalisation framework promotes both physical and economic connectivity and thereby significantly increases the economic presence of the chinese current large scale infrastructure projects funded under bri in the south asian region include 3 ports and the 3 economic corridors which connect china with pakistan with nepal and with myanmar the bri projects in our region will thus recast regional connectivity while giving china access to the indian ocean via gwadar and kyaukphyu ports parallel to the bri are the chinese free trade agreements expanding chinese economic partnerships beyond the rcep today the asia pacific is the largest economically integrated region in the world a series of trade agreements covering four continents forms its integration architecture these cover australia new zealand the whole of east asia other than north korea and the entirety of the america pacific coast excluding the usa the bri can be seen as dovetailing into the rcep what remains is for the usa to join the cpatpp which is likely to happen within a decade these agreements also affect us in the subcontinent for example the cpatt reduced tariff on apparel export between members in particular tariff reductions on items such as 1 male trousers hs 620342 2 brassieres hs621210 may lead to exporters like sri lanka and bangladesh losing their staple markets in canada australia and japan to vietnam a fellow member of cpatt unfortunately for us south asia remains the least economically assimilated region in asia and it faces a dilemma to be connected or to be left out of these new and expanding asia pacific configurations of productivity and trade effective integration in trade and security within our region gives us the members the ability to determine our architecture for the next few decades as an integrated regional grouping we will have the strength to negotiate agreements favourable to us with the rcep and other trade groupings we were the first to gain independence during the first phase of british de colonization this combined with our strategic location in the subcontinent enabled our nations to punch above our weight in the global fora yet today we are at the risk of being left out of this productivity network no doubt individual nations can bargain for admission to rcep but becoming an appendage in that forum will mean the loss of voice and weight in this region moreover our region will also lose its identity and the leading position amongst the indian ocean nations the consequences for india will be even greater a loss of prestige and predominance especially if bimstec and saarc loses its economic importance and therefore its political relevance if india loses its clout in this region then it will be a critical setback to its aspirations for a global role therefore all of us require an outcome which enables us to control our destiny consequently regional economic and security integration continues to be the best option as noted earlier our two regional groupings have hitherto made no headway the postponement of the kathmandu saarc summit in 2017 due to heightened indo pakistan tension has brought saarc to a standstill but saarc s stagnation is not entirely due to the uri terrorist attack there have been similar periods of acrimonious relations between members previously and these were not confined to india and pakistan i believe that the core issue holding us back from a regional grouping is the inertia towards regional integration we wish for trade agreements based solely on reducing tariff rates without the required economic restructuring this is an outlook starting from the bombay plan prepared by 8 leading industrialists in pre independent india in 1944 the plan was based on the premise that indigenous industries could not compete in a free market and required government intervention hence the development of a supportive government economic bureaucracy but nearly 80 years later indian companies themselves have proved this to be a false premise by their ability to compete both in the domestic and export markets these inward looking theories and political stances have led to south asia has less than 1 of the net worth of the world s total production of exports while south east asia has 8 you will agree that 1 is a figure that is not sufficient to sustain south asian economic growth the growth in our countries are driven by domestic demand therefore our imports far outstrip our exports leading to increasing trade deficits it is doubtful as to whether this scenario is sustainable in a highly competitive world more to the point an energetic growth scenario is required if the 150 million young people entering the job market in the region by 2030 are to be found employment therefore in the medium term we need to transit into export led growth to galvanise regional economic development and dynamism it is worthwhile noting that imf reports estimate a productivity boost of 20 over 20 years for india if it accelerates structural reforms including the elimination of trade and investments barrier in such a scenario the spill over effect in bangladesh and sri lanka will possibly see gdp increases by 3 furthermore the total region would contribute 35 to global growth by 2040 at least three recent reports by multilateral agencies have dealt exhaustively with the subject of integrating regional economies and making them competitive these are i south asia ready for take off imf ii a glass half full the promise of regional trade in south asia world bank and iii exports wanted world bank as noted earlier saarc is deadlocked while bimstec is not a substitute for saarc it is nevertheless a starting point for integration furthermore it has immense untapped potential by 2030 the entire bimstec population will exceed 1 7 billion at present bimstec has 3 7 of global trade the current intra regional trade is us 40 billion according to the report reinvigorating bimstec by the federation of indian chambers of commerce and industry it is estimated that the actual trade potential of regional integration by bimstec countries could be us 250 billion bimstec also has the added advantage of being a bridge to asean unlike asean the bimstec countries of bangladesh bhutan india myanmar nepal sri lanka and thailand are asymmetrical to one another no doubt this could be construed as a hurdle to integration the population the land area and the gdp of india exceeds the combined equivalent of the other countries many times over furthermore economic unevenness between members prevent the uniform restructuring that is required for genuine economic reintegration therefore if regional integration is to succeed in bimstec the initial effort should be confined to a core group of nations which have complementary economies india sri lanka bangladesh and thailand which have a combined gdp of us 3 5 trillion having a deeper assimilation will not be disadvantageous to india in 2018 india had a surplus of us 9

tensions have led to our region being identified as a possible site for nuclear conflict this itself indicates the urgent necessity to restore normalcy hence the indo pakistan disputes affecting the saarc though a bilateral issue need to be resolved by the two countries at a level which permits the summits to take place this also requires solutions to the underlying issues of terrorism including cross border terrorism here we must reflect on how economic integration in the asia and pacific has acted as a disincentive for conflict the outstanding issues are still retained within the present architectures available for example our region should follow a similar approach only regional integration both economic and security leading to a linkage with the existing asia pacific network will enable us to create rapid economic growth to escape the middle income trap and lead us to prosperity this will also make us the first economically integrated region in the indian ocean hence we will be able to take leadership in promoting trade integration in the indian ocean and ensure security of the sea lines of communications in conclusion then let us be bold in conceptualising one vast global productivity and connectivity network from east africa to the shores of the pacific region of the americas we have the possibility of becoming the 4th global trading bloc and increasing our voice and weight in the global fora we must not miss it speech made by ranil wickremesinghe at the 4th edition of the huddle organised by the hindu on sunday 23 february 2020 at itc gardenia hotel

reading time 4 minutes after 15 years the center left broad front s hold on power in uruguay will end when luis alberto lacalle pou of the national party takes office on march 1 lacalle pou s presidency is the latest example of voters in latin america turning to a conservative leader to open up their economies tackle yawning fiscal deficits combat crime improve the education system and realign their country s foreign policy toward the u s however lacalle pou differs from other conservative leaders in latin america like president jair bolsonaro of brazil or president nayib bukele of el salvador as he remains committed to centrist politics and wants to reduce polarization still not all will be smooth sailing for lacalle pou uruguay s traditionally stable party system has fragmented especially on the right the new president narrowly secured his election in october by forging a clunky multicolor coalition that includes the historic and centrist colorado party as well as the new populist open forum party the challenge for lacalle pou is whether this diverse coalition can survive as policy disagreements on sensitive issues become apparent however lacalle pou hopes he ll be able to find some consensus within his coalition on three key issues fiscal consolidation tackling rising crime and turning the country into a magnet for migrants making it easier to do business according to the imf uruguay is in an enviable position in many respects as it stands out as one of the region s most stable economies indeed lacalle pou inherits a country with an investment grade rating sizable foreign exchange reserves and a balanced external debt profile with only 14 of debt maturities being short term for comparison 24 of argentina s debt in 2018 was short term despite these advantages it s increasingly expensive to do business in uruguay posing a problem for lacalle pou s government the outgoing government s spending and expanded entitlement programs specifically pensions raised the fiscal deficit which grew to 4 6 of gdp in 2019 to cover its expenses the government raised taxes and utility rates at state owned enterprises as a result uruguayans pay the highest prices in the southern cone for energy and gasoline for an export dependent economy these high input costs are pricing producers out of markets and they explain the angst of the rural led protest movement only one uruguay who are demanding a reduction in the size of the state lacalle pou owes his victory in part to the agricultural sector and to satisfy their demands he plans to focus on curtailing spending instead of raising taxes to tackle the deficit the incoming president has promised to reduce state employment and make state spending more efficient which could save 900 million lacalle pou also plans to liberalize uruguay s energy sector in order to increase competition and reduce energy prices that will require ending the monopoly held by state owned energy firm ancap this proved difficult for the broad front in 2003 when unions defeated an effort to liberalize the sector in a referendum labor is another area where the government may seek to reduce costs workers have seen wage increases every year since the broad front took power but there has also been a significant increase in unemployment with the youth being hit particularly hard addressing the wage and employment trade off will be a sensitive issue for the government as doing so promises to place the government on a collision course with uruguay s powerful unions reducing crime uruguay has become the fourth most violent country in south america and lacalle pou will enter office with high expectations from concerned middle class voters within his party hardliners have made combating crime their siren song and lacalle pou named one of them former national party presidential candidate and senator jorge larrañaga as the incoming interior minister larrañaga has a more mano dura approach towards crime and led the charge on two referendums on the issue in 2014 he promoted a change to the constitution to reduce the age of criminal responsibility to 16 which failed to pass last year voters

reading time 4 minutes after 15 years the center left broad front s hold on power in uruguay will end when luis alberto lacalle pou of the national party takes office on march 1 lacalle pou s presidency is the latest example of voters in latin america turning to a conservative leader to open up their economies tackle yawning fiscal deficits combat crime improve the education system and realign their country s foreign policy toward the u s however lacalle pou differs from other conservative leaders in latin america like president jair bolsonaro of brazil or president nayib bukele of el salvador as he remains committed to centrist politics and wants to reduce polarization still not all will be smooth sailing for lacalle pou uruguay s traditionally stable party system has fragmented especially on the right the new president narrowly secured his election in october by forging a clunky multicolor coalition that includes the historic and centrist colorado party as well as the new populist open forum party the challenge for lacalle pou is whether this diverse coalition can survive as policy disagreements on sensitive issues become apparent however lacalle pou hopes he ll be able to find some consensus within his coalition on three key issues fiscal consolidation tackling rising crime and turning the country into a magnet for migrants making it easier to do business according to the imf uruguay is in an enviable position in many respects as it stands out as one of the region s most stable economies indeed lacalle pou inherits a country with an investment grade rating sizable foreign exchange reserves and a balanced external debt profile with only 14 of debt maturities being short term for comparison 24 of argentina s debt in 2018 was short term despite these advantages it s increasingly expensive to do business in uruguay posing a problem for lacalle pou s government the outgoing government s spending and expanded entitlement programs specifically pensions raised the fiscal deficit which grew to 4 6 of gdp in 2019 to cover its expenses the government raised taxes and utility rates at state owned enterprises as a result uruguayans pay the highest prices in the southern cone for energy and gasoline for an export dependent economy these high input costs are pricing producers out of markets and they explain the angst of the rural led protest movement only one uruguay who are demanding a reduction in the size of the state lacalle pou owes his victory in part to the agricultural sector and to satisfy their demands he plans to focus on curtailing spending instead of raising taxes to tackle the deficit the incoming president has promised to reduce state employment and make state spending more efficient which could save 900 million lacalle pou also plans to liberalize uruguay s energy sector in order to increase competition and reduce energy prices that will require ending the monopoly held by state owned energy firm ancap this proved difficult for the broad front in 2003 when unions defeated an effort to liberalize the sector in a referendum labor is another area where the government may seek to reduce costs workers have seen wage increases every year since the broad front took power but there has also been a significant increase in unemployment with the youth being hit particularly hard addressing the wage and employment trade off will be a sensitive issue for the government as doing so promises to place the government on a collision course with uruguay s powerful unions reducing crime uruguay has become the fourth most violent country in south america and lacalle pou will enter office with high expectations from concerned middle class voters within his party hardliners have made combating crime their siren song and lacalle pou named one of them former national party presidential candidate and senator jorge larrañaga as the incoming interior minister larrañaga has a more mano dura approach towards crime and led the charge on two referendums on the issue in 2014 he promoted a change to the constitution to reduce the age of criminal responsibility to 16 which failed to pass last year voters

globalisation has been a powerful force of change that has increased productivity and played a key role in lifting millions out of poverty in emerging markets governments are increasingly confronted with the challenge of preserving the benefits of globalisation while managing its side effects in this column we highlight that central banks are also not immune to the forces of globalisation in at least three dimensions first and foremost globalisation may have an impact on inflation second it may complicate central banks role in supporting financial stability finally globalisation may influence central banks in subtler and more indirect ways we review each aspect on the basis of recent evidence and academic literature has globalisation made inflation more dependent on global factors it has been stressed in the recent international finance literature that globalisation has made inflation more dependent on international factors and put into question the usefulness of standard economic models forbes 2020 it is indeed well known that inflation has a strong global component driven in particular by commodity prices for headline inflation 1 recent work has also shown that globalisation is affecting inflation through several additional channels that may help explain the lack of inflationary pressures in the recovery phase after the global financial crisis notably foreign slack can influence domestic inflation by reducing the bargaining power of labour globalisation has further decreased the bargaining power of workers as firms can offshore their technological knowhow baldwin 2016 the expansion of global value chains may have also enhanced the economic relevance of global economic slack for domestic inflation by increasing international linkages auer et al 2017 last but not least there is evidence that rising trade exposures explain the decline in responsiveness of aggregate inflation to output fluctuations across industries gilchrist and zakrajsek 2019 the above findings prompt the more general question of whether globalisation leads to higher co movements of macroeconomic and financial variables whose assessment are essential for the conduct of monetary policy in theory this is not necessarily the case because on the one hand integration increases the degree of global interdependence but on the other hand it fosters economic specialisation and risk sharing overall the empirical evidence however supports a positive link between trade and financial integration and international co movements 2 in this context a simple correlation analysis reveals some interesting stylised facts in figures 1 and 2 we show the average bilateral correlations of major real and financial variables during a period of relatively low pre 2003 and high globalisation post 2003 omitting the years of the global financial crisis in both periods we find that cross country correlations are higher than in standard economic models justiniano and preston 2010 this international synchronisation has generally risen further with the deepening of economic and financial integration but not for all variables while the rise was particularly sizeable in the case of real variables and stock market returns there was even a slight decline in the case of headline inflation and financial conditions between the two samples figure 1 real variables sources imf international financial statistics oecd main economic indicators haver analytics refinity datastream and ecb staff calculations notes averages unweighted of bilateral correlations based on quarterly data for 53 countries annual growth rates gdp and components are expressed in real terms figure 2 financial variables sources imf international financial statistics oecd main economic indicators haver analytics refinity datastream and ecb staff calculations notes averages unweighted of bilateral correlations based on quarterly data for 53 countries except for financial conditions whose sample covers 43 countries annual growth rates except for financial conditions levels bond yields refer to long term yields house prices are expressed in real terms while credit measures are nominal moreover the cross country correlation of core inflation and gdp deflator is much lower than for headline inflation in both sample periods confirming that a large share of the co movement in headline inflation can be ascribed to fluctuations in commodity prices another relevant consideration for central banks is at which frequency inflation is measured as stressed by carney 2005 the degree of co movement of inflation across countries tends to rise at lower frequencies which is confirmed by the evidence shown in figure 3 this does not necessarily imply that inflation is itself more driven by global factors over the medium term as it could also be a result of central banks behaving in a more similar way and relying on a similar analytical framework during the great moderation i e a globalisation of central banking indeed in a recent study kamber and wong 2020 claim that global factors play a marginal role in driving trend inflation figure 3 average country pairwise correlation at different frequencies sources imf international financial statistics haver analytics and ecb staff calculations notes averages unweighted of bilateral correlations based on quarterly data for 53 countries over the period 1980q1 2018q4 in terms of monetary policy transmission it is also often argued that globalisation weakens central banks control over domestic financing conditions for example arregui et al 2018 find that global factors account for about 20 to 40 of the variation in countries domestic financial conditions indices consistent with the notion of a global financial cycle rey 2013 however as shown in figure 2 this conclusion mainly stems from co movements in stock prices which are known to be largely driven by co movement in risk premia jorda et al 2017 bond yields on the other hand display lower co movement as do other financial variables in particular those that are known to be the best predictors of crises such as credit and house prices higher trade and financial integration may also increase the international transmission of monetary policy leading to the question of whether major central banks should take monetary policy spillovers into account lane 2019b recent ecb research estimates the international effects of monetary policy shocks in the us and the euro area ca zorzi et al 2020 this paper finds that the spillover effects of monetary policy between the euro area and the united states on output and inflation are small despite notable spillovers from federal reserve monetary policy to euro area financial markets ecb and fed monetary policy shocks have instead larger effects on emerging market economies since the impact on these countries spills back domestically international considerations may matter for central banks out of enlightened self interest caruana 2015 however spill backs are time varying and challenging to measure albeit their importance may have risen with the increasing weight of emerging markets in the global economy globalisation and financial stability in the aftermath of the global financial crisis central banks have been typically assigned a larger role in contributing to financial stability in cooperation with other authorities the ecb for example has been given supervisory and macro prudential powers for euro area banks with the creation of the single supervisory mechanism ssm in 2014 in light of this enhanced role central banks are also evaluating the links between globalisation and financial stability while in theory access to international capital markets should lead to more risk sharing there is a widespread perception particularly after the global financial crisis that globalisation could increase financial stability risks broner and ventura 2011 some economists have even claimed that a financial trilemma exists schoenmaker 2011 with only two of the three objectives of i financial stability ii independent national financial policies and iii cross border financial integration able to be achieved simultaneously the corollary of the financial trilemma is that unless policymakers are prepared to tame globalisation the transfer of greater regulatory and supervision policies away from national institutions becomes a necessity to preserve financial stability while there has been progress in the coordination and regulatory policies in international fora such as the bis and fsb the quality of financial globalisation is also important for preserving financial stability for example equity rather than debt integration may reduce the domestic cost of crises as losses are partly borne by foreign investors lane 2019a another strand of the literature has explored more directly the link between globalisation and financial crises even if crises are best predicted by credit booms schularick and taylor 2012 which are to a large extent domestic more recent evidence suggests that some banking crises also have an important global dimension for example cesa bianchi et al 2019 argue that foreign credit growth has a large positive effect on the probability of domestic banking crises even when controlling for domestic credit growth this does not imply however that domestic financial stability is at the mercy of international factors recent ecb research has shown that the contribution of foreign credit growth to the probability of domestic crises can be mitigated by using macro prudential policy tools beck et al 2020 overall there is an increased consensus that greater reliance on macro prudential tools helps insulating countries from foreign shocks the optimal design of monetary and macro prudential policies in response to sizeable capital inflows remains however a major challenge especially for emerging economies 3 more research is also needed to understand how macro prudential policies may redirect capital flows to other destination countries forbes et al 2016 other challenges moving beyond the concerns related to the maintenance of price and financial stability globalisation influences central banks in subtler and more indirect ways we briefly touch upon five dimensions in particular first protectionist pressures may have significant repercussions on the global economic outlook and pose a direct challenge for central banks in the near term to the extent that for example tariff increases represent negative supply shocks they create an unfavourable trade off for monetary policy ecb 2019 however this trade off is weakened when the central bank credibly commits to its price stability objective cœuré 2013 second the activities of multinational companies and financial centres are profoundly changing the nature of global financial integration and in particular the quality of economic statistics that are essential for central bank analysis such as the assessment of external exposures 4 third central banks are also subject to enhanced international competition and possible disruption from digitalisation the possible emergence of competing forms of money through digital innovations at the global level have been a wake up call for central banks to promote faster more reliable and less costly payment systems and to reassess the benefits and costs of issuing central bank digital currencies boar at al 2020 fourth the anti globalisation backlash more than globalisation itself has challenged the consensus in favour of central bank independence goodhart and lastra 2018 recent empirical evidence for developing countries also supports the notion that there may be a negative link between the rise in national identity politics and the acceptance of central bank independence agur 2018 5 finally climate change which can be seen as partly fostered by globalisation is perhaps the key global challenge of our time although central banks are certainly not at the forefront of the global effort to fight climate change they have to deal with its consequences for price and financial stability as well as facilitate the transition led by other policymakers to a low carbon economy overall central banks are far from immune from the forces of globalisation and have an interest that the responsible policymakers properly manage its evolution and make it sustainable and equitable on their side central banks should continue to evolve and reassess their role and instruments in a changing world as

the mad rush to electric vehicles by duggan flanakin tesla s stock market value is already bigger than ford and general motors combined says a report in forbes magazine elon musk s company had already received nearly 5 billion in federal subsidies by 2015 helping him amass a net worth of 31 billion who says government cannot make anyone rich but hold on an ascendant bernie sanders has called for a massive expansion of government run electricity production he claims to be no friend of billionaires and is running against multiple billionaires including two democrat candidates and 23 contributors to mayor pete s campaign but he sure is helping the rich sanders and many other politicos have championed a multi state effort to end the sale of vehicles with internal combustion ic engines so have several european nations related goals include phasing out coal oil and natural gas for heating electric power generation and other uses as politico reports a major part of sanders 16 trillion greener new deal allocates massive new funding for the four existing power marketing administrations that are overseen by the department of energy tennessee valley authority and a new federal agency the money would go to vastly expand their solar wind and even geothermal power production matt palumbo writing in the bongino report says the sanders plan will need 2 trillion just for infrastructure dwarfing the cost of the interstate highway system to add 800 gigawatts of intermittent weather dependent wind and solar energy right now sanders insists that he is not nationalizing energy production but merely providing wholesale energy to public and private local suppliers however these subsidized government run facilities will surely control the energy market that looks like nationalization in all but official nomenclature private companies that now rely on coal or natural gas will be further squeezed by mandated deep cuts in co2 emissions meanwhile energy demand for a mandated and growing fleet of electric vehicles will soar requiring still more wind turbines solar panels backup batteries transmission lines and as i note in a recent article about electric buses metals minerals and mining demands on unprecedented scales â coupled with rampant environmental destruction child labor and horrific increases in cancer and other diseases from the absence of workplace safety and pollution control standards americans have expressed great displeasure over subsidizing evs for the wealthy a recent american energy alliance poll found only one in five voters would trust the federal government to make decisions about what kinds of cars should be subsidized â or mandated many do not even like or cannot afford the innovations already introduced for internal combustion vehicles as evidenced by data showing that the average age of the u s vehicle fleet has increased in recent years who can blame them for being angry wealthy ev buyers can get 7500 federal and up to 2500 state tax credits not just deductions free or low cost charging at stations installed at taxpayer and electricity consumer cost and access to hov lanes even with no passengers ev drivers pay no gasoline tax and thus pay nothing for road construction repair and maintenance and as states go green and eliminate fossil fuel and nuclear power average americans will have to endure the eyesores noise habitat destruction and wildlife losses that will come with millions more wind turbines and solar panels nevertheless despite public qualms most automakers have joined the ev movement like gossip in a small town proposals and promises to ban or end production of ic engines have spread like wildfire the chinese owned swedish automaker volvo announced in 2017 it would stop designing new ic engines german giant daimler mercedes benz followed suit last year and in the united states general motors in 2018 announced plans to offer only battery powered or hydrogen powered vehicles in the near future these automakers are perhaps just responding to the political climate in europe the united kingdom just moved up its cutoff date for banning sales of new ic vehicles to 2035 the uk ban would even include hybrids france and other countries are holding to a 2040 date for mandating all electric fleets while norway has set a goal not a mandate to eliminate most ic engines but not hybrids by 2025 but amazingly california lawmakers actually killed a 2018 effort to ban ic engines by 2040 meanwhile european automakers have moved to profit from ev charging stations ionity created in 2017 as a joint venture between the bmw group mercedes benz ag the ford motor company and the volkswagen group with audi and porcshe has already built over 200 facilities with over 860 charging points it plans to expand to 400 facilities in 24 countries by yearend 2020 and ionity is not alone europe today still has over 100 000 petrol and diesel fueling stations certain to shrink as ic engines are now pariahs but how do europeans plan to charge all the electric cars trucks and buses if they must rely entirely on intermittent unreliable weather dependent super expensive wind and solar electricity before february 2020 ionity was charging a flat fixed rate of eight euros about 8 87 for a fast charging session that was less than 15 cents per kilowatt hour for a 60 kw charge that might be good for 210 miles â on a continent where electricity prices are already 25 to 45 cents per kwh with eu gasoline prices ranging from 1 77 euros liter 7 35 per gallon in the netherlands to 4 41 gallon in romania drivers would need about 31 in romania or 51 in the netherlands to drive the same distance assuming 30 mpg even at these incredible and unsustainable bargain basement electricity prices but as of february 1 ionity switched to unit pricing at a rate of 0 79 euro kwh 88 cents kwh or about 52 80 for a 60 kw charge that s a 500 increase in the cost of charging your car just to travel a couple hundred miles suddenly an ev charge is a whole lot more expensive than a fill up so ionity is offering discounts that customers can purchase from ionity partner companies at home chargers in the eu cost about 18 per 60 kw charge plus about 1 000 for installation that s at the average eu residential rate of 30 cents kwh twice the current u s average and that s before the mad rush to electric cars trucks and buses â and the mad rush to expensive renewable energy how will poor and working classes afford this especially people who must drive to work or must use trucks in their small businesses who will subsidize their soaring costs â the eu s increasingly stretched and impoverished middle class its millionaires and billionaires here s the rub for americans if sanders gets his way the federal government will control the price and availability of electricity in the usa california which wants to mandate evs only has already faced multi day electricity blackouts due to fire concerns and if there s no power there s no charging many other countries also lack reliable electric power â and increasing electricity scarcity almost certain in a fossil fuel free environment drives up prices even in government controlled marketplaces after the 1970s oil embargo the united states opted for a broad based energy sector so that shortages in one fuel would not cripple the national economy but today many cities have already moved to ban oil coal and natural gas nuclear is still taboo and wind and solar are intermittent the push toward an all electric society â plus heavy and rising burdens on the power grid from intermittent power generations and charging all electric vehicles â looks like a recipe for disaster at least for the average consumer the well connected always do well enough in controlled economies â at least until government policies send energy prices soaring and send angry poor and working class protesters into the streets to rage and rampage as has happened in iran france and chile but what can a we the governed do but submit to the will of the all powerful state envisioned by sanders and his fellow democrat presidential wannabes they re all insulated by their wealth and positions from the impacts of their policies but what about the rest of us state and federal ruling classes might be surprised at how liberty and opportunity loving americans respond duggan flanakin is director of policy research for the committee for a constructive tomorrow cfact

what is a limited government a limited government is one where legalized force is restricted through delegated and enumerated authorities countries with limited governments have fewer laws about what individuals and businesses can and cannot do in many countries a written constitution is used to spell out the powers and limitations of government power the opposite of a limited government is an interventionist or authoritarian government in reality most countries even those with otherwise high degrees of freedom and liberty operate with some amount of government control and intervention key takeaways limited government describes a political system where government bodies are prohibited from certain activities in europe the concept of limited government gained force during the enlightenment but it can be dated back at least to the magna carta 1215 many modern political systems have codified legal rights that cannot be violated by the government police or military in economic policies limited government is frequently associated with the ideas of classical liberalism and laissez faire economics while many theorists support the principle of limited government there are disagreements on how strong those limitations should be investopedia zoe hansen understanding a limited government the theory of limited government can be traced back to the enlightenment philosophers of the 17th century but the idea itself is much older it is also associated with the free market and classical liberalism though politicians and economists differ on the exact limitations that a government should have in its basic form a limited government is one whose main function is the protection of people and their property and it levies just enough taxes to finance services related to these purposes according to this interpretation a limited government might tax the population to pay for police or national defense but it would not concern itself with the beliefs or moral behavior of its citizens another interpretation defines a limited government as one that exercises only the specifically named powers that its constitution assigns to it it can also be characterized by a separation of powers and a system of checks and balances for example the u s government is restricted to exercising the specifically named powers that the constitution assigns to it history of limited governments limited government in its modern conception originated out of the classical liberal tradition in europe this tradition emphasized the rights of the individual in contrast to the monarchies and theocratic governments that dominated europe at that time the magna carta drafted in the year 1215 is one of the earliest written descriptions of a limited government the document limited the reach of the english king s power by giving the country s nobility the rights that they could exercise over the throne however the document only protected a small part of what is today the united kingdom the united states constitution written in 1787 extended the idea of a limited government by separating the powers of state and federal governments it also segmented the federal government into three branches legislative judicial and executive this is intended to make it difficult for any single person or interest group to control the entirety of government power in addition the bill of rights the first 10 amendments to the u s constitution ratified in 1791 enumerates certain prohibitions that apply to the government these rights further limit the federal government by prohibiting certain uses of government power while limited government is frequently associated with the free market the terms are not interchangeable there have been many instances of authoritarian governments that were friendly to business interests limited governments and the economy in economic policy limited governments seek minimal interventions in trade or commercial activity they are often associated with concepts such as laissez faire economics as first delineated in adam smith s 1776 book entitled an inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations in this context the most extreme sort of limited government would be one that lets supply and demand drive the economy the government would not intervene to set prices or influence business activity proponents of this view believe that limited government can facilitate economic growth and prosperity by minimizing restrictions on commercial activity this view later associated with the austrian school of economics holds that government interventions in the economy can distort markets and reduce competition resulting in shortages or high prices critics of this view believe that the government has an obligation to intervene in the economy either to support certain industries or reduce wealth inequality in contemporary economics this view is frequently associated with john maynard keynes who argued that government spending can actually stimulate economic activity problems with limited governments while many contemporary political thinkers agree that government powers should be constrained there is considerable disagreement on the exact limitations that government power should have many critics argue that government has the ability or obligation to solve collective action problems that cannot be solved by market forces alone a common example is the environmental regulations that punish businesses for polluting the air or water although individuals can pursue polluting industries through the court system this solution is out of reach for many potential victims particularly those who are excluded from the legal system instead the environmental protection agency is expected to penalize these industries on behalf of the public another is the protection of key industries many governments use subsidies or tariffs to support domestic agriculture or manufacturing even though prices would be cheaper on the world market although protectionism sometimes works on behalf of political interest groups it can also support industries with a strategic or security value according to this reasoning the cost of supporting these industries is lower than the cost of not having them particularly in the event of a major crisis such as a war or famine limited government vs small government it is also possible for a government to be too small in colloquial usage the phrase limited government is often used interchangeably with small government the idea that governments should impose as few taxes as possible and employ a minimum number of administrators while these ideas are closely connected a small government may not necessarily have the resources to protect public interests for example consider a hypothetical country whose taxes are not high enough to pay administrators a competitive salary in order to make a living some administrators might resort to graft or bribery thereby imposing an even greater economic burden than that of taxation in fact research by the world bank confirms that public sector salaries play a large part in anti corruption measures based on country data the bank concluded that increasing wages could reduce corruption in certain situations when paired with appropriate policies 1625 the phrase limited government appears to have originated during the reign of james vi i king of scotland england and ireland examples of limited governments since 1996 the fraser institute a canadian research and educational organization has produced annual reports ranking countries in terms of how much their policies and institutions are supportive of economic freedom it measures limited government by the size of government top marginal tax rates public spending the legal system protection of property rights judicial independence sound money inflation freedom to trade internationally tariffs trade barriers and regulation of credit markets labor markets and businesses the following rankings come from the fraser institute s 2023 economic freedom of the world index report fraser index which analyzes 165 countries and territories the 2023 rankings are assessed based on 2021 information hong kong technically an autonomous region of china hong kong was nevertheless ranked second in the 2023 fraser index hong kong has always been in the top spot in the fraser index due to favorable taxes freedom to trade internationally and favorable labor and business market regulations hong kong s drop from first to second has to do with the new security law imposed by china in 2021 the government s new laws imposed new and significant barriers to entry limits on the employment of foreign labor and increases in the cost of doing business the decline in hong kong has been larger than the world s average decline honduras although it was ranked 71 in terms of economic freedom the fraser index ranked honduras second in size of government just behind neighboring guatemala honduras had a high score for transfers and subsidies government investment and foreign currency bank accounts balancing out low scores for its legal system new zealand according to the fraser rankings new zealand was the fourth freest economy in the world though it ranked 108 in terms of size of government the country earned high marks for its legal system and property rights sound money and freedom to trade internationally however the country scored lower in size of government largely due to government spending and subsidies how is federalism connected to the idea of limited government federalism refers to a political system that delegates certain powers to local or provincial bodies in a federalist system local governments may have their own legislature courts tax authority and other functions of government in some cases they may also have the power to secede from the central government how does the constitution reflect the principle of limited government in the united states the constitution divides the government into three separate branches with separate powers and constraints all three must work together to enact new policies and laws at the time the constitution was written it was considered unlikely that any one person or faction could control all three branches therefore this separation was considered a way of preventing government overreach who came up with the idea of limited government while the concept of limited government dates back to the magna carta the idea was further developed by enlightenment thinkers in the 17th and 18th centuries the idea that government power requires the consent of the governed originates from john locke the concept of separating the government into three branches is attributed to baron de montesquieu and the idea that the government should avoid intervening in commerce is frequently attributed to adam smith many of these ideas were later integrated into the american and french revolutions which countries have the highest degree of limited government according to the annual human freedom index report for 2023 co published by the cato institute and the fraser institute the highest scoring country in terms of limited government was switzerland the top 10 included switzerland new zealand denmark ireland estonia sweden iceland luxembourg finland norway the bottom line the concept of limited government holds that there should be legal constraints on the power of political authorities especially with respect to individual rights the concept is also important in economic

the novel coronavirus has changed the optimism on china s economy seen at the beginning of this year into nervousness now the whole country is mobilized to fight the covid 19 epidemic and china s financial markets are not exempted stock bond foreign exchange or fx and commodity markets all re opened on feb 3 which showed confidence in the leadership and enabled those who need liquidity to sell their positions for cash in particular as bond and fx are over the counter markets that require market making the trading volume of both markets recovered only slowly this was true even during the second week after the chinese new year holiday as many traders are still in quarantine at home or are required to do remote work based in beijing i fully understand the difficulty in finding balance between the reboot of economy and the fight against the virus however a lower volume does not mean a quiet market for china rates a strong risk off sentiment combined with a concern about the economic impact pushed 10 year china government bond yield from 3 10 percent down to 2 80 percent a level last seen in 2016 even the escalation of the trade tension between china and the united states did not lead to such a big move however the chinese yuan in the fx markets largely remained stable with the dollar yuan rate fluctuating around 7 0 which is far from the 7 2 peak reached last year investors maintained a clear mind without any panic as the number 7 0 is no longer magic the people s bank of china the central bank had successfully made the market to go through this level last year in renminbi fx options market the implied volatility has stayed at a level similar to that in november 2019 far below the level in august 2019 when the dollar yuan rate broke 7 0 this shows that investors are not convinced to buy insurance at a high price to protect themselves from large movements such a stability in rmb fx shows that the market is very satisfied with the recent reforms in rmb fx both buyers and sellers of rmb have many arguments to support their view and the market is overall balanced it also shows that rmb itself is no longer a weak currency that depreciates significantly when a large negative shock hits the country in contrast rmb is traded as a hard currency that is driven by balanced demand and supply plus the deep integration of china into the world economy also supports rmb fx china is not only an exporter but an important buyer of energy and services the covid 19 outbreak sent the oil price down by more than 20 percent which implies less overall spending on crude oil import due to both a lower price and a weaker demand plus chinese travelers largely canceled their overseas trips so the demand for foreign currencies is also weaker due to weaker tourism spending in fact the above two points are often mentioned by investors as reasons to go long on rmb rather than short it the stability of rmb fx also implies that for global investors the impact of the virus will be limited and temporary so there is no reason to have a run on rmb fx or any concern about capital controls investors are comforted by the responsiveness of the chinese authorities companies and individuals many industries including energy and commodity production are largely intact and the recovery of production tends to be very rapid for manufacturing and exporting industries plus given the china us phase 1 trade deal and global risk on sentiment the external environment is positive for china economic indicators in many countries have been recovering recently and global trade has been re energized therefore chinese manufacturers may generate higher revenue as long as they can return to full function after three rate cuts by the federal reserve and a reflation of its balance sheet the abundant and cheap global funding is also helpful for china s credit and liquidity condition in addition the domestic monetary policy reacted swiftly with the central bank cutting 10 basis points on its reverse repurchase operation on feb 3 such a stance is very different from the experience of 2019 when the central bank remained reserved until a clear signal of the china us phase 1 trade deal in november despite both economic and financial pressures in retrospect the slightly hawkish stance secured more policy room for this year such a 10 bp cut may be the beginning of a series of small rate cuts in 2020 in our view on thursday china s central bank cut the one year loan prime rate or lpr the new benchmark for commercial bank loans to the corporates and households by 0 1 percentage point to 4 05 percent lpr may decline significantly this year so as to support the economy and attract more borrowers to convert their outstanding old benchmark based loans into lpr based loans for the rest of this year we expect that china will return to its growth potential with new focus areas the shock of the virus has been a stress test for china s financial system which it appears to have passed with an outstanding performance so far the focus of policymakers is on supporting economy rather than preserving financial stability which is a big leap from 2015 16 when china experienced several crashes in the stock market and challenges in the fx market this resilience will attract more overseas investors to participate in china s financial markets not only bond and fx but equity and commodity the writer heads foreign exchange and local market strategy for global markets china bnp paribas

ethiopia s economic growth hovered between 8 11 for over 10 years but its sovereign credit rating has not been upgraded eric lafforgue art in all of us corbis via getty images there is renewed concern about the sustainability of rising debt levels in many african countries much of this debt is being incurred through foreign currency denominated eurobonds issued on international financial markets the total value of eurobonds issued between 2018 and 2019 was more than the value of all bonds sold between 2003 to 2016 african governments are issuing and listing their eurobonds on established international debt markets usually london and irish stock exchanges african governments would venture offshore a lot less if domestic bond markets were active and liquid but besides south africa african bond markets are largely underdeveloped with inactive and illiquid secondary markets this makes it difficult to attract international investor participation locally the international monetary fund imf believes that african countries are on a eurobond issuing spree and half of them are near or at distressed levels it argues that african governments are piling on debt without evaluating the exchange rate risks and the real costs of repaying the debts but in my view the debt alarm being set off by international debt management organisations is exaggerated the problem is not that african countries are borrowing too much but rather they are paying too much interest there are a number of reasons for this including badly informed ratings by rating agencies as well as the behaviour of issuers there are solutions but these require african governments to stand up and take action doing the calculations there are two key elements that are taken into account in assessing a country s debt burden one is the level of debt based on the ratio of debt to gross domestic product gdp the other is the cost of servicing the debt interest payments debt levels on the continent for example are on average way below the 100 debt to gdp ratio mark but the impression created is that they are much higher this exaggerated perception of african debt levels has resulted in countries paying higher interest rates on debt the premiums are much higher than those paid by other countries in my view these are not justified by the risk profile of african countries save for four countries cape verde djibouti congo and mozambique all the other african countries have debt to gdp ratio averaging 60 a debt to gdp ratio of 60 is the imf s and african monetary co operation program s threshold for prudent debt levels the scale of debt issuances in africa amounts to only 1 of the continent s total gdp annually whose average annual growth rate is 4 in simple terms this means the value of income generation is higher than the rate of government debt accumulation these ratios gives a snapshot of the a country s fiscal sustainability on the contrary the amount of interest expenditure has been disproportionate to the debt to gdp ratio studies show that in developed economies an increase of 1 in debt to gdp ratio is associated with an increase of between 0 02 and 0 03 in interest rates african governments are paying interest of 5 to 16 on 10 year government bonds compared to near zero to negative rates in europe and america on average the interest repayment is the highest expenditure portion and remains the fastest growth expenditure in sub saharan africa s fiscal budgets the rising interest rates on africa s debt should be of major concern african countries are shortchanging themselves by accepting high yield curves in their eurobond initial public offerings this unjustifiably cements the perception that they are high risk issuers the drivers the high interest rates are driven by several key factors first the mismatch between the short term duration of the debt that african governments have taken on by issuing eurobonds compared to the long term nature of the infrastructure projects they propose to fund with the money raised through eurobonds the excessive need to attract investors is forcing african governments to borrow short term to finance long term projects second fungibility of eurobonds proceeds flexibility to be utilised for purposes other than the ones they were raise for exposes the funds to the downside vulnerabilities of misappropriation and nonproductive expenditures third poor credit ratings as the majority of countries are in junk status credit ratings are pivotal in determination of both interest rates and the demand for bonds the weaknesses of rating agencies risk assessments have widely been criticised according to sovereign credit methodologies of the big three rating agencies economic growth is a decisive factor in past sovereign credit events there is a strong positive correlation between economic strength and credit worthiness but in africa high economic growth has not translated into better sovereign ratings despite consistent positive economic growth averaging 3 6 among 32 rated african states data show that the number of downgrades and negative outlooks are almost double that of upgrades and positive outlooks this implies that african countries are now worse off than they previously were this overlooks the continent s significant progress in governance economic growth and human development over the past years take ethiopia it has a current economic growth of 8 5 and has been hovering between 8 11 for over 10 years but it has not had a single upgrade activity from any of the three international rating agencies senegal one of africa s most stable countries experiencing three peaceful political transitions since its independence in 1960 has maintained an economic growth averaging 6 over the past 10 years it still remains in junk status rating some of what drives higher interest rates also rests with africa governments for example a lack of sufficient information about the specific use of proceeds in prospectuses during eurobond initial public offerings is magnifying the risk of fiscal indiscipline it means that funds have no conditionalities or any lines of accountability it is also the case that governments use the money they raise on loss making projects and nonproductive fiscal expenditure two examples illustrate the point the failing kuraz mega sugar project in ethiopia was funded from the 2014 eurobond as was the kenyan standard gauge railway sgr which is failing to stimulate any new economic activity solutions african countries can act to address the rising interest burden and to avert falling into a debt trap through the following mechanisms governments should use the money raised to fund profitable projects and use the profits from these projects to repay interest owed governments must take control of the bond issuance process during the bond structuring stage they must exercise their choice of accepting or rejecting investors bids it is imperative for african countries to structure bonds with favourable yields and tenure this process should not be entirely renounced to syndicates of lead managers originators and investment banks the oversubscription of recent eurobond issues eurobond issuances have been oversubscribed by three times on average simply shows that demand is outweighing supply countries should manage lead issuance advisors to negotiate for the lowest interests possible to be saved from unnecessary costs governments should bargain for competitive interest rates and accept only favourable bids governments should borrow for productive expenditure and manage proceeds from international bonds more prudently with integrity and transparency african countries should establish a continental position adopt international standards and guidelines to establish lines of accountability in rating agencies this will create a platform to enforce adherence to scientific rating methodology rating appeals regulating rating agencies and sufficient involvement of rated countries in the rating process misheck mutize lecturer of finance graduate school of business gsb university

by accusing china or any other country of currency manipulation trump administration is effectively demanding that the chinese appreciate their currency that is make each renminbi cost more in dollars washington dc would you believe the following story if you heard it imagine a small rural town with one general store that sells to and buys from the farmers living in the surrounding area owing to their large families the farmers have been running up a tab at the store and they now owe the store a great deal of money so they organize a protest to demand that the store raise its prices on seed fertilizer and the like while reducing the price it will pay for the farmers grains obviously the scenario is absurd paying even higher prices for agricultural supplies and receiving less for what they produce will not help the farmers pay off their tab indeed either change would probably result in higher profits for the store and greater losses for the farmers and their families in this nonsensical parable us president donald trump s administration represents the farmers by accusing china or any other country of currency manipulation the administration is effectively demanding that the chinese appreciate their currency that is make each renminbi cost more in dollars to be sure many politicians over the years have argued that china and other developing and emerging economies manipulate their currency to gain a competitive edge by reducing the purchasing power of their own currencies they can make their exports cost less to foreign buyers while rendering imports more expensive to domestic buyers to account for such concerns the united states has a law mandating that the department of the treasury prepare a biannual report for congress specifying whether any currencies are being manipulated if the treasury does so specify the administration is then expected to carry on talks with the accused country but even then the law mandates no penalties congress has established three criteria to determine whether manipulation has occurred the offending country must have a current account surplus above three percent of gdp it must have intervened in the foreign exchange market to make its currency cheaper and it must have a bilateral surplus with the us in excess of 20 billion in august 2019 china s current account surplus fell below three percent of gdp and the chinese government had previously been intervening not to devalue the renminbi but rather to prevent further depreciation following trump s threats of additional tariffs in the event the us declared china a currency manipulator anyway only to remove the designation as a part of the phase one trade deal agreed in january but in the meantime the trump administration has discovered a new tool with which to bludgeon foreign competitors the department of commerce this month issued a rule that allows for additional levies on imports from countries deemed to be currency manipulators with the percentage increase in the tariff in addition to the statutory tariff and the antidumping or countervailing duty margin being equal to the estimated percentage by which the currency is deemed undervalued worse under the new rule there is no legal process that the department must follow when determining whether manipulation has occurred accordingly an american company that believes it is losing sales to a foreign company may now appeal to the commerce department and the international trade administration for special treatment even if a profitable german exporter charges the same prices for the goods it sells domestically as it does for the goods it sells in the us an american firm can demand additional levies by citing currency manipulation and if no us firm acts the commerce department can simply initiate such appeals on its own the us has long had one of the world s strongest economies owing in no small part to its respect for the rule of law and its efforts to maintain a level playing field for competition both foreign and domestic within the us market given this tradition it is puzzling that so many american politicians and businessmen are now terrified of other countries economic strengths true the us has also long championed extraordinarily loose criteria to justify anti dumping measures and countervailing duties and it has secured rules and procedures for determining such offenses within the world trade organization but a finding of currency manipulation has never been among the relevant criteria most likely the trump administration s unilateral decision to add currency manipulation to the list will be contested in court and at the wto more broadly the trump administration s currency politics will be felt everywhere trump has complained that both argentina and brazil are manipulating their currencies even though those countries exchange rate depreciation is obviously a response to high inflation the international monetary fund and others have recommended that both pursue devaluation in order to restore macroeconomic balance meanwhile trump continues to call on the us federal reserve to lower interest rates and ease its monetary policy so that the dollar will depreciate apparently the us is free to manipulate its currency just so long as no one else does anne o krueger a former world bank chief economist and former first deputy

issuing and listing their eurobonds on established international debt markets usually london and irish stock exchanges african governments would venture offshore a lot less if domestic bond markets were active and liquid but besides south africa african bond markets are largely underdeveloped with inactive and illiquid secondary markets this makes it difficult to attract international investor participation locally the international monetary fund imf believes that african countries are on a eurobond issuing spree and half of them are near or at distressed levels it argues that african governments are piling on debt without evaluating the exchange rate risks and the real costs of repaying the debts but in my view the debt alarm being set off by international debt management organisations is exaggerated the problem is not that african countries are borrowing too much but rather they are paying too much interest there are a number of reasons for this including badly informed ratings by rating agencies as well as the behaviour of issuers there are solutions but these require african governments to stand up and take action doing the calculations there are two key elements that are taken into account in assessing a country s debt burden one is the level of debt based on the ratio of debt to gross domestic product gdp the other is the cost of servicing the debt interest payments debt levels on the continent for example are on average way below the 100 debt to gdp ratio mark but the impression created is that they are much higher this exaggerated perception of african debt levels has resulted in countries paying higher interest rates on debt the premiums are much higher than those paid by other countries in my view these are not justified by the risk profile of african countries save for four countries cape verde djibouti congo and mozambique all the other african countries have debt to gdp ratio averaging 60 a debt to gdp ratio of 60 is the imf s and african monetary co operation program s threshold for prudent debt levels the scale of debt issuances in africa amounts to only 1 of the continent s total gdp annually whose average annual growth rate is 4 in simple terms this means the value of income generation is higher than the rate of government debt accumulation these ratios gives a snapshot of the a country s fiscal sustainability on the contrary the amount of interest expenditure has been disproportionate to the debt to gdp ratio studies show that in developed economies an increase of 1 in debt to gdp ratio is associated with an increase of between 0 02 and 0 03 in interest rates african governments are paying interest of 5 to 16 on 10 year government bonds compared to near zero to negative rates in europe and america on average the interest repayment is the highest expenditure portion and remains the fastest growth expenditure in sub saharan africa s fiscal budgets the rising interest rates on africa s debt should be of major concern african countries are shortchanging themselves by accepting high yield curves in their eurobond initial public offerings this unjustifiably cements the perception that they are high risk issuers the drivers the high interest rates are driven by several key factors first the mismatch between the short term duration of the debt that african governments have taken on by issuing eurobonds compared to the long term nature of the infrastructure projects they propose to fund with the money raised through eurobonds the excessive need to attract investors is forcing african governments to borrow short term to finance long term projects second fungibility of eurobonds proceeds flexibility to be utilised for purposes other than the ones they were raise for exposes the funds to the downside vulnerabilities of misappropriation and nonproductive expenditures third poor credit ratings as the majority of countries are in junk status credit ratings are pivotal in determination of both interest rates and the demand for bonds the weaknesses of rating agencies risk assessments have widely been criticised according to sovereign credit methodologies of the big three rating agencies economic growth is a decisive factor in past sovereign credit events there is a strong positive correlation between economic strength and credit worthiness but in africa high economic growth has not translated into better sovereign ratings despite consistent positive economic growth averaging 3 6 among 32 rated african states data show that the number of downgrades and negative outlooks are almost double that of upgrades and positive outlooks this implies that african countries are now worse off than they previously were this overlooks the continent s significant progress in governance economic growth and human development over the past years take ethiopia it has a current economic growth of 8 5 and has been hovering between 8 11 for over 10 years but it has not had a single upgrade activity from any of the three international rating agencies senegal one of africa s most stable countries experiencing three peaceful political transitions since its independence in 1960 has maintained an economic growth averaging 6 over the past 10 years it still remains in junk status rating some of what drives higher interest rates also rests with africa governments for example a lack of sufficient information about the specific use of proceeds in prospectuses during eurobond initial public offerings is magnifying the risk of fiscal indiscipline it means that funds have no conditionalities or any lines of accountability it is also the case that governments use the money they raise on loss making projects and nonproductive fiscal expenditure two examples illustrate the point the failing kuraz mega sugar project in ethiopia was funded from the 2014 eurobond as was the kenyan standard gauge railway sgr which is failing to stimulate any new economic activity solutions african countries can act to address the rising interest burden and to avert falling into a debt trap through the following mechanisms governments should use the money raised to fund profitable projects and use the profits from these projects to repay interest owed governments must take control of the bond issuance process during the bond structuring stage they must exercise their choice of accepting or rejecting investors bids it is imperative for african countries to structure bonds with favourable yields and tenure this process should not be entirely renounced to syndicates of lead managers originators and investment banks the oversubscription of recent eurobond issues eurobond issuances have been oversubscribed by three times on average simply shows that demand is outweighing supply countries should manage lead issuance advisors to negotiate for the lowest interests possible to be saved from unnecessary costs governments should bargain for competitive interest rates and accept only favourable bids governments should borrow for productive expenditure and manage proceeds from international bonds more prudently with integrity and transparency african countries should establish a continental position adopt international standards and guidelines to establish lines of accountability in rating agencies this will create a platform to enforce adherence to scientific rating methodology rating appeals regulating rating agencies and sufficient involvement of rated countries in the rating process misheck mutize lecturer of finance graduate school of

the issue in june 2020 the united kingdom will host a pledging conference at which gavi the vaccine alliance will seek funding to support an ambitious work plan for 2021 2025 gavi is seeking at least 7 4 billion to reach its goal of delivering more than 3 2 billion doses of routine immunizations to children and families while continuing to fund emergency vaccine stockpiles and support the delivery of the inactivated polio vaccine in eligible countries the united states one of the top donors to gavi has supported the alliance s efforts since its inception 20 years ago and made annual commitments of 290 million in fy 2018 and 2019 in promoting health security contributing to economic development and engaging implementing countries and the private sector in the move toward fully self financed immunization programs gavi s work is closely aligned with u s interests the united states has recently announced a commitment of 1 16 billion to gavi over four years essentially sustaining the annual commitments of 290 million through fy 2023 this sends a strong message to other donors as well as eligible countries that the united states remains confident in gavi s ability to deliver results to reinforce its support the united states should also 1 encourage other donor countries to sustain or even increase their support for gavi over a multi year period 2 identify opportunities to strengthen bilateral engagement on immunization programs advocacy activities and the mobilization of domestic resources for vaccines in priority countries and 3 continue to support gavi as it navigates the challenges to immunization programs posed by demographic change urbanization conflict and migration over the 2021 2025 period and beyond this video serves as a companion to the full brief explaining how gavi works and how u s support for gavi in 2020 and beyond helps protect the health of future generations in the united states and around the world introduction recent decades have seen enormous progress in getting lifesaving vaccines to children in the world s poorest and most remote settings from 1980 to 2012 the percentage of children worldwide receiving the recommended three doses of diphtheria tetanus and pertussis dtp3 vaccine a key indicator of immunization system reach and quality rose from 47 percent to 89 percent 1 yet in some countries immunization coverage has stagnated or even declined in recent years and some communities have never had access to vaccines at all in 2018 20 million infants worldwide did not receive any doses of dtp3 vaccine 2 several factors affect immunization coverage at the national and local levels persistent high fertility in some settings means an ever greater cohort of babies who must be immunized each year urbanization and migration as well as intensifying cycles of natural disasters can make it difficult to locate and reach the most vulnerable populations conflicts and emergencies including outbreaks and other health crises can threaten the financial stability and quality of immunization programs and undermine community trust in the health sector in this context sustaining progress while working to reach a growing number of never immunized children with an increasing number of available vaccines is a significant challenge and one that gavi the vaccine alliance will seek to address over the next five years with renewed donor support gavi at 20 a mature investment in january 2020 gavi celebrated its twentieth anniversary at the world economic forum wef in davos where the alliance was launched two decades ago since its inception gavi has proven to be a high impact and resilient public private partnership involving donor countries implementing countries the private sector and civil society organizations in the effort to make vaccines available to children in the world s lowest income settings gavi achieves this in large part by helping governments procure vaccines at very low cost having mobilized nearly 21 billion in funds between 2000 and 2019 it has supported the immunization of more than 760 million children and made available to them some of the newest and most costly vaccines many of which might not have otherwise reached those populations for 30 years or more in 2019 gavi estimated that it facilitated the purchase and delivery of vaccines to nearly 50 percent of the world s children 3 since its inception in 2000 gavi has grown to support the introduction of vaccines against 17 different infectious diseases to carry out this work gavi has built an alliance that draws on its network of partners including the world bank world health organization who and unicef country offices as well as host governments bilateral donors private sector organizations and civil society groups it requires even the poorest implementing countries to co finance vaccines procured with gavi support as a means of building sustainable budgets for immunization programs over the long term gavi also provides technical assistance to help eligible countries strengthen and better integrate immunization programs into routine health services 4 in the early years gavi was hosted by unicef and located at that agency s campus in geneva but the organization became an independent international institution under swiss law in 2009 5 in 2018 gavi relocated to the geneva global health campus and is now housed in a building with other high profile public private health partnerships including the global fund to fight aids tuberculosis and malaria unitaid roll back malaria and the stop tb partnership 6 gavi s internationally recognized management practices help it realize an ambitious set of goals in 2008 gavi was a founding member of the international aid transparency initiative iati and in 2012 it was lauded for its commitment to transparency and accountability by the publish what you fund index 7 gavi continues to make external evaluations of its programs and materials from its board meetings publicly available through its website and its most recent financial report shows that overhead expenses for management and fundraising were just 2 53 percent of the organization s total budget in 2018 8 that year gavi was also certified by the equal salary foundation as an equal salary gender employer making gavi the first international not for profit organization to commit to equal pay for men and women 9 in september 2019 gavi was also recognized for its efforts to improve health and well being in the world s poorest countries with the prestigious lasker bloomberg public service award 10 over time the gavi approach has evolved in important ways with the alliance demonstrating a consistent ability to adapt to changing global circumstances for the first five years eligible countries were defined as those with an annual gross national income gni per capita of 1 000 or less with 74 countries initially qualifying for support in 2009 gavi adopted a graduation policy to chart a path away from assistance for countries that were developing economically and moving from being classified as low income under world bank criteria to lower middle income recognizing the struggles that even countries on the cusp of lower middle income status were facing as they sought to secure vaccines for their populations gavi raised the eligibility threshold in 2011 to an annual gni per capita of 1 500 the eligibility threshold now takes inflation into account and is updated on a yearly basis countries with a three year average annual gni per capita of 1 630 or less are currently eligible to apply for gavi assistance 11 to reinforce assistance for countries as they move beyond eligibility gavi adopted a new transition policy in 2015 to more clearly articulate the stages through which lower income countries must pass as they progress toward fully self financing national immunization programs using the three year average of gni per capita as the reference for eligibility gavi now classifies countries as initial self financing in preparatory transition or in accelerated transition in the initial self financing phase countries pay 0 20 per dose of vaccine as a country s annual gni per capita increases it enters the preparatory transition phase and as it approaches the eligibility threshold it moves to the accelerated transition phase during the latter countries remain eligible for support to procure and introduce new vaccines but as their economies grow they must co finance a greater percentage of each vaccine dose 12 the multi phase transition process introduced in 2015 represented an important step in enabling gavi countries to move toward fully self financing vaccine purchases but it neglected to take the potential for a country to experience economic instability into account in 2017 gavi further refined its transition policy acknowledging the potential for a country to experience a sharp economic downturn ideally over the five year accelerated transition process countries assume 20 percent more financing responsibility each year so that by the end they are paying the full cost for the vaccines initially procured with gavi assistance however countries may regain eligibility for support if their annual gni per capita dips below the threshold 13 in rare cases the gavi board has approved a multi year extension to the time a country will spend in the accelerated transition phase this was the case for papua new guinea which was expected to transition out of support by the end of 2020 thanks to rapid economic growth fueled by mining and extractive industries but because it has low vaccine coverage has experienced recent outbreaks of polio and measles and has high rates of child mortality the country now has until 2025 to complete the transition process 14 the commitment by some vaccine manufacturers to extend low prices to fully transitioned countries for a period of time also provides a financial cushion for some governments struggling to fully self finance immunization programs 15 see map on transition over the past two decades many of the countries originally eligible for gavi support have transitioned out of assistance and taken on full financial responsibility for their vaccine programs data reflects country eligibility and transition status as of the end of 2019 armed conflicts and other humanitarian emergencies create conditions of insecurity which affect the health sector and can make it difficult for governments to deliver vaccines through public mechanisms in 2018 unicef reported that many of the nine countries with the lowest dtp3 coverage included countries in crisis or states of fragility such as the central african republic chad somalia south sudan syria and ukraine 16 recognizing these challenges the gavi board approved a new policy on fragility emergencies and refugees in 2018 this framework allows gavi to adjust its support and processes to better meet each country s specific needs working in close collaboration with partners and humanitarian actors 17 the policy recognizes that operating in such insecure settings carries higher financial and security risks than in more stable contexts and it offers gavi the flexibility to work directly with civil society actors in regions of gavi eligible countries where there may be limited official presence 18 to encourage eligible countries to provide immunization services for refugees within their borders the fragility emergencies and refugees policy allows eligible countries a greater range of options for financing the procurement of vaccines for these special populations than would otherwise be allowed it also permits governments hosting refugees to opt not to pay co financing for products offered to migrant populations fleeing disorder in their home countries 19 a newer area of consideration for gavi is the extent to which it may be possible to support middle income countries that have never been eligible for gavi support but which nevertheless struggle to deliver vaccines and maintain high levels of immunization coverage for their populations of the 10 countries that account for 60 percent of un or under immunized children for example brazil and the philippines are classified under world bank criteria as middle income and have never had gavi support angola indonesia and vietnam are also on the list of countries with high numbers of un and under immunized children and have already transitioned away from gavi assistance 20 to address these challenges the gavi board asked the gavi secretariat in 2019 to explore approaches to engaging with self financing lower middle income countries 21 for formerly eligible countries gavi has made a commitment to strengthen post transition coordination to ensure the sustainability of programs previously supported by gavi but for non eligible countries one option under consideration is to identify separate pathways to assistance for two different groups those with an annual gni per capita above the 1 630 threshold but below 4 000 and those with an annual gni per capita between 4 000 and 6 000 without changing the long established gavi eligibility model that prioritizes the lowest income countries the ideas under review could enable gavi to provide technical advice to these more economically developed countries and potentially allow them to benefit from gavi negotiated vaccine prices through an innovative vaccine procurement facility while the gavi board continues to study how the organization can best address the problem of stagnating or declining immunization coverage rates in middle income countries it has allocated up to 3 percent of the planned operating expenses between 2021 2025 to the issue 22 a history of u s support and engagement the united states has supported gavi since the very beginning as of the end of september 2019 u s contributions and pledges to gavi totaled nearly 2 5 billion making the united states one of the top three donors to gavi behind the united kingdom and the bill melinda gates foundation 23 recognizing the effectiveness of gavi programs in getting vaccines to children in low income settings the united states has increased its support over the years with annual commitments of 290 million in 2018 and 2019 reflecting bipartisan commitment to gavi s mission 24 during gavi s 2016 2020 phase of work u s contributions made up 15 4 percent of all direct funding to the organization 25 beyond its financial contributions which flow through maternal and child health accounts at the u s agency for international development usaid the u s government is involved with gavi governance through several different mechanisms it joins australia japan and the republic of korea on one of several seats reserved for donor countries currently the united states is the anchor donor for that constituency and through usaid represents the group on the gavi board the usaid representative has also served on the program and policy committee the market sensitive decisions committee and the audit and finance committee in recent years the u s centers for disease control and prevention cdc currently participates on the gavi board s constituency for research technical health institutes 26 usaid maternal and child health priority countries cdc global immunization priority countries and gavi eligible countries overlap in several regions in usaid and cdc priority countries u s efforts complement gavi assistance through broad support to national immunization programs including routine and supplemental immunization activities through strengthening immunization policy development and by supporting the introduction of new vaccines among other activities the united states also provides technical assistance for outbreak support when countries request it 27 this map shows the overlap between countries that are a priority for immunization programs within the u s government cdc or usaid and those that are eligible for gavi support gavi s work aligns with and reinforces u s global health security goals in several ways immunizations are a key component of the 2019 u s global health security strategy which states that u s agencies will help selected countries strengthen their national immunization systems to improve their response to existing and new infectious disease threats 28 and immunization is one of several key thematic action packages that are part of the global health security agenda with the united states the republic of south korea and the kingdom of saudi arabia serving as financial contributors to the activity 29 gavi s provision of assistance to help countries deliver vaccines within the context of quality health services at the community level helps build local capacity to prevent detect and respond to outbreaks 30 at the same time gavi s management of global stockpiles of cholera meningitis and yellow fever vaccines makes these products available for rapid deployment as soon as they are needed 31 at its december 2019 meeting the gavi board approved a global emergency stockpile of ebola vaccines signaling its continued commitment to supporting efforts to address health emergencies 32 the gavi model is also consistent with u s government development approaches the current framework for u s development assistance the journey to self reliance focuses on empowering host country governments and our partners to achieve locally sustained results helping countries mobilize public and private revenues strengthening local capacities and accelerating enterprise driven development 33 gavi s emphasis on country co financing and a transition to fully self financing national immunization programs complements the u s emphasis on country led advancement at the same time recent research showing that each 1 invested in immunization delivers a return of 54 to the countries including broader societal benefits suggests that the savings that countries realize when they improve vaccine programs may contribute to their longer term economic development 34 finally gavi s comprehensive integration of the private sector into its activities is consistent with u s diplomatic efforts to showcase u s based innovation and entrepreneurship abroad some of gavi s earliest private sector partners included u s based vaccine manufacturers which agreed to lower the prices for their products for the gavi eligible countries given the potential for aggregated demand and a guaranteed market gavi has since integrated medical device manufacturers into its cohort of private sector partners along with providers who can help address bottlenecks to immunization delivery in gavi s work 35 newer partners include u s based mastercard the ups foundation and google org which contribute to gavi by making direct cash contributions or by providing their expertise within the implementing country context 36 gavi s emphasis on incentivizing innovation in the immunization sphere helps introduce u s based approaches to data management service delivery and sustainable business practices overseas as well gavi s infuse innovation for uptake scale and equity in immunization program for example connects business start ups that have developed products useful for vaccine delivery with well established gavi partners with the goal of helping the new companies bring these promising approaches to scale in gavi eligible countries u s based start ups including zenysis an artificial intelligence company parsyl which promotes supply chain integrity and zipline a battery powered drone delivery service have all been highly engaged with infuse as pacesetters as gavi works to help eligible countries strengthen their immunization systems u s technology engineering and business expertise help them build and sustain progress in the longer term 37 gavi 5 0 a renewed focus on equity last june the gavi board approved a new strategic framework for the next phase of gavi s activities between 2021 and 2025 the board determined that equity and reaching never immunized children and missed communities with vaccines will be a priority during the next phase in so doing the board recognizes that even with great successes in improving access to vaccines worldwide 1 out of every 10 children across the world still does not have access to immunization services while ensuring equitable access to vaccines has been part of gavi s mission since the beginning during the next work phase gavi will place an even stronger emphasis on strengthening primary healthcare systems building and sustaining community demand and using innovation to ensure that immunization services reach the world s most marginalized children 38 reflecting the understanding that access to immunizations and primary health services improves both health security and economic development gavi anticipates that its new work plan will enable it to help provide immunizations for an additional 300 million children and contribute 80 100 billion in economic benefits including savings of over 900 million in vaccine prices during the 2021 2025 period 39 while gavi has had a gender policy in place for more than 10 years the new plan will put a sharper focus on the gender and household dynamics that can determine a child s access to immunizations 40 recognizing that many of the world s zero dose children are missing critical vaccines because of demand related challenges including caregivers poor understanding of the science behind immunizations concerns over vaccine safety and challenges getting to and from health clinics gavi will focus on educating and empowering mothers who it recognizes are often the family decisionmakers when it comes to children s health 41 several new themes and global trends will shape gavi s potential to achieve this ambitious equity agenda over the next five years high fertility and larger birth cohorts in gavi eligible countries have created an expanding population of children who need vaccines each year making the sustainability of immunization coverage in those contexts a persistent challenge urbanization and the growth of informal settlements as well as migration driven by conflict and increasingly climate change can make it difficult for public health officials to locate and track children who need immunizations 42 the promise of new vaccines for malaria and tuberculosis as well as the potential urgency of disseminating new products developed for emerging health security threats such as the novel coronavirus or a pandemic strain of influenza may require tough decisions about additional funding at the same time recent problems with the supply of some products such as the human papillomavirus hpv vaccine and the decision of at least one supplier to suspend production of the pentavalent vaccine because the price dropped too low for it to justify continued production signal the importance of regular check ups on the health of the vaccine marketplace 43 with more than 168 cases of wild polio virus in 2019 and ongoing outbreaks of vaccine derived poliovirus in several countries gavi s work to support global polio eradication efforts will need to accelerate in the next phase gavi has worked with the global polio eradication initiative gpei to support the introduction of the inactivated polio vaccine ipv since 2014 when it was first introduced in nepal as of may 2019 all 73 gavi supported countries had introduced it 44 continued support of the polio initiative is crucial to prevent a reversal of progress made over the three decades since the launch of the gpei in 1988 by working closely with the gpei and the polio oversight board pob which gavi ceo seth berkley joined in 2019 gavi s work can help address the rising number of polio cases and resolve the unfinished business of polio eradication 45 by coordinating more closely with the gpei gavi can integrate data tools and lessons from the decades of work on polio into its efforts to help eligible countries strengthen immunization services what is at stake for the united states in gavi s next strategic period u s priorities on global health security economic development and a strengthened private sector are all well met with the proposed focus of gavi 5 0 the plan s overarching focus on equity is directly related to global health security as it will ensure greater immunization coverage particularly among difficult to reach never immunized populations in this way u s citizens abroad and at home are better protected from vaccine preventable diseases gavi s support for efforts to strengthen the capacity of health workers to deliver immunizations as part of an integrated suite of health services contributes to the quality of primary health care at the local level and helps ensure the success of other u s investments in core areas of maternal and child health hiv tuberculosis and malaria at the same time it strengthens countries outbreak preparedness and response capabilities key elements of the u s global health security strategy in that context gavi s funding for and maintenance of emergency stockpiles of vaccine that can be readily mobilized and deployed in the event of an outbreak is crucial gavi s work also closely aligns with the u s development agenda by helping countries be more self reliant and plan for the requirements of self financing health and social projects indeed gavi estimates that country co financing contributions will rise from 1 6 billion over the 2016 2020 strategic period to 3 6 billion between 2021 and 2025 beyond co financing obligations implementing countries are expected to spend 6 3 billion in domestic financing on service delivery costs over the next phase of work 46 finally gavi s increasing engagement with global polio efforts through supply of ipv and participation on the pob helps protect longstanding u s support for the gpei the united states has been a longtime donor and instrumental partner to the gpei and provides considerable bilateral technical assistance on polio through both the cdc and usaid between 2010 and 2019 annual u s funding for work on global polio efforts rose from 136 million to 235 million 47 having already invested a great deal in the global polio eradication agenda the united states can support gavi in finishing the task recommendations to support gavi s work in the 2021 2025 strategic period the united states should take several steps encourage other donors to sustain or increase funding commitments to gavi over a multi year period the united states has recently pledged 1 16 billion to gavi between fy 2020 and 2023 essentially sustaining its recent annual commitments of 290 million this sends a strong message to other donors as well as eligible countries that the united states remains confident in gavi s ability to deliver results the united states should encourage other longstanding gavi supporters to make strong multi year pledges and work through embassies in emerging markets to encourage first time support at the gavi pledging conference continue to support gavi governance activities the united states should use its roles on the gavi board and sub committees to encourage gavi to continue to address tough issues such as how to support non eligible middle income countries particularly where the united states has historically supported immunization and health initiatives and may be able to share contacts networks and advice 48 through service on gavi s board and sub committees and by working at the country level to support eligible countries engagement with gavi the united states can share its agencies scientific and development expertise and ensure a high return on u s global health investments given the promise of new vaccines on the horizon for malaria tuberculosis and hiv the united states can also support a stronger relationship between gavi and the global fund to fight aids tuberculosis and malaria to make sure new products are made available to the neediest populations should the united states decide to join cepi the public private consortium formed in 2017 to develop and disseminate new vaccines to prevent epidemics in the future continued u s support for gavi will help ensure a ready mechanism for getting those products to the lowest income countries when they are needed 49 redouble bilateral support for immunization programs gavi s model of a geneva based secretariat and no field staff often means reliance on who and unicef country offices to support health ministries in gathering data and crafting proposals for support but depending on the capacity of governments and these multilateral partners to devote resources to preparing for gavi programs the support provided can be uneven in gavi eligible countries where the united states has a strong bilateral presence on maternal and child health usaid and cdc officials should strengthen collaborative efforts with other in country partners to support national immunization programs by offering health ministries technical assistance by strengthening the capacity of civil society groups to advocate for and deliver improved immunization programs and by supporting regular communication between finance and health ministries to fund immunization activities and anticipate the need for increased immunization budgets as the gavi transition process gets underway the united states has supported gavi s vaccine financing market shaping and health systems strengthening since the organization s inception 20 years ago in davos u s annual contributions have risen over time and the united states provided 290 million in 2018 2019 and again in 2020 in promoting health security contributing to economic development and engaging implementing countries and the private sector in the move toward fully self financed immunization programs gavi s work is closely aligned with and supports u s priorities ahead of the 2020 replenishment the united states has made a multi year commitment of at least 290 million per year to gavi by identifying opportunities to strengthen bilateral engagement on immunization programs advocacy activities and the mobilization of domestic resources for vaccines in priority countries the united states can further support gavi as the organization navigates the challenges of reaching the most vulnerable children and families with vaccines in a context of

kareem chehayeb is a lebanese journalist and researcher based in beirut alice welcomed us into her crammed street level apartment right off a narrow street with tangled electricity cables in nabaa a suburb near beirut alongside her daughter and 2 year old grandson she shared their harrowing story of coping as lebanon s economy continues to plummet despite her age early 60s and feeble body madame alice as she introduced herself has found herself working again rummaging through garbage bins in a nearby neighborhood for recyclable cans that she could sell for every week for a few dollars my heart sank into my stomach as i translated her story to a correspondent and crew from an international television news channel though this isn t a new phenomenon in lebanon s plethora of neglected towns and communities families such as this one have dealt a new blow in lebanon s worsening economic crisis advertisement over the past 30 years lebanon has relentlessly tried to maintain an absurd economic system best described as a toxic concoction of sectarianism territorialism and laissez faire capitalism its bloated public sector is used as a tool to win political loyalty and votes with virtually no public spending on public health care education and other necessary social programs though there have been warning signs of economic collapse for the last year a regressive tax on whatsapp last october finally sparked an uprising that has entered its fourth month now the economy is in free fall prices continue to skyrocket and u s dollar shortages have caused import shortages of essential medicines wheat and fuel since last fall lebanese customers at their local banks struggle to withdraw roughly 200 every two weeks the more money you have in your account the higher your withdrawal limit and therein lies the problem the pervasive inequality that this system has propped up for decades unfortunately there is every sign that things could get worse advertisement no longer able to kick the can down the road the lebanese government sent a request for nonbinding technical assistance from the international monetary fund talks started on feb 20 lebanon with one of the highest debt to gdp ratios in the world exceeding 150 percent has to pay a series of eurobonds that add up to 1 2 billion in march however for the first time it may not be able to pay them is this the prelude to an imf bailout perhaps lebanese prime minister hassan diab said painful measures are necessary to salvage the economy echoing the sentiment of his predecessors he is referring to austerity measures additional regressive taxes and additional cuts to public spending the imf concluded following an audit last year that lebanon should among other measures increase its value added tax from 11 percent to 15 or 20 percent end state subsidies on the inefficient electricity company and hike electricity bills and tax fuel at gas stations advertisement given that these reforms are not out of line with the conditions necessary to unlock a hefty 11 1 billion in loans pledged in paris in april 2018 for infrastructure development the government could see this as striking two birds with one stone share this article share what does all this mean for working lebanese people simply put it spells disaster advertisement there s also the question of alleviating lebanon s rampant corruption including black market cash cows such as its informal electricity and water services some make the case that privatization and austerity would at least set lebanon in a positive direction but privatization and corruption are not mutually exclusive in post soviet albania in the 1990s corruption skyrocketed following imf mandated privatization of hundreds of state assets protestors haven t stayed silent while all of this has unfolded one group has even drafted an alternative cabinet policy statement that better reflects the demands of those demonstrating they want a more aggressive pathway to an independent judiciary that can take on corruption a progressive taxation system and the reallocation of wasteful spending toward programs that protect lebanese people while protesters see economic recovery through the lens of protecting the most vulnerable the country s decision makers see economic recovery as protecting themselves but lebanon s elites also cannot tread freely as they once did with citizens now mobilizing within minutes when they feel injustice is brewing advertisement so lebanon s ruling elite is at a crossroads they could pave the way for a future when the elderly such as madame alice can retire gracefully and when the next generation of children such as her grandson can be the masters of their own destiny or they can save themselves and sweep all of the country s socioeconomic problems under the rug business as usual
prime minister shinzo abe s government has transformed japanese monetary and fiscal policy over the last seven years but the abenomics experiment shows that enhancing demand is not enough to boost economic growth when an economy also faces massive supply side constraints tokyo since taking office at the end of 2012 japanese prime minister shinzo abe has transformed the country s macroeconomic management but the abenomics experiment may soon start drawing to a close although abe s term as head of the ruling liberal democratic party does not end until the autumn of 2021 the succession debate has already begun it is therefore an appropriate time to assess the effectiveness of his policies and what might come next the hallmark of abenomics has been aggressive monetary easing under bank of japan governor haruhiko kuroda whom abe appointed in march 2013 kuroda previously one of the leading internationalists at the ministry of finance mof has been instrumental in rapidly expanding the boj s balance sheet to a degree comparable to the boj s american and european counterparts this represents a clear break from the policies of his predecessor masaaki shirakawa who belonged to the boj s mainstream conservative bureaucracy under kuroda s watch japan s average annual inflation between 2013 and 2019 was 1 1 according to the international monetary fund that represented a marked improvement from the previous five years under shirakawa when inflation averaged 0 2 in fact as columbia university s takatoshi ito and takeo hoshi of the university of tokyo argue in their recent book the japanese economy the boj s tight monetary policy before abe took office worsened japan s deflation problems regarding fiscal policy the abe administration under pressure from the mainstream fiscal hawks of the mof raised the consumption tax rate from 5 to 8 in april 2014 in line with a 2012 agreement with the democratic party of japan dpj but the unexpectedly sharp economic slowdown that followed led abe to postpone the next planned hike to 10 from 2015 to 2017 despite objections by mof officials the 10 rate eventually was introduced in october 2019 japan s exceptionally high level of public debt nearly 150 of gdp in 2018 means that any government must consider revenue increasing measures while recognizing that they can be a severe impediment to economic growth fine tuning the size and timing of such measures is therefore critical and it requires a maestro s touch to get it right the abe administration approached last october s consumption tax hike very cautiously implementing it alongside counterbalancing measures such as reduced rates on foodstuffs but that was not enough to offset the tax policy s negative effects strained by the hike as well as by the fallout from typhoon hagibis japan s economy shrank by an annualized rate of 6 3 from the previous quarter in october december 2019 subscribe to ps digital subscribe to ps digital access every new ps commentary our entire on point suite of subscriber exclusive content including longer reads insider interviews big picture big question and say more and the full ps archive subscribe now the longer term effects of that contraction which may be aggravated by the covid 19 outbreak remain to be seen nonetheless the abe administration has prevailed over japan s powerful policy establishment at the mof and boj not least because of the shift of political power to the kantei the name of the prime minister s official residence and the composition of abe s team current and former government officials from outside the mainstream elite bureaucracy moreover abe was greatly helped by the lack of effective opposition in the diet as widespread disappointment with the previous dpj led administration enabled him to win one election after another but now although japan s avoidance of deflation in recent years was no mean achievement abe s successor will face two big challenges the first is to boost economic growth an area where abenomics has underperformed while monetary and fiscal policies have strengthened japan s insufficient aggregate demand average annual 1 1 growth under abe demonstrates that this alone is not sufficient in particular japan must implement supply side policies that enhance productivity boj estimates of potential growth rates between 2013 and 2019 show that much of the contribution came from expansion of the country s workforce and capital stock while the contribution of productivity gains has actually declined under abenomics moreover japan needs higher growth to finance its mounting social security costs if pro growth policies remain unfocused the fiscal burden ultimately will destroy the economy the top priority must be to create a vibrant job market and accelerate the economy s shift to more productive sectors the next imperative is bold regulatory reform to encourage new market entrants japan still maintains strict non transparent regulations to protect its old fashioned taxi industry from ride sharing services for example establishing a nurturing environment for start ups that eventually can replace japan s old industrial behemoths is another challenge requiring a new government agency devoted to innovation policymakers also must urgently upgrade the country s education system for the digital age these policies will require political courage to overcome strong vested interests and the wisdom to embrace continuous policy improvement it is a pity that abe did not spend his tremendous political capital on the critical economic agenda with the exception of trade agreements such as the trans pacific partnership his successor will have to make a much stronger long term commitment to pro growth policies the second challenge is to energize the government bureaucracy in sharp contrast to the united states where institutions and experts compete to provide policymaking services japan s bureaucracy is a de facto monopoly supplier following institutional reforms aimed at exerting effective political leadership over the silo minded bureaucracy a central personnel authority controlled by powerful politicians in the cabinet now vets senior japanese civil servants but many critics claim that this system encourages officials to tell politicians only what they want to hear and stifles bottom up initiatives that is too bad because japan urgently needs a new style of policymaking in which well informed open minded civil servants offer expert options for decision makers but returning to traditional seniority based personnel practices within ministerial bureaucracies is not an option instead abe s successor must try to overhaul the bureaucracy by establishing a transparent merit based evaluation and appointment system seven years of abenomics have produced some notable results but japan s next government must focus squarely on the supply side and administrative reforms needed to accelerate and sustain economic growth

but besides south africa african bond markets are largely underdeveloped with inactive and illiquid secondary markets this makes it difficult to attract international investor participation locally the international monetary fund imf believes that african countries are on a eurobond issuing spree and half of them are near or at distressed levels it argues that african governments are piling on debt without evaluating the exchange rate risks and the real costs of repaying the debts but in my view the debt alarm being set off by international debt management organisations is exaggerated the problem is not that african countries are borrowing too much but rather they are paying too much interest there are a number of reasons for this including badly informed ratings by rating agencies as well as the behaviour of issuers there are solutions but these require african governments to stand up and take action doing the calculations there are two key elements that are taken into account in assessing a country s debt burden one is the level of debt based on the ratio of debt to gross domestic product gdp the other is the cost of servicing the debt interest payments debt levels on the continent for example are on average way below the 100 debt to gdp ratio mark but the impression created is that they are much higher this exaggerated perception of african debt levels has resulted in countries paying higher interest rates on debt the premiums are much higher than those paid by other countries in my view these are not justified by the risk profile of african countries save for four countries cape verde djibouti congo and mozambique all the other african countries have debt to gdp ratio averaging 60 a debt to gdp ratio of 60 is the imf s and african monetary co operation program s threshold for prudent debt levels the scale of debt issuances in africa amounts to only 1 of the continent s total gdp annually whose average annual growth rate is 4 in simple terms this means the value of income generation is higher than the rate of government debt accumulation these ratios gives a snapshot of the a country s fiscal sustainability on the contrary the amount of interest expenditure has been disproportionate to the debt to gdp ratio studies show that in developed economies an increase of 1 in debt to gdp ratio is associated with an increase of between 0 02 and 0 03 in interest rates african governments are paying interest of 5 to 16 on 10 year government bonds compared to near zero to negative rates in europe and america on average the interest repayment is the highest expenditure portion and remains the fastest growth expenditure in sub saharan africa s fiscal budgets the rising interest rates on africa s debt should be of major concern african countries are shortchanging themselves by accepting high yield curves in their eurobond initial public offerings this unjustifiably cements the perception that they are high risk issuers the drivers the high interest rates are driven by several key factors first the mismatch between the short term duration of the debt that african governments have taken on by issuing eurobonds compared to the long term nature of the infrastructure projects they propose to fund with the money raised through eurobonds the excessive need to attract investors is forcing african governments to borrow short term to finance long term projects second fungibility of eurobonds proceeds flexibility to be utilised for purposes other than the ones they were raise for exposes the funds to the downside vulnerabilities of misappropriation and nonproductive expenditures third poor credit ratings as the majority of countries are in junk status credit ratings are pivotal in determination of both interest rates and the demand for bonds the weaknesses of rating agencies risk assessments have widely been criticised according to sovereign credit methodologies of the big three rating agencies economic growth is a decisive factor in past sovereign credit events there is a strong positive correlation between economic strength and credit worthiness but in africa high economic growth has not translated into better sovereign ratings despite consistent positive economic growth averaging 3 6 among 32 rated african states data show that the number of downgrades and negative outlooks are almost double that of upgrades and positive outlooks this implies that african countries are now worse off than they previously were this overlooks the continent s significant progress in governance economic growth and human development over the past years take ethiopia it has a current economic growth of 8 5 and has been hovering between 8 11 for over 10 years but it has not had a single upgrade activity from any of the three international rating agencies senegal one of africa s most stable countries experiencing three peaceful political transitions since its independence in 1960 has maintained an economic growth averaging 6 over the past 10 years it still remains in junk status rating some of what drives higher interest rates also rests with africa governments for example a lack of sufficient information about the specific use of proceeds in prospectuses during eurobond initial public offerings is magnifying the risk of fiscal indiscipline it means that funds have no conditionalities or any lines of accountability it is also the case that governments use the money they raise on loss making projects and nonproductive fiscal expenditure two examples illustrate the point the failing kuraz mega sugar project in ethiopia was funded from the 2014 eurobond as was the kenyan standard gauge railway sgr which is failing to stimulate any new economic activity solutions african countries can act to address the rising interest burden and to avert falling into a debt trap through the following mechanisms governments should use the money raised to fund profitable projects and use the profits from these projects to repay interest owed governments must take control of the bond issuance process during the bond structuring stage they must exercise their choice of accepting or rejecting investors bids it is imperative for african countries to structure bonds with favourable yields and tenure this process should not be entirely renounced to syndicates of lead managers originators and investment banks the oversubscription of recent eurobond issues eurobond issuances have been oversubscribed by three times on average simply shows that demand is outweighing supply countries should manage lead issuance advisors to negotiate for the lowest interests possible to be saved from unnecessary costs governments should bargain for competitive interest rates and accept only favourable bids governments should borrow for productive expenditure and manage proceeds from international bonds more prudently with integrity and transparency african countries should establish a continental position adopt international standards and guidelines to establish lines of accountability in rating agencies this will create a platform to enforce adherence to scientific rating methodology rating appeals regulating rating agencies and sufficient involvement of rated countries in the rating process misheck mutize lecturer of finance graduate school of business gsb university

education b s in mechanical engineering from northwestern university m s in engineering economic systems from stanford university ph d in political science from duke university occupation u s representative 8th term former university professor former congressional staff member campaign website lipinskiforcongress com previous or current elected or appointed office u s congressman the single most pressing issue facing the 3rd district and what i intend to do about it the high and rising cost of healthcare is a major burden for many americans i have made it a priority since i was first elected to work on making healthcare more affordable we need a thoughtful multi faceted approach to healthcare reform that addresses costs while protecting access and coverage choices balancing these priorities while working to lower insurance premiums and bring down hospital doctor and prescription drug costs is achievable but there s no easy solution the affordable care act is flawed but i ve fought against attempts to repeal it and worked extensively to make improvements so that insurance through the exchanges would be truly affordable one action the federal government can take to lower premiums in the aca by 25 30 is creating a reinsurance program and guaranteeing the cost sharing reduction payments to insurers i worked in the bipartisan house problem solvers caucus to develop legislation to do this another action the federal government can take is permitting the 14 remaining non medicaid expansion states to be eligible for enhanced funding for medicaid expansion without the initial time constraints that were originally imposed in the aca this will especially benefit single adults who struggle with mental illness as well as other vulnerable populations this year i helped the house pass h r 987 the strengthening health care and lowering prescription drug costs act which helps states set up their own insurance marketplaces expands funding for marketing public awareness efforts for the aca and rescinds an administration rule promoting junk plans i will continue to work on these and other provisions to make the aca more affordable for working families and seniors in my district and across the country the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs remains a real crisis in 2019 i introduced legislation h r 5039 to lower the cost of life sustaining drugs for seniors and others on medicare by allowing the secretary of health and human services to leverage the purchasing power of the federal government along with prescription drug pricing data from other developed nations to ensure patients receive better pricing and are not being excessively charged for vital life sustaining medications like insulin epipens and anti seizure medications recently i helped pass h r 3 the lower drug costs now act to make prescription drugs more affordable for working families and seniors by stopping americans from having to pay more for their medications than what pharmaceutical companies charge for the same drugs in other countries and there is more that congress can do to fight high drug prices there are many other ways to bring down the cost of healthcare we need to put an end to expensive surprise medical billing practices through proposals that maximize healthcare savings for patients lower insurance premiums and provide meaningful deficit reduction to the federal government at the same time recently i led an organized effort with other house members to call on house and senate leadership to allow a vote on legislation to protect patients from surprise billing ending this practice will take the patient out of the middle of payment disputes between insurers and out of network providers in situations where there is no real opportunity for the patient to choose in network care this could save taxpayers anywhere from 9 billion to 25 billion according to congressional budget office estimates what are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post i am a problem solver who cooperatively develops commonsense solutions to problems faced by my constituents and our nation enabling me to deliver results my opponents offer unworkable harmful schemes and would only add to the divisive extremism and gridlock in washington that is hurting our nation i ve been able to accomplish so much for my constituents and america s middle class because i m not afraid to roll up my sleeves and work with others regardless of party or ideology and get things done i m a workhorse not a show horse who listens to all sides studies issues thoroughly and develops workable solutions through my top notch staff i have helped thousands of constituents from all communities in the district solve problems they have faced from getting a senior her proper social security benefit to getting a veteran his service medals to getting an immigrant her citizenship just in the past two years i helped deliver 150 million for a long awaited rail underpass in chicago and 6 million for an air traffic control tower in romeoville helped improve metra service in the western suburbs and cta service on archer avenue helped end cancer causing eto emissions from sterigenics helped solve flooding issues in la grange helped protect a bridgeview community helped improve safety on a downtown lockport rail line and helped get new heated metra commuter shelters in summit and beverly much of the disastrous gridlock in our country can be attributed to a hyper partisan system in washington that rewards party loyalty and punishes bipartisan cooperation as well as a national political system that rewards extremism over compromise the public suffers most when the parties antagonize one another and commonsense policies are immediately dismissed just because they originated in the opposition party i m a proud member of the bipartisan problem solvers caucus and the work we ve done to begin opening up the legislative process and empowering rank and file members to make lawmaking less top down driven and more representative of the american people the high and continually rising cost of healthcare is a burden for most americans especially working class families i have fought to defend the vital provisions of the aca jettison the harmful pieces and make it work better for middle class families through bipartisan legislation that would bring down premiums i have fought to bring down the cost of prescription drugs including introducing a bill to lower the cost of life sustaining medications and helping the house pass h r 3 to stop americans from having to pay more for their medications than what pharmaceutical companies charge for the same drugs in other countries i have also worked to eliminate surprise billing at hospitals that would save tens of billions of dollars these are some of the ways that we will realistically begin to make healthcare more affordable for americans and i will continue to work with my democratic colleagues and republican colleagues willing to help to make it happen my opponent who gets the most attention marie newman favors a plan which would abolish private insurance and have the government take over that role all of the 177 million americans who have private insurance would lose their plan and medicare would be eliminated for seniors this extreme plan would require a doubling of every federal tax not just income tax to pay the cost which is estimated at 32 6 trillion over ten years the impact on the entire system of providers including doctors hospitals and other healthcare facilities would be severe i have also long been a leader on sensible climate change issues in congress and am an active member of the house climate solutions caucus in 2007 the first two bills i authored that became law both addressed climate change one required the federal government to install energy efficient lightbulbs and light fixtures in federal office buildings and the other created the h prize to promote the development of hydrogen as a clean fuel for transportation in 2009 i helped introduce the first bipartisan bill to institute a fee on carbon emissions to fight climate change and earlier this year i introduced with bipartisan support h r 3966 the raise wages cut carbon act which establishes a fee on greenhouse gas emissions and returns all the revenue generated to the american people you can read more in question 9 about my leadership on the issue of climate change my opponents instead offer a plan that would cost american taxpayers between 50 and 93 trillion over ten years since the federal government currently raises about 3 2 trillion dollars a year in taxes this would mean every federal tax would have to triple to pay for this plan climate change is a serious issue that demands serious solutions these are two examples of critical issues that we face and the differences between my commonsense problem solver approach and the unworkable extremist approaches of my opponents that would simply create more gridlock and division in our nation as the problems grew and americans suffered describe the other issues that define your campaign platform improving local transportation our region is a transportation hub for the nation but we have some of the country s worst congestion on our roads rails and airports which means lost time with friends and family and a less competitive economy as the most senior member from illinois on the house transportation and infrastructure committee and chair of the subcommittee on railroads pipelines and hazardous materials i am in a good position to continue my leadership improving our local transportation system over the years i have brought back over 600 million in federal funds for local transportation projects for roads bridges public transit rail and bikes pedestrians after serving as a co chair of governor pritzker s infrastructure transition team i was able to work with state and local officials to get 150 million to build a long awaited underpass at rail crossings at harlem avenue and 63rd and or 65th street and 6 million to build an air traffic control tower at lewis university airport in romeoville in january the house will begin its work on a new long term federal road transit and rail funding bill and my key position on the transportation committee will give me the opportunity to provide more federal help to fix and expand our local surface transportation system i have been a tireless advocate for public transit in our region helping to increase federal funding for public transportation infrastructure as chair of the subcommittee on rail i will build upon the work i have already done for commuter rail such as provision in a transportation funding bill that directs the federal railroad administration to identify potential issues contributing to the frequency and length of delays on metra trains and develop recommendations on addressing these challenges i will continue to hold hearings to call out and pressure metra freight railroads and amtrak to provide better commuter rail service sitting on the aviation subcommittee over the years i have been able to help deliver tens of millions of dollars for safety improvements and other projects at midway airport which sits in the heart of the third district it is critical that midway continue to be an economic engine in the region and that the safety of passengers and the surrounding neighborhood is protected i will also continue to work to keep the modernization of o hare airport moving forward while the chicago ship and sanitary canal and the cal sag channel are often unnoticed they are vital inland waterways in the third district i continue to work to provide funding for infrastructure to stop asian carp from proceeding up the canal so that we can keep commerce that is important for local jobs flowing on the waterway growing good paying jobs throughout my time in congress i have been focused on growing american manufacturing jobs manufacturing built america and the middle class and if we re going to rebuild the middle class we need to boost american manufacturing that s why i authored the american manufacturing competitiveness act which required the establishment of a comprehensive manufacturing strategy for the first time since alexander hamilton the first plan was published in 2018 and every four years a revised plan will be created manufacturing is no longer only old style heavy manufacturing but also advanced manufacturing where america can use cutting edge technology and our innovative spirit to make the products of the future we can also promote the creation of good paying manufacturing jobs through the promotion of buy american policies which assure that when the federal government spends taxpayer money it is investing in american made goods and american workers i have been successful in adding buy american provisions to numerous pieces of legislation and have introduced the buy american improvement act to expand made in america requirements to more federal programs and to close loopholes in current policy we also must continue to invest in research that will help produce continued technological advancement and prepare and train our workforce so that we have the skilled employees to keep america at the forefront of innovation to help with this important issue i helped create the national science foundation innovation corps i corps program and have helped expand this highly successful initiative that bridges the divide between the research and start up sector by educating scientists and engineers about how to turn their laboratory research into new products and services this helps to drive innovation spur small business development and create new jobs to increase america s competitiveness since 2012 i corps has trained over 1 300 teams led to the formation of 644 startup companies and resulted in over 300 million in follow on funding raised the manufacturing sector needs a new model for trade that protects american workers middle class americans have suffered from bad trade deals made over the past 25 years and manufacturing has been particularly hard hit these agreements have contributed significantly to stagnant wages i helped lead the fight that killed the trans pacific partnership tpp which would have been the biggest trade deal in history and would have led to more disastrous job losses last month i helped the house pass the united states mexico canada agreement usmca to replace nafta this was a tough vote for me but i ultimately decided to support the agreement because while it has flaws it is an improvement over the disastrous nafta and establishes a floor plan to build from that protects american workers and tries to force mexico to uphold labor standards that won t undercut american workers i joined with my house democratic colleagues to apply the pressure that helped make this agreement much better from what was originally negotiated while i do not have confidence in how president trump is approaching china on the trade issue i am happy that he is addressing the issue of china s unfair trading practices and will support good policy that helps american workers against further outsourcing of jobs there is significant work that needs to be done to ensure we have effective systems in place to help new graduates unemployed adults and returning military veterans choose and succeed in careers identifying and promoting available opportunities for real life job training especially for in demand careers is important we need to prioritize the creation of new pathways to careers with an emphasis on providing students with job skills before they graduate from high school the federal government needs to continue working collaboratively with businesses education leaders and state and local policymakers to build upon the existing programs and conduct outreach about opportunities i have been active in promoting apprenticeships in fields that have not traditionally provided such opportunities what accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job i ve authored almost 20 laws including initiatives that boost american manufacturing jobs protect the environment and fight climate change empower victims of sexual assault spur american technological innovation honor veterans and safeguard consumers i ve done this by bringing people together to develop solutions including through my membership on the bipartisan house problem solvers caucus i ve brought home over 600 million in federal money to improve local transportation including funding for roads bridges public transportation bike ped and airports these projects improved local quality of life by creating jobs and helping ease congestion i ve also been able to get metra service added to the heritage corridor and southwest service lines as well as getting additional cta bus service for constituents as chairman of the house transportation and infrastructure committee s subcommittee on railroads pipelines and hazardous materials i ve worked tirelessly to improve america s transportation system and led efforts to increase funding for roads mass transit bike ped and airports i have helped to maintain the vitality and safety of midway airport by securing more than 30 million for safety enhancements at the airport i ve also been the leading advocate for the create rail modernization program a public private partnership to reduce rail and road congestion throughout the chicago region to fight for better funding for public transit i founded the congressional public transit caucus if you win this position what accomplishment would make your term in office as a success in this term i have been able to get many local projects for communities across the district completed or funded by working collaboratively with elected officials at all levels as well as local organizations and community members in the past year alone i helped deliver 150 million for a long awaited rail underpass in chicago and 6 million for an air traffic control tower in romeoville end cancer causing eto emissions from sterigenics improve metra service in the western suburbs and cta service on archer avenue solve flooding issues in la grange protect a bridgeview community with a new wall next to a railroad and highway improve safety on a downtown lockport rail line and get new heated metra commuter shelters in summit and beverly with regard to legislative work one of my proudest accomplishments was being part of a small group of members who were able to get changes made to house rules so that for the first time in many decades some power was moved away from the speaker to rank and file members the changes were based on the break the gridlock package i worked on with the bipartisan house problem solvers caucus and adopted after a group of us made clear that we would base our support for speaker candidates on willingness to enact reforms one change was the creation of the house consensus calendar sometimes popular bills get stuck in committee because a committee chair or house leadership don t support it under the new rule if a bill reaches 290 cosponsors it is placed onto the consensus calendar simply having the consensus calendar available has given rank and file members the threat of bringing a bill to the floor without the speaker s consent thanks to this change my colleagues and i ensured a house vote on the repeal of an onerous 40 excise tax on certain job based health plans enacted in the affordable care act aca as many as 25 of workers with job based health plans could have been affected by this tax by 2025 after the house vote repeal of this tax was included in a 2019 year end legislative package and enacted into law continuing to deliver for my constituents and making government more representative of the american people would make my next term a success why should voters trust you the value of serving others was instilled in me from an early age at home in school and at church i was inspired toward public service that is why i became a teacher and then ran for congress as a member of congress my job is very complex but it is guided by the simple principle of doing what i can to help others i ve always made it a top priority to provide the best possible casework for my constituents and my staff has helped thousands of district residents with issues related to social security medicare veterans benefits immigration low income heating assistance and myriad other issues my staff holds regular hours at 4 different offices throughout the expansive third congressional district to ensure every community has the access they need to have their issues addressed what else would you like voters to know about yourself and your positions since i was first elected to congress i have been a leader in the fight to take action against climate change in 2007 the first two bills i authored that became law both addressed climate change one required the federal government to install energy efficient light bulbs and light fixtures in federal office buildings and the other created the h prize to promote the development of hydrogen as a clean fuel for transportation in 2007 i was also a strong backer of the department of energy s arpa e program advanced research projects agency energy modeled after the department of defense s arpa program that funds cutting edge research the successful arpa e program is currently funding research across the country including a program at argonne lab working to produce a breakthrough in innovative battery technology to enable exponential growth in the use of renewable energy in this congress i am co sponsoring h r 4091 which would significantly expand arpa e in 2009 i helped to introduce the first bipartisan bill to institute a fee on carbon emissions to fight climate change as an active member of the house climate solutions caucus i brought a bipartisan group of members of congress to the house floor to speak on merits of carbon fee legislation earlier this year i introduced with bipartisan support h r 3966 the raise wages cut carbon act which establishes a fee on greenhouse gas emissions and returns all the revenue generated by cutting payroll taxes increasing social security benefits and increasing funding for weatherization programs and low income home energy assistance according to the imf a fee on carbon is the most powerful and efficient way to fight climate change additionally in the current congress i am leading h r 3100 directing the department of energy to establish a prize challenge competition to address climate change as well as co sponsoring a number of climate change related bills including h r 1166 the use it act to promote carbon emissions capture and h r 978 the clean and efficient cars act to reduce transportation emissions i believe that the u s should recommit to international emissions reduction goals as outlined in the paris agreement and was proud to vote for h r 9 and support its passage in the house of representatives addressing climate change requires long term and sustained global action the united states must take a leading role in addressing climate change and reaffirm its commitment to the paris climate change agreement as well as move ahead with the clean power plan i support the 100 clean economy act h r 5221 which directs the federal government to develop a plan to reduce emissions by 50 by 2030 technology developments that help existing industries transition to lower emissions have the added benefit of stimulating our economy and creating new jobs
2019 was a year of turmoil massive popular protests rocked hong kong lebanon iran and iraq in february three million people are said to have marched in algeria and large popular uprisings later led to the fall of a long standing dictatorship in the sudan there were protests in richer countries too the gilets jaunes brought chaos to central paris on multiple occasions but perhaps no region saw protests as widespread as latin american and the caribbean where large scale uprisings and demonstrations took place in countries as different as haiti and chile as well as in bolivia colombia ecuador and venezuela among others in chile latin america s most prosperous nation and something of a poster child of international organizations 1 2 million people approximately 6 4 of the country s population took to the streets of santiago on october 25 and more in other cities up and down the country there is clearly not a single cause for all the different protests around the world rebellion against or fear of encroaching authoritarianism clearly played a role in many cases so did disgust at perceived corruption by governing elites social media clearly acted as an important facilitator in this post we want to comment more narrowly on two commonly proposed hypotheses linking inequality or income distribution more generally to the protests in latin america and in particular in democratic and relatively prosperous countries such as chile and colombia the first hypothesis is that the popular uprisings in these countries represented a social response to rising income inequality this view was particularly popular among a social media contingent who seem to believe despite clear evidence to the contrary that inequality is always rising everywhere the trouble with this hypothesis is that income inequality as captured by household surveys has actually been declining in latin america for the last twenty years as figure 1 shows the simple average gini coefficient in the region fell from 0 56 in 2000 to 0 51 in 2017 almost a 10 decline for a notoriously sluggish indicator nor is this an artifact of the gini index other measures agree the p75 p25 ratio for example fell from 3 8 to 3 3 figure 1 income inequality in selected latin american countries 2000 2017 gini coefficients to be sure this declining trend did slow down since 2012 and has recently reversed in some latin american countries figure 1 shows an increase in brazil from 2015 to 2017 and an earlier uptick in argentina unfortunately for the proponents of the simple inequality protest link however there were no large scale protests in these two countries during 2018 19 in countries that did experience mass protests chile colombia ecuador and bolivia on the other hand inequality was either constant or continued to decline in the last few years for which data is available somewhat surprisingly this conclusion is robust to considering income trends at the very top of the distribution which are notoriously poorly captured in household surveys the world inequality database a remarkable dataset assembled by the world inequality lab at the paris school of economics contains estimates of top 1 income shares based on administrative tax data for five south american countries argentina brazil chile colombia and uruguay the only one showing an increase is the series for argentina the others are either stable or show a slight decline chile s share goes from 0 20 in 1990 to 0 17 in 2015 brazil s is the highest roughly stable around a quarter of total fiscal income i use the fiscal rather than national income series as fewer assumptions are involved in producing them let s be clear whether you use gini coefficients or top income shares these levels of inequality are obscene a quarter of fiscal income accruing to the richest 1 of the population is clearly outrageous inequality in latin america remains the highest in the world though comparison with africa is problematic for various reasons and such high levels of inequality are both intrinsically repugnant and instrumentally pernicious but that is not to say they were what brought chileans and colombians out into the streets if there was a direct simple link between high income inequality and protests in latin america brazilians should have been out in the streets of são paulo in 2019 or chileans in 2001 not chileans in 2019 a slightly more sophisticated hypothesis linking changes in the distribution of incomes to last year s social uprisings in the region goes as follows propelled by high commodity prices and in some cases improved social policies the 2002 2012 period saw a substantial decline in poverty from 44 to 26 at usd 5 50 per day in ppp 2011 dollars in the region this was accompanied by a growth the region s middle classes from 22 to 35 by the world bank s 13 70 per day definition with the end of the commodity super cycle around 2012 and the delayed contagion from the global financial crisis of 2008 09 finally reaching the region both economic growth and the pace of inequality reduction slowed down and so did middle class growth it was frustrated aspirations from a recently stagnant middle class rather than higher inequality the story goes that led to last year s massive street protests this second hypothesis is both more thoughtful and more plausible inspection of the middle class trends in figure 2 does reveal clear signs of stagnation after 2002 both for the region as a whole and for countries such as bolivia which did see large protests but alas it does not seem consistent with the trends in colombia and in particular in chile where the middle class continued to grow from 40 in 2012 to 55 of the population in 2017 the country ranking here is affected by multiple factors including ppp exchange rates so focus on the time trends once again according to this hypothesis the largest protests should have taken place in brazil where the deep 2014 2016 recession caused the middle class to shrink so at least for those two countries chile and colombia an alternative hypothesis is needed figure 2 middle class in selected latin american countries 2000 2017 share of population with income 13 70 2011 ppp fortunately an eminently suitable one has been around for at least 180 years since alexis de tocqueville reflected that both the french and american revolutions were born from incomplete progress rather than from an outright failure of the preceding regime in democracy in america 1840 he wrote the hatred that men bear to privilege increases in proportion as privileges become fewer and less considerable so that democratic passions would seem to burn most fiercely just when they have least fuel when all conditions are unequal no inequality is so great as to offend the eye whereas the slightest dissimilarity is odious in the midst of general uniformity hence it is natural that the love of equality should constantly increase together with equality itself and that it should grow by what it feeds on or as the wikipedia entry on the tocqueville effect pithily summarizes as social conditions and opportunities improve social frustration grows more quickly there clearly has been socio economic progress in chile over the last twenty years poverty and inequality have fallen access to all levels of education has grown and average wages are higher social conditions and opportunities have improved for most but the progress has been severely incomplete and insufficient giving rise to great social frustrations one protester interviewed by the new york times came from a poor neighborhood and was the first in her family to go to college where she even had access to a scholarship but the scholarship was partial and she described her student debt as a heavy backpack tellingly she felt that the playing field was still tilted against her there is this discourse of merit of striving of how you should get up earlier but even if we get up early nothing is going to change javiera lópez layana quoted in the new york times 3 november 2019 chile woke up dictatorship legacy of inequality triggers mass protests the evidence suggests ms lópez is right measures of inequality of opportunity which capture how much income inequality can be attributed to factors beyond a person s control like race gender place of birth and family background remain extremely high in chile and most of latin america figure 3 plots such a measure against income inequality in a version of the well known great gatsby curve aside from south africa latin america has the highest levels of inequality of opportunity getting up earlier is not in fact enough to catch up with the elites if you are born to poorer parents and in the wrong part of town figure 3 the opportunity great gatsby curve protesters like ms lópez are emboldened by recent social gains rather than by worsening conditions to demand levels of fairness and equality which are still far from their reality they demand a break with the old latin american social contract through which elites pay lower taxes except in argentina and brazil and opt out of low quality public services hoarding opportunity through private schools and kindergartens private health insurance schemes and clinics and better pension systems than those available to most in that sense the 2019 protests in chile and colombia are related to inequality after all inequality of opportunity preserved by an oligarchic social contract

london england christine lagarde president of the ecb want to listen to the public view photo by facundo arrizabalaga pool getty images getty images a bank wants to listen to public opinion it has happened before at a commercial and central banking level in the u k and u s as a matter of fact midland bank plc was one of the big four barclays lloyds midland and national westminster banking groups in the u k for most of the 20th century it is now part of hsbc midland bank had an iconic slogan the listening bank this was repeated in television commercials throughout the 1980s it was a catchphrase that came to define midland as the most customer friendly amongst the big four of u k banking much of that was lost when midland bank was acquired by hsbc in 1992 all ears at the ecb ecb president christine lagarde has sparked an exercise of public consultation to assist in the bank s strategy review she appeared in the first direct video address by the institution s chief to euro zone citizens this is certainly a radical step for the ecb as lagarde spoke directly to a camera straight down the lens to suggest she was directly talking to all and any viewers as she invited the public to express their opinion on monetary policy the broadcast was launched on twitter and had a synchronous release with a press statement outlining the ecb s plans however it is not the first time a central bank has reached out the u s federal reserve in october 2018 invited public comment on actions the fed could take to support faster payments in the u s banking system federal reserve board governor lael brainard said consumers and businesses increasingly expect to be able to send and immediately receive payments at any time of the day any day of the year a 24 7 economy with 24 7 real time payments needs 24 7 real time settlement that is where we believe that the federal reserve and the private sector together need to make investments for the future what did she say lagarde said the euro actually belongs to all of us it belongs to you so we need to hear from you in this strategy review stable prices help you make decisions in many aspects of your life from saving to borrowing and from spending to investing please share your ideas and concerns with us why did she say it at a time when the global economy is struggling to contend with the trade tensions between the two leading economies i e the u s and china the uncertainty that always surrounds the quadrennial white house race the impact of brexit on the euro zone and not least the economic impact of the coronavirus she may need as many ideas as possible economic pain to be blunt the ecb has not been very successful in delivering the concept of price stability since the global financial crisis and the euro zone sovereign debt debacle inflation which should be at or near 2 0 has only pushed to or above that level for 27 of the time since 2010 the inflation rate in the euro zone was confirmed at 1 4 year on year in january 2020 the highest since april last year boosted by prices of energy 1 9 cf 0 2 in december and unprocessed food 2 3 cf 2 1 on the other hand costs rose at a softer pace for both services 1 5 cf 1 8 and non energy industrial goods 0 3 cf 0 5 the annual core inflation rate which excludes energy food alcohol tobacco prices and at which the ecb looks at when deciding monetary policy was also confirmed at 1 1 below december s 1 3 on a monthly basis consumer prices dropped 1 0 when one considers that the quarterly gdp growth rate in q4 2019 was just 0 1 down from 0 3 in q3 the scale of the dilemma facing the ecb starts to become clear the ecb is out of ideas as one can see from the metrics listed above the euro zone economy is in a bad way the region has endured dismal growth and persistently high unemployment joblessness is crushing greece 16 5 spain 13 8 while in france it sits at 8 1 speaking at the end of july lagarde s predecessor mario draghi was brutally blunt for a central banker saying this outlook is getting worse and worse what is to be done it looks as though the ecb is going to apply more of the same medicine in the guise of further interest rate cuts and start a new round of quantitative easing qe one might say that this sounds quite reasonable except for the hard reality that all that the ecb achieved with qe was a great market distortion that has allowed the euro zone sovereigns off the hook of profligacy and given an easy money ride for investors that caught the ecb s coat tails savers i e the prudent members of the euro zone society have been punished by 2 trillion 2 3 trillion of qe just delivering negative interest rates lagarde knows that what is really needed is a massive wave of fiscal stimulus but as eu nations argue over their post brexit budget contributions it is unlikely that germany will show the way and embark on a round of deficit spending to drive further integration of eu member states the fed may have sought ideas about the payment system but that is a far cry from seeking pubic input on the issue of price stability that is a fundamental of the ecb s purpose as for seeking public opinion on climate change i might be inclined to applaud the sentiment but the ecb should only do that once it has proven it can fulfil its highly specific mandate which is economic stability the ecb has to work to its main mandate not get all warm and fuzzy on issues of sentiment right now it is failing to do its job so as i have said since 2010 the ecb needs to start dictating monetary terms to national governments and stop pussy footing around the issue on fear of upsetting sovereign feelings the euro zone is in a mess and needs a strong central bank to fix it

opinions expressed by entrepreneur contributors are their own you re reading entrepreneur middle east an international franchise of entrepreneur media until quite recently the barriers to investing in the middle east and north africa mena region were effectively insurmountable most attempts to break into the marketplace were thwarted by decades old laws specifically designed to protect the interests of state owned enterprises and merchant families foreign investors who managed to identify potential footholds faced the further impediments of among others prohibitively high minimum capital requirements combined with stringent ownership restrictions that limited their stake in companies local production rules and licensing processes were designed to serve as an additional set of obstacles to frustrate direct foreign investment all these factors allowed state owned enterprises and merchant families to build large uncontested conglomerates requiring foreign firms to partner with them or use them as the sole distributor but in 2014 the sudden and unexpected decrease in oil prices resulted in a sea change in attitudes towards foreign investment in the mena region the gulf countries in particular began to rethink the role foreign direct investments could play as a means to ease fiscal burdens and restructure local economies in the five years since what has happened across the region has been nothing short of an economic revolution legislation that favored local interests has been repealed and in its place progressive investment and corporate ownership laws have taken root a broad suite of reforms has been instituted regarding capital market rules that also strengthen the rights of minority investors the executive teams of the national agenda 2021 in addition a host of stumbling blocks that were once deterrents to foreign investment are progressively being addressed access to credit has been eased along with changes to insolvency resolution making the marketplace more hospitable to overseas money business creation has been simplified as well as an overhaul of the tax code to encourage investment at a variety of scales indeed one of the main things that has not changed is the attitude of foreign investors towards the mena while the transformation in the region has been neglected in the press resulting in a lack of attention globally that indifference has also resulted in a rich array of opportunities for serious investors to consider changes afoot the changes that are underway can be seen at multiple levels most visible are the state driven plans that will set the tone for investment in the next decade in the kingdom of saudi arabia ksa for instance the saudi vision 2030 plan is nothing short of a transformation of the economy away from its dependence on oil by investing in infrastructure to support diversification into manufacturing technology and mining among other sectors at the same time ksa seeks to develop and grow its public service sectors to ensure access and improvements in areas like health and education as well as recreation and tourism but changes in outlook are not limited to saudi arabia in the united arab emirates uae the government has launched the uae vision 2021 which focuses on environmental sustainability as well as improvements to infrastructure in areas like healthcare and education to support a knowledge based economy key emirates of the uae like abu dhabi and dubai have launched their respective strategies spanning into 2050 egypt has similarly announced a plan egypt vision 2030 to revive its traditional role in regional leadership by promising social justice and focusing on sustainable economic development through creating a competitive and diversified economy centered around knowledge based innovation source neom grand visions are nice but what impresses is that the talk is backed up by action take for instance the giga project currently being developed by neom in ksa a massive 26 500 sq km smart city between the jordanian and egyptian borders that stretches from the red sea to the mountains the city is already hosting daily flights to its airport with the goal of attracting one million residents and five million tourists by 2030 nor is saudi arabia alone in building new cities along with investments into a new canal industrial zone egypt is constructing a new administrative capital the size of singapore that will be home to five million people and will feature the tallest skyscraper in africa at the same time the country is busy creating seven new tunnels to the sinai peninsula and updating and upgrading five separate ports but the ambitions in the area go far beyond mere construction projects you can see it in the bold steps countries like the uae has taken in launching khalifasat its first ever satellite and the creation of the region s first space exploration program including sending its first astronaut into outer space but the technological innovations don t end there as part of its strategic plans the uae appointed a minister of state for artificial intelligence ai recognizing that ai is on track to contribute upwards of 96 billion to its economy by 2030 13 6 of gdp the uae has an even bolder published strategy to establish the first inhabitable human settlement on mars by 2117 or consider egypt s moves toward a cashless economy mandating that the collection of taxes customs and duties will be through cashless payment methods coupled with their embrace of renewable energy from promoting net metering deregulating highvoltage transmissions and removing subsidies of conventional energy one can see why the region is attracting the attention of international investors new reforms and policies supporting these changes are structural reforms that not only fundamentally alter the way these countries do business but inspire investor confidence in the region as well foremost among these are changes to the laws and legal systems in these countries since 2017 the uae has taken measures to modernize its judiciary with better training for judges and arbitrators the establishment of specialist commercial courts electronic case management systems and the implementation of a new insolvency regime in 2018 egypt implemented a raft of business reforms ranging from new laws protecting foreign investors to insolvency tax and credit reform khalifasat was developed at the mohammed bin rashid space center source mohammed bin rashid space centre the workforce itself is changing whereas before employers found roadblocks to recruiting talented knowledge based employees to the region now those hurdles are being gradually removed the uae recently announced a 10 year visa for professionals and investors and the ksa also removed requirements for local sponsors and started offering permanent residency to some expats social reforms are now at forefront of the agenda in the ksa as well with the relaxation of social norms accelerating at a very rapid pace making the country more hospitable for foreign talent many highlevel entertainment activities like cinemas and concerts have been announced and are already creating new opportunities and nowhere have the social changes been more visible than in the unprecedented rate women have been entering the gcc workforce the ksa lifted its long held ban on women driving and recently the president of the uae called for emirati women to occupy 50 of the country s federal national council giving women a greater say in their country s future accompanying these reforms are pro business policies that are poised to spur investment there is a widespread realization in the region that the path to prosperity and development requires a move towards privatization and two way trade agreements as the world s top oil exporter aims to reduce its dependence on hydrocarbons saudi arabia s privatization program is one of the most ambitious with entire sectors being privatized including healthcare energy and even basic services like water as part of its vision 2030 economic roadmap the ksa has plans to eventually raise as much as 200 billion by expanding the private sector and diversifying its revenue streams egypt has launched its own ambitious privatization program by floating several large state owned enterprises on the public markets the state named five companies in 2018 and it is expected to announce nine names in the second phase shortly similarly the uae announced policy changes that allow for 100 foreign ownership of onshore entities the suez canal the environment for investment the news is good and investors are starting to take notice in 2018 almost 900 million was invested into over 350 different mena based startups with 30 of those investments coming from outside the region the entrepreneurial ecosystem has attracted firms such as general atlantic and gobi partners to invest in opportunities like property finder and holidayme respectively homegrown tech startups are becoming more visible and they are attracting interest from foreign strategic buyers one of the biggest acquisitions of all time was amazon s takeover of the e commerce website souq at least until uber acquired careem for 3 1 billion among the many attractive aspects of investing in the mena region is its key geographic location between two of the largest growth markets in the world china and africa the flow of trade between middle east and china as part of the latter s belt and road initiative bri has almost doubled in the last decade from 40 billion to 80 billion but china s 21st century maritime silk road also travels through the region to africa where over the past two decades growth in trade between the middle east and africa has seen a nine fold increase with over 65 billion in bilateral trade in 2018 the influx of trade has benefitted all the countries involved contributing to new investment opportunities job creation gdp growth and human capital development understanding the importance of china s bri initiative for the predicted growth in the mena region cannot be understated the middle east and north africa are expected to play a central role in connecting china to the rest of the world in no small part because chinese trade hubs such as hong kong and shenzhen run through the suez canal it s no surprise to discover that china is the largest investor in egypt s new suez canal zone initiative that covers close to 500 sq km and incorporates six separate ports but their interests in the region extend far beyond the venerable canal and include support for additional trade routes through locations like oman s duqm special economic zone and the uae s jebel ali free zone a closer look at the role the uae plays as a key transit point in this network reveals just how crucial the region is for global trade networks as a whole currently the uae accounts for over 50 34 billion of the middle east s trade with the african continent that amount will only grow as more chinese exports pass through the region as part of the bri initiative according to the uae s ministry of economy in 2018 30 of china s exports to the arab world goes through the uae indeed the uae s two biggest trading partners are not other countries in the middle east but china and india expo 2020 nor is china or the middle east sitting on its hands when it comes to investing in africa to ensure the centrality of the mena region in trade flows to the continent led by the uae many gulf states have heavily invested in ports infrastructure mining agriculture and other strategic sectors across africa the uae has deep ties to the region dubai based global ports operator dp world is a leading investor in africa with offices in algeria egypt djibouti somaliland rwanda mozambique and senegal similarly the uae s largest telecommunications operator etisalat has international operations in egypt morocco mauritania mali niger burkina faso cote d ivoire togo benin central african republic and gabon china has similarly invested billions of dollars in aid loans and investments into africa to strengthen trade along the 21st century maritime silk road the road ahead so what does the future hold for the middle east in a word growth consider just three observations of the many that could be made governments in the region have invested over 2 trillion in infrastructure upgrades population growth in the region has increased by six million in 2018 alone twice the rate of growth of north america and europe combined dubai s airport experiences the highest volume of traffic amongst all airports worldwide economically the region is on a strong footing growth in saudi arabia recovered strongly in 2018 growing at 2 2 versus 0 7 in 2017 with the private sector growing at 3 2 yoy the ksa increased spending by 7 in 2019 and it is expected that the surge in investment will further boost the private sector real gdp growth in the ksa is projected to hit 2 1 in 2019 national agenda 2021 executive teams gathering the united arab emirates is hosting expo 2020 with estimates of tourism to the region nearly doubling which is projected to generate 9 billion of incremental tourist spending equivalent to 2 0 of the uae s gdp close to 100 000 jobs are expected to be created in the uae as a result of expo 2020 and real gdp growth in the uae is projected to hit 2 4 in 2019 egypt even achieved a budget surplus in fy 2018 for the first time in contemporary economic history with projections to expand that surplus by 2 in fiscal year 2020 after transitioning to a floating currency system and driven by gains in exports tourism remittances and direct and portfolio investments egypt s international reserves reached a record high of 45 billion 0 of gdp real gdp growth in egypt is projected to hit 5 8 in 2019 in short the mena is primed for global investors to take a closer look at opportunities across all sectors in the region the time is now related the impact of the middle east s fintech boom on economic inequality in the region

by the freezing mediterranean squalls that slash across downtown beirut and the seafront to the west may give the impression this week that lebanon is lapsing back into its favourite pastime forgetting history and praying for a return to the good old days revolution now that the country s old parliamentary sectarians have gathered to support hassan diab s deeply uninspiring government it s hard to see how the wretched system behind this country s fragile grip on reality can ever change true the graffiti is still there including the god is great imprecations spray painted on the walls just down from my home and the broken windows on downtown offices and the steel shutters of the banks in the city centre and in hamra but there s a bigger storm coming more inflation more taxes more poverty though i noticed that the parliamentarians who gathered to vote for the new government were literally very well heeled is coming in this tempest a government which tries to alleviate anger by promising yet more economic suffering is a scenario which only lebanon can invent new taxes on fuel and electricity plus a rise in vat to 15 per cent a rate still below eu nations but likely to rise to 20 per cent will probably hit first but the revolution may well return among government employees who receive their salaries in lebanese pounds and whose income has already fallen by up to 40 per cent compared to price increases of 50 per cent what many non lebanese fail to appreciate is that the lebanese army and its associated military personnel all 72 000 of them are among these government employees policemen are going to suffer just as much as the civil society whose anger they must confront in order to protect the government it s hard to know whether to laugh or simply dismiss as satire the efforts of hassan diab s cabinet to survive the country s economic collapse we all know that hezbollah s imprimatur is stamped heavily on the government those brave symbols of national resistance having long ago decided that their political power is more important than the legions of militia martyrs who died to preserve the independence of the lebanese civilians many of whom have protested in downtown beirut yet around 14 of the 20 newly appointed ministers are said to hold us passports if this true don t tell donald trump although the white house insane asylum probably wouldn t understand the irony the us embassy in beirut still cannot get the state department to answer all their phone calls not many people there it seems but american diplomats in beirut have been dubiously putting it about among lebanese banking officials that far too much us dollar currency is making its way from lebanon to the regime in syria this lies in the interesting if true department if the lebanese millionaire circuit can t get their dollars out of the country how can they shift them to damascus or is the long standing contractual friendship between beirut s rich and syria s rich somehow able to bend these rules reader warning however there are no such things as rules in lebanon take the lebanese pound us dollar exchange rate as we all know and loved to remind ourselves after the 1975 1990 civil war it stood at 1 500 pounds to the dollar until the revolution last october when the black market rate soared to 2 600 money changers then patriotically patriotism being another overcharged word in lebanon these days agreed to hold the dollar at 2 000 in the third week of january but today it s almost 2 600 and expected to reach 3 000 next week for those who have dollar accounts this was great news although they could not take their cash out of the country and could only take it out of their accounts in batches of 200 a week this was a tragedy for those with lebanese pound accounts who could only watch their savings or income collapse by almost 50 per cent critically this does not only include all those soldiers and cops see above but an awful lot of pensioned army officers yet a strange irony is occurring bankers anonymous of course and financial journalists also anonymous are now talking of how the lebanese economic crisis was caused by the protesters in downtown beirut when in fact it was the corruption which created the economic crisis about which the demonstrators first protested in other words it s the poor and the younger educated generation who demand a modern non sectarian lebanon who are to blame not the sectarian groups who control albeit rather pitifully the economy the central bank governor riad salameh is now maintaining his job with abu mazen type arguments if i go lebanon goes too the palestinian president runs the same storyline if i go palestine goes although it s going rather quickly with him hosni mubarak we must remember played the same line in egypt and looked what happened to the old boy in the meanwhile the old dream of the protesters continues only a new constitution can de confessionalise lebanon and produce a modern state the problem is that to end sectarian politics you need politicians to help you and all the politicians are sectarian walid jumblatt the druze leader and my favourite nihilist produced another fantasy this week get rid of president michel aoun this would almost certainly destroy the career temporarily of course of gebran bassil the former foreign minister who just happens no nepotism please to be the son in law of the still reigning aoun both are christian maronites of course they have had to be maronites in order to hold their posts aoun s position was not helped although his grotesque lack of sensitivity towards his country s crisis was all too evident when he celebrated his 85th birthday two days ago with a party complete with dancing and cake and a song by his followers that changed the words of the national anthem into a paean for the old man so maybe jumblatt has a point don t demand a revolution just shave away at the edges of sectarianism until only the core is left change the constitution in stages which is not what jumblatt is actually demanding and eventually the whole fandango will just whirl away in a series of lebanese dabke dances debate the worth not of sectarian ministers but of sectarianism within the institutions the duplicated or triplicated sectarian balanced officials in the central bank for example or among ministry bureaucrats then the roots of the lebanese cedar tree will grow stronger along with the economy see how you can get addicted to metaphors here yet all this would need foreign support you can forget the arabs most of whom maintain sectarian governments of monstrous size which make lebanon s confessional power bloc look like a very small striped hyena which does just happen to be the country s national animal more seriously though take a look at the international reaction to lebanon s crisis the french response has been typical france according to the quai d orsay waits for deep and ambitious reforms on the part of the lebanese authorities especially economic transparency economic sustainability and finance the struggle against corruption and the independence of the judicial system in the general interest of all lebanese but wait do you notice what was missing from this gallic nonsense there was no demand to develop lebanon into a modern non sectarian state nor could one expect there to be any such remark since the entire lebanese sectarian system was set up after the first world war by the french the lebanese revolution then is a real page turner at once burlesque

the future of democracy in india john f kennedy shaking hands with jawaharlal nehru cc u s embassy new delhi india is the key to a democratic asia its economy is in a delicate equilibrium much more so than the european economy in 1947 between the dangers that threaten it and the possibilities it holds it finds itself at a crucial and precarious turning point of success or failure senator cooper and i recently proposed three measures to take with respect to india the first would consist in a series of administrative steps in order to alleviate in the short term the problem of the dollar for india the second would be a declaration from congress affirming that a successful effort to industrialise india is in america s interest a gesture similar to congress s action in 1947 which provided a framework for negotiations on the development of the marshall plan the third measure would seek to obtain that the us government alongside the governments of the oeec japan and all eventual participants researches the possibility of setting up a special grouping to determine the long term borrowing needs of india and prepare the constitution of a consortium that would guarantee to india that it could without fear pursue the implementation of its second five year plan the failure of the second plan could bring about the failure of india and of all hope of democracy in asia i am aware of course of the considerable efforts of resourcing and technical assistance western europe has put into underdeveloped regions in general and of the great contribution made to india s economic development by the influx of credits in pound sterling by various agreements with germany and through the contributions of the other participants to the colombo plan i also know that france while pursuing many construction projects in its colonial empire is grappling with the tragic problem in algeria which understandably occupies its attention and a large proportion of its resources other western european nations are also faced with problems and have to satisfy many askers who want to obtain from them what remains of their resources after their own needs have been met in my own country we find ourselves facing urgent questions such as reassessing the cost of our military strategy and the problems related to the economic recession nevertheless senator cooper and i believe that the plan of action we have drafted cannot wait and that the united states and the other industrialised nations of the free world must now produce from the democratic system measures that will ensure the success of the great adventure currently underway in india our view flows from a judgment about the state of things in india and a judgment about the situation of the alliance of the free world india has successfully shown the route to progressive economic development it has accomplished this development at a good pace it has established a solid economic base maintained an economy where the private sector plays an important and growing role and it has avoided excess government regulation and controls democracy has prevailed there despite heavy obstacles national income and per capita income have risen despite continuous population growth and education has spread two general elections have been held on the basis of universal suffrage the parliamentary framework is not merely a mirage there it is sustained by capable political leadership and a first rate civil service the indian political system is imbued with a spirit of democratic compromise in 1956 india completed its first five year plan during that period national income increased by 18 exceeding its target by 5 apart from its intrinsic achievements this plan by prioritising agriculture helped to generate a mood of national confidence that began to reach the villages where the majority of indians live the plan channelled the energies of colonial grievances to unite them in an effort of economic development on a truly national basis moreover the plan was favoured by good harvests and generally good weather through this plan s implementation the us provided india with 300 million in aid in addition to special loans of wheat amounting to 190 million the world bank for its part consented to several loans totalling around 30 million few of our assistance loans have ever been better used from the point of view of economic development the recognition of india s independence only came a short time before the communist regime took power in china these were the two cardinal events in asia in the post war period china and india launched their five year plans at around the same time both countries started from an economic base where 85 of the population lived in rural conditions both countries have considerable potential when it comes to natural resources and a relatively reduced proportion of cultivated lands both systems were momentarily in danger of sliding to the minimum level of human wellbeing in 1950 the national income per capita of inhabitants had fallen below 50 in both countries that is lower than twenty years earlier india had the advantage of having more educated men and technical experts at its disposal of a somewhat better transport network and a great ability to raise internal capital but like china it didn t have the means to exploit its abundant resources it needed to import a great proportion of its machines and it also suffered from insufficient food and on top of the market after 1948 it faced the grave problems of population redistribution and the economic troubles caused by the partition of the country it is easy to dismiss india s needs by arguing it embarked on a project that was grandiose and overly vast requiring effort and a massive injection of capital that far exceeds its capacity but is this really true however it was able to create an atmosphere favourable to economic development without imposing a totalitarian leadership like china india managed to make great leaps forward both economically and politically india s second five year plan is now reaching the end of its second year in contrast to the first plan it finds itself in great danger it risks failing the failure of the second plan could bring about the failure of india and of all hope of democracy in asia unleashing forces that would breach the vast security interests of the united states and its allies if india falls prey to internal disorder and the disappointment of its masses or its leaders if it is absorbed into the communist system the free world will suffer an incalculable setback the danger it finds itself in is the handmaiden of success the fact that the indian economy is expanding that the government has forced itself not to impose a rigid system of controls that it has permitted a considerable private enterprise sector what is more this plan is ambitious it is almost two and a half times larger than the first plan it is intended to enable indians to overcome the great difficulties of the start of economic growth the creation of capital generative basic industries such as steel it attempts to increase national income by 5 a year and 3 per capita it could serve to accelerate the development to a rate that would permit india to double the real national income over the next twelve years if it is successful it could effectively mobilise the country s abundant resources in hydroelectric power iron ore manganese coal and bauxite clearly this plan which is being executed in a period of bad harvests and growing unemployment the latter being a function of the import of machinery depends on international credit but we are in a period where there is little available international capital public or private and the price of such funds is high the world bank interest rate is 5 5 that set by the us fund for international development is almost as high while the interest rates of some short term loans have risen to 13 it is easy to dismiss india s needs by arguing it embarked on a project that was grandiose and overly vast requiring effort and a massive injection of capital that far exceeds its capacity but is this really true certainly not if we consider that the plan comprises a level of investment that represents less than 7 per year and per capita and if we compare this plan to the totalitarian planning effort currently being pursued by china if india s plan succeeds the rate of investment and savings will be less than 10 of india s national income compared to 20 in russia 15 in pre war japan and 12 in china india with a population double the size of western europe s will still only have an investment capacity the size of sweden s whose population is barely 7 million india has also taken severe measures of economic self discipline the present economic program of the indian government can reasonably be described as austere taxes are high particularly after the recent introduction of taxes on wealth and expenditure strict import controls and licensing have been imposed in the hopes of preserving foreign exchange reserves travel abroad has been prohibited although only a few people have an income high enough to be taxed in a country where income per capita does not reach 60 a year people with incomes of some importance are taxed at least as heavily as in other countries in fact the real question is whether these austerity measures may not soon reach a level when they are self defeating and exhaust private capital draining the private sector which was so healthy before through rigid import controls and sapping the incentives on which the plan was largely predicated can the indian government significantly reduce its plan without undermining and breaking its very foundations a careful judgment tells us it cannot as an authentic program of economic development is a seamless web that cannot be pulled apart or rewoven with cheaper materials the indian economy has reached a level of complexity and a stage of development where the various elements of the plan are interdependent steel coal transport and machines form a single complex and all must be developed together the mining industry cannot prosper until the deposits are accessible nearly all industries depend on energy sources and on machine equipment the training of technical experts and construction are the dynamic elements of the development effort without them we will be left with a husk without a kernel the proposal we have made could modify the psychological relations between the industrialised states of the west and the new nations in short serious reductions to the plan would not save money they would only mask and adjourn even higher spending in future or bring about the failure of the plan and of india s democratic experiment in asia western countries and india must and this is an absolute imperative unite their efforts to realise important goals and the safeguarding of the type of project originally formulated by the second plan a continuing sliding and a kind of laissez faire attitude would have pitiful economic results and would create a climate of disappointed expectation the consequences of which seem to be prefigured by what has happened in the indian state of kerala and in bombay where educated but desperate citizens freely elected a communist government there is another reason to act now within the western alliance there are difficult unresolved problems problems brought about by the emergence of new weapons and strategies and by the colonial controversies that still persist the western alliance must not only reinvigorate its military program but also find joint undertakings with the new nations of the world and those that are forming which offer constructive alternatives to the colonial type relations that are disappearing the proposal we have made in the hope of a collaboration with india could i think modify the psychological relations between the industrialised states of the west and the new nations and would contribute to ridding the western alliance of certain vices and causes for failure here is a beginning and a method for joint action which could later strengthen the creative impulses we find exemplified in the development of euratom the common market in western africa and in the colombo plan it is natural that europeans should ask us what are the prospects of such an initiative in the us no one can predict the decisions that will be made by the current congress although the process is too slow there has been a constant increase in our aid program abroad independent of military pacts and purely military support thanks to a recognition of the importance of aid allocated for economic development as such the increase over the past two years has been of around 15 nothing to my mind would accelerate the pace of this essential transformation in american politics and thinking more than a joint effort between allies beginning in india and gradually spreading to other nations that have the will and the capacity to accomplish real economic progress allow me to remind you again of the contours of asia india with its 400 million souls and china a country of about 600 million inhabitants india comprises nearly 40 of all free peoples of the uncommitted world nothing serves western interests better than to see the uncommitted recently constituted nations of the world devote their principal energies to realising programs designed to genuinely improve their economic situation nothing serves western interests better than to see the uncommitted recently constituted nations of the world devote their principal energies to realising programs designed to genuinely improve their economic situation in this domain india offers an example of an experiment that is decisive for strategic reasons and because from casablanca to jakarta all the unengaged countries are speculating about india s progress which they contrast with that of china the russians are trying to replicate their stranglehold on china in other parts of asia and africa they are counting on a lack of western aid being a disappointment to indians on the weakness of democratic planning methods and on the fragility of the free economy when considering the economic future of india we would do well to remember that india is no longer under a caricatural economic system that it has thrown itself into an effort that will make of it one of the world s great powers by the end of the century with a population of almost a billion people armed with all the resources of modern science of technology and of destruction the major competition of the future will unfold around the peaceful organisation of a global society which outside of the rich industrial countries of america western europe and russia will comprise powerful new countries in asia in south america in africa and in the middle east the way these countries present themselves after a period of economic transformation will not only leave a mark it will shape the historic destiny of future generations in europe and the united states we will not have to wait long to find out what will happen if we do not act at this very moment and over the course of the coming years as india the most important of all the uncommitted states has entered a decisive phase the success of its program is important not least because of the example it can set for the economic future of other underdeveloped countries the us canada western europe and japan are in a position to demonstrate that the path of democracy provides an effective method of creation and does not lead to defeat

larger and continuous losses caused by the corona virus covid 19 new historical and record gains for gold the losses from china turned to japan and south korea which paved the way for record and historical gains for gold prices that culminated by testing of the 1649 resistance its highest level in seven years before closing the week s trading around the 1643 level at the beginning of this week s trading the price gapped higher towards 1679 before settling around 1662 at the time of writing forex traders wonder about the most appropriate level of selling especially with the gold gains continuing without stopping the answer depends on allaying global markets concerns about the future of eradicating the epidemic that threatens global economic growth the announcement of a vaccine that ends in the virus and that has already proven its efficacy will be translated into violent gold sales because the technical indicators have all reached strong overbought areas the number of confirmed corona cases has risen to more than 76 000 with 2 250 deaths and the number is constantly increasing the epidemic tsunami has crossed the chinese borders the world s second largest economy the upcoming summer olympics in tokyo is at stake and he has joined many important economic events in china and its neighbors as well as the announcement by international companies of their business and profits being affected by the crisis in china it was surprising for traders to see gold prices rise at the same time when the us dollar was rising strongly last week us federal reserve chairman jerome powell reiterated that the bank believes the economy is in good shape and is satisfied with the current range of the interest rate between 1 5 and 1 75 as is well known this rate affects many consumer and commercial loans the gap between investor expectations of a rate cut and policymakers expectations has posed a long term dilemma for the fed as the central bank tries to guide markets about what it may or may not do in the coming months however they are also studying signals from the markets on how the economy is going and the fed s interest rate policy is going and if the fed ignores investor expectations for lower interest rates market losses may worsen especially if the central bank turns out to be wrong in its economic assessments on the other hand if fed officials have designed their policies primarily to satisfy traders this could risk inflating risky asset bubbles at a conference last friday in new york sponsored by booth school of business at the university of chicago loretta mester federal reserve chair in cleveland suggested that the federal reserve listen closely to market signals mester said monetary policy makers should be open minded to reassess their view of the economy on the basis of all the information provided including those of participants in the financial markets and that we have to be open to the possibility that the view of markets is more in line with the fundamentals from the policymakers point of view meester is a voting member of the monetary policy committee this year according to the technical analysis of gold on the daily chart the price of gold has reached strong overbought levels and the correction awaits profit taking sales from these levels and the correction will be stronger if optimism returns to the financial markets due to finding a vaccine that ends the corona virus epidemic for the next levels on the upside the aggravation of the crisis and the increase of gold purchases may support testing of new highs the closest ones being 1655 1672 and 1700 respectively market sentiment is an important factor affecting the price of gold at that point given that the bearish correction will be violent
the eu directive on its preventive restructuring framework european parliament and council 2019 has created a legislative battle national legislators must choose between the absolute priority rule apr principle used elsewhere or adopting a new eu relative priority rule rpr any shift to the rpr would weaken protection for unsecured lenders such as trade creditors and bondholders while making debt restructuring easier for perhaps deliberately overburdened companies the shift to an eu rpr would offer few incentives to invest undermine vulnerable lenders and create a threat to financial stability at a time when credit standards are declining it would also set back the vision of the european capital market union that borrowers should transition away from an overreliance on bank credit towards more diverse sources of funding the apr is a traditional safeguard to prevent shareholders from retaining control in a reorganised company unless most creditors as a group consent in some cases strict adherence to apr may prevent competent shareholders from restructuring when there is excessive debt on the other hand debt renegotiation without apr exposes unsecured creditors to massive write offs their bargaining position is vulnerable to collusion between secured creditors such as banks shareholders or private equity the ease with which shareholders could retain control over a reorganised company under eu rpr even after largely wiping out unsecured debt will not strengthen balance sheets instead it will encourage highly leveraged buyouts and equity withdrawals many industries have already seen a cycle of cynical equity extraction by means of dividend recaps and share buybacks driven by issuance of secured debt this process leaves captured creditors suppliers bondholders tax authorities pension funds and workers exposed to the threat of default the claim of an excessive debt burden is belied by such strategic restructuring eu rpr raises concerns for financial stability too demand by savers for higher yield has produced strong incentives for banks to manufacture high yield securities especially given the declining demand for credit by healthy firms at a time of low investment and a shift to less tangible assets european and global supervisors such as the financial stability board have warned of the risks created by the rise in covenant light unsecured loans by banks these are subsequently repackaged as collateralised loan obligations clos and sold to bond funds figures 1 3 taken from a recent fsb report show the rise in weakly protected unsecured loans and their collateralisation fsb 2019 figure 1 global covenant light share of issuance 12 month rolling average 2000 2019 source fsb figure 2 debt to ebitda ratios 2010 2019 source fsb based on data from jp morgan figure 3 leveraged loans issued in a given vintage as percentage share of total outstanding us eu and rest of world source fsb based on bloomberg and ecb calculations further legal undermining of unsecured claims will lead to much larger bondholder if there are defaults in a recession it will certainly lead to extreme illiquidity in the entire clo segment a worrying echo of the last credit crisis since bond funds are subject to open redemptions on demand the chances of market panic are not to be underestimated the limited attention paid to this phenomenon by central banks the first line of defence on financial stability is surprising in part this reflects the more limited threat for banks the shift may even reduce the nonperforming loan problem for many eu banks but only by shunting losses elsewhere the legal perspective on the insolvency reform the benchmark apr plays a role when the requisite majority of all voting classes do not accept a restructuring a non consensual plan and it becomes binding through a so called cross class cram down mechanism applied by courts the initial draft of the directive required the mandatory inclusion of the apr as a condition for enforcing a non consensual plan to protect the legal interests of dissenting classes inspired by us chapter 11 the apr ensures shareholders do not retain any interest in a reorganised company unless creditors who agreed to financial concessions give their consent but in a surprising last minute change the legislators introduced a vaguely formulated european priority rule as the preferred alternative to the tried and tested apr the eu rpr provides that dissenting creditors only need to be treated more favourably than junior classes such as shareholders and subordinated creditors the concept of relativity of treatment of different classes is extraordinarily imprecise and the lack of clarity on how an eu rpr would assign value among stakeholders exacerbates this uncertainty shareholders are residual claimants so their relative treatment cannot in any sensible way be benchmarked by a pay out percentage the eu rpr would also facilitate strategic gifting when creditors senior to dissenting claimants redirect a part of the distributed value from their own share to a class junior to the dissenting class this priority jumping activity de facto provides an opportunity to overcome objections and expropriate unsecured creditors this is a higher risk in jurisdictions with weak governance rules that furnish shareholders with controlling competences such as the possibility of granting shareholders an exclusive right of proposing a restructuring plan under the directives secured creditors that engage in gifting may transfer some value to the equity sponsor of the debtor the plan maker to draft a plan that favours them neglecting the interests of other creditors gifting is legally controversial in many priority regimes but if jurisdictions opt for an rpr instead it is much less likely that any creditor could successfully challenge a gift plan there are reasons to believe that the eu rpr has been advanced with limited attention to its consequences and certainly with no coherent academic analysis the european law institute eli report made references to american legal scholars claiming they supported the principle of relative priority us legal scholars have differing views but they respect non bankruptcy rights and aim at facilitating negotiation under uncertain valuation for distressed firms in contrast the directive allows an unprecedented and unjustifiable shift undermining the rights of unsecured creditors 1 a financial stability view in an idealised modigliani miller world additional risks resulting from the application of the eu rpr would be priced unfortunately recent evidence from macro and finance research shows that bond investors are often oblivious to rising risks at times of abundant funding and falling standards as recalled in the recent speech at the ecb by jeremy stein leading harvard professor and a former fed board member the reform would compound the problem for dispersed market participants who historically relied on banks as gatekeeper of bond issuance establishing covenants to protect them from excessive risk taking trade creditors tax authorities and company pension funds are also in a weak position without apr weak credit demand has left banks with fewer lending opportunities while demand for highly leveraged loans by private equity has increased the rapid expansion of unsecured clos by banks has caused alarm at the fsb which two months ago issued a report highlighting financial stability risks associated with this development fsb 2019 an rpr regime at a time of modest growth aggravates risk taking positive returns would be captured by shareholders while losses would be borne by the unsecured creditors poorly designed bankruptcy reform clearly creates financial stability risks unsecured bonds supported only by weak covenants would face huge losses if there are defaults in a recession and their liquidity would plummet once investors recognised the downside risk diffused illiquidity driven by uncertain losses would be a serious problem for bond mutual funds committed to redemptions on demand mutual funds will not go bust if their share prices were to collapse but they may be forced into liquidation or seek closed fund status with massive damage to confidence on both liquidity and safety in the euro area there is also the question of the extent to which central banks would be able to resist demands for liquidity support for these unregulated shadow banks and so unquestionably a reckless rpr would undermine the eu s capital market union objectives to develop market alternatives to bank financing whatever the merit of a softer bankruptcy regime economic circumstances in the eu hardly justify such a major shift in eastern europe during the 1990s firms were burdened by excessive inherited debt yet attracted new investment as they integrated into international markets current conditions are much less favourable high firm leverage is a strategic choice by shareholders and private equity not a burden inherited from the past the main use of highly leveraged transactions at present is to fund large equity payouts rather than as investment conclusion eu national parliaments will be adjusting national bankruptcy law within two years a reckless shift to rpr as the preferred alternative to the classic benchmark rule will cause a rift between banks and private equity on one side and defenders of bondholders trade creditors tax authorities workers and pensioners on the other the effort to harmonise eu legislation is at

introduction a bullish view of the utes on friday seeking alpha sent to my e mail inbox a must read article titled utilities and xlu this hated sector continues to soar a great exit opportunity now exists i thought this was especially relevant as i had spent all week and most notably friday increasing my electric gas renewable energy exposure notably having discussed these which i will also just call utes nysearca xlu in this article several times over the years i thought that this might be a good time to weigh in again both because seeking alpha highlighted that bear point of view but also in view of the drop in 30 year t bond rates to record lows friday note my core argument is 3 fold long term rates continue in a bull declining trend the xlu has under performed the s p 500 spy the past 10 years high quality utes offer alpha in the current interest rate and growth environment later in the article i will provide some discussion of three of my largest utilities not all of the ones i am long before then let s look at these points in order bonds are still ok but utilities look like more attractive total return vehicles friday the most free market part of the fixed income market namely very long term bonds whose yield is virtually unaffected by federal reserve policy dropped to the lowest yield ever data by ycharts for some reason ycharts does not show rates back in the 1980s the downtrend shown above began in q2 1981 i have estimated about a 0 25 0 30 rate drop per year over the past 30 years note the chart s gap in the 2000s relates to a period where no new 30 year bonds were sold by the government the drop in rates has been accompanied by a notably smaller drop in realized inflation rates however meaning that the real return to buy and hold bond investors has declined since the palmy days of vigilantes in the 80s what i think tends to keep the long term bond market in its downtrend are three key points comparable rates are much lower in other safe havens i e around zero in germany and japan for 30 year govvies see bloomberg as one source bloomberg baby bust continues in us and other developed countries growing role of tech in us and global economy good deflation if one is a european retiree or running investments for a wealthy family and thinking of long term safety why settle for zero from a long german bund or 1 0 from a uk gilt why not take the yield step up from a potentially stronger long term currency and buy american i think this dynamic can go on a long ways given that realized inflation in germany is 1 5 yoy almost the same as in the us so even if inflation does not decline it is possible for long term rates in the us to trend down because of global interest rate dynamics the xlu can play catch up and then some with the spy first a short term comment the utes have had quite a run and are well positioned technically to move sideways even if the intermediate trend months up to a year or so is to generate alpha a longer term view is 10 years including dividends the spy has returned 13 40 per year the xlu has returned 11 60 yet the country requires electricity and heat to grow this applies to the high tech and media industries that have driven a disproportionate amount of the ongoing and expected future growth so it s not clear that this imbalance should and or will remain perhaps it s time for essential basic industries to rise in total return because 2009 was such a depressed time i will use a spreadsheet found on an s p web page that shows 2010 eps and expectations for 2020 these were 77 and 161 respectively this calculates to 7 65 cagr using non gaap numbers gives similar results adding dividends would bring the total to roughly 9 65 the rest of the total return comes from p e expansion the utes also have had p e expansion but one other point about the spy is that earnings have also come from operating margin expansion per the same web page the average operating margin was about 8 7 in 2010 in 2019 this was much higher around 11 1 thus the spy has benefited two ways in addition to growing sales first by rising profitability to the highest levels since at least 2006 second by rising p e s on these potentially peak profits as a percentage of sales i lack similar data for utilities certainly p e s have risen as yields investors require from dividends have declined along with both high quality and junk bond yields however my guess is that profits as a percentage of sales have not changed much as the utes get the substantial majority of their earnings from their status as regulated local monopolies this special status means that public service commissions set maximum allowable returns on equity to conclude this section it is reasonable to think of a yield starved investing public gravitating more toward stable returns and for the utes to outperform the spy for years to come the main driver of this possibility in this view would be simply for investors to forecast operating margin reversion to the mean which in turn could be driven by labor finally increasing its share of national income toward its historical average at the expense of corporate profits meanwhile demand for the services provided by utilities could continue to grow apace how the utes can offer more than a less risky alternative to the spy part 1 i m actually bullish on the spy some short term over enthusiasm already being worked off last week so in this section i d like to take a different tack namely i d like to focus on the rising p e theme what i observe since charting stocks as an after school job in 1967 8 is that a secular shrinkage of p e s tends to be bearish for some years to come and a secular rise in p e s tends to be bullish applying this first to the rising bond price interest rate phenomenon of declining yields on long term bonds the past almost 39 years utilities have offered and may well continue to offer superior returns to bonds because dividends tend rise while fixed income payouts by definition do not rise take for instance wec energy wec a wisconsin based electric and nat gas company with certain unregulated activities i wrote about this bullishly twice first in november 2016 in wec energy a utility with attractive yield and price appreciation potential and again in june 2017 when i said if so as long as rates hang around below 2 2 on the 10 year and below 3 on the 30 year t bonds utility stocks may provide growing income while rising in price wec energy is highlighted as a strong performer that could provide alpha while the fed remains in a tightening mode today the fed is in a loosening mode nonetheless rates are not rising due to coronavirus and other factors the fed may have to cut rates again to keep the us dollar from getting too strong for our exporters and to reverse the current inversion in rates up to 5 years or so that said look at the stock price ascent of wec since those articles were written november 2016 about 55 june 2017 about 64 feb 21 2020 102 50 these are very strong returns the p e is now high but unlike a growth software stock with no dividend and very possibly gaap losses and perhaps non gaap losses as well or even a large company such as netflix nflx there is a well accepted metric to valuing wec this is dividend yield and growth sustainability characteristics of such compared with a bond yield typically in my case either a treasury or else a debt obligation of wec itself or a subsidiary of comparable credit quality to restate the point of this section as an income vehicle first and foremost a utility stock need not be compared with the spy and certainly not with the nasdaq 100 qqq it can be a strong choice because it can outperform sometimes dramatically fixed income no matter what bond rates do now let me discuss that last statement in more detail utes can grow again a utility dividend is not a bond and utilities are operating businesses with lots of risk i only invest in individual utes where i can assess the risk reward and where the reward includes growth potential i will focus on three types of growth beyond simple population growth or accretive bolt on regulated utility acquisitions first wec is taking a majority interest in a growing number of unregulated wind power assets discussing three recent deals on its latest conference call wec is an extremely well run company it is annually rated as the most reliable midwestern electric utility so when it engages in these deals i trust that they will be accretive to real accounting and just non gaap earnings the best run companies can grow in this sort of manner next consider the achievements of nextera energy nee i have written three articles on this and the titles tell a good deal of the story in the first of those articles with nee below 172 i made certain assumptions and using a discounted cash flow calculator came up with a 335 fair value for nee nee is up 62 since then and since it is 1 1 2 years later then given lower competing interest rates now greater acceptance of its focus on renewable energy and the time value of money presumably its fair value using similar assumptions is notably higher now than it was then nee exemplifies two ways a utility can generate growth one way is by engaging in best practices for running its business in nee this has been called project accelerate this capability has allowed nee to acquire gulf power and rapidly improve its efficiency thus nee can be a roll up of regulated utilities initially within florida but also next perhaps within south carolina so a ute can block and tackle better and grow accretively second nee focused on clean renewable energy and has developed its wholly owned subsidiary nextera energy resources as the world s leading producer of energy from wind and the sun neer accounts for nee s premium valuation thus a ute can grow by using its management skills and expertise in the energy creation and distribution business to innovate third consider little mdu resource group mdu mdu s main businesses now are in construction many of them related to the energy electricity business it retains certain conventional electric gas utility businesses in the montana dakota area therefore the md part of its corporate name business is thriving and i think there is significant value to be unlocked which could occur voluntarily if the board splits the company into at least two entities or else via a takeover or an activist investor i discussed mdu briefly on jan 9 this year in a multi stock review titled 10 for 20 under followed smaller buy and hold stocks with mdu then at 28 87 other utility companies have done similar things as mdu risks to re emphasize the market does not give something for nothing very often whether one owns a utility stock index such as xlu and there are others not limited to the us or individual stocks a lot can go wrong nuclear construction and operation of nuclear plants floods adverse regulation recession or rising inflation and many other problems can make utility stock investing a frustrating experience so please think carefully of the downside possibilities in this sector to see if utility stocks or funds are right for you or if you manage money your clients conclusions bullish on utes potential alpha versus the spy as interest rates on government bonds descend below current rates of consumer price inflation increasingly even a rated corporate bonds are only at best keeping up with inflation after tax this raises the question of whether utility stocks can provide competitive and superior income versus bonds while also serving over time as inflation hedges in view of this issue i like the utes in almost any rate environment so long as the company is well run even though i emphasized my observation that with the 30 year t bond breaking to all time lows friday the good thing about the utes is that they may provide attractive returns even in several rising rate scenarios as an overall summary my first main point is that the utes can do double duty on the one hand the market tends to view them as bond substitutes and they can outperform bonds handily on many time frames and with many types of fluctuation of the economy my second main point is that a regulated utility company can also be run by people who find ways to improve quality while lowering cost all the while being alert to growth in unregulated areas in adjacent fields to the core business so just because returns are limited from the regulated business the company can be a growing one and thereby reward its owners with alpha not simply from being better than a bond in addition these fundamental points xlu and all the above named utility stocks have had large runs in the past couple of months and may be ready to rest or settle back thus this article looks beyond short term price movements thanks for reading and sharing any thoughts you may wish to contribute

what s bbva outlook on the mexican economy and markets for 2020 in 2019 we saw a slump in strategic sectors such as oil production construction and sectors closely related to government spending and investment as a result the mexican economy flatlined but the slump was not generalized despite the lack of growth labor markets have been resilient evidence of the latter is the 1 7 growth of formal private employment and the low unemployment rate for 2020 we anticipate a mild economic recovery in mexico we believe that the government will deploy resources in a more effective way this year thus bolstering current spending and investment as the us economy is expected to continue growing the mexican economy should therefore be able to expand between 1 to 1 5 y y for 2020 we expect a 3 5 inflation rate well under control the main risks for this forecast are a poor budget execution and a further slowdown of us manufacturing never the less with the usmca deal signed by president trump and a phase one deal between china and usa agreed we see a constructive environment for local financial markets on the local front banco de méxico has ample leeway to continue cutting rates this year even though the board will most likely proceed at a cautious pace in this context we remain constructive on the mxn peso and see scope for an appreciation to 18 5 against the usd in the first half of the year in the second half we cannot rule out periods of higher volatility triggered by the us election mexico s credit rating remains at risk as two of the main rating agencies have a negative outlook for both the sovereign and pemex this story is not new however and in all likelihood it has been mostly priced into mexico s risk premium 2 which sectors are expected to grow more in 2019 we saw very low activity in the construction and infrastructure sector due to the lack of new projects being tendered on the other hand the sector recorded very important m a transactions such as the acquisition of relevant stakes in rco and ideal two of the largest toll roads operators in mexico these transactions showed the strong interest from international investors in long term projects that involve exposure to mexico s gdp growth we believe this appetite will continue in 2020 construction should improve as the government flagship infrastructure projects are expected to accelerate their development and modifications to toll road concession titles announced by the sct last year will be signed in the telecom industry the growing demand for data will drive investment a friendlier government stance is being perceived by the telecommunications sector one that doesn t involve more regulations like the ones that ended up impacting its value during the previous administrations this environment is favoring a more rational competition dynamic that is based on price increases in the mobile phone segment and wider margins resulting from the digitalization of operations as a result companies will compete by offering better geographical coverage and quality service and thus they will require to rent a higher number of telecommunication towers in mexico it is also important to underline that the communications sector has a more friendly government policy and a more rational competitive environment ie price increases in the wireless segment that should drive competition towards improving geographic coverage and quality of services the healthcare sector is poised for growth because of an existing environment of limited health coverage in the country but an increasing awareness of the need to prevent and treat diseases in 2019 a landmark transaction took place when cdpq the canadian pension fund acquired a minority stake in sanfer the largest mexican private pharmaceutical company in the country even though the energy sector has seen less activity due to uncertainty created by the public announcements in 2019 e g revision of tariffs in pipelines cels wheeling charges etc we believe the growing need for power generation whether investment is made by privates or cfe directly will bring more activity to the sector in 2020 we think real estate will benefit from the ratification of the usmca and the continued interest rate cuts by mexico s central bank we expect industrial real estate to be the best performer within the sector 3 what is the outlook on the national infrastructure plan the mexican government has already published a private sector infrastructure program whereby it commits to give the development projects the necessary administrative facilities to meet their schedule it does not however offer any funding or guarantees to the private sector the program amounts nearly 40 billion and markets have perceived it as a signal of confidence in the current administration the financial sector including us awaits the publication of the national infrastructure plan to outline priorities and guidelines for developing public infrastructure regardless we have already seen positive signals since the government announced last november 147 infrastructure projects that will be financed by the public sector in the coming four years in addition to this soon the government will announce the energy sector investment plan no doubt the implementation of the national infrastructure plan will play a role on investor s confidence and thru that channel become a catalyst for economic growth 4 what is bbva mexico s role in this environment bbva remains mexico s largest and most important financial group we have had a
