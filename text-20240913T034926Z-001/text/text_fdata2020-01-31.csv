the union minister for finance corporate affairs smt nirmala sitharaman presented the economic survey 2019 20 in the parliament today the key highlights of the economic survey 2019 20 are as follows wealth creation the invisible hand supported by the hand of trust india s dominance as global economic power for three fourths of economic history manifests by design kautilya s arthashastra postulates the role of prices in an economy spengler 1971 historically indian economy relied on the invisible hand of the market with the support of the hand of trust o invisible hand of the market reflected in openness in economic transactions o hand of trust appealed to ethical and philosophical dimensions post liberalisation indian economy supports both pillars of the economic model advocated in our traditional thinking survey illustrates enormous benefits accruing from enabling the invisible hand of the market exponential rise in india s gdp and gdp per capita post liberalisation coincides with wealth generation survey shows that the liberalized sectors grew significantly faster than the closed ones need for the hand of trust to complement the invisible hand illustrated by financial sector performance during 2011 13 survey posits that india s aspiration to become a 5 trillion economy depends critically on o strengthening the invisible hand of the market o supporting it with the hand of trust strengthening the invisible hand by promoting pro business policies to provide equal opportunities for new entrants enable fair competition and ease doing business eliminate policies unnecessarily undermining markets through government intervention enable trade for job creation efficiently scale up the banking sector introducing the idea of trust as a public good which gets enhanced with greater use survey suggests that policies must empower transparency and effective enforcement using data and technology entrepreneurship and wealth creation at the grassroots entrepreneurship as a strategy to fuel productivity growth and wealth creation india ranks third in number of new firms created as per the world bank new firm creation in india increased dramatically since 2014 o 12 2 cumulative annual growth rate of new firms in the formal sector during 2014 18 compared to 3 8 during 2006 2014 o about 1 24 lakh new firms created in 2018 an increase of about 80 from about 70 000 in 2014 survey examines the content and drivers of entrepreneurial activity at the bottom of the administrative pyramid over 500 districts in india new firm creation in services is significantly higher than that in manufacturing infrastructure or agriculture survey notes that grassroots entrepreneurship is not just driven by necessity a 10 percent increase in registration of new firms in a district yields a 1 8 increase in gross domestic district product gddp entrepreneurship at district level has a significant impact on wealth creation at the grassroots birth of new firms in india is heterogeneous and dispersed across districts and sectors literacy and education in a district foster local entrepreneurship significantly o impact is most pronounced when literacy is above 70 per cent o new firm formation is the lowest in eastern india with lowest literacy rate 59 6 as per 2011 census physical infrastructure quality in the district influences new firm creation significantly ease of doing business and flexible labour regulation enable new firm creation especially in the manufacturing sector survey suggests enhancing ease of doing business and implementing flexible labour laws can create maximum jobs in districts and thereby in the states pro business versus pro markets survey says that india s aspiration of becoming a 5 trillion economy depends critically on o promoting pro business policy that unleashes the power of competitive markets to generate wealth o weaning away from pro crony policy that may favour specific private interests especially powerful incumbents viewed from the lens of the stock market creative destruction increased significantly post liberalisation o before liberalisation a sensex firm expected to stay in it for 60 years which decreased to only 12 years after liberalisation o every five years one third of sensex firms are churned out reflecting the continuous influx of new firms products and technologies into the economy despite impressive progress in enabling competitive markets pro crony policies destroyed value in the economy o an equity index of connected firms significantly outperformed market by 7 a year from 2007 to 2010 reflecting abnormal profits extracted at common citizens expense o in contrast the index underperforms market by 7 5 from 2011 reflecting inefficiency and value destruction inherent in such firms pro crony policies such as discretionary allocation of natural resources till 2011 led to rent seeking by beneficiaries while competitive allocation of the same post 2014 ended such rent extraction similarly crony lending that led to wilful default wherein promoters collectively siphoned off wealth from banks led to losses that dwarf subsidies for rural development undermining markets when government intervention hurts more than it helps government intervention though well intended often ends up undermining the ability of the markets to support wealth creation and leads to outcomes opposite to those intended four examples of anachronistic government interventions essential commodities act eca 1955 o frequent and unpredictable imposition of blanket stock limits on commodities under eca distorts the incentives for the creation of storage infrastructure by the private sector movement up the agricultural value chain development of national market for agricultural commodities o imposition of stock limits on dal in 2006 q3 sugar in 2009 q1 and onions in september 2019 spiked up the volatility of the retail and wholesale prices of onions o the ministry of consumer affairs must examine whether the eca is relevant in today s india o with raids having abysmally low conviction rate and no impact on prices the eca only seems to enable rent seeking and harassment o survey suggests there is clear evidence for jettisoning this anachronistic legislation drug price control under eca o the regulation of prices of drugs through the dpco 2013 led to increase in the price of the regulated pharmaceutical drug vis Ã  vis that of an unregulated but similar drug o the increase in prices is greater for more expensive formulations than for cheaper ones and for those sold in hospitals rather than retail shops o these findings reinforce that the outcome is opposite to what dpco aims to do making drugs affordable o government being a huge buyer of drugs can intervene more effectively to provide affordable drugs by combining all its purchases and exercising its bargaining power o ministry of health and family welfare must evolve non distortionary mechanisms that utilise government s bargaining power in a transparent manner government intervention in grain markets o policies in the food grain markets led to emergence of government as the largest procurer and hoarder of rice and wheat crowding out of private trade burgeoning food subsidy burden inefficiencies in the markets affecting the long run growth of agricultural sector o the food grains policy needs to be dynamic and allow switching from physical handling and distribution of food grains to cash transfers food coupons smart cards debt waivers o analysis of debt waivers given by states centre full waiver beneficiaries consume less save less invest less and are less productive after the waiver compared to the partial beneficiaries debt waivers disrupt the credit culture they reduce formal credit flow to the very same farmers thereby defeating the purpose survey suggests that o government must systematically examine areas of needless intervention and undermining of markets but it does not argue that there should be no government intervention o instead it suggests that the interventions that were apt in a different economic setting may have lost their relevance in a transformed economy o eliminating such instances will enable competitive markets spurring investments and economic growth creating jobs and growth by specializing in network products survey says india has unprecedented opportunity to chart a china like labour intensive export trajectory by integrating assemble in india for the world into make in india india can o raise its export market share to about 3 5 by 2025 and 6 by 2030 o create 4 crore well paid jobs by 2025 and 8 crore by 2030 exports of network products can provide one quarter of the increase in value added required for making india a 5 trillion economy by 2025 survey suggests a strategy similar to one used by china to grab this opportunity o specialization at large scale in labour intensive sectors especially network products o laser like focus on enabling assembling operations at mammoth scale in network products o export primarily to markets in rich countries o trade policy must be an enabler survey analyses the impact of india s trade agreements on overall trade balance o india s exports increased by 13 4 for manufactured products and 10 9 for total merchandise o imports increased by 12 7 for manufactured products and 8 6 per cent for total merchandise o india gained 0 7 increase in trade surplus per year for manufactured products and 2 3 per year for total merchandise targeting ease of doing business in india a jump of 79 positions to 63 in 2019 from 142 in 2014 in world bank s doing business rankings from 142 in 2014 in world bank s doing business rankings india still trails in parameters such as ease of starting business registering property paying taxes and enforcing contracts survey has numerous case studies o for merchandise exports the logistics process flow for imports is more efficient than that for exports o electronics exports and imports through bengaluru airport illustrate how indian logistical processes can be world class the turnaround time of ships in india has almost halved to 2 48 days in 2018 19 from 4 67 days in 2010 11 suggestions for further ease of doing business o close coordination between the logistics division of the ministry of commerce and industry the central board of indirect taxes and customs ministry of shipping and the different port authorities o individual sectors such as tourism or manufacturing require a more targeted approach that maps out the regulatory and process bottlenecks for each segment golden jubilee of bank nationalisation taking stock survey observes 2019 as the golden jubilee year of bank nationalization accomplishments of lakhs of public sector banks psbs employees cherished and an objective assessment of psbs suggested by the survey since 1969 india s banking sector has not developed proportionately to the growth in the size of the economy india has only one bank in the global top 100 same as countries that are a fraction of its size finland about 1 11th denmark 1 8th etc a large economy needs an efficient banking sector to support its growth the onus of supporting the economy falls on the psbs accounting for 70 of the market share in indian banking o psbs are inefficient compared to their peer groups on every performance parameter o in 2019 investment for every rupee in psbs on average led to the loss of 23 paise while in npbs it led to the gain of 9 6 paise o credit growth in psbs has been much lower than npbs for the last several years solutions to make psbs more efficient o employee stock ownership plan esop for psbs employees o representation on boards proportionate to the blocks held by employees to incentivize employees and align their interests with that of all shareholders of banks o creation of a gstn type entity that will aggregate data from all psbs and use technologies like big data artificial intelligence and machine learning in credit decisions for ensuring better screening and monitoring of borrowers especially the large ones financial fragility in the nbfc sector survey investigates the key drivers of rollover risk of the shadow banking system in india in light of the current liquidity crunch in the sector key drivers of rollover risk o asset liability management alm risk o interconnectedness risk o financial and operating resilience of an nbfc o over dependence on short term wholesale funding survey computes a diagnostic health score by quantifying the rollover risk for a sample of hfcs and retail nbfcs which are representative of their respective sectors the analysis of the health score has the following findings o the hfc sector exhibited a declining trend post 2014 and overall health of the sector worsened considerably by the end of fy2019 o the score of the retail nbfc sector was consistently below par for the period 2014 19 o larger retail nbfcs had higher health scores but among medium and small retail nbfcs the medium size ones had a lower score for the entire period of 2014 19 survey suggests that the health score provides an early warning signal of impending liquidity problems equity markets react favourably to increase in health score of individual hfcs and retail nbfcs the survey prescribes this analysis to efficiently allocate liquidity enhancements across firms with different health scores in the nbfc sector thereby arresting financial fragility in a capital efficient manner privatization and wealth creation survey examines the realized efficiency gains from privatization in the indian context and bolsters the case for aggressive disinvestment of cpses in the indian context and bolsters the case for aggressive disinvestment of cpses strategic disinvestment of government s shareholding of 53 29 per cent in hpcl led to an increase of around rs 33 000 crore in national wealth survey presents an analysis of the before after performance of 11 cpses which underwent strategic disinvestment from 1999 2000 to 2003 04 o financial indicators such as net worth net profit return on assets roa return on equity roe etc of the privatized cpses on an average have improved significantly o privatized cpses have been able to generate more wealth from the same resources survey suggests aggressive disinvestment of cpses to o bring in higher profitability o promote efficiency o increase competitiveness o promote professionalism is india s gdp growth overstated no gdp growth is a critical variable for decision making by investors and policymakers therefore the recent debate about accuracy of india s gdp estimation following the revised estimation methodology in 2011 is extremely significant as countries differ in several observed and unobserved ways cross country comparisons have to be undertaken by separating the effect of other confounding factors and isolating effect of methodology revision alone on gdp growth estimates models that incorrectly over estimate gdp growth by 2 7 for india post 2011 also misestimate gdp growth over the same period for 51 out of 95 countries in the sample several advanced economies such as uk germany and singapore have their gdps misestimated with incompletely specified econometric model correctly specified models that account for all unobserved differences and differential trends in gdp growth across countries fail to find any misestimating of growth in india or other countries concerns of a misestimated indian gdp are unsubstantiated by the data and are thus unfounded thalinomics the economics of a plate of food in india an attempt to quantify what a common person pays for a thali across india a shift in the dynamics of thali prices since 2015 16 absolute prices of a vegetarian thali have decreased significantly since 2015 16 across india and the four regions though the price has increased during 2019 20 post 2015 16 average household gained close to rs 11 000 on average per year from the moderation in prices in the case of vegetarian thali average household that consumes two

balance improved from 2009 14 to 2014 19 although most of the improvement in the latter period was due to more than 50 decline in crude prices in 2016 17 india s top five trading partners continue to

crude in total imports increasing imports to gdp ratio significant gold imports also correlate india s total imports with gold prices however share of gold imports in total imports remained the same during 2018 19 and the first half of 2019 20 despite an increase in prices possibly due to increase in import duty that reduced the import of gold non pol non gold imports are positively correlated with gdp growth non pol non oil imports fell as a proportion to gdp from 2009 14 to 2014 19 when gdp growth accelerated this may be because of consumption driven growth while investment rate declined

miscellaneous group during 2019 20 april december food and beverages was the main contributor among food and beverages inflation in vegetables and pulses was particularly high due to low base effect and production side disruptions like untimely rain cob web phenomenon for pulses farmers base their sowing decisions on prices witnessed in the previous marketing period measures to safeguard farmers like procurement under price stabilisation fund psf minimum support price msp need to be made more effective divergence between retail and wholesale price observed for essential agricultural commodities in four metropolitan cities of the country from 2014 to 2019 divergence particularly high for vegetables like onion and tomato this may be due to the presence of intermediaries and high transaction costs volatility of prices o volatility of prices for most of the essential food commodities with the exception of some of the pulses has actually come down in the period 2014 19 as compared to the period 2009 14 o lower volatility might indicate the presence of better marketing channels storage facilities and effective msp system regional variations o cpi c inflation has been

interconnectedness risk o financial and operating resilience of an nbfc o over dependence on short term wholesale funding survey computes a diagnostic health score by quantifying the rollover risk for a sample of hfcs and retail nbfcs which are representative of their respective sectors the analysis of the health score has the following findings o the hfc sector exhibited a declining trend post 2014 and overall health of the sector worsened considerably by the end of fy2019 o the score of the retail nbfc sector was consistently below par for the period 2014 19 o larger retail nbfcs had higher health scores but among medium and small retail nbfcs the medium size ones had a lower score for the entire period of 2014 19 survey suggests that the health score provides an early warning

accuracy of india s gdp estimation following the revised estimation methodology in 2011 is extremely significant as countries differ in several observed and unobserved ways cross country comparisons have to be undertaken by separating the effect of other confounding factors and isolating effect of methodology revision alone on gdp growth estimates models that incorrectly over estimate gdp growth by 2 7 for india post 2011 also misestimate gdp growth over the same period for 51 out of 95 countries in the sample several advanced economies such as uk germany and singapore have their gdps misestimated with incompletely specified econometric model correctly specified models that account for all unobserved differences and differential trends in gdp growth across countries fail to find any misestimating of growth in india or other countries concerns of a misestimated indian gdp are unsubstantiated by the data and are thus unfounded 11 thalinomics the economics of a plate of food in

wealth creation india ranks third in number of new firms created as per the world bank new firm creation in india increased dramatically since 2014 a 12 2 cumulative annual growth rate of new firms in the formal sector during 2014 18 compared to 3 8 during 2006 2014 b about 1 24 lakh new firms created in 2018 an increase of about 80 from about 70 000 in 2014 survey examines the content and drivers of entrepreneurial activity at the bottom of the administrative pyramid over 500 districts in india new firm creation in services is significantly higher than that in manufacturing infrastructure or agriculture survey notes that grassroots entrepreneurship is not just driven by necessity a 10 increase in registration of new firms in a district yields a 1 8 increase in gross domestic district product gddp entrepreneurship at district level has a significant impact on wealth creation at the grassroots birth of new firms in india is heterogeneous and dispersed across districts and sectors literacy and education in a district foster local entrepreneurship significantly a impact is most pronounced when literacy is above 70 per cent b new firm formation is the lowest in eastern india with lowest literacy rate 59 6 as per 2011 census physical infrastructure quality in the district influences new firm creation significantly ease of doing business and flexible labour regulation enable new firm creation especially in the manufacturing sector survey suggests enhancing ease of doing business and implementing flexible labour laws can create maximum jobs in districts and thereby in the states pro business versus pro markets survey says that india s aspiration of becoming a 5 trillion economy depends critically on a promoting pro business policy that unleashes the power of competitive markets to generate wealth b weaning away from pro crony policy that may favour specific private interests especially powerful incumbents viewed from the lens of the stock market creative destruction increased significantly post liberalisation a before liberalisation a sensex firm expected to stay in it for 60 years which decreased to only 12 years after liberalisation b every five years one third of sensex firms are churned out reflecting the continuous influx of new firms products and technologies into the economy despite impressive progress in enabling competitive markets pro crony policies destroyed value in the economy a an equity index of connected firms significantly outperformed market by 7 a year from 2007 to 2010 reflecting abnormal profits extracted at common citizens expense b in contrast the index underperforms market by 7 5 from 2011 reflecting inefficiency and value destruction inherent in such firms pro crony policies such as discretionary allocation of natural resources till 2011 led to rent seeking by beneficiaries while competitive allocation of the same post 2014 ended such rent extraction similarly crony lending that led to wilful default wherein promoters collectively siphoned off wealth from banks led to losses that dwarf subsidies for rural development undermining markets when govt intervention hurts more than it helps government intervention though well intended often ends up undermining the ability of the markets to support wealth creation and leads to outcomes opposite to those intended four examples of anachronistic government interventions 1 essential commodities act eca 1955 frequent and unpredictable imposition of blanket stock limits on commodities under eca distorts the incentives for the creation of storage infrastructure by the private sector movement up the agricultural value chain development of national market for agricultural commodities imposition of stock limits on dal in 2006 q3 sugar in 2009 q1 and onions in september 2019 spiked up the volatility of the retail and wholesale prices of onions the ministry of consumer affairs must examine whether the eca is relevant in today s india with raids having abysmally low conviction rate and no impact on prices the eca only seems to enable rent seeking and harassment survey suggests there is clear evidence for jettisoning this anachronistic legislation 2 drug price control under eca the regulation of prices of drugs through the dpco 2013 led to increase in the price of the regulated pharmaceutical drug vis Ã  vis that of an unregulated but similar drug the increase in prices is greater for more expensive formulations than for cheaper ones and for those sold in hospitals rather than retail shops these findings reinforce that the outcome is opposite to what dpco aims to do making drugs affordable government being a huge buyer of drugs can intervene more effectively to provide affordable drugs by combining all its purchases and exercising its bargaining power ministry of health and family welfare must evolve non distortionary mechanisms that utilise government s bargaining power in a transparent manner 3 government intervention in grain markets policies in the food grain markets led to emergence of government as the largest procurer and hoarder of rice and wheat crowding out of private trade burgeoning food subsidy burden inefficiencies in the markets affecting the long run growth of agricultural sector the food grains policy needs to be dynamic and allow switching from physical handling and distribution of food grains to cash transfers food coupons smart cards 4 debt waivers analysis of debt waivers given by states centre full waiver beneficiaries consume less save less invest less and are less productive after the waiver compared to the partial beneficiaries debt waivers disrupt the credit culture they reduce formal credit flow to the very same farmers thereby defeating the purpose survey suggests that government must systematically examine areas of needless intervention and undermining of markets but it does not argue that there should be no government intervention instead it suggests that the interventions that were apt in a different economic setting may have lost their relevance in a transformed economy eliminating such instances will enable competitive markets spurring investments and economic growth creating jobs and growth survey says india has unprecedented opportunity to chart a china like labour intensive export trajectory by integrating assemble in india for the world into make in india india can raise its export market share to about 3 5 by 2025 and 6 by 2030 create 4 crore well paid jobs by 2025 and 8 crore by 2030 exports of network products can provide one quarter of the increase in value added required for making india a 5 trillion economy by 2025 survey suggests a strategy similar to one used by china to grab this opportunity specialization at large scale in labour intensive sectors especially network products laser like focus on enabling assembling operations at mammoth scale in network products export primarily to

credicorp jorg friedemann citibank tibad alessandri credicorp yuri fernandes jp morgan operator ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by and welcome to the q4 2019 banco santander chile earnings conference call i would now like to hand the conference over to cfo emiliano muratore please go ahead sir emiliano muratore good morning everyone welcome to banco santander chile s fourth quarter 2019 results webcast and conference call this is emiliano muratore cfo and i m joined today by robert moreno managing director of investor relations and our chief economist claudio soto thank you for attending today s conference call despite a challenging quarter we have made advances in our strategy and look forward to sharing with you our progress before we get into our results claudio will give us some insight into the macro environment and our expectations for the rest of the year claudio soto thank you emiliano activity contracted abruptly in the fourth quarter due to the social unrest that affected chile october s effect fell more than 5 against september in november there was a partially recovered with a 1 gain we estimate activity continued to improve in december as the social unrest received all in all we estimate the economic fell by more than 2 year on year in the last quarter and the year as a whole expanded 1 1 going forward activity will depend to a large extent on the domestic political scenario confidence has declined and risk premia have increased on top of that uncertainty regarding the constitutional process will affect new investment projects against that backdrop a substantial fiscal stimulus will help to support domestic demand on the other hand the real depreciation of the peso of about 10 will boost exports all in all we see a 4 decline in gross capital formation for the year as a whole private consumption will expand at around 1 and export will speed up to 3 3 gdp in total will grow 1 this year until now official figures do not show a significant deterioration in the labor market however layoffs during the last days of december increased relevantly although we estimate that there won t be significant layoffs in the coming months job creation will slow down therefore unemployment will increase up to 8 to 8 5 during the year cpi inflation increased in the last month and closed 2019 just at the 3 part of the central bank which led to a u s inflation variation of 2 7 during the first quarter cpi inflation will increase above 3 5 driven by the currency depreciation however in the second part of the year it will slow down as the low growth of the economy creates slackness after an important cut in monetary policy rate in mid 2019 we do not expect further cut this year the central bank made clear that while they are intervening the fx market a rate cap will be incoherent moreover given the volatility seen in financial asset prices we estimate the board will be particularly careful in deciding its next move regarding fiscal policy we estimate the public deficit will reach between 4 5 to 5 of gdp thus public debt will rise fast when the government has room to expand its expenditure a credible commitment towards a fiscal consolidation in the future will be important to ensure the debt converted towards a reasonable level the associated topic with goodness during the last weeks was spurred by several factors including a slower economic growth after the commodity boom a persistent although declining in equality lack of safety nets for the growing middle class and corruption scanners at different levels in response to this event almost all political parties agreed to launch a process for an eventual changes change in the constitution the process begins with a referendum that will take place on april 26 citizens will decide if they want a new constitution or not and if so which body will write it down writing the eventual new constitution each have to go in it will have to be approved by 2 3 of the constituent body once written the new constitution will be put back to chileans in a second referendum that we estimate will take place in march 2022 in parallel the government is looking to speed up some of the reforms that were already in discussion with the bill that modernizes the tax system to be approved this week in its new design there will be no full integration of the income tax as it is it was originally proposed and there will be a focus on helping the smaller enterprises and increased taxes to the wealthy in this reform the government seeks to collect an additional clp 2 2 billion regarding pensions 1 of the more demanded reform by the commission the ammendment deal proposed increasing the mandatory contribution from 10 up to 16 with increased charge to the per year of the extra contribution 3 will finance a new solidarity fund this reform will be implemented over a 12 year transition period emiliano muratore okay thank you claudio if we move now on to slide 7 i wanted to also briefly discuss some of the reforms and regulations that may affect the bank both positively and maybe negatively just to note not all of these reforms are finalized and many are in the initial discussions firstly beginning in january 1 of this year there is already in place a new regulation where banks have to automatically use available checking account funds to pay off our clients associated credit line this will have an impact on nims around 8 basis points this year another potential risk going forward is more consumer protection through fraud compensation there is ongoing discussion about limiting the responsibility of clients in case of loss threat or fraud of debit and credit cards in light of these developments we are trying to limit the exposure of our clients to credit card fraud through education marketing campaigns daily transfer amount limits better chip technology improved atm software and other technological improvements but we cannot assure this level will not increase the financial cost related to cyber crime credit card fraud and insurance coverage as many of you know our regulator has been publishing the regulations for the implementation of basel iii in chile just this week the regulator published the model for risk weighted of credit risk from our preliminary evaluation this is broadly in line with our expectations and we continue to believe that the effect of on our bank should be neutral to positive in terms of our capital ratios according to the bank regulator credit risk weighted assets would decrease 20 for the system under this new method we are still estimating the impact for us by december of this year banks must publish the risk weighted assets under basel iii other possible developments which we view as positive are the creation of a consolidated positive credit bureau and what is called financial portability these 2 measures should improve bank penetration levels especially through the development of new digital banking services moving on to slide 8 we wanted to give a strategy update of the bank 2019 was a landmark year in innovations as we see on slide 9 super digital was piloted and launched and now has over 18 000 clients during the first half of 2020 we will have the official launch of super digital which was postponed in the fourth quarter we also made advances in our acquiring business which we will go into detail shortly in november we also received the final approval from a regulator to acquire 51 of santander consumer and began consolidating this company in that month this portfolio represents around 1 of our total loan book 8 of our consumer loans and has an roe greater than 18 during the quarter our large program continued to grow strongly despite the social turmoil reaching over 136 000 clients a new private banking model will also be launched during the first half of this year on slide 10 we show the most relevant advances we made in the fourth quarter at the end of december the president of the bank claudio melandri made the first transaction through our acquiring system which is currently being piloted in our work effects we expect to roll this out in the first semester of 2020 acquiring business will be branded as getnet as we help grubstake build a global brand name in this business claire our digital insurance platform will also be launched during the first half of this year the subsidiary was officially created but we re still waiting for final regulatory approvals to start operations remember that this is a 100 digital platform where clients will be able to customize and compare different insurance products these 2 initiatives will help bolster our fee income in the coming years on slide 21 we can see that we had a strong client we also had a strong client growth in the last during the year during the fourth quarter despite the social unrest on average we opened more than 23 new accounts each month that means we managed to open 66 more accounts comparing to the same quarter of 2018 we also had the highest market share in terms of net increase in current accounts in 2019 we opened 26 of all new checking accounts in the market this also has given way to increase in client loyalty as well as digital clients as seen on slide 12 we measure loyalty as clients with at least 4 products who must also surpass a minimum usage and profitability standards throughout the year we had an increase in loyal high income individuals as well as smes digital clients also kept expanding increasing 13 reaching over 1 2 million clients our work in digitalization as well as other initiatives has also helped us improve our client satisfaction as seen on slide 13 we have consistently improved both our net promoter score and net global satisfaction closing the gap with our top contender another important topic that santander pushed during the year was esg as can be seen on slide 14 during last year our mission put in emphasis not only to be the best bank but to do so responsibly we have always been a market leader but this year we but in 2009 we put more focus on communicating our esg initiatives and this in turn help us to improve in many ranking and indices this year for example we were able to improve our esg score as measured by vigeo eiris from a limited score of 38 out of 100 to a robust score of 58 this put us well above our chilean and latin american peers and ranked us number8 in the world and number4 in emerging markets for the best esg standards for retail banks one such initiative in line with the responsible banking is that now our clients can compensate their carbon footprint as it can be seen on slide 15 we are the first bank in the country to give our clients the opportunity to become carbon neutral clients can compensate their full print to either directly buying certified carbon credits while contributing to an environmental project here in chile clients only have to go into their account online and they can see how many kilos of carbon dioxide they have admitted how much it translates into monetary terms and the breakdown of where the co2 emissions are coming from this initiative was launched during the end of november and during the month of december 312 tons of co2 were compensated through carbon credits clients also contributed to a to their foundation for a project in a national park close to coquimbo and in 1 month already 20 of the total financing of this project was achieved on slide 16 we show how our strategy and continue to pursue has also gained us in recognition for the second year in a row we were recognized within the top 3 in the country were best in corporate governance by a survey carried out by ernst young ey we are also very proud of climbing the ranks in great place to work from number5 place overall last year to number3 in companies with over 1 000 employees once again we were awarded bank of the year for 2019 by the renowned magazine the banker moving on to slide 17 we will now go into the results for the fourth quarter and the full year on slide 19 we show that net income attributable to our shareholders for 2019 was clp 552 billion translating to an roe of 16 7 remember that during the year we had an increase in provisions of clp 31 billion in july as the new model for smes set out by a regulator came into effect as a social unrest continued from october onwards we also decided to take on an additional provision of clp 16 billion for our consumer model when adjusted for these extraordinary provisions our roe reached 17 7 for the year please turn to slide 19 the bank s total deposits decreased 7 7 year over year and 2 7 quarter on quarter during the quarter the central bank lowered the monetary policy rate again by 25 to 1 75 this led to a decrease in cost of funds to lower time deposit costs on the other hand demand deposits had a record year in terms of growth in 2019 increasing 8 8 quarter on quarter and 17 8 year over year as a reminder demand deposits are noninterest bearing our liquidity ratios also remained healthy with the lcr ratio finishing the year at 143 and the nsfr at 108 on slide 20 we review loan growth total loans increased 8 1 in 2019 in line with guidance and 2 6 quarter on quarter loans to individual was the fastest growing segment in 2019 led by an increase in lending to high income earners this was also driven in part by the incorporation of santander consumer in november following the final approval from our regulator this contributed clp 451 billion of consumer loans as of december 2019 representing 8 of the consumer loan book going forward we expect loan growth of 5 for this year with more or less the same growth across all segments on slide 21 we show the evolution of nim the quarter on quarter increase in the net interest margin was mainly due to the higher uaf inflation rate a decrease of 25 basis points in the short term interest rate and the improved funding mix these positive effects were partially offset by the negative impact of lower long term interest rates that drove a record level of refinancing of mortgages in the year with this in mind on slide 22 we wanted to show you the evolution of certain market factors that should help to sustain margins in 2020 as you can see on this slide the yield on the central bank s 2 year note fell steadily during 2019 but began recovering during the fourth quarter this should help loan spreads at the same time the central bank cut the monetary policy rate issued lower funding costs during 2020 in addition we have seen an increase in inflation which is positive for margins we also expect a positive push from santander consumer which should boost margins by 10 basis points as well on the other hand we do have headwinds coming from the regulatory changes as well as slower economic growth therefore we are leaving our guidance for nims with a stable outlook for the year at around 4 1 on slide 23 we can see that the asset quality that asset quality had a slight deterioration during the quarter due to the social unrest in chile with npls and the impaired loan ratio increasing 10 basis points to 2 1 and 5 9 respectively by segment smes were the most affected within our loan book we have been proactive in trying to help our sme clients by either refinancing or giving grace periods for them to recover explaining the uptick in impaired commercial loans as well our coverage ratio increased in the consumer loan portfolio during the quarter as we set aside additional provisions for clp 16 billion to cover possible higher risk levels and any greater provisions required by the bank regulator for this portfolio in 2020 in mortgages we have maintained a focus on originating mortgage loans among high income earners and with an average loan to value below 80 this has been a key factor in maintaining healthy asset quality in this product moving on to slide 24 we can see that the cost of credit ended the fourth quarter at 1 9 and 1 3 for the whole year when adjusted by the onetime charge previously mentioned the cost of credit was 1 7 in the quarter incorporation of santander consumer had an effect on the cost of credit of 10 basis points in the quarter going forward our cost of credit should remain stable at 1 3 to 1 4 in 2020 due to the expected increase in unemployment lower economic growth of 1 for the year and the incorporation of santander consumer this will be partially contained by the bank s minimal exposure to low income retail lending only less than 1 of the loan book today is to low income earners on slide 25 we show how noninterest income was a positive contributor to our revenues this reflects that despite lower growth we successfully continued to generate greater business income with our new and existing clients financial transactions had an overall strong year especially in client treasury as demand for treasury products remained strong throughout 2019 fee income rebounded nicely in the second half of the year led by a rebound in card fees due to the migration of our cards to an interchange fee model and greater usage an increase in collection fees from santander consumer which we started to consolidate in the quarter and an increase in financial advisory among our corporate clients in total noninterest income increased 25 in 2019 in 2020 fee income should continue to recover as many of our initiatives such as claire should begin contributing a new client and client loyalty growth remains high all in we expect non net interest income to rise above loan growth in 2020 on slide 26 we show our distribution network as of the end of the year we had 377 branches of which 53 were work cafÃ£ s during the social unrest we had 70 branches which suffered damages with 15 inoperable most of the damage was covered by insurance which is reflected in other operating income in the quarter at the same time we recognized an impairment of clp 2 8 billion due to destroyed assets and branches we do not expect any material additional charges due to social unrest in 2020 however our digital channels have been able to serve our clients efficiently during these times driving upward our productivity levels in 2020 employee headcount decreased compared to last year however when compared to the previous quarter sorry there was an uptick as we began consolidating santander consumer the incorporation of santander consumer added about 200 employees to the bank headcount going forward we do not believe headcount should increase further please turn to slide 27 operating expenses remained flat in the quarter with a year on year growth of 3 9 the bank consistently delivers world class levels of efficiency with a ratio of 38 3 in the quarter and 40 for the year the bank continues to spend on marketing communication cyber security and technology developments as well as improvements to our distribution network but the efficiency ratio should remain around 40 for 2020 as well please turn to slide 28 as of december 2019 we reached a core capital ratio of 10 1 and our bis ratio reached 12 9 the solid capital ratios at the end of the quarter gives the bank room to grow and to continue implementing our investment plan as we stated before the cmf has been publishing a series of regulations that map out the transition of bank to basel iii firstly the cmf published for discussion the definition of systemic banks the regulator then published for discussion the determination of the operational risk coefficient which are all very much in line with the recommendations made by the basel community in basel iv we estimate that operational risk should add on around 7 to our risk weighted assets very much in line with our original estimates more recently this week the regulator published for discussion the credit risk ratings according to the regulator using information for december 2018 the regulations proposed should reduce credit risk assets by 23 compared to current regulations which will lead to a total savings for the industry of usd 4 5 billion however this will be compensated by the incorporation of operational and market risk we continue to believe that the transition to basel iii or iv will be neutral to positive for this bank in 2019 we distributed an annual dividend of 60 of the previous year s profits which led to a dividend yield of 3 7 for 2020 we expect a similar level of payout which places our current dividend yield at above 4 the final dividend proposal will be decided by the board in march to finalize we will now move on to our outlook for 2020 on slide 30 the social unrest in chile continues to create uncertainty in the local economy we expect investment to contract in 2020 it should be compensated by the export sector and higher fiscal spending from the reforms initiatives proposed to address the social issues however our ambitious investment plan which is focused on digitalization and technological improvements and new businesses such as acquiring will continue to progress in 2020 we expect loan growth in 2020 to reach 5 with higher growth coming from retail loans margin should benefit from higher inflation particularly in the first semester and the impact of santander consumer however this will be compensated or may be compensated by regulatory changes such as the automatic payment of credit lines therefore nim should remain stable at around 4 1 our improving client service and digital channels has enhanced our ability to capture new clients and cross sell existing ones and this should continue driving noninterest income slightly above loan growth considering the expectations that unemployment will increase this year and the onetime provisions already taken in 2019 we now expect cost of credit to remain stable at 1 3 to 1 4 of loans average loans the efficiency ratio should also remain around 40 even including our ambitious investment plan and the effective tax rate will remain on average around 21 to 22 with this outlook we believe in return on average equity of around 17 is attainable at this time we will gladly answer any questions you may have question and answer session operator and our first question comes from the line of ernesto gabilondo with bank of america ernesto gabilondo my first question is in the economic outlook as you mentioned the economic growth is expected to decelerate in 2020 so considering the potential increase in chile s debt from 27 to 40 in the next years the implementation of a progressive tax reform the implementation of the pension reform and the challenges of reaching constitutional agreements do you see the possibility of a negative outlook for chile for the credit rating agencies later this year i will this will be my last my first question and then i will ask a couple of questions claudio soto okay okay first of all up to now credit agencies have been positive regarding the chile s outlook they have been supportive of the strategy the government is pursuing the information regarding the evolution of the deficit has been made public already since a couple of weeks so the agency is already incorporated that information into their evaluation and up to now in general the evolution is relatively positive now there are risk the risk a risk on the activity on the one hand in general we see more downside risk and upside risk for activity and also of course the impact of the expansion reform might not be completely incorporated in the forecast for the evolution of the public deficit into the future therefore we see some risk of a revision of the outlook for the economy in the future ernesto gabilondo great and then a couple of questions the first one is in terms of your expectations for loan growth so we know this loan growth of 8 in 2019 i think it was partially explained by the acquisition of a consumer portfolio but how do you see the organic and total loan growth in 2020 under this scenario you mentioned 5 but i just want to know if this is considering an organic growth or it s excluding the consumer portfolio and especially i will appreciate your expectations in the sme segment we have seen several merchants that have not been able to reopen their businesses and we think that social unrest is expected to come back in march after being in holidays and then my last question is if it will be reasonable to expect low to mid single digit earnings growth in 2020 and with that we will reach your 17 roe for this year emiliano muratore okay so the 5 is year end versus year end so it includes it s organic obviously in the first half of the year we re comparing it will be higher because we ll be including santander consumer compared to last year when we were not the one we reached the end of the year it should be around 5 so take that as our organic and smes smes is a large segment for the bank it s already 15 of the loan book and there we have companies that sell up to around 3 million but there s more than 200 000 companies and the focus will be obviously in the larger smes the smes that also are more involved in the export business chile has many sectors so there are sectors that are going to perform well this year as claudio said the export sectors should be have a strong year the prices of chile s exports have been relatively robust copper has been a little volatile but the other ones have been very very strong and we re obviously probably going to avoid some of the maybe the smaller smes until we have better economic figures and obviously in smes there s a lot of stores and commerce which suffered in october november we did see improvements in december and in january things have been really calm as you said we don t the march is a big question mark everyone is kind of on vacation now but given that the government has taken a lot of steps to reform to do reforms they announced the constitutional reforms i m not saying that social and rest will disappear but we don t believe it will be at the levels we saw in october november because a lot has been done and the democratic institutions are slowly churning out the reforms that everyone has been asking for so i would say smes are kind of the weak link in the loan book but we think things should slowly get better and not worse okay ernesto gabilondo perfect perfect thank you and then for my last question robert moreno about the net income growth emiliano muratore net income growth yes so exactly so basically we ve always said it comes true we should have a mid to high single digit eps growth right but basically i think the important thing here is that despite the lower loan growth our revenue growth last year revenues grew 5 6 we re not expecting revenue to growth slow down because margin should be relatively stable noninterest income should be high or good or strong or similar to loan growth and it s a big question mark and we did give some guidance is the cost of credit okay operator our next question comes from the line of jason mollin with scotiabank jason mollin my first question is a follow up on loan growth i mean do you consider this outlook conservative can you talk about the upside and downside risk to this 5 for total loans and my second question is about the new client data that you showed with santander chile achieving a 26 share of the net increase in clients can you talk about these clients do they come from other banks are these clients new to the system what kind of clients are they robert moreno okay i mean regarding the buyout or the loan growth guidance i think that it s a bit biased to the downside as claudio was mentioning that is our 5 is consistent with the 1 gdp growth that as of today we see maybe more downside risk than upside to that gdp and that would imply also the loan growth expectation to be a little bit more biased to the downside if we consider risk scenarios although today our base case and maybe best estimate is that i mean 1 for gdp 5 for loan growth but in terms of risk scenarios i would say that the downside is a bit higher than the upside emiliano muratore and regarding the so we had a as we said in the presentation a growth of 26 and a net increase in checking accounts through october so this is mainly the middle high income portion of the client and this is a mix of everything getting since these are checking accounts this is mainly people who are already in the system so i would say it s clients coming from other banks i think this has a lot to do with the fact that our client service has been steadily improving our digital services have always been very good the fact that the work cafÃ£ has really helped our image and so forth so checking accounts is really a reflection of all the efforts we ve done on many fronts and mainly either a little bit of cross selling we ve been very successful in opening checking accounts and not only in chilean pesos but in dollars and we re also obviously capturing market from other clients the new entrants are basically coming through santander life and super digital especially santander life santander life they re opening debit card accounts so it s not included in the checking account and that has also been very strong santander life has been very well perceived by clients remember that social unrest but santander life s merit program is very much in line with what people are looking for to be recognized for their efforts and the digital onboarding in santander life kept things going even when branches were closed okay operator and our next question comes from the line of thiago batista with ubs thiago batista i have two questions the first one is a follow up on the macro overview or the macro outlook about the unemployment ratio how much we better expecting for an employment ratio in chile in 2020 and also if this explains the potential increase in cost of risk when it s increased the 1 3 to 1 4 guidance for cost of risk if this should be caused by this increase in the unemployment ratio in chile and my second question is about the medium term roe so i know that there s a lot of moving parts nowadays in chile but do you believe it s possible to work with the roe of 19 and 20 as used to be a couple of years ago or the 17 tend to be the new level robert moreno on unemployment we expect unemployment to go up up to 8 to 8 5 this year we are starting at around 7 in november that 7 already accounts for part of the event after the social unrest and up to now the labor market even so a significant deterioration however because of the slow growth we are expecting for this year unemployment should go up now having said that our risk are more to the downside than there is a risk to the upside in terms of unemployment but in no case we are seeing unemployment reaching to 2 digit levels emiliano muratore and yes and relating that to cost of risk i mean the increase in cost of risk in that the last quarter had to do in part with the let s say the employment situation worsening a bit not so far yet not too much yet but yes the expectations are unemployment going up and regarding long term roe we honestly i think that it s still too early to assess or let s say recalibrate long term roe expectations at this moment because although the situation in chile has been relatively let s say abrupt and big during these last few months but i think it s too early to change or to let s say guide a long term roe after this situation and we will need to have to see the time passing and maybe during this year we got to have a clearer picture of the let s say the new long term expectation for the economy and for the bank operator and our next question comes from the line of tito labarta with goldman sachs tito labarta my question in terms of asset quality i guess and the cost of risk i mean you saw a little bit of deterioration in the quarter i mean do you think this will continue throughout the year i know you mentioned higher unemployment so it probably will but just want to get a sense how much do you think it could deteriorate from here and also with the cost of risk right it s a bit more elevated than in the past given the uncertainty which makes sense but do you think that you can if things go well you eventually get back to that clp 1 1 million cost of risk that we saw in the past or do you think given the uncertainty beyond this year could likely remain more elevated at that 1 3 1 4 level or even higher just to get a sense on like maybe some sensitivity on asset quality and cost of risk that you expect robert moreno yes i mean i think it s important what you mentioned that before after september before all this situation in chile we were with that underlying cost of risk of around 1 that is consistent with all the changes we have made in the composition of the loan book so when you look at the cost of risk of the last quarter and also the total for the year around 1 35 and we think that assuming the underlying risk of the portfolio that it was consistent with that 1 the new environment in terms of employment and consumption and economic activity we think that it s going to be unlikely to go as low as we were before all this so that 1 1 1 looks as too challenging but also we think that the situation from where we are in the last quarter especially after seeing the behavior of the portfolio in october november and december that it has been sequentially better month after month i mean october was the 1 with the biggest noise and disruption but then november and december we saw a kind of good behavior of the delinquency in the portfolio so i would say that we re going as low as we were before october it s unlikely that but we don t see the full year cost of risk going higher than we had last year operator and our next question comes from the line of neha agarwala with hsbc neha agarwala first on the regulatory side do you foresee any other regulatory changes that are not incorporated in your guidance maybe higher tax rate and the second question is on the asset quality i understand that you re being more cautious on the retail and construction sector any other sector or segment that you re trying to hold on and not grow as much this year robert moreno regarding the regulation no we don t today we don t see it actually there is not any other piece of regulation on the day we re under discussion apart from the ones we mentioned so we are not factoring in any other piece in our outlook for the year and in terms of asset quality and sectors actually i think that is going to depend the growth on the demand of credit that it will also be different among other sectors we are still seeing i would say kind of normal decent demand coming from middle market corporates all the external sector exporters and all that so we haven t seen any significant slowdown in loan growth in those segments then when you go to smes the demand is also is now a bit lower because of the general situation but no there is not any specific sector that we think that we need to slow down or the stuff we do want to be say prudent in exploring like new clients and we want to work more with our client base clients that we know that we have been working with them in the past so maybe in terms of calibrating the growth strategy maybe the biggest tweak would be not being extremely aggressive in capturing new clients especially in lending i mean going into lending to new clients that is maybe the biggest change if you compare the current stance to what we had before neha agarwala okay and if i can ask another question could you update us on the ifrs implementation robert moreno i mean ifrs it s by january next year when all the disclosing regulation is implemented in chile i would say that by january 2021 we will be fully ifrs except for credit losses provisioning i mean that is the that is the part where we are not ifrs and we are not going to be in the near future and so in the long term our expectation is to convert fully to ifrs because remember that now all the issuers not just banks are the same regulator or the cmf and all the other issuers are under full ifrs so i think that in the long term i expect to see conversions to full ifrs but in the near future we expect to be as we are in full ifrs except for provisions that will stay with this more standardized expected loss model created by the regulator emiliano muratore just as a clarification we are ifrs except for the credit provisions and the change that s coming now is the format how we publish all our financials that will change so more or less what you see in other parts of the world and that should be finished by the end of this year beginning of next year operator and our next question comes from the line of sebastiÃ£ n gallego with credicorp sebastiÃ£ n gallego i have several questions the first one on asset quality as well more follow up on asset quality i just want to get a sense if you could break down per segment on commercial consumer and mortgage where do you see the most deterioration in terms of asset quality delinquencies or npls second question is related to margins i just want to get a sense of under which scenario are you considering or what s your base case scenario for inflation or u s inflation on a quarterly basis just to reach a stableness in your guidance and final question is regarding basel iii standards when you read the article that was published by the regulator they mentioned that even though the risk weighted assets or the credit risk weighted assets will decline this will be compensated by the other risk weighted assets market and operational the question is do you expect that to actually compensate or do you actually believe that the net effect will be a decline in risk weighted assets emiliano muratore okay so regarding your first question which is the asset quality breakdown basically obviously there s potential for consumer lending to deteriorate but we already have a really high coverage so and remember we took like the clp 16 billion additional provisions we have very little loan growth in the low end of the market so i think that is a good you could say insurance policy so maybe npls could rise but i don t expect a huge situation of the cost of risk in consumer lending okay and mortgage is similar as well and remember all of this is using the current 1 gdp forecast and the unemployment forecast we discussed and mortgage as well mortgage we have a decent loan to value ratios and we ve also focused growth more on the higher end so obviously there could be some deterioration but we feel like it could be contained and the big question mark really comes from the sme sector where i think when you saw that in the fourth quarter and you and we re probably there where we could see potential further deterioration and need to increase the cost of risk so i would say that s the basic breakdown and that s why we are forecasting a cost of risk of 1 3 to 1 4 okay robert moreno regarding the inflation expectations i mean for full year today we are expecting like 2 7 ufi variation and the quarterly profile i would say that it is relatively stable i mean 0 7 0 8 for the different quarters starting in this quarter so that s why with that inflation assumption we are foreseeing still nims and regarding the impact of basel iii the numbers one of the i would say i don t know 1 of the things we found is that the regulator is incorporating some kind of complexity in the standard method when to calculate the weighting so it s we don t have our fine print our numbers today but if you the regulator mentioned that there will be a 23 reduction in risk weighted assets coming from risk so if we do that we take that 23 for us i mean we assume that credit risk will fall 23 and we take into account the operational regulation that it s already under consultation so we know how it will be and if you then then you have market risk at the x there in that equation and but if you take this scenario of keeping the same model that today we have under basel i which is a very let s say harsh and prudent model if you take those numbers we see our cet1 around 11 that it s roughly like 100 basis point higher than what we have today but there are i would say indirect calculation the two big questions are that 23 of reduction coming from credit risk how close we are to that average above or below we will know that in the coming weeks when we are able to do all the simulations and regulations and then market risk how close it is the basel iii model or the basel iv model compared to the basel i we have today but that s the kind of number we are seeing so far operator and our next question comes from the line of jorg friedemann with citibank jorg friedemann i have also a couple follow ups if possible just for me to understand you explained several times already regarding your cost of risk guidance and asset quality expectations but in this quarter you actually took a proactive stance and build up coverage in advance before more severe deterioration came in so is this the same rationale that you are going to follow going forward to come up at this 1 3 to 1 4 or you re going to be more reactive to npl deterioration from now on so the question is if we re going to continue building up coverage and the expectation of things to deteriorate or you re going to be only more reactive going forward so this is the first question and the second question if you could give us an update on the payout taking into consideration these regulations of basel iii that are coming in emiliano muratore okay so regarding your first question i think maybe one way to explain it is that during 2019 we had a cost of risk of 1 3 what we had like one timers right so we had the clp 16 billion in the fourth quarter and with clp 31 billion in the third if you take that out our cost of risk was 1 1 so you can say with all the events last year we would have been at 1 1 1 and we re going to increase that to 1 3 is what i m saying so the actual impact of all of this is a 20 on a comparable basis it s like a 20 basis increase so i would say there was in the fourth quarter some kind of like proactiveness this year it s going to be more i would say a little more like reactive because of the proactiveness we already did okay so at a comparable basis we re going from like 1 cost of risk to 1 3 1 4 and that s how we view it and we feel comfortable with that considering what we ve already done last year okay and the second on the payout so as we said in the just a little while ago given the information we have now regarding our current capital ratios and what we ve seen and what we can infer from the new regulations we expect the payout of 2019 earnings which would be paid in april to be around 60 of similar payout which gives you a current dividend yield of around like 4 or so now the board still hasn t decided on its final resolution and what it will propose to the shareholders meeting and that will be informed at the end of march okay robert moreno and i would say maybe let s say well definitely we said say loan growth expectations are not so higher and are a bit biased to the downside so that the pressure on capital shouldn t come from let s say faster loan growth there are a few pieces of the regulation for basel iii to be put under presentations market risk being 1 of them and some others so those are the many of the risk on the payout having without having any relevant negative surprise coming from the basel iii regulation you should expect the payout to be stable compared to last year operator and our next question comes from the line of tibad alessandri credicorp tibad alessandri i know there are no new regulations under discussions but are you considering the possibility of an increase on banks and taxes considering the increase in debt for the government or do you see the possibility of a specific tax for the banks robert moreno no actually we are not at this moment considering any of those taxes in the future i mean there is nothing being discussed and so under the current tax reform nothing like that is under discussion so we are not going to your question no we are not considering that operator and our next question comes from the line of yuri fernandes with jp morgan yuri fernandes i had a question regarding margins are you even conservative here i mean looking to your inflation outlook you had flattish inflation too like the cpi at 2 7 and santander chile you have like a benefit that maybe your peers in these should not have like you have you are just consolidated consumer finance company that helped margins and you also had a very good performance on the main deposits so if you re really right on the flattish margins for 2020 i think the outlook is negative for this system right because it may be down for your peers and for this system so that s the first one regarding margin for being conservative here or not and i have a follow up on the asset quality you had many many questions here but just checking about the renegotiated portfolio if you can provide some color on how big was the increase in this quarter when are you renegotiating those loans you can provide any metric any color so we can track these and keep an eye on how the renegotiated book is behaving robert moreno okay so first on nim i would say that it s a it s not so conservative because you re right in the sense that we have many tailwinds for nims i mean the central bank cut rates recently the slope of the curve recovered and now we have let s say a decent flow between the short term and the longer and then inflation is going to be stable or maybe with some upside risk if the fx keeps high or and depreciating so i would say that in general the new origination all these new factors are possibly factors for nims maybe the thing that you are not factoring in is that all the big flow of mortgages refinancing that we had last year it was mainly during the second half of last year so we are still seeing that let s say snowball effect in the full year margin for this year so and maybe that s why without factoring in that more refinancing mortgage effect you can see it as conservative but this effect is going to hit harder during the full year in 2020 than it was in 2019 which was only part of the year emiliano muratore on asset quality yes so the best way to go monitoring that is the impaired loan ratio that s why we include that because in very simple terms the impaired loan ratio on slide 23 if you can look it there that includes the npls plus mainly the renegotiated loans so if you look at for example commercial loans impaired loan ratio went from 6 7 to 7 that s the biggest impact we had there on asset quality and that s the renegotiation of these like sme loans mainly in tourism restaurants hotels small shops okay so the best way to go monitoring how that behaves is the impaired loan ratio and i see our provisioning models which aren t ifrs 9 but they re forward looking they have to take this so when you renegotiate you just don t sweep problems under the table we have to you have to take provisions anyway so that s why provisions were high apart from the because if you take out the clp 16 billion you still get a relatively large amount of provisions because we were increasing provisions for these impaired loans so as the year progresses and not only do you look at npls but keep a track of how the impaired loan ratio evolves because that s a good indicator of the overall in fact impaired loan ratio is very similar to the stage 3 of ifrs 9 okay yuri fernandes super clear robert thanks for the answer if i just may ask one thing on the cost of risk it s fair to assume that it should be much higher in the first half of the year and especially in the first q and then gradually decrease right at a average should be the 1 3 or 1 4 you ve mentioned in the guidance right robert moreno yes i think that should be correct yes operator and i m showing no further questions at this time so with that i ll turn the call back over to cfo emiliano muratore for closing remarks emiliano muratore thank you all very much for taking the time to participate in today s call we look forward to speaking with you again soon operator ladies and gentlemen this concludes today s conference call thank you for participating and you may now disconnect

karl popper in the open society and its enemies warned against utopian engineering massive social transformations led by those who believe they found a revealed truth these utopian engineers carry out the wholesale destruction of systems institutions and social and cultural structures in a vain effort to achieve their vision in the process they dismantle the self correcting mechanisms of incremental and piecemeal reform that are impediments to that vision history is replete with disastrous utopians the jacobins the marxists the fascists and now in our own age the globalists or neoliberal imperialists the ideology of neoliberalism which makes no economic sense and requires a willful ignorance of social and economic history is the latest iteration of utopian projects it posits that human society achieves its apex when individual entrepreneurial actions are free from government constraints society and culture should be dictated by the primacy of property rights open trade which sends manufacturing jobs to sweatshops in china and the global south and permits the flow of money across borders and unfettered global markets labor and product markets should be deregulated and freed from government oversight global financiers should be given control of the economies of nation states the role of the state should be reduced to ensuring the quality and integrity of money along with internal and external security and to privatizing control of land water public utilities education and government services such as intelligence and often the military prisons health care and the management of natural resources neoliberalism turns capitalism into a religious idol this utopian vision of the market of course bears no relationship to its reality capitalists hate free markets they seek to control markets through mergers and acquisitions buying out the competition they saturate the culture with advertising to manipulate public tastes and consumption they engage in price fixing they build unassailable monopolies they carry out schemes without checks or oversight of wild speculation predation fraud and theft they enrich themselves through stock buybacks ponzi schemes structured asset destruction through inflation asset stripping and the imposition of crippling debt peonage on the public in the united states they saturate the electoral process with money buying the allegiance of elected officials from the two ruling parties to legislate tax boycotts demolish regulations and further consolidate their wealth and power these corporate capitalists spend hundreds of millions of dollars to fund organizations such as business roundtable and the chamber of commerce and think tanks such as the heritage foundation to sell the ideology to the public they lavish universities with donations as long as the universities pay fealty to the ruling ideology they use their influence and wealth as well as their ownership of media platforms to transform the press into their mouthpiece and they silence heretics or make it hard for them to find employment soaring stock values rather than production become the new measure of the economy everything is financialized and commodified these utopians mutilate the social fabric through deindustrialization turning once great manufacturing centers into decayed wastelands and the middle and working class the bulwark of any democracy into a frustrated and enraged precariat they offshore work carry out massive layoffs and depress wages they destroy unions neoliberalism because it was always a class project and this was its goal redistributes wealth upward robbed of the protective covering of cultural institutions karl polanyi writes in his book the great transformation human beings perish from the effects of social exposure and die as victims of acute social dislocation neoliberalism as a class project is a brilliant success eight families now hold as much wealth as 50 of the world s population the world s 500 richest people in 2019 added 12 trillion to their assets while nearly half of all americans had no savings and nearly 70 could not have come up with 1 000 in an emergency without going into debt david harvey calls this accumulation by dispossession this neoliberal assault antagonistic to all forms of social solidarity that put restraints on amassing capital has obliterated the self corrective democratic mechanisms that once made incremental and piecemeal reform possible it has turned human beings and the natural world into commodities to be exploited until exhaustion or collapse the ruling elites slavish devotion to corporate profit and the accumulation of wealth by the global oligarchy means they are unwilling or incapable of addressing perhaps the greatest existential crisis facing the human species the climate emergency all competing centers of power including government have now been seized by corporate power and corrupted or destroyed we have undergone what john ralston saul calls a coup d Ã©tat in slow motion it is over they won at the same time these utopians attempting to project american power and global dominance launched invasions and occupations throughout the middle east that have descended into futile quagmires costing the united states between 5 trillion and 7 trillion dollars this utopian project in afghanistan iraq libya syria and by proxy in yemen has killed hundreds of thousands displaced or made refugees of millions wrecked cities and nations created failed states that incubate radical jihadist groups and fatally weakened american power indeed these wars some now in their 18th year are the greatest strategic blunder in american history the utopians culturally linguistically and historically ignorant of the countries they occupied believed in their naivetÃ© that they could implant democracy in places like baghdad and see it emanate out across the middle east they assured us we would be greeted as liberators the oil revenues would pay for reconstruction and iran would be cowed and defanged this was no more achievable or grounded in reality than the utopian scheme to unfetter the market and unleash worldwide prosperity and liberty once a cabal monarchial communist fascist or neoliberal seizes power its dismantling of the mechanisms that make reform possible leaves those who seek an open society no option but to bring the system down the corporate state like the communist regimes i covered in eastern europe is not reformable from within the failures that plague us are bipartisan failures on all of the major structural issues including war and the economy there is little or no divergence between the two ruling political parties of the u s the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of an oligarchic elite as aristotle warned leaves only two options tyranny or revolution and we are fast on the road to tyranny neoliberal utopianism because it suppresses the freedoms to organize to regulate and to protect the common good and empowers the freedoms to exploit and consolidate wealth and power is always fated polanyi writes to end in authoritarianism or outright fascism the good freedoms are lost the bad ones take over neoliberalism has given rise to the worst form of monopoly capitalism and greatest level of income inequality in american history the banks and the agricultural food arms and communications industries have destroyed regulations that once impeded their monopolies allowing them to fix prices suppress wages guarantee profits abolish environmental controls and abuse their workers they have obliterated free market competition unfettered capitalism as karl marx pointed out destroys the so called free market it is hostile to the values and traditions of a capitalist democracy capitalism s final stage marx wrote is marked by the pillage of the systems and structures that make capitalism possible it is not capitalism at all the arms industry for example with its official 612 billion defense authorization bill a figure that ignores numerous other military expenditures tucked away in other budgets masking the fact that our real expenditure on national security expenses is over 1 trillion a year has gotten the government to commit to spending 348 billion over the next decade to modernize our nuclear weapons and build 12 new ohio class nuclear submarines estimated at 8 billion each we spend some 100 billion a year on intelligence read surveillance and 70 of that money goes to private contractors such as booz allen hamilton which gets 99 of its revenues from the u s government we are the largest exporters of arms in the world the fossil fuel industry swallows up 5 3 trillion a year worldwide in hidden costs to keep burning fossil fuels according to the international monetary fund this money the imf notes is in addition to the 492 billion in direct subsidies offered by governments around the world through write offs write downs and land use loopholes taxpayer subsidies to the big banks jpmorgan chase bank of america citigroup wells fargo and goldman sachs are estimated at 64 billion a year an amount roughly equal to their typical annual profits in 1980 freight trains were deregulated the number of class i railroads shrank from 40 to 7 four account for 90 of the industry s revenue nearly one third of all shippers have access to only one railroad president bill clinton s telecommunications act of 1996 was touted as a way to open the cable industry to competition instead it saw a massive consolidation of the industry into the hands of about half a dozen corporations that control what 90 of americans watch or hear on the airwaves the airline industry freed from regulation was rapidly consolidated four airlines control 85 of the domestic market they have divided the country into regional hubs where they extort fees fix prices cancel flights at will leaving passengers stranded without compensation and provide shoddy service the pharmaceutical and insurance corporations that manage our for profit health care industry extracted 812 billion from americans in 2017 this represents more than one third 34 2 of total expenditures for doctor visits hospitals long term care and health insurance if we had a public health system such as in canada it would save us 600 billion in costs in a single year according to a report by physicians for a national health plan health administration costs in 2017 were more than fourfold higher per capita in the u s than in canada 2 479 versus 551 per person the group notes canada implemented a single payer medicare for all system in 1962 in 2017 americans spent 844 per person on insurers overhead canadians spent 146 neoliberalism cannot be defended as more innovative or more efficient it has not spread democracy and by orchestrating unprecedented levels of income inequality and political stagnation has vomited up demagogues and authoritarian regimes that falsely promise vengeance against ruling elites who betrayed the people our democracy under this assault has been replaced with meaningless political theater as the academics benjamin page and martin gilens detailed in their exhaustive 2017 study democracy in america the best evidence indicates that the wishes of ordinary americans little or no impact on the making of federal government policy wealthy individuals and organized interest groups especially business corporations have much more political clout he general public virtually powerless the will of majorities is thwarted by the affluent and the well organized who block popular policy proposals and enact special favors for themselves majorities of americans favor specific policies designed to deal with such problems as climate change gun violence an untenable immigration system inadequate public schools and crumbling bridges and highways large majorities of america favor various programs to help provide jobs increase wages help the unemployed provide universal medical insurance ensure decent retirement pensions and pay for such programs with progressive taxes most americans also want to cut corporate welfare yet the wealthy business groups and structural gridlock have mostly blocked such new policies there should be no debate about how to effect change piecemeal and incremental reform is always preferable to the inevitable anarchy any power vacuum creates the problem is that our utopian engineers in their giddy dismantling of an economic and democratic system as well as their draining of state resources in the wars they prosecute overseas have dynamited the tools that could save us they have left us no option but to revolt and remove them from power we will carry out sustained acts of civil disobedience to bring down these corporate oligarchs or live in an orwellian tyranny at least until the climate emergency renders the human species extinct regulations laws planning and control are not the enemies of freedom they keep capitalists from extinguishing freedom denying justice and abolishing the common good the freedom of the capitalist class to exploit human beings and the natural world without restraint transforms the freedom for the many into freedom for the few that was always the point
economy still on path of recovery the 2020 economic outlook released by the nigerian economy summit group nesg on wednesday shows that nigeria s economy is going to go through some challenges writes chinyere okoroafor the united states and chinese governments are reaching a truce on their trade conflict the feuding parties have embarked on a series of tariff exclusions to settle on a trade deal the outcome of the settlement deal is one of the issues the nigerian economy summit group nesg believes will have an impact on nigeria s economy this year it also listed other issues that will shape the economy to include the african continental free trade agreement afcfta which is slated to be effective from july 2020 electricity tariff hike the central bank of nigeria s readiness to increase available credit to the real sector and the tension between the u s and iran while afcfta presents an opportunity for nigeria to increase non oil exports and dominate markets of other african countries the nigerian electricity regulatory commission nerc has approved the increase in electricity tariff by distribution companies in nigeria thus increasing the cost of production in the economy with a welfare implication on the citizens but with the cbn set to increase the loan ratio to 70 per cent within the first quarter of this year more credit will be available to the real sector however the nesg warns it could increase non performing loans of banks nesg argued in its outlook that the tension between the u s and iran over a nuclear deal means uncertainty and unrest in the middle east a major region for the supply of oil this will have a significant impact on oil price movement and will positively affect nigeria s oil revenue nesg said nesg chief executive officer laoye jaiyeola said the nigerian economy is still on the path of recovery however at a slow momentum and high level of fragility real gdp expanded by 2 28 per cent in the third quarter of last year averaging 2 17 per cent in the first three quarters of the year inflation rate averaged 11 4 per cent but closed the year at 12 per cent following the effects of the land border closure exchange rate stability was sustained on the back of continued central bank of nigeria s interventions while the foreign exchange reserves depleted significantly due to dwindling inflows from foreign portfolio investors and moderating oil prices on the social aspect the poverty situation worsened as growth remained non inclusive over 100 million people live in abject poverty the weak linkage between economic growth and socio economic impact persists as poverty becomes endemic in our macro economic outlook for 2019 we concluded that growth in 2018 was anaemic and marred by rising economic and social exclusion we therefore proposed an inclusive growth framework for nigeria with emphasis on broad based economic growth that delivers improved social welfare the proposed strategies prioritised industry governance and social sector reforms to step up the inclusive growth narrative our macro economic outlook for 2020 takes a deep dive approach to fixing nigeria s poverty problem through accelerated economic growth and job creation as a precursor to inclusive economic growth part i of the report reviews the nigerian economy in 2019 and provides an outlook for 2020 which will be influenced by several events and policies such as the increase in value added tax vat implementation of the africa continental free trade area afcfta agreement movement in global oil prices us china trade wars loan to deposit ratio and insurance companies recapitalisation among others part ii of the report examines how nigeria can create significant number of jobs in the medium to long term to lift millions out of poverty he continued as we enter this new decade the government private sector and other stakeholders must rise up to the challenge work together and hold one another accountable in delivering a sound future for our great country what the nesg said on economy in 2019 it is the dawn of a new decade and many economies including nigeria are working towards achieving sustainable goals amidst diverse complexities and uncertainties still on the path of recovery with economic growth at 2 3 per ent the nigerian economy remains highly fragile and vulnerable to oil price fluctuations even as the structure of growth is still skewed towards a few sectors at the wake of 2019 the economy faced a high level of uncertainty ahead of the general elections which later held in march last year while several bold statements and policy proposals were made to stimulate the economy and provide jobs for the teeming populace during the campaigns many of these promises are yet to be actualised in our 2019 macro economic outlook report we noted that growth in 2018 was anaemic and thus strategies for steering nigeria through the inclusive growth path needed to be rolled out however economic growth remains lethargic and non inclusive during the year fiscal authorities continued to grapple with the challenges of underperforming revenue this was triggered by lower than expected oil revenues arising from oil production shortages which was below the budgeted target of 2 3 million barrels per day mbpd efforts to improve non oil revenues yielded positive results during the year with an improved collection of company income tax customs revenues and fgn independent revenues on the business environment nigeria was ranked among the top 10 improvers in the 2019 world bank ease of doing business rankings reforms in areas such as starting a business dealing with construction permits and enforcing contracts propelled nigeria to record significant jump from 145th in the previous year to 131st in the global rankings unconventionally monetary policy focused on maintaining exchange rate and price stability and to a broad extent supporting economic growth in 2019 the central bank of nigeria cbn continued to defend the currency through its intervention in the foreign exchange market this is evident in the declining external buffers in the face of lower inflows of foreign investment albeit a stable oil price in desperation to tame the dwindling reserves the cbn prioritised hot money in the interim as it limited open market operation participation to foreign investors and deposit money banks furthermore in the first quarter of last year the monetary policy rate mpr was reviewed downwards by 50 basis points to 13 5 per cent aimed especially at driving real sector growth in the spirit of growth the cbn increased the loan to deposit ratio twice first to 60 per cent and second to 65 per cent these moves are reshaping the interest rate environment and pushing credit to the private sector in a bid to strengthen self sustainability and curtail smuggling of goods the government closed the seme border this was later extended to all land borders in the country the closure truncated the single digit inflation target of the cbn with inflation rate reaching 12 per cent in december last year however even with the price effects both the fiscal and monetary authorities were in unison regarding the potential medium to long term gains of this policy this in effect propelled the surge in the domestic production of some food items such as rice and poultry products the policy action of closing the borders which came some months after signing the african continental free trade area afcfta agreement raises doubts as to nigeria s commitment to the trade deal and the country s ability to take advantage of the opportunities it presents nigeria needs to do more in attracting real investments into key sectors of the economy although investors sentiment improved as overall foreign investment inflows into the economy increased relative to the previous year data from the national bureau of statistics show that 70 per cent of foreign inflows in 2019 were portfolio investment the concerns about lower foreign direct investment inflows nevertheless continue to linger nesg said the report added the review of the macro economic indicators and the various policies stance in 2019 suggests that the nigerian economy remains vulnerable to external shocks with dwindling reserves rising debt levels and tardiness in growth response to impetus towards the close of 2019 fitch a rating organisation downgraded nigeria from stable to negative in their recent outlook revision emphasising the increased vulnerability of the economy to disruptive macro economic policy risk rising debt profile in light of constrained revenue inflationary pressure and complexity in cbn s unconventional regulatory measures this therefore calls for comprehensive and coherent economic and social policies that address economy wide challenges and build resilience over time even as the government s plan the economic recovery and growth plan ergp elapses in 2020 such policies must prioritise accelerated and inclusive growth founded on the deliberate effort at ensuring overall macro economic stability that instills confidence in the economy creates jobs and reduces poverty in the decade ahead 2020 what to expect the group said the signing of the 2020 budget in december was a good omen it said it was the first time in over 14 years the budget was signed before the budget year begins the 2020 budget is themed sustaining growth and job creation and also represents the largest spending plan of the federal government in a single year early passage of the budget is expected to result in improved capital spending which is much needed to stimulate economic growth and facilitate the delivery of infrastructure across the country with oil price expected to stay above the budget benchmark of 57 per barrel in 2020 nigeria has an opportunity to grow the excess crude oil account improve external reserves and meet its oil revenue target to fund the 2020 budget it said it observed that the government would have more money with the passage of the finance bill which would result in an increase in vat from 5 per cent to 7 5 per cent in the year the government it added is also considering other avenues of raising non oil revenues such as the proposed communication tax online tax excise duty on carbonated soft drinks and toll charges it is expected that the introduction of these taxes and charges will improve non oil revenue however the challenge for fiscal authorities is levying several taxes and charges on an economy that is recovering with economic growth still low at 2 3 per cent this could therefore have unintended negative effects on growth either through reduced consumer spending or reduced margins for businesses revenue drive should therefore be implemented with caution going into 2020 inflationary pressure will remain high in 2020 on the basis of the continued closure of land borders the introduction of taxes and other charges directed at consumers and businesses as well as sustained pressure on businesses arising from an infrastructure deficit poor power supply and high cost of credit among others given these concerns monetary policy is expected to remain tight in the year although the cbn will continue in its effort to provide financial support and direct incentives to local businesses in order to stimulate local production and reduce the country s ever rising import bills the heightened tension between the us and iran as well as opec s commitment to control supply in order to sustain higher prices will stiffen oil price in 2020 in order to take advantage of the increase nigeria will need to implement reforms in the oil and gas sector to attract large investments into the upstream sub sector and ultimately shore up oil production the leadership of the national assembly has made commitments to focus on the petroleum industry bill in 2020 and progress in the industry will largely depend on the speed of passage of the industry wide legislation it said the coming on board of the dangote refinery the report said will influence activities in the economy in this decade the 650 000 barrels per day refinery is expected to meet nigeria s fuel requirements and produce about 35 000 direct and indirect jobs at the moment mineral products including petrol account for 30 per cent of imports this figure is expected to reduce in the coming years as the refinery becomes operational conserving foreign exchange as the refinery comes into the stream the output of oil refining which is currently categorised under the manufacturing sector as well as exports of petroleum products will significantly increase even as transport and logistics within nigeria will be impacted efforts are therefore required to upgrade infrastructure leading to the refinery to allow for easy and efficient traffic management it said it identified rising population rapid urbanisation the advancement of technology as complex challenges which will influence the future of work and skills rising population and urbanisation it said will create significant pressure on food jobs infrastructure social amenities and human capital the onus therefore is on policy makers to be spontaneous and proactive in dealing with these challenges adopting innovative and home grown strategies to deliver accelerated growth and enable the creation of sustainable jobs and reduction in poverty across the country incentivising private sector investments into strategic sectors as well as repositioning government towards becoming efficient and effective are crucial interventions that need to be implemented in the new decade to ensure that nigeria is not left behind in the league of fast developing nations nesg said certainly 2020 is a year to watch closely

as the effects of china s coronavirus cloud prospects for the economy signs from the state power sector have added to concerns about diminishing growth even before the scope of the virus infections became known in january reports on china s electricity use and predictions of consumption pointed toward a prolonged slower growth trend the actual track of the economy has been hard to follow due to the rapid flurry of factors on both the positive and negative sides in the past month as 2019 drew to a close several economic reports saw signs of an upswing in the fourth quarter based on expectations of a break in the trade war with washington after u s and chinese negotiators sealed a phase one agreement to halt further escalation of tariffs on jan 15 the international monetary fund raised its forecast of china s growth in 2020 by 0 2 percentage points to 6 percent on jan 17 the national bureau of statistics nbs released its estimate of china s gross domestic product in 2019 showing a 6 1 percent growth rate for the year with 6 percent in the fourth quarter staying barely within the government s target range of 6 0 6 5 percent state media reports stressed the positive aspects of the results hailing the country s high quality development and the service sector s 53 9 percent contribution to gdp up from 53 3 percent in 2018 there was less attention paid to the sharp drop in the official gdp growth rate from 6 6 percent in 2018 to 6 1 percent the slowest pace in 29 years according to reuters but even the reuters account noted a positive shift in the fourth quarter after the government responded with eased credit generous tax cuts and infrastructure projects the official data showed the world s second largest economy ended the rough year on a somewhat firmer note as a trade truce revived business confidence and earlier growth boosting measures finally appeared to be taking hold reuters said but that was before the number of officially reported virus cases tripled over the following weekend triggering a massive quarantine response in the central city of wuhan and surrounding areas posing major threats to public health commerce and 2020 gdp as the contagion spread chinese officials voiced hope that the economic effect would not be as bad as that of the sars outbreak which was estimated by the asian development bank to lower gdp by 0 5 percentage points in the boom year of 2003 when growth hit 10 percent very different now the recovery from sars came quickly but economic conditions look very different now china s growth has been on a downward trajectory for the past decade driven largely by the declining performance of traditional heavy industry and the government s stubborn support for inefficient state owned enterprises soes since 2010 annual economic growth rates have dropped steadily from 10 6 percent to the six percent range according to the world bank a new york times report on the potential impact of the virus concluded that it is not yet clear today china s economy is bigger but is growing at its slowest pace in nearly three decades it is grappling with problems like the trade war with the united states and a campaign to wean local governments off their addiction to borrowing it said while the health scare is likely to reduce forecasts further economists have been reluctant to quantify the potential economic damage as the extent of the contagion unfolds adding to the tragic human toll the health crisis is certain to take a toll on china s slowing economy accompanied by losses already recorded in chinese stock markets wrote tianlei huang a research analyst at the peterson institute for international economics in washington china may no longer have the resources that it relied on for recovery from the sars crisis 17 years ago today china is running large fiscal deficits and thus has less room to apply fiscal stimulus as it did last time huang said even before the virus became a factor to consider in economic forecasts there were signs from within the state sector that the growth slowdown was expected to continue for years the slower growth track may be an indicator of the economy s weaker resilience and capacity to recover than during the outbreak of 2003 according to a financial times report in january an internal forecast by the state grid corp which runs china s electricity network warned late last year that gdp growth could fall as low as 4 percent by 2024 the company planned to cut capital spending accordingly the paper said the monopoly is now more cautious after being caught off guard by slower than expected economic growth and government ordered cuts in electricity prices in recent years it said gloomy forecast there are several reasons for the glum pre virus forecast from the giant state owned monopoly which was previously known for bullishness on the economy and investment in the electricity system for starters china s economic planners treated the state grid s ample finances as a target of opportunity two years ago when they sought to cut power costs for business and commercial users in an attempt to boost profits and spur the economy the attacks on the state grid s deep pockets highlighted the government s schemes for granting subsidies to industries without paying for them in 2018 the state grid slashed rates for commercial and industrial customers by 10 6 percent at the government s behest saving them 91 5 billion yuan u s 13 2 billion the official xinhua news agency reported the china electricity council estimated the break was worth 125 8 billion yuan u s 18 1 billion in 2019 businesses were given a similarly sized rate cut although the burden fell mostly on coal fired power plants the state grid was still smarting from the government s pressure on its finances last year at least 10 of the company s 27 regional operations reported a loss a record number according to company insiders the financial times said at the same time power production and consumption have shown signs of weakening demand the electricity figures have long been regarded as a surrogate indicator of economic strength in 2019 the growth of electricity generation fell by nearly half from 6 8 percent a year earlier to 3 5 percent growth of power consumption dropped to 4 5 percent last year from a six year high of 8 5 percent in 2018 official agencies and the china electricity council cec said playing up the rates state media reports have tried to play up the stronger power consumption rates in the more vibrant service sector which rose 9 5 percent according to the cec but a check of year earlier reports found that service sector growth rate has also declined from 12 7 percent in 2018 power consumption growth in the industrial sector fell sharply from 7 2 percent in 2018 to 3 1 percent last year the poor results combined with lower economic forecasts and overspending in the past could drive the state grid to cut capital spending by nearly a quarter this year the financial times reported with slowing growth lower tariffs and consequent financial losses the decision to cut back on investments seems very sensible said philip andrews speed senior principal fellow at the national university of singapore s energy studies institute the case of the state grid may only be a barometer of declines in the state sector to come the impact from the coronavirus is only likely to cloud economic forecasts further driving a cycle of lower demand and reduced investment that could last for months or years

growth represents the percentage change in revenue during the applicable period as compared to the prior year period excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates see the supplementary analysis of results below for revenue percentage change from currency for the three months and year ended december 31 2019 growth and organic revenue growth all references to growth and organic growth refer to growth compared to the equivalent prior year period unless specifically noted organic revenue growth is a non gaap financial measure that excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and revenue from business acquisitions management believes that reporting organic revenue growth provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to the performance of our peers see the supplementary analysis of results below for a reconciliation of reported revenue growth to organic revenue growth for the three and twelve months ended december 31 2019 see the constant currency note above for the impacts of estimated currency changes to fourth quarter and full year 2019

growth and operating margin growth comparable constant currency operating expense growth operating profit growth and operating profit margin gain or growth are non gaap financial measures and exclude ceo transition charges and changes in foreign currency exchange rates management believes that reporting comparable constant currency operating expense growth operating profit growth and operating margin gain provide useful information to investors because it enables better period over period comparisons of the fundamental financial results by excluding items that vary independent of performance and provides greater transparency to investors regarding key metrics used by management comparable constant currency operating expense growth operating profit growth and operating margin gain should be considered in addition to and not as replacements of or superior measures to operating expense growth operating profit growth and operating margin gain reported in accordance with gaap ceo transition charges increased operating expense growth by 7 in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 2 for the full year 2019 decreased operating profit growth by 12 in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 3

comparable constant currency eps growth is a non gaap financial measure that excludes the tax effects of share based compensation activity under asu 2016 09 ceo transition charges and changes in foreign currency exchange rates management believes comparable constant currency eps growth is a more useful way to measure the company s business performance than eps growth because it enables better period over period comparisons of the fundamental financial results by excluding items that vary independent of performance and provides greater transparency to investors regarding a key metric used by management share based compensation activity is expected to increase projected eps by 0 09 to 0 11 for the full year 2020 increased fourth quarter 2019 eps by 0 05 compared to 0 01 in the fourth quarter of 2018 increased eps by 0 22 for the full year 2019 and increased eps by 0 24 for full year 2018 ceo transition charges decreased eps by 0 14 in the fourth quarter of 2019 these impacts and those described in the constant currency note above reconcile reported eps growth to comparable constant currency eps growth for the company free cash flow free cash flow is a non gaap financial measure and means with respect to a measurement period the cash generated from operations during that period reduced by the company s investments in property and equipment management believes free cash flow is a useful measure because it indicates the cash the operations of the business are generating after appropriate reinvestment for recurring investments in property and equipment that are required to operate the business see the supplementary analysis of results below for our calculation of free cash flow for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 to estimate projected 2020 free

gross debt and net debt are non gaap financial measures adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure of earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and share based compensation management believes that using adjusted ebitda gross debt and net debt in the adjusted ebitda ratio is a useful and recognized measure for evaluating financial leverage for further information on how

operating profit margin growth and eps growth estimated currency changes impacted full year 2019 results as follows increased gross margin growth by 10 basis points decreased operating profit growth by 1 had an immaterial impact on operating leverage growth increased operating profit margin growth by 15 basis points and decreased eps growth by 1 estimated currency changes are also expected to decrease projected full year 2020 revenue growth by approximately 0 5 decrease projected full year 2020 cag diagnostics recurring revenue growth by approximately 0 5 decrease projected operating profit margin growth by approximately 20 basis points and decrease projected 2020 eps growth by approximately 2 and decrease first quarter revenue growth by approximately 1 constant currency revenue growth represents the percentage change in revenue during the applicable period as compared to the prior year period excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates see the supplementary analysis of results below for revenue percentage change from currency for the three months and year ended december 31 2019 growth and organic revenue growth all references to growth and organic growth refer to growth compared to the equivalent prior year period unless specifically noted organic revenue growth is a non gaap financial measure that excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and revenue from business acquisitions management believes that reporting organic revenue growth provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to the performance of our peers see the supplementary analysis of results below for a reconciliation of reported revenue growth to organic revenue growth for the three and twelve months ended december 31 2019 see the constant currency note above for the impacts of estimated currency changes to fourth quarter and full year 2019 as well estimated full year 2020 organic revenue growth for the company the percentage change in revenue resulting from acquisitions represents incremental revenues attributable to business acquisitions that have occurred since the beginning of the prior year period revenue from acquisitions is expected to increase projected full year 2020 revenue growth by approximately 0 5 and first quarter 2020 revenue by 0 5 and projected full year 2020 cag diagnostics recurring organic revenue growth by approximately 0 5 comparable constant currency operating expense growth operating profit growth and operating margin growth comparable constant currency operating expense growth operating profit growth and operating profit margin gain or growth are non gaap financial measures and exclude ceo transition charges and changes in foreign currency exchange rates management believes that reporting comparable constant currency operating expense growth operating profit growth and operating margin gain provide useful information to investors because it enables better period over period comparisons of the fundamental financial results by excluding items that vary independent of performance and provides greater transparency to investors regarding key metrics used by management comparable constant currency operating expense growth operating profit growth and operating margin gain should be considered in addition to and not as replacements of or superior measures to operating expense growth operating profit growth and operating margin gain reported in accordance with gaap ceo transition charges increased operating expense growth by 7 in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 2 for the full year 2019 decreased operating profit growth by 12 in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 3 for the full year 2019 and decreased operating margin gain by 220 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 55 basis points for the full year 2019 ceo transition charges are projected to increase operating margin growth by approximately 50 basis points in 2020 these impacts and those described in the constant currency note above reconcile reported operating expense growth operating profit growth and operating margin gain to comparable constant currency operating expense growth operating profit growth and operating margin gain for the company comparable constant currency eps growth comparable constant currency eps growth is a non gaap financial measure that excludes the tax effects of share based compensation activity under asu 2016 09 ceo transition charges and changes in foreign currency exchange rates management believes comparable constant currency eps growth is a more useful way to measure the company s business performance than eps growth because it enables better period over period comparisons of the fundamental financial results by excluding items that vary independent of performance and provides greater transparency to investors regarding a key metric used by management share based compensation activity is expected to increase projected eps by 0 09 to 0 11 for the full year 2020 increased fourth quarter 2019 eps by 0 05 compared to 0 01 in the fourth quarter of 2018 increased eps by 0 22 for the full year 2019 and increased eps by 0 24 for full year 2018 ceo transition charges decreased eps by 0 14 in the fourth quarter of 2019 these impacts and those described in the constant currency note above reconcile reported eps growth to comparable constant currency eps growth for the company free cash flow free cash flow is a non gaap financial measure and means with respect to a measurement period the cash generated from operations during that period reduced by the company s investments in property and equipment management believes free cash flow is a useful measure because it indicates the cash the operations of the business are generating after appropriate reinvestment for recurring investments in property and equipment that are required to operate the business see the supplementary analysis of results below for our calculation of free cash flow for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 to estimate projected 2020 free cash flow we have deducted projected purchases of property and equipment also referred to as capital expenditures of 140 million 155 million debt to adjusted ebitda leverage ratios adjusted ebitda gross debt and net debt are non gaap financial measures adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure of earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and share based compensation management believes that using adjusted ebitda gross debt and net debt in the adjusted ebitda ratio is a useful and recognized measure for evaluating financial leverage for further information on how adjusted ebitda and the debt to adjusted ebitda ratio are calculated see the company s quarterly report on form 10 q for the quarter ended september 30 2019 after tax return on invested capital excluding cash and investments roic after tax return on invested capital excluding cash and investments is a non gaap financial measure after tax return on invested capital excluding cash and investments represents our after tax income from operations divided by our average invested capital excluding cash and investments using beginning and ending balance sheet values management believes that reporting roic provides useful information to investors for evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of our use of capital see the supplementary table below for reconciliation of this non gaap

as the effects of china s coronavirus cloud prospects for the economy signs from the state power sector have added to concerns about diminishing growth even before the scope of the virus infections became known in january reports on china s electricity use and predictions of consumption pointed toward a prolonged slower growth trend the actual track of the economy has been hard to follow due to the rapid flurry of factors on both the positive and negative sides in the past month as 2019 drew to a close several economic reports saw signs of an upswing in the fourth quarter based on expectations of a break in the trade war with washington after u s and chinese negotiators sealed a phase one agreement to halt further escalation of tariffs on jan 15 the international monetary fund raised its forecast of china s growth in 2020 by 0 2 percentage points to 6 percent on jan 17 the national bureau of statistics nbs released its estimate of china s gross domestic product in 2019 showing a 6 1 percent growth rate for the year with 6 percent in the fourth quarter staying barely within the government s target range of 6 0 6 5 percent state media reports stressed the positive aspects of the results hailing the country s high quality development and the service sector s 53 9 percent contribution to gdp up from 53 3 percent in 2018 there was less attention paid to the sharp drop in the official gdp growth rate from 6 6 percent in 2018 to 6 1 percent the slowest pace in 29 years according to reuters but even the reuters account noted a positive shift in the fourth quarter after the government responded with eased credit generous tax cuts and infrastructure projects the official data showed the world s second largest economy ended the rough year on a somewhat firmer note as a trade truce revived business confidence and earlier growth boosting measures finally appeared to be taking hold reuters said but that was before the number of officially reported virus cases tripled over the following weekend triggering a massive quarantine response in the central city of wuhan and surrounding areas posing major threats to public health commerce and 2020 gdp as the contagion spread chinese officials voiced hope that the economic effect would not be as bad as that of the sars outbreak which was estimated by the asian development bank to lower gdp by 0 5 percentage points in the boom year of 2003 when growth hit 10 percent very different now the recovery from sars came quickly but economic conditions look very different now china s growth has been on a downward trajectory for the past decade driven largely by the declining performance of traditional heavy industry and the government s stubborn support for inefficient state owned enterprises soes since 2010 annual economic growth rates have dropped steadily from 10 6 percent to the six percent range according to the world bank a new york times report on the potential impact of the virus concluded that it is not yet clear today china s economy is bigger but is growing at its slowest pace in nearly three decades it is grappling with problems like the trade war with the united states and a campaign to wean local governments off their addiction to borrowing it said while the health scare is likely to reduce forecasts further economists have been reluctant to quantify the potential economic damage as the extent of the contagion unfolds adding to the tragic human toll the health crisis is certain to take a toll on china s slowing economy accompanied by losses already recorded in chinese stock markets wrote tianlei huang a research analyst at the peterson institute for international economics in washington china may no longer have the resources that it relied on for recovery from the sars crisis 17 years ago today china is running large fiscal deficits and thus has less room to apply fiscal stimulus as it did last time huang said even before the virus became a factor to

attacks on the state grid s deep pockets highlighted the government s schemes for granting subsidies to industries without paying for them in 2018 the state grid slashed rates for commercial and industrial customers by 10 6 percent at the government s behest saving them 91 5 billion yuan u s 13 2 billion the official xinhua news agency reported the china electricity council estimated the break was worth 125 8 billion yuan u s 18 1 billion in 2019 businesses were given a similarly sized rate cut although the burden fell mostly on coal fired power plants the state grid was still smarting from the government s pressure on its finances last year at least 10 of the company s 27 regional operations reported a loss a record number according to company insiders the financial times said at the same time power production and consumption have shown signs of weakening demand the electricity figures have long been regarded as a surrogate indicator of economic strength in 2019 the growth of electricity generation fell by nearly half from 6 8 percent a year earlier to 3 5 percent growth of power consumption dropped to 4 5 percent last year from a six year high of 8 5 percent in 2018 official agencies and the china electricity council cec said playing up the rates state media reports have tried to play up the stronger power consumption rates in the more vibrant service sector which rose 9 5 percent according to the cec but a check of year earlier reports found that service sector growth rate has also declined from 12 7 percent in 2018 power consumption growth in the industrial sector fell sharply from 7 2 percent in 2018 to 3 1 percent last year the poor results combined with lower economic forecasts and overspending in the past could drive the state grid to cut capital spending by nearly a quarter this year the financial times reported with slowing growth lower tariffs and consequent financial losses the decision to cut back on investments seems very sensible said philip andrews speed senior principal fellow at the national university of singapore s energy studies institute the case of the state grid may only be a barometer of declines in the state sector to come the impact from the coronavirus is only likely to cloud economic forecasts further driving a cycle of lower demand and reduced investment that could last for months or years

the san diego union tribune editorial board interviewed four candidates in the 53rd congressional district race ahead of the march 3 2020 primary election in which the top two vote getters will advance to a runoff election in november below is the transcript of our dec 16 2019 interview with democrat jose caballero who is running to succeed susan davis in a district that includes western el cajon eastern chula vista parts of central and eastern san diego as well as bonita la mesa lemon grove and spring valley this interview was transcribed using the digital transcription service temi and checked for accuracy by a staffer to call any errors to our attention or to ask any questions about our interviews please email matthew hall sduniontribune com with the subject line election interviews union tribune so tell us you were in this race uh when susan was still in this jose caballero that s correct advertisement q why did you decide to run for congress this year a um well this year i decided to run and really when it when it was when i was considering it back in march and finally decided to file in april it was basically on the issues uh susan davis wasn t for the green new deal at the time she wasn t for medicare for all college loan debt forgiveness college for all um and ending the forever wars so what i wanted to do and i actually met with susan before we i i actually officially said i was going to do this and i asked her um where do you stand on these policies and she didn t give me an answer and i was like well this is why i m running and the remain reason why i was running is to give to voters an opportunity to vote for those major mainstream left issues now which is medicare for all education for all student loan debt forgiveness and you know and ending the forever wars so that s why i decided to run to really give the voters a chance to vote on the issues that this district really wants to see yeah meet the other candidates in this race below opinion meet the candidates for the 53rd congressional district the candidates we interviews for the 53rd congressional district are jose caballero sara jacobs georgette gomez and janessa goldbeck q and obviously you ve been involved in a lot of campaigns on the as we said on the other side as as a as a candidate yourself ran once for city council finished third finished in third a yeah absolutely that was a tough race q how what did you learn from that that made you think uh not all these you would you kind of run again upfront but then run for congress obviously a more difficult race advertisement a yeah um what i learned is that when you put yourself out there and put your ideas front and center you can actually make a big change for example when we ran uh in for city council in district seven we really pushed like municipal internet for example you know and nobody else was saying that now almost every city council candidate wants some form of broadband internet uh you know municipal internet here in san diego county um i was able to to really spark some hope and a lot of the voters in district seven we got about a little over 17 of the vote and and people really admired you know the the effort and 53 about 50 of the district district seven is in 53 so i figured well i already have a strong hold there so i was able to build the san diego progressive democratic club out of that campaign and that campaign and and i was able to you know continue to influence the democratic party cause i didn t go anywhere so what i learned is as long as you put yourself out there and actually run on the issues and the values people will support you and so that s what i mainly learned and i m going to continue to fight for those things q how about obviously the strategy has changed it s changed with susan out and now you have uh georgette who has a lot of endorsements sarah who s got a lot of money some endorsements how do you compete with those two um two names a well uh it s not going to be easy i m not i am no under i m not disillusioned here i don t come under any illusion that this is going to be an easy task however with you look at the progressive story of many candidates across the country you see you know like an alexandria ocasio cortez you see ilhan omar you see a lot of these candidates that also didn t have a lot of resources but they had a good message and a strong following of people that started the rally around those messages and when you look at these other campaigns you look at what you said endorsements and you look at money but we don t really talk about the issues that these these candidates are bringing to the table when people are introduced to my campaign they talk oh yeah jose he s the uh the progressive medicare for all candidate or he s the green new deal candidate or he s the you know veteran candidate that is fighting for the hero s promise so so i like being associated with the issues rather than some endorsement or some amount of wealth that i was able to obtain over a generation so so yeah so that s that s how i m going to overcome it also the fact that i ve been a community leader in this district for several several years um because i helped build the san diego progressive democratic club i was able to run a race and for city council i was able to um really rally a movement around the bernie sanders campaign when he when he was running for office so i have a lot of name recognition here in this district i m one of the few candidates that s actually lived for at least over a decade recently in this district as well so i ve built that community support and those are intangibles that money can t buy q i ve never seen a policy analysis in a major american journalism outlet that thinks free college tuition makes sense rich people s kids should pay free college has the threat to drive out existing public universities free college transfers responsibility from an individual to taxpayers in general to pay for free college free college in the nations that s been used around the world has led to overindulgence by the students who take seven or eight classes and then drop after two or three in short it s a recipe for chaos what is the case for free a so if you look back in the past we almost had free college already in in decades ago um and just because we have a tuition free college does not mean that there s not gonna be a way to get accepted to these these universities getting into sdsu for example is a difficult task and then ucla berkeley any state school there s still going to have requirements of being able to get the grade advertisement q that s not the issue this issue isn t getting into any college you want it s making college free which is something that historically has not worked out well in the places it s tried california in the 50s and 60s had very cheap college and that worked out quite well but it didn t have completely free college and there is economists say of course there have to be costs to something or it s just going to be like a buffet everyone will take all you can eat so i still i d like to hear you name an economist who thinks free college makes sense a um as as if you want to look at the economy we look at a generation that is strangled by student loan debt q in fact in california student loan debt is way below average the average california student loan debt was 23 000 which is bad but it s not nearly as bad as the national average a right but we still have several students that are still if if when when when you look at going out of college with a 22 000 debt right i m a veteran i have 35 000 worth of student loan debt why because i took took some grad school right that doesn t bode well for getting a home starting a family starting a business the economic growth is stifled you don t need an economist to tell you that having a generation that is being strangled by this massive amount of debt is bad if you look at the generations before the millennial generation you ll see that student loan debt wasn t that bad that s why they have record levels of home ownership that s why they have business ownership that s why they control the majority of the wealth in this country is because they the other generations didn t have an a a albatross around their neck that basically stopped them from being able to excel because they have to go to do one two three level three jobs just to pay off these student loans so so the comparison between now and and and and like the minimum amount of money that was paid which was basically free compared to what we think is free right there is no comparison and what we now have is results now not not what results will be later because what we do know is that life was better back then when college was basically free especially here in the state of california versus what it is now because you can look around san diego and see the youth moving out of town because they can t afford to buy a home they can t afford to live because they have to pay a car payment s worth amount of of bills every month just to pay off their student loan debt that doesn t see an end in sight some students don t even think they re going to be able to pay off their student loans until the age of 65 so so that s not an economy that works so to say that the economy is working with these absorbing costs are all is also kind of shortsighted q but that s an argument that that college debt is bad the specific argument i made is that it doesn t work free college for all doesn t work why should rich people have a subsidy from taxpayers for their kids and why how do colleges get around the problem that if everything s free then the students have no compulsion to try hard or to do things because there s no downside to them failing a private schools still going to be charged so you re still going to pay for harvard you re still going to pay for yale you re still going to pay for all of these institutions but a student that works hard to get a 4 0 coming out of college or community college or high school to go to cal state berkeley right to go to go to sdsu those students are grateful to even be accepted to those schools so i have to argue the premise that the students are going to freeload these students are going to work because they were happy to even be able to have the opportunity advertisement some students don t even think they re going to be able to pay off their student loans until the age of 65 so so that s not an economy that works jose caballero q in europe when they ve done this this is what happened a yes but this is america this isn t europe everything we do in americas is uniquely american and what we have in america are the best rated education educational systems in the world and what we need to do is give our american citizens the opportunity to take advantage of them q define uh we we ve had a lot of conversations with candidates uh their feeling about medicare for all what is your version of medicare for all a my my medicare for all is the the house resolution that was passed by or not passed but uh introduced by um in the house um so i do want to see a a free at the point of service health care system that includes vision dental hearing and and end of life and also make illegal private insurance that is covered by medicare for all so so i want to see the elimination of private health insurance and and to go ahead and take it the next argument nobody s fighting for blue cross nobody s fighting to keep their anthem nobody s fighting to keep these insurance companies in business what people are fighting for is trying to get a treatment because they need a biopsy but their insurance company s not allowing them to do that they want to make sure that they get sick that they can afford their copay or the premiums people don t want to be able to sit and say well if i get sick and i have to pay a 5 000 deductible why am i paying my health insurance companies that 5 000 every year right so that s the flavor of medicare for all that i m going to bring to the table q but more than 70 of americans consistently support and like their health insurance as is meanwhile on border towns across northern states canadians come to america to get services that they can t get because of rationed care advertisement a that 70 that 70 number is actually people like their own health care not health insurance people like their doctors people like their hospitals people like the community the relationships that they build with their medical professionals people aren t saying man i love my blue cross oh i love blue shield so much that i don t want to lose them people are saying i don t want to lose my doctor i don t want to lose my hospital that s what they re saying and under the medicare for all system that s not going to be affected q but in 2009 in 2010 when obamacare was adopted polls showed that americans like their health insurance and in november 2010 63 congressional democrats lost their seats because of the affordable care act so that seems to suggest a level of satisfaction with the status quo that the medicare for all thing it s just an echo chamber of about 15 of the people in the left a well if you look at the affordable care act you ll see that the affordable care act was a system that was designed to make you purchase private health insurance so of course if you re forced to buy private health insurance that you already have or that you may like that s that s that s comparing apples to apples what we re talking about here is we re talking about we re gonna we re going to completely remove that system that is that is a complete burden to most americans in society and just focus on the health care part so yes of course people would be annoyed if they have to switch insurance providers but what we re talking about here is just eliminating the insurance providers and just making it a single payer system through medicare for all so it s a completely different it s a different argument so so i m not so i agree the way that health uh the the affordable care act was rolled out and the way that it forced americans to buy into another private industry was wrong and most americans hated that so so for me it s like let s remove that entire process and just give people the health care that they deserve q but it s matt yglesias it s not right wingers who say the left wing of the democratic party perceives a world in a different way than moderate voters and moderate voters are not eager for the kind of wholesale changes that the left is selling in this case including with medicare for all i simply am waiting for the first poll ever that shows like 25 or 30 of older americans have any interest in this they re scared by change and nothing you re saying addresses this fact you re just making the case for it what about the case that americans don t want change this dramatic a well we have to look at the people who are suffering under the current system you re looking at millions of people being uninsured you re looking at bankruptcies everyday happening in this country you re looking at people dying because they can t afford their insulin so so yeah there may be people that are sitting there being like ooh i don t want to change but there are people who are dying for this change so we have to really look at it from a wholesale point of view and look at the americans and the people across this country that if they do not provide it they re dead and if you want to talk about the economy i do not think it s very good economic sense to have a sick employee workforce or a workforce where they re losing family members or having to take care of their or spending their entire life savings to take care of grandma right or or or a sick kid right these are the things that are actually happening and if you actually do look at the polls this is why almost every single major democratic candidate running for president right now is saying medicare for all in some form or some flavor because it does poll well and that s what people want now there may be a small majority a sliver of people that say no i don t want change but that s always the way status quo works so we cannot say oh these people don t want to change status quo that s going to be that argument every time there s any wholesale policy change that changes the way this country runs social security people didn t want it people when when child labor laws were removed people didn t want it right or when we added child labor laws when we added the weekend people didn t want it when we ended slavery people didn t want it so so i don t think it s a good idea to go toward the argument of people who don t want change we need a people that we do need change that is going to help most americans so so for me i am going to be fighting for the people that are suffering the most in this country because that s what this country was founded on founded on helping downtrodden and helping the people that need the most help and that s the that s why i am for medicare for all with the elimination of private health insurance a member of the audience holds up a placard as us senator bernie sanders independent from vermont discusses medicare for all legislation on capitol hill in washington dc jim watson afp getty images advertisement q the country is running a 1 trillion deficit a yes q we re on track to spend 25 of our budget in about 10 years on debt service how do you pay for this a uh the the how will you pay for it it s actually been it s been shown in many different ways you can look at it through through the bill that has already been proposed in the house um we have to be careful when we say how do we pay for it because for example we never talked about how we re going to pay for the trump tax cuts never talked about it but yet we spent 1 9 trillion dollars of american money for this tax cut yet when we talk about social services that s when we start talking about how we pay for it most americans don t even know how we pay for fire departments locally why would the sudden they know how if if i gave an exam if i went in and gave a articulate two page answer on how we pay for medicare for all people would be like well that s that s just all googly goop why because it s high level policy analysis so for me it has been shown how we pay for it bernie sanders has shown how we pay for it debbie dingell has showed how we pay for it representative um uh omar and have have have explained how we pay for it the answer is out there it s those people who are willing to look for the answer that actually finds it and so so i feel like how do you pay for it is more of a shutdown the conversation comment more than i m actually interested how you do it q two years ago hawaii senator brian schatz said when democrats return to power like we had in 2009 2010 we shouldn t answer the questions about how we re going to spend things because look at the republicans look at how irresponsible they are what about those of us who aren t democrats or republicans who don t like either party and both parties have abandoned fiscal restraint you act like it s an easy question how to pay for it it s not an easy question the thrust of the criticism of the washington post of warren s plan was that she s lying about the fact that ultimately the middle class is going to have to pay far more just the rich alone won t do it a so so let s let s so we can dive into that so right now americans are paying over 35 trillion a year on uh in in i m sorry i think that number may be wrong i may have to be fact checked on that one but americans are spending more on private health insurance than they ever would on a on a public system so when you re paying those deductibles these families that are paying over almost 12 000 a year in their completely healthy families those families are paying for it already it s not like we re not already paying for health care cost we are just transitioning a to a more efficient model that doesn t allow private corporations to profit off of our sickness and we cannot allow these corporations to commodify the the sickness and illness of our of our citizenry we need to put that into the government s hands so we have oversight very few people even how much a pregnancy costs or how much a broken leg costs people aren t shopping around which hospital to go to if they break their leg they re going to the hospital that s what they re supposed to do so the fact that we have to sit here and say look how are we going to pay for it it s like well how do we already pay for it i don t think a lot of people are because we re going bankrupt so so for me i think we need to solve the problem on how we re going to pay for it transition it from the common person to everyone so then everybody s bills go down dramatically and that and that and that s the case that s why it the the koch brothers study that was released said that medicare for all would be cheaper by at least 2 trillion so so we have to look at we re already paying for health care it s not like we re just magically gonna pay for what we re paying for health care now and then pay for medicare for all on top of that it s a transition and that s how that s how we ve got to pay for it is the fact that we already are we re just going to shift where the money is going advertisement q but you re using the word transition this doesn t sound like a transition this sounds like almost a 180 degree turn and why wouldn t you be more supportive of something that is more transitional something like uh joe biden has put forward or that uh medicare for those who want it a yeah oh that was buttigieg that says that but but but um so so the transitional system hasn t has a big fatal flaw and this is what it is if we have a system where okay we have a medicare for all system for people who want it so therefore people who are poor that can t afford private health insurance you re going to create a death spiral we talked about this in debates with with uh affordable care act of like only six people are going to be a part of this plan and the private industry is going to take all the healthy people and then they re going to be able to lower their costs and then the medicare for all systems is going to crush get crushed by it the only way this is going to work is if we put everybody on it so the pool the risk pool is manageable and when i talk about transition i really am talking about so we have like i said blue shield and anthem and blue cross and all of these these these insurance companies the people who work for those companies do an important job they code what is being administered right they say okay this doctor did this this this patient got this those jobs are still going to be needed and they can get absorbed into the medicare for all system and get a federal job with benefits and pension rather than the private job that they already have so that s what i mean by transition because we are going to have to absorb those private uh employee employees into a into a nationalized system so so i believe that once we have that then i think we re going to we re going to be in completely ok shape because if we go too slow the medicare for all system will be been bankrupt before we can get it off the ground so that s my biggest fear and that s why i believe we need to move q saskatchewan instituted a national health care program in 1995 that was compulsory for everybody but it also has a robust system under which wealthier people can buy additional coverage so i know you said that america is unique and we shouldn t learn from other countries but why shouldn t we learn from other countries a well why well does a rich person s leg more valuable than a poor person s leg like you have to we have to realize that health care is health care sick people get people get heart attacks if you re wealthy or not right and we need to be able to provide that health care we should not create this this two tiered system that this country is so used to we already have a oligarchy like 1 ruling most of the things in this country already why should we allow that to continue we should make it a system where everybody is equal so everybody receives that coverage if you look at finland and i m gonna take a quick tangent if you look at finland for example and how they do education they banned all private schools guess what happened the the the rich kids and their parents had to go to public schools what did those parents do they started investing in the public schools to make them better right so so we have to look at the system as we re all in this together and and just because somebody is more wealthy doesn t mean that they get the cut somebody else in line everybody should receive coverage 100 and that s that s the way i see it there shouldn t be a tiered system because if we this moment we created it to your system where we re going we re going right back to where we are now we have to look at the system as we re all in this together and and just because somebody is more wealthy doesn t mean that they get the cut somebody else in line jose caballero q yet health outcomes are better in taiwan then they are in canada and britain which have the nationalized kind of system you talk about it it s frustrating to talk to you sometimes because i bring up specific examples that you broaden out into this idealistic utopianism it works better in taiwan to have a two tiered system than the single tiered system in canada and britain they live longer they have better health outcomes why can t we do something that acknowledges the fact that rich people are going to pay more for the basics of life and they re willing to and they re ready to have a system that says mediocrity for all in saskatchewan there is an eight month wait eight month wait for some kinds of medical procedures is that ideal advertisement a so so again like when we go we can cherry pick a lot of different things that are happening across different countries but us as representatives as americans we re going to take what works best in all the countries and then make a system that is uniquely american we in america have one of the best medical systems in the entire world and that s not going to go away just because we changed the way we pay for our health care i think that it s a misnomer to think that oh if we just allow people into the medical system that all of a sudden these doctors are going to quit these nurses are going to we re going to have these massive waiting lines it s like we already have waiting lines in this country like like if you don t have enough insurance you re in a waiting line right so so and it s a lot longer than britain and canada and all of these things because it s a it s a waiting line for exclusively poor people in america so what we need to do is allow our quality health care system that we have it s not it s not britain s health care system it s not canada s system it s not taiwan system it s going to be america s system q but in fact america system is way better on heart attacks and way better on heart health than any other nation in the world we are not been on vast other categories including the most basic things such as childbirth so you hold america out as this exceptional thing and say it will continue after we change it s not exceptional except for one big area a well and and and that and that has a lot to do with the the way that we do preventative medicine the way that we deal with with with people health outcomes for example our health our health outcomes are pretty bad because there s a lot of people who don t go to the doctor until it s too late why because they don t have health insurance or it s too expensive to go even with their health insurance so of course america s health and health outcomes are going to be abysmal because people are going to the doctor way too late if we had a system that allowed people to go and get a checkup annually maybe we could catch that tumor or that cancer or or that even even the pregnancy even maybe a a danger with the birth the pregnancy early but because we re on a system that is like oh it s going to cost you a lot of money if you go to the doctor ooh maybe maybe my sore arm isn t that bad right q i didn t say american health outcomes are abysmal i just said that there s one area where they re exceptional and the other ways are right there in the middle a yeah well and and we could be better than the middle and the way that we re going to be better than the middle is by preventative medicine and making sure that we can we can actually catch our problems of americans before they become major life threatening issues that end to loss of life and that s that s what medicare for all is going to allow people to do is go to the doctor when they need to before it s too late jon and sabine sherman bang drums as they march with mission bay high school students participating in the global climate strike in pacific beach on friday september 20 2019 in san diego california hayne palmour iv the san diego union tribune advertisement q let me ask you about um the green new deal obviously you re all in on it there s a lot of democrats moderate democrats like scott peters who have reservations about it kind of like this rate of change fear that some people have why is that uh uh so necessary at this moment why why why why move so quickly a well we re in a climate crisis we don t have much time left um we are losing rain forest at a ridiculous rate q how much time do you think we have a well on on the uh conservative side 10 years i think we have 10 years before we can actually do something uh before we can do something about what is happening to actually create carbon sequestration restore our soils to to the have more trees and things of that nature we need to completely go with an aggressive plan to end the fossil fuels that we re we re doing as countries for easy steps that we could start with removing every fossil fuel subsidy this country gives remove all agriculture subsidies that degade our environment because agriculture is destroying our environment to be able to feed large amounts of of of animals to the the massive monocropping farming that is that is destroying our soils because there is as our soils become less um enriched the less carbon that they can pull from the co2 so we need to be able to do things like that we need to punish industries that continue to pollute with with no regard meaning a carbon tax on industry i i like to say about 73 per every ton of co2 created creates about 300 billion in revenue a year that we can then use to to continue to build into the climate crisis and and and help preventing we need to put trillions of dollars in our infrastructure to completely re re change our our our uh energy structures the our infrastructure making sure that we actually have buildings that are more green um because we have a lot of buildings across the country right now that are that are that putting an air conditioning but it s not effective right and if they re putting more energy in to keep a place cool when they could do it better so so it really comes down to i have a five year old son i love hiking i love going to the sequoias i love going to you know nature and and just sitting there and you know the bliss of what it is to sit on a mountaintop when i think about it 15 years from now that we re going to be possibly choking not choking for air but not have as much air quality having water quality problems my son will be 20 in 15 years i will be 30 40 47 right or 48 i would have already lived a pretty good chunk of my life he ll be 20 like that s a scary prospect to know that the planet will be choking with i will be choking at the same time as my son will and that is why i look at this urgency as a crisis that s why i think we should put every all the chips in to preventing the climate crisis because if we don t like it doesn t matter if we have education for all medicare for all or all these things if we have no planet to live on then we re all screwed we re all gonna die so when i look at this i look at this as an existential threat to our humanity and if we do not do something we ll go extinct and then the world will continue to turn until a couple million later and something else pops out of the ground and and i don t want our humanity to be stifled and ended before we before we even have a chance q that s a nonbinding resolution so what steps would you take as a congressional leader a well um some of the things i ve already mentioned which would be a the carbon tax making sure we remove subsidies from industries that pollute um and and i m really just ringing the alarm bell more and infrastructure trillion dollar infrastructure plans that i would like to see as well so so it s gonna be an all hands on deck issue and there s going to be a lot of representatives that are going to be fighting for different segments of the green new deal because it s going to take all of us to be able to create this omnibus package that is going to be the green new deal when it eventually becomes a bill advertisement q the head of the afl cio said the green new deal over my dead body right now the city of los angeles the department of water and power union is fighting mayor garcetti s attempts to shut down gas plants in favor of more environmentally friendly plants huge factions of the democratic party are not on board so it s not just the republican stick in the muds it s a party problem too a that s true it is a party problem and and what we have to do is we have to be more vocal on how we re going to deal with the transition so so we need to say look if you have a job that is that is reliant on fossil fuel production or fossil fuel energy then we need to start creating programs it s like oh well you re you re pretty good at manufacturing you know turbines for for gas plants why can t you let s train you to create those same turbines but different a little bit for a windmill or or or a tide tide plant or the things like that i was a reactor operator in the u s navy for for six years i know how to boil water but that s a very very it s a i just boiled it with nuclear nuclear energy that s all that s the only difference me boiling water with a solar plant is no different on how a power plant works so so what we have to do is we just have to use the tools that we have to retrain and retool and if we have to give subsidies to these workers for a few years to transition in like maybe give them like a climate crisis pension right where they lose their job and we give them a pension so they can retrain and go into another field that may be what we have to do because we can t just leave people out and out with no jobs i think that s a big problem as well what we need to do is we need to provide a transitional system that allows these workers to not lose everything because we are trying to save the planet and we can t have people and and because if we don t provide that we ll have the issue that we re having now which is people are trying to hang on for everything for their jobs and their livelihoods for their families which makes complete sense when you re in survival mode it s like oh my gosh these these climate activists want to remove my job yeah that s scary that s a scary prospect but we need to be more vocal and say hey look you may lose this job but we have another one here or we have something to transition you in so you won t lose everything in your family s livelihood at the same time so i think there s a disconnect in the way that we communicate because a lot of people hear oh this is what they want to do but we really don t talk a lot about what transition is going to take place and i think that is a big step that we need to talk about more is what are we going to do with the displacement of workers and and i think that s a valid argument and i i do think that if that s expressed more effectively i think we ll be in a better place but yes there is some push back but i think overall the people in this in this country are just afraid q a year ago the yougov people did a massive survey of like 20 000 americans and they found like there s eight distinct categories of americans on the left there s like 8 of people who fervently believe in all this stuff on the right there s like 7 of fervent people but the people in the middle are as distant from democrats as they are from republicans on these kinds of issues so i want to get get back to my question is it possible that you re in a bubble where you hear people tell you these things all the time and you don t grasp the fact that these are views that represent the the left 8 of america as opposed to the 50th percentile or even the 75th percentile the the survey had example after example of liberal democrats who hear people talking progressive talk and they re saying what is that about you can t print money a yeah so so luckily for me um i actually grew up in conservative texas as a catholic uh so i have this ability i like to make the joke i speak fluent conservative um and i talk to people across the country um about these issues all the time yeah there s a bubble here but when we re talking about national issues when i talk to a conservative right about about climate crisis a lot of them are like oh we can t afford it we can t change it and i go back to i go back to things like property for example fire fire insurance companies companies that provide fire insurance for most properties um in l a have either stopped covering fire protection or have made it four to six times the cost of what it is now that actually has direct impacts on their livelihood and their personal property because if they know they can t get fire insurance to be able to protect their their their belongings that s when it actually affects them and so when you actually talk about the actual impacts of what it s like to have a climate in crisis people kind of open their eyes like oh wait that is a problem oh the winters have been getting hotter over the last decade if you bring it back to them to the person and rather than the existential crisis that the climate crisis is because that s a hard concept for most people to grasp is the idea that the planet is burning down and it may not be here and you know we may not be able to fix it in 10 years that s a lot for people to take in and a lot of people are like oh i don t want to think about that i have to take my kids to school right what what we have to do is we have to be like look if you don t do this if we don t make this happen then your kids probably won t even be able to go to school you know and actually have the existential conversation with them there on how it affects them personally and when you talk about the economy how much is it going to cost when miami goes underwater right why don t we prevent that from happening before it happens and when you put it in the terms like that people are like wow that that that that is a big deal right and the massive economic loss that we ll have if we don t do anything at this moment is much higher than what we can put in front end and it s going to be expensive both ways and it s just how people want to how people want to pay for it if you re going to be after catastrophe or is it going to be to prevent it that s where we have to weigh it yeah we need to be more vocal and say hey look you may lose this job but we have another one here or we have something to transition you in so you won t lose everything in your family s livelihood at the same time jose caballero q talk a little about criminal justice i saw on your website something interesting your dad was a drug dealer and money launderer advertisement a yes q your stepfather was a police detective a yes q so how do you would that in your kind of where do you come down on criminal justice reform a yeah um well obviously our criminal justice system is flawed it has a lot of really major issues um going back from the the drug war of you know criminalizing um mainly bright black and brown people the fact that we have increased the prison populations in this country at an astronomical rate um has has really created not only the loss of the economic development of putting all these people behind bars and then the impacts of their families after they have to deal with that incarceration the fact is that we have created a level of distrust of our own law enforcement within our own people right people are afraid to call the police these are the things that we need to be uh concerned about that if people think about calling the police it may be a death sentence that s horrifying to know being a son of a detective right and where my father is what i hope and i and assume and you know and as i talked to him is a good police officer right he does the right thing and and i appreciate all the work that he does so what we need to do is we need to make some big changes first you know we need to we need like do simple things like banning the chokehold making sure that we um you know go into police practices where did they can t use profanities you know little things like that like for example if a police officer comes to your windows and get the f out of the car well that escalation has already happened right police officers should stop talk to the to the people the way they want to be talked to right because they don t want to be disrespected they shouldn t disrespect the person as well right because it creates that that level of of of anxiety that doesn t need to be there i want to see the decriminalization of of all drugs in this country because what we re seeing right now is q all drugs advertisement a yes so so yeah so so the users shouldn t be punished q opioids are killing people they ve lowered life expectancy three years in a row i m a libertarian to the core and i ve argued for decriminalization decriminalization of drugs my whole life but opioids a so you want to criminalize percocet you want to criminalize you know all of these opioids that doctors are prescribing over the counter at a ridiculous rate q i think uh i think uh painkillers that are prescribed are different than saying opioids should not should be legal a but what are where are people getting their people are dying from the drugs that the doctors are prescribing q no the overwhelming cause of drug deaths in america is from fentanyl that s manufactured in china advertisement a but why are they addicted to fentanyl because their doctor there was a this is a personal story i had just had i ran into a family their son just died of an opioid overdose because they got he got in a skateboarding accident broke his ankle doctor prescribed them large amounts of opioids after his heel ankle healed he wanted to continue to get high off those opioids and then he got into the opioid fentanyl and he died because they didn t monitor the amount of opioids that they were prescribing him so when i going back to the decriminalization piece we can have people rather than running from the police coming to the police for help right now what we have are people hiding in the shadows shooting up because the government makes him do so if we can have a system where it s a medical issue where we have medical officers walking around saying hey we re here to help you if you need any medical needs i believe that it will make people say hey look i got a problem and ticked it and it doesn t ruin their lives because if you were to go to an officer and say hey i m addicted well we don t know where that s going to go next right so what we need to do is we need to allow people a safe level of comfort to be able to come up to their government and say hey look i have a problem and i need medical assistance and the only way we re going to be able to do that is do what portugal has done portugal has actually has actually saw no increase or decrease in their crime rates or their drug use but what they have seen is that people are getting safer because they re actually going to the government for help q glenn greenwald before he became the famous muckraker wrote the most famous piece about the portugal experiment and it found that on the extremes with really hard drugs like morphine and heroin it was scary what was going on so por portugal is buying my theory that yeah make most drugs legal but be very very very careful the ones that are super addictive and kill you a so so what we have to do is we have to go in deeper and figure out where are these drugs coming from that s a big one right where i m not saying we re going to decriminalize the drug dealers that are bringing in black tar heroin from wherever right or or fentanyl from china or i m not saying stop the policing of these these horrible substances that are hurting american lives every day that s not what i m saying at all what i m saying is the people who unfortunately get addicted to these substances are the ones that need our help and if we criminalize them they re going to run away from our government rather than running to our government for help and that s where my biggest case is if we can talk maybe about the fringes about maybe heroin maybe opioids maybe all of these things can still be criminalized but it s already criminalized and the and the opioid opioid deaths are sky high like you said you know like heroin sky high you know meth sky high so obviously what we re doing now isn t working so we need to start looking at different ways to figure out how we re going to address this problem because currently status quo is not working so so those kids are still dying those people are still dying so what we need to do is we need to take some serious action that is in a different direction rather than continuing to put more weight on a system that isn t working so that s the way that i see it and i think i could be open to a conversation about opioid and heroin and how we will address those systems because we may address those those those substances in a different way i agree with you we may be able to do that but what i what i do believe in is the philosophical point of view that if we decriminalize these substances people will be more willing to seek medical attention if it doesn t destroy their lives after they do us border patrol agent theron francisco looked off in to the otay mountain wilderness area where the border fence will be constructed in the coming year at the us mexico border east of otay mesa in san diego on tuesday october 15 2019 john gibbins the san diego union tribune q so on immigration and border issues where do you stand what do you believe about what some of the candidates said in june in which they essentially said we should have no ice we should have no border patrol a well i i we should have border patrol i think to say we don t have borders we ve had border patrol for a long time we should keep border patrol ice i agree we should get rid of ice um i i believe and i m a i m a grandson of immigrants three of my grandparents were were immigrants to this country so i want to see first off the ending of the the camps that are that are holding these these these these people uh i want to criminalize the separation of families i don t want to see that happen anymore uh i want to remove the private prison industry from this process as well i want to also remove the um refugee cap that that that trump has put into place of over i think a little over 11 000 people which is de facto zero um we don t have a crisis that requires us to cap our refugees um at all in this country um and i want to see a one page intake process so for example if you re an immigrant coming to this country the way that i would like to see it is you would do the basic information of like what it takes to do an international background check they do an international background check if it comes back clear you can give that person working a working documents so they can start working you can also if you want to give them an ankle bracelet so we can track them for until they get a court hearing that works as well but we should allow them to go to the place that they re going to go let s say they got to go to minnesota right and their family is in minnesota let them go to minnesota and let them set up a court hearing date there so you can oh so you don t have to create a burden on the border system and the border courts where you have entire courtrooms filled of five year olds to do these hearings right this this isn t a system that works so we have to not put so much burden on our border cities like here in san diego right we need to we need to create that process and if they don t come back clear then you can hold them for a few days and figure out where what s going on why why they why are they on an international crime watch why are all these types of things so i think that and also lastly creating more um uh administrators putting more administrators at the border so they can actually intake the amount of people that are coming in i think that they ve created a false bottleneck situation is where they take the administrators away therefore increasing the length times of being able to get processed we need to change that and just bring as much as we need to process what is what is for the people who are coming in um so that s kind of what i want to see as far as reform um because i think that the way we re doing it now is incompassionate and all also really unworkable for america and its economy like we we ve had immigrants in this country since the beginning and if we start stopping it now we re only going to stifle our economic growth advertisement q one of the biggest arguments from the right is that uh the democrats want open borders what you re saying sounds very much like open borders a well we would start a process right we would still have court hearings would still have what we have now about you know immigration courts and things like that that s still going to exist i m not calling for open borders like i said i still want a border patrol i still want some level of security on our borders to say otherwise is is is silly and and i challenge any democrat that says i want open borders and i want to debate them right now and tell them how that s a bad idea we need to have some form of intake process so we can track our people just like we do our citizens to this day in this country right so so i think that open borders is a fear mongering word to scare a lot of conservatives to make people like me sound like i want open borders when i don t because like i said border patrol needs to stick around we need to have an intake process that does that does a check on them and we need to be able to track them and have hearings in a court of law immigration court like we have that that show that they are going to be productive members of our society q and where where would the cap be then how many immigrants would we be talking about a well um well there isn t a cap necessarily as well for me i don t i don t really see a necessity for a cap because we don t even know right we ve had so many caps that we don t even like i think that a cap system has inherent flaws um but i definitely would i would be open to expanding our caps by by by large amounts to see okay if we have our cap let s say refugees rather than 11 000 and say it s a quarter million right and then we hit that quarter million and we see more people coming in and we d be like okay what effects did that have on our economy can we expand that can we let more people in but maybe when we hit those caps we can then readdress should we expand them right i think that s where we can be where we can have more of a tiered system i think that would be important because then we can actually know how many people are coming q but to return to a theme once again what did the american people believe two years ago there was a poll asking americans how many immigrants should we allow a year america has averaged allowing about a million a year for most of the century and 85 said less than 500 000 and like half said less than a quarter million there is no appetite for the kind of immigration contemplated by democratic candidates and this is not a conservative position a great majority of african americans wanted it under 500 000 so once again to return to the theme my questions to you aren t you in a kind of a bubble where you re advocating things the majority of americans don t want a well i don t think there was ever any time in american history where immigrants were seen as a good thing um so so but we can see through historical data that immigrants are a great thing advertisement q and elites totally believe that we absolutely believe that but then they also turn and say why don t we have a system like canada canada doesn t have lotteries canada says you can get in if you ve got a college degree or you can get into ifyou have a half million dollars to start a business canada has a system that treats immigration like it s college and that s what the elites in this country want a right so but but again um we re talking about america has major industry that doesn t require a college degree it doesn t require a quarter million dollars or half a million dollars to start a business if you want to go like my grandfather did and worked for the railroad to support his family then by god they should be able to do that so so for me it s like people forget the think like what do immigrants build in our country they build a massive level of our infrastructure and our food processing right if we don t have that we re in trouble like if we didn t have the chinese immigrants come and help build the california west coast railroad system or if we didn t have the people coming from europe uh to come and help our industry when we are actually industrializing for the first time in this country if we didn t have the the the mexican community coming in to to to help pick our crops where would we be right now and and so what we have to do is be very very critical and very very clear on what our country will look like after we let these immigrants in and what what could flourish from our economy because we have mountains of evidence and proof that it works and all the american people want to know is that you re going to be safe and and there is a lot of fear mongering that has been happening on a lot of different media outlets that make it seem like you got a fear of the brown person coming over the border well that has worked for a long for the most part people are afraid of the other but what we have to do is we have to change that narrative and yes that it is a very liberal position to stand where i stand but this is also the most liberal progressive district in the county of san diego so so these arguments may not resonate to a georgian somebody in georgia but it is resonating to people here in here in this county in this district so my job is to represent their voice in d c and i and i have the tools to be able to have those constructive conversations with other representatives across the country to let them understand where we are coming from and if we put somebody in that is going to be reserved on those positions in a border town like san diego where i don t think anybody here fears their lives because we have mexico border 15 minutes away so so we need to be able to address that message loud and clear because there s a lot of people people live in tennessee that don t even have a border next to them other than the you know like that that is the type of representative we need to be talking to and saying hey it s okay it s nothing to be afraid of so i think that s very valuable to have in d c even though there is an opposition i want to make sure that we still respect the second amendment because it is there i just want to i just want the regulation piece to be adhered to in the constitution jose caballero q you served in the military yes uh what s your what s your standing on gun rights a i am so it s always so funny i always say oh you know from being from texas it s hard to be very clear um my belief is that we should ban all high powered assault rifles of all kinds those are weapons of war being in military i don t think they belong in the hands of untrained civilians i think that s very dangerous however i do believe that we have a second amendment that is very that that talks about regulation well regulated militia so what i want to see is a registration system that is similar to registering a car i hear argument all the time from the conservative side say hey a car is just as dangerous as a gun true that s why we license do vision tests do written tests do expiration dates on licensing like registration so let s use that and let s play that logic forward if you want a gun you have to get a license you have to get it registered you have to take an eye exam to take a written safety exam you have to you have to train proficiency to know that you can lock it safety put it in a safe like those types of things so and for as far as the and being from texas i know a lot of my my old high school buddies they like to go out and shoot some weapons what i want to see is possibly creating facilities where those those people who like to shoot guns recreationally can go to a facility and shoot targets they can keep their guns at a locker there they can go inspect their weapons they can do have fun whatever go and shoot at the range and then put it back and then leave so i i believe that we can t have both best of both worlds i think there there s a lot of people on my side even that are just like just ban them all no no way like i m in a i want to make sure that we still respect the second amendment because it is there i just want to i just want the regulation piece to be adhered to in the constitution q you re not saying ban home storage advertisement a no i m not i m not saying ban home storage uh so so like when you said well oh sorry ban ban home storage for high powered automatic or not automatic but high powered assault rifles as well so so so like if you have a long you know an ar 15 whatever can t store that at home store it at the store it at the local facility that allows you to store those weapons and you can go and shoot it and have it there q what about those ban entirely a well they are but we have to rethink how we re going to if we re going to ban all assault rifles right then maybe we should we should reconsider some of the things that we have in place already q you said you uh you would be in a very liberal progressive district and district yet the incumbent is very much more a nancy pelosi democrat than an aoc democrat aoc s chief of staff was forced to quit after he said moderate democrats might as well be republicans who needs them so it s pretty much i m back to my question i just i don t perceive a national appetite for the agenda that your slice of the party is so enraptured with and i just don t see how you get from here to there the nancy pelosi approach she s told the the the squad over and over again we can get way more done if you tone it down and they don t tone it down a we ve moved further to the furthest to the left than we ever have in this country s time we re talking about medicare for all we re talking about green new deal we re talking about all of these really progressive issues because they didn t tone it down we have to continue to scream and be loud at these points because if the american people don t see that there s people fighting for these points how are they going to be to have the courage to talk about it with their families we have to have champions in office that stand for these issues because if in any negotiation if you want to negotiate something you have to start from your most strongest position strongest footing and then once we re at that table we can start having adjustments but if we start negotiating before we even get to the room we re already we re already cheating the american people so so for me i m i m unapologetically progressive i you know that after this conversation but what i know is that there s a lot of americans that aren t represented and they want people like aoc ilhan omar in office too so they can sing the song that they want to hear so they feel represented and in this district for far too long they have not been represented because like you said a nancy pelosi democrat incumbent right that s who that sue s been sitting in the seat for a long time people want a more progressive viewpoint and that is why when i was pushing on the issues that i was pushing on i feel that the district was really moved a direction that that susan was still at she was still in the early two thousands it s now 2020 it s completely different world now in this image from video presiding officer chief justice of the united states john roberts reads a question during the impeachment trial against president donald trump in the senate at the u s capitol in washington thursday jan 30 2020 senate television via ap associated press q let me ask ya about impeachment i assume that you are all in on impeachment my question is this is that you ve always got to take polls with a grain of salt but if you look at 538 s running average on impeachment it has not only narrowed but flipped so according to the most recent poll this weekend more americans oppose impeachment then support it why does that argument not resonate with your advertisement a i know you can see so many different things yeah um well when it comes to impeachment like i am not going to say oh we re going to impeach trump and he s going to leave office right like i m not naive like i i know for a fact that the senate still has strong control you can look at the statements of what mitch mcconnell said about impeachment recently that he s working with the white house to make sure that they don t get impeached which is completely impartial to or completely yeah completely impartial uh not impartial completely partial my words are getting tangled up here but but what we can see is that the one side of the party is completely working for the trump administration versus another party that isn t unfortunately the senate has control however we do need to follow our constitutional duty to to to to impeach a president on constitutional violations on constitutional grounds and if we decide all of a sudden they d be like we re not going to do anything we re just going to let it pass we are sending a message that is so loud and clear to the future of our country the people that are going to be assuming this office later doesn t matter what you do you can do whatever you want and that is not okay and if we re going to have this impeachment we need to do it with integrity and we need to do it full hilt full tilt you know we ve got to go to the hilt for it we ve got to fight as hard as we can because it s the right thing to do now when we if we look at outcomes of what s gonna happen i think that just waters down our message more i think we just need to stick to stick to the arguments that we have and we need to impeach donald trump that needs to happen i mean we impeached clinton for less so so so what we need to do is we need to have it have the discussion openly and we don t know the like you said it s been flipping back and forth right it s like a pancake with the american people right now it just keeps on going back and forth back and forth so we don t know we saw more republican defections go into the democratic party recently so we could see that on the senate side q there s now been a democratic defection a yeah that s true too exactly so so we so we don t know you know i think i think time will tell i would love to see donald trump appear in front of the senate and have his his time to speak i think if that happens i think that will enlighten a lot of american people on what is happening but yes i have been calling for impeachment for a long time because of emoluments for a lot of different reasons and i think that we need to proceed and to continue this fight this fight 100 no holds barred and then we can see what happens at the end of the day and then we can see what the american people feel after that so it s a very tough situation right now in our country we re in a constitutional crisis q yeah so we ve talked about a lot of different issues when you go out to the people in your district and talk to them what what is it that they prioritize what do they tell you a so a lot of it is health care um it is by far a hundred percent health care um i i ve talked to people when it s it s funny because when i speak to people at the door a lot of them is like hey what national issue do you you know care about a lot i m like ooh that s a big question you know there s so much going on nationally and and i i usually ask them i m like how s your health care how is it like paying your health insurance with you know how how are things going and they just open up and they say oh my gosh i pay this i ve been dealing with this i ve been dealing with this and i was like wouldn t it be better if we could just like eliminate all that and then go to the system and they re like oh yes it d be much better and that becomes a big part of the talking point um another thing is the fact that i m a veteran and the fact that i have the hero s promise and the hero s promise has really enlightened a lot of the conservative moderate people as well about wow we can actually protect our veterans and what i love about the hero s promise is veteran issues are very nonpartisan right people want their vets to do well i mean it doesn t matter if you re democrat or republican kids are going into the military and they want their kids to be taken care of so so when i go into the to the hero s promise a lot of people also are very very receptive to that because it s like oh this is an issue that we can all get behind and so so that s another thing that i feel is very very effective as well and then of course i m talking to a young person student loan debt forgiveness is a big one if i m talking to even a younger person it s about college for all right um so so there s a lot of a lot of different things and like who i m talking to that really changed a lot in the way that the conversations are going but yeah those are and then you know that s that s pretty much it and we also talk about climate too a lot there s a lot of green activists in san diego as well so so yeah it is the top issues that we re talking about the ones that are in national mainstream that s what people are talking about other than the hero s promise that s the unique angle that i have as a candidate that is that is powerful i will be fighting for medicare for all at the elimination of private health insurance i ll be fighting for um green new deal education for all student loan debt forgiveness immigration reform i ll be fighting for the hero s promise which is a military veteran bill of rights jose caballero advertisement q how many doors have you knocked on a um for this campaign uh we ve knocked on about 2 000 doors so far um we re planning on knocking several more in january um so we we ve been we ve been going out there and trying to get as many as we can we re going to be getting more volunteers i m talking about me personally knocked on 2 000 doors probably my volunteer efforts probably knocked on about another thousand after that but i ve been out there pretty much every day it s tough yeah q any other questions okay go ahead and give us your close a yes absolutely uh first thank you for taking your time i i love contention by the way so i thank you for for all those arguments i was speech and debater in college so bring it on i love it um so so i will be fighting for this district as an unapologetic veteran for peace progressive veterans for peace um i will be fighting for medicare for all at the elimination of private health insurance i ll be fighting for um green new deal education for all student loan debt forgiveness immigration reform i ll be fighting for the hero s promise which is a military veteran bill of rights i will be the candidate that will be supportive of the bernie sanders policies a lot of them um i m very in line with a lot of the things that he does um and i m here to be able to to give the voters a chance to fight for these unapologetic issues and knowing where i stand from the moment that i get in the office so you can visit my website at joseforcongress us to learn more we have probably the most robust issue page that of all the other candidates that are in the field right now so i urge all of you to take a look at that q thanks for coming in a thank you so much

everyone and welcome from me in december at our investor deep dive we gave you an update on our strategy to radically transform our bank by 2022 our performance in the fourth quarter shows two things a we have seen further good progress and b that our strategy is working and we will continue to execute in a disciplined manner we are in line with or ahead of all our key targets and objectives that were to be achieved in 2019 since 2018 we have set realistic targets and delivered against them we remain disciplined on costs we delivered our eighth quarter in a row of year on year reductions in adjusted costs excluding transformation charges and bank levies our capital ratio increased in the quarter and is at the high end of our international peer group and next to capital and costs where we have delivered now for a while we are also encouraged by the stabilization that we are seeing in our core businesses clients support our focused strategy and are actively reengaging with us a clear sign that our franchise is intact and this bodes well for our performance in 2020 and beyond let me go through these themes in detail starting with our performance against our 2019 objectives on slide two delivering on our near term objectives sets us up to achieve our long term goals in 2019 we executed against all our financial objectives we promised adjusted costs of eur21 5 billion excluding transformation charges and the impact of the global prime finance transfer to bnp paribas and we delivered our cost performance was in part driven by the reduction in employees where we ended the year at under 88 000 down more than 4 000 in the year and in line with our target since the end of the first quarter of 2018 we have reduced employees by around 10 000 we committed to keeping our cet1 ratio above 13 at the end of the year and we delivered our cet1 ratio at the end of the fourth quarter was 13 6 we promised a leverage ratio of 4 at the year end and we delivered 4 2 outperformance against our group capital ratio targets was principally driven by asset reductions in the capital release unit where we overachieved against our external targets thanks to good momentum toward the end of the quarter let me now go a little deeper into our 2019 performance on slide three in the core bank which represents our long term future and strategic vision we were encouraged by our performance in the face of our transformation and the challenges presented by the environment reflecting the improved performance in the fourth quarter we held core bank revenues flat in 2019 and grew pre tax profit by 7 excluding certain specific revenue and cost items which james will detail shortly this is a strong achievement against the magnitude of changes we have gone through in 2019 at a group level the results were obviously negatively impacted by the capital release unit but even here we are executing in line or slightly better than our planning assumptions so while we still have considerable work to do we are happy with our performance this year and in the fourth quarter let us look in more detail at the core bank revenues on slide four one of our core objectives when we announced our strategy in the summer was to stabilize and then grow revenues in the second half of 2019 the first six months of our strategic transformation we have grown core bank revenues excluding specific items slightly compared to the prior year period we achieved these results despite many headwinds including an even tougher interest rate environment and a slowing global economy looking at the year on year performance by business in the second half of 2019 now revenues in the corporate bank were flat as we grew loans principally in germany and performed well in asia to offset the ongoing impact of negative interest rates and as we said in the investor deep dive we started to actively reprice deposits in the fourth quarter which should begin to offset some of the impact of negative interest rates during 2020 we grew revenues in the investment bank by 7 in the second half and by 22 in the fourth quarter with a strong recovery in fixed income the focus in changes we have implemented in the third quarter are paying off this is our first quarter of year on year growth in the investment bank for 11 quarters with a strong recovery in our fixed income business fixed income revenues increased by more than 30 in the quarter led by our rates business which doubled and ongoing strength in our credit businesses our flow business recovered well helped by the improvement in our credit spreads revenues in the private bank were broadly stable we offset the headwinds from negative interest rates with growth in loan and investment product revenues repricing and benefits of hiring in wealth management in prior periods asset management continued its recovery with revenues up 12 in the second half reflecting higher performance fees in certain core funds now let me turn to the progress we have made on costs on slide five excluding transformation charges which james will detail shortly adjusted costs were eur5 1 billion in the fourth quarter and eur21 5 billion for the full year also excluding the costs associated with the prime finance platform the full year performance was in line with our communicated targets we made reductions in every major category while continuing to improve our technology and controls cost management will be a significant focus under the leadership of fabrizio campelli our chief transformation officer let s now turn to capital on slide six our commitment was and is to manage our transformation with our existing capital resources in this respect we feel even more confident after the fourth quarter we ended the year with a core tier one ratio of 13 6 comfortably meeting our prior guidance as in the third quarter we offset the negative impact of transformation effects with the positive impact of risk weighted assets reduction as a result we have increased our core tier one ratio in the second half of 2019 our year end core tier one ratio was around 200 basis points above our pillar two requirement and as you may remember our requirement was reduced by 25 basis points by the ecb with effect from january 1 2020 outperformance on the core tier one ratio largely reflects stronger than anticipated risk weighted asset reductions in the capital release unit since its creation at the start of the third quarter of 2019 we have reduced risk weighted assets in the cru by around 30 to eur46 billion at year end looking forward we reaffirm our commitment to keep our core tier one ratio above 12 5 at all times given our performance on capital in 2019 we believe we are in an even stronger position to execute against our capital plan we announced in july 2019 and we have created some room to allocate additional capital to growing our core businesses more broadly we have been managing our balance sheet conservatively and intend to keep doing so as you can see on slide seven we are focused on maintaining strong credit quality provision for credit losses was 17 basis points of loans in 2019 in line with our guidance and at low levels both historically and relative to our peers this reflects again our conservative underwriting standards our strong risk management and our low risk portfolios our loan to deposit ratio was 76 at year end and that reflects a strong and stable funding base supporting our high quality and growing loan portfolio our liquidity position also remains strong our liquidity coverage ratio of 141 gives us a surplus of eur55 billion over required levels looking forward our solid performance in 2019 should provide a good base for future growth our achievements last year also begin to highlight the underlying strength of our franchises and the benefits of our strategic decisions slide eight shows some example of the underlying momentum that we can see building the corporate bank operates in a highly attractive market with good returns and stable underlying growth in 2019 we grew corporate cash transactions by 9 and loans by 5 in the investment bank as we said in our investor deep dive in december the actions that we have taken to restructure our operations are bearing fruit and faster than we expected we see clear signs of higher client engagement around our more focused business model in addition the negative halo effect of our business exits on our core client relationships and adjacent product areas has been less than we anticipated we are also encouraged by the performance in the investment bank at the start of the year and are focused on further stabilizing revenues in the private bank we are focused on offsetting the pressure from negative interest rates as well as executing on the integration of the postbank and deutsche bank retail operations on both measures we are off to a solid start we grew our loan book by eur9 billion across the german and the international franchise and in our wealth management business and in line with our commitments we generated eur200 million of cost synergies from the integration in asset management we are building on the momentum that we have generated with our fourth consecutive quarter of net inflows in 2019 let me summarize on slide nine for this management team our priority is simple it s all about execution in 2019 we have delivered on all our targets for 2020 and beyond we aim to continuously deliver quarter by quarter on the strategic objectives and financial targets we have communicated to you on revenues the momentum across the core bank is building the recent improvement we have seen in our cds spreads both in absolute terms and relative to our peers is very encouraging and supports the business significantly lower cds and bond spreads make us more attractive for counterparties while also lowering our funding costs which helps improve our profitability we continue to progress on our regulatory remediation agenda some of this progress was visible to you in 2019 most notably our performance in the u s federal reserve ccar exam the financial stability board s reduction in our g sib classification and the ecb decision to reduce our pillar two capital requirement we are determined to maintain our progress with regulators in coming periods we are confident of sustaining our momentum on cost reduction in 2020 and reaching our eur19 5 billion target for adjusted costs excluding transformation charges and the costs associated with the prime finance platform that puts us on a path to deliver on our eur17 billion target in 2022 on capital we look ahead with increasing confidence given our solid core tier one ratio in the fourth quarter of 2019 overall we are aware of the uncertainties in the external environment and these are incorporated into our financial plans and the targets that we have laid out in december since then there are even signs that our macroeconomic assumptions may be on the conservative side put simply at this stage we can say that our transformation has started very well we are on track against all our objectives and are increasingly positive in the outlook and with 70 of the expected total transformation effects now behind us we are satisfied with what our teams have accomplished in this short time frame with that let me hand over to james james von moltke chief financial officer thank you christian let me start with a summary of our financial performance on slide 10 our results in both the quarter and the year were impacted by our actions to execute on our transformation which i will detail shortly in the fourth quarter revenues adjusted for specific items shown on slide 30 declined by 1 reflecting the wind down of noncore businesses in the capital release unit noninterest expenses of eur6 4 billion included approximately eur1 3 billion of restructuring and severance litigation and transformation charges our net loss in the fourth quarter was a little under eur1 5 billion including approximately eur400 million of transformation related deferred tax asset valuation adjustments tangible book value per share was eur23 41 a 4 decline from the third quarter mainly reflecting the net loss in the period for the full year we generated a pre tax loss of eur2 6 billion including eur1 1 billion of transformation related charges eur1 billion of goodwill impairment as well as eur805 million in restructuring and severance and eur473 million of litigation charges provision for credit losses was eur723 million in line with our expectations and at 17 basis points of loans remained relatively low our net loss of eur5 3 billion included eur2 8 billion of transformation related deferred tax asset valuation adjustments also in line with our expectations to execute quickly on our strategic transformation we took substantial costs in 2019 as you can see on slide 11 results in the fourth quarter included around eur1 1 billion of pre tax transformation effects these items included eur608 million of transformation related charges included in our definition of adjusted costs these charges principally relate to impairments and accelerated amortization of software intangibles and real estate charges results in the fourth quarter also included a further eur400 million deferred tax asset valuation adjustment for 2019 as a whole we have taken around 70 of our total planned transformation effects for 2020 and 2021 we expect a lesser but still significant burden on our results this year we currently affect a further eur1 billion of pre tax charges including eur400 million of accelerated software amortization which is not relevant for capital purposes we also currently expect a further eur400 million of deferred tax asset valuation adjustments progress we have made to date gives us confidence that we can successfully manage our capital position through the transformation let me now turn to the results for the core bank in the quarter on slide 12 the core bank grew revenues by 5 on a reported basis and by 8 excluding specific items operating leverage was positive in the quarter as we reduced adjusted costs excluding transformation charges by 2 risk weighted assets were flat as the reduction in operational risk rwa was offset by increases in regulatory inflation and business growth in the private bank leverage exposure increased as we grew business volumes including 8 loan growth let s now look in more detail at costs on slide 13 in the fourth quarter we reduced adjusted costs by around eur380 million or 7 year on year excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation and the transformation charges i described earlier adjusted costs included eur102 million of expenses incurred in the fourth quarter associated with the prime finance platform being transferred to bnp paribas which are reimbursable from december 2019 onwards for the full year adjusted costs also declined by 7 to eur21 6 billion or eur21 5 billion excluding the prime finance costs in the fourth quarter in both the fourth quarter and the full year we made progress in all major cost categories we reduced compensation and benefits expenses reflecting the reductions in internal workforce professional service fees declined as we further improve the efficiency of our external spend other costs declined reflecting reductions across a number of areas including occupancy consistent with our commitments we kept our it costs broadly stable and within our target range as we continue our investment program let me now move to discuss our capital ratios on slide 14 we increased our cet1 ratio by 24 basis points in the quarter to 13 6 as we more than offset the transformation effects with derisking in the capital release unit reductions in risk weighted assets generated 73 basis points of capital on an exchange rate neutral basis including approximately 41 basis points from the cru and approximately 20 basis points from lower market risk in our core bank the asset reductions were partly offset by the 47 basis point reduction in the capital ratio from the net loss for 2020 we reaffirm our target to manage our common equity tier one ratio to be at least 12 5 at all times on a pro forma basis our cet1 ratio at 1st january 2020 is 13 3 when considering the impact of the new securitization framework we ve discussed with you in previous calls this gives us capacity to absorb further anticipated regulatory headwinds as well as targeted business growth we increased our fully loaded leverage ratio by 25 basis points in the quarter to 4 2 slightly ahead of our 4 guidance on an exchange rate neutral basis we reduced leverage exposure by eur110 billion including a eur49 billion reduction in the capital release unit we also reduced our cash balances by around eur29 billion as part of our ongoing liquidity optimization program combined with a seasonal reduction in investment bank balances we reaffirm our leverage ratio target of 4 5 this year excluding the prime finance platform to be transferred rising to around 5 for 2022 turning now to our businesses starting with the corporate bank on slide 16 excluding specific revenue items and approximately eur800 million of goodwill impairments transformation charges and restructuring and severance which are detailed by business on slide 29 of the appendix the corporate bank generated a pre tax profit of eur939 million in 2019 with a post tax return on tangible equity of 7 on an underlying basis the performance in the corporate bank was consistent with our financial objectives however the performance in the fourth quarter and full year was impacted by our strategic transformation lower levels of episodic items and changes to cost allocations in addition to the challenging interest rate environment in the fourth quarter revenues declined by 5 year on year principally driven by lower episodic items excluding these items like credit recoveries and certain smaller one off gains which we ve discussed with you in previous calls corporate bank revenues were broadly flat as we grew volumes and fee income to offset the impact of lower net interest income principally in cash management for the full year too revenues were broadly flat excluding specific items and episodic effects revenues increased slightly as we grew volumes to offset the negative impact from interest rates the benefits of repricing which we began to roll out more widely late in the fourth quarter of 2019 as well as the full benefits of tiering should help support our revenue performance over the coming quarters we feel comfortable that the corporate bank can as we indicated in december on average grow revenues at 4 over the next three years this reflects the progress we are making on our growth initiatives for example in asia together with the prepricing measures i just mentioned that said for 2020 our plans assume growth closer to the levels seen last year principally reflecting lower levels of episodic items adjusted costs excluding transformation charges increased materially in both the fourth quarter and the full year the increase reflects higher spending on technology and controls as well as the change in internal service cost allocations following our recalibration last year these effects are in line with the guidance we provided in the third quarter results we believe that the run rate of these higher costs is largely reflected in our reporting and will be fully reflected after the first quarter of 2020 we should start to see the benefit of ongoing cost reductions being reflected in both sequential and year on year comparisons in the second half of 2020 we expect the corporate bank to generate positive operating leverage in this year and beyond provisions for credit losses were eur104 million in the fourth quarter and eur286 million or 225 basis points for the year the fourth quarter was impacted by a few idiosyncratic events the majority of which were outside germany with stage one and stage two provisions remaining at low levels turning to the corporate bank revenue performance by business on slide 17 global transaction banking revenues declined by 6 mainly reflecting lower episodic items within global transaction banking cash management revenues declined reflecting the impact of the negative interest rate environment with very limited benefits of tiering or repricing in the period trade finance revenues were essentially flat in the quarter but up 6 for the full year as lending and trade flows grew strongly in asia and germany securities services revenues declined reflecting our exit from equities trading and lower episodic items commercial banking revenues declined 2 on a reported basis as growth from lending was offset by spread compression on deposit products however on a full year basis revenues were up by 4 turning now to the investment bank on slide 18 as christian mentioned we are happy with the momentum that we see building in the investment bank in the fourth quarter revenues increased by 22 excluding specific items for the year revenues declined by 3 excluding specific items with fixed income sales trading essentially flat and lower revenues in origination and advisory adjusted costs excluding transformation charges declined in both the quarter and the full year the reductions were driven by lower compensation and benefits expenses given the reduction in workforce lower service cost allocations as well as continued disciplined management of non compensation costs excluding specific revenue items and approximately eur430 million of restructuring and severance and transformation charges the investment bank generated a pre tax profit of eur863 million in 2019 with a post tax return on tangible equity of 2 consistent with our strategy to invest in our core franchises we grew loans by 16 in 2019 revenues in fixed income sales trading were eur1 2 billion in the fourth quarter a 31 year on year increase on a reported basis or 34 excluding specific items as shown on slide 19 credit trading saw strong year on year revenue improvements reflecting better performance in flow credit across all regions and particularly europe while distressed debt revenues were also higher credit trading also benefited from disciplined risk management targeted investments in prior periods and increased client activity in rates revenues almost doubled from the prior year period with improved performance across all regions most notably in europe foreign exchange revenues were broadly flat despite lower market volatility in emerging markets our structured businesses continued to perform well with a significantly improved performance in flow trading compared to the prior year origination advisory revenues declined by 12 year on year relative to a strong prior year period advisory revenues were significantly lower following a strong third quarter where we saw several transactions booked earlier than anticipated revenues in debt origination increased by 27 outperforming a growing market with market share gains in both investment grade and high yield in equity origination we continue to win mandates with our activity level in the fourth quarter similar to third quarter levels and consistent with our expectations that we announced with our strategy last july let s now turn to the private bank on slide 20 the private bank continued to execute on its strategic priorities in the fourth quarter and full year with revenues excluding specific items broadly stable and reductions in adjusted costs excluding transformation charges excluding specific revenue items and approximately eur900 million of restructuring and severance goodwill and transformation charges the private bank generated a pre tax profit of eur524 million in 2019 with a 3 post tax return on tangible equity revenues in the fourth quarter and the full year were impacted by the negative interest rate headwinds partly offset by growth in loans and assets under management and the benefits of repricing efforts excluding transformation charges we reduced adjusted costs by 5 in the quarter and 4 in the full year including the eur200 million in german merger cost synergies we had previously indicated provision for credit losses was broadly stable in the full year and at 15 basis points of loans reflects the conservative nature of our portfolios and strong underwriting standards revenues in the private bank declined by 4 on a reported basis or 2 excluding specific items as you can see on slide 21 we grew revenues in our international operations and wealth management to broadly offset lower revenues in germany revenues in germany declined by 7 primarily reflecting higher funding and liquidity related costs as well as lower contributions from asset sale transactions we re working on a series of loan and asset under management growth and repricing measures in our home market to help mitigate the interest rate headwinds in our international business we grew revenues by 3 as growth in loan and investment products combined with repricing measures more than offset the interest rate headwinds wealth management grew revenues by 11 excluding the impact of sal oppenheim workout activities this reflects our relationship manager hiring programs in prior periods as well as strong market conditions let me now turn to asset management on slide 22 we as you will have seen in their results published this morning dws continued its strong performance to remind you asset management includes certain items that are not part of the stand alone dws financials excluding restructuring and severance and transformation charges asset management pre tax profit of eur539 million increased by 31 year on year despite higher noncontrolling interests following the ipo in the first quarter of 2018 asset management enjoyed its best revenue quarter since the second quarter of 2017 with revenues also growing 31 year on year in the fourth quarter and by 7 in the full year assets under management were eur768 billion at quarter end up by eur103 billion or 16 during the year the growth in aum was driven both by market performance and four consecutive quarters of net inflows our flagship products delivered significant outperformance while the number of 4 and 5 star rated funds further increased noninterest expenses in the fourth quarter increased reflecting higher compensation and benefits expenses for the full year noninterest expenses were broadly stable given management s ongoing efforts to control expenses as a result of the strong revenue performance and cost discipline asset management generated significant positive operating leverage with a six percentage point improvement in the full year cost income ratio to 73 on a segment basis the dws adjusted cost income ratio was 68 for 2019 the strong performance in asset management revenues in the fourth quarter was principally driven by significantly higher performance fees as you can see on slide 23 performance and transaction fees were eur104 million in the fourth quarter up from eur23 million in the prior year period driven primarily by performance fees in our flagship multi asset products in germany consistent with the guidance the dws management gave this morning we would expect for performance and transaction fees to normalize in 2020 compared to the elevated levels recorded last year management fees grew by 6 year on year reflecting the strong market conditions and consecutive quarters of net inflows which more than offset the impact of margin compression net inflows were eur12 billion in the quarter and eur25 billion in the full year mainly in our targeted growth areas of passive alternatives and multi asset other revenues were eur15 million positive versus a negative eur30 million in the prior year quarter partly reflecting a positive change in the fair value of guarantees with that let me turn to corporate other on slide 24 corporate other reported a pre tax loss of eur154 million in the quarter compared with a pre tax loss of eur109 million in the same period last year the improved year on year performance reflected higher revenues from valuation and timing differences mainly due to interest rates of rate effects offset by higher litigation costs funding and liquidity charges increased reflecting certain funding costs held centrally as part of our new funds transfer pricing framework i have described on previous occasions as we noted in july these costs should be around eur200 million per year in 2020 and should materially amortize over a 5 year period let me now discuss the capital release unit on slide 25 the capital release unit continued to execute on its deleveraging plan in the fourth quarter as we move toward a smaller and simpler balance sheet as christian detailed earlier we reduced risk weighted assets and leverage exposure in the cru slightly faster than our internal projections while the net income drag was less than we planned revenues in the fourth quarter were negative eur164 million excluding dva within the range we provided at the investor deep dive revenues were impacted by mark to market effects as well as hedging and de risking costs noninterest expenses of eur691 million declined by eur75 million from the third quarter principally driven by lower compensation and benefit costs given the front office headcount reductions we reduced risk weighted assets by eur10 billion in the quarter including eur3 billion of operational risk leverage exposure declined by eur50 billion in the quarter mainly driven by reductions in equities before i close a few words on our 2020 financial targets on slide 26 the progress we have made already gives us a clear line of sight on what we can achieve in 2020 for this year we have three key targets first as described to build on the momentum we have generated over the past two years and deliver on our 2020 adjusted cost target of eur19 5 billion excluding transformation charges and the impact of the prime finance transfer second to maintain our cet1 ratio above 12 5 as we manage the remaining part of our transformation a target we are confident of hitting given our stronger starting point and third to raise our fully loaded leverage ratio to 4 5 excluding the balances we hold for bnp paribas and prime finance principally reflecting the further deleveraging by the capital release unit consistent with our previous guidance we expect provisions for credit losses to increase to around 20 basis points of loans in 2020 reflecting a continued normalization of credit and lower recoveries finally as we ve discussed with you before we have continued to work on plans to merge our german retail subsidiary pfk into our parent company dbag we re increasingly confident of the feasibility and viability of this decision and have begun the discussions with all the relevant stakeholders this merger should generate significant adjusted cost savings and avoid potential funding cost increases associated with the implementation of nsfr although there are remaining uncertainties regarding the financial impact of this transaction a conservative estimate of the potential impact is built into our capital plan as discussed in december the pre tax implementation costs are fully reflected in our planning the tax impact if any could be incremental to the eur400 million of deferred tax asset valuation adjustments we already anticipate and i described earlier looking further ahead the progress toward our short term financial objectives gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on our 2022 targets including a post tax return on tangible equity of 8 with that let me hand back to james and we look forward to your questions james rivett head of investor relations stuart let s now open the lines for questions questions and answers operator first question is from the line of andy stimpson of bank of america please go ahead andy stimpson bank of america analyst afternoon everyone thanks for taking my questions and first question on capital a decent sized beat on capital today but james i think you said on a media call that you re still thinking that would trough at about 12 7 i m just wondering what the moving parts are from here and whether there was a bit more seasonality in the risk weighted assets this quarter that you d expect to come back in the first quarter or why or if there s more inflation or why not think that you could be above that 12 7 trough level during 2020 and then secondly please on the corporate bank revenues and costs were both a little weaker i just wondered if you can talk around a on revenues the pressure on margins and how you think that will develop i think you said you expected flat revenues in 20 i m not sure if i heard that correctly if you could just clarify that and then b on costs the greater tech spend presumably on things like compliance and aml is a factor in there and just how progressed those projects are and whether there s an investment phase that we should expect to reduce at some stage during 20 or maybe it s even after that please thank you james von moltke chief financial officer sure andy thanks for the questions i ll take both but i m sure christian will want to add to the corporate bank discussion so first of all i mean i guess what i d say is at this point we don t want to move that guidance up but i d say it s a conservative position that we re taking here to give you a sense of the moving parts as you asked about 13 6 is what we reported for december 31 we talk about the inflation so i mentioned the securitization framework if you go back to the december presentation the reg inflation in all of 2020 we would look at it as being about 60 basis points so if you pro forma that we have 13 basis points as a kind of foundational position everything else that happens this year whether it s deleveraging in the capital release unit some degree of losses from restructurings earnings in the core bank and investments in balance sheet growth in the core bank all of that nets out against that 13 how big a buffer we carry against the 12 5 minimum we re going to have to see based on both the timing of all of these events as well as frankly the market opportunities for the businesses to grow balance sheet to support client activity so with all of those things baked into the pie as you may have heard me say on the media call we think there s clearly a larger margin for error and potentially some ability to grow balance sheet beyond what had been originally foreseen in the plan but i think i d like to be conservative at this point in thinking about where we trough given all the moving parts and also the timing that i mentioned so i hope that s helpful as to why we re not moving guidance today but we re obviously very cognizant that the market is looking for us to maintain a healthy buffer to the 12 5 on the corporate bank again christian will want to add but as he mentioned there are a lot of moving parts in that revenue line i think the starting point is three of the four major businesses on a full year four of five major businesses grew revenues so cash management trust and agency trade finance corporate bank commercial bank are all growing and there was a bit of a decline in securities services for a number of reasons including our own perimeter but competing with that growth is of course the interest rate environment some of the episodic items that we mentioned a little bit of ftp charges coming through to that business and so that sort of nets out to the numbers that we re reporting we do think the underlying trends remember in the third quarter we reported 6 year on year growth and we said the underlying trend was in the low single digits in the fourth quarter that reversed largely driven by the episodic items but we would argue that the underlying trends are just as they were in the third quarter with a little bit more transient pressure on interest rates given central bank actions in the second half that of course will now work to offset given repricing tiering and all the other items that we also described to you with that christian i m sure will want to add strategically christian sewing chief executive officer well there is not a lot to add because i think you named it on the corporate side underlying we are happy with the progress we are doing andy i think on the idd in december stefan hoops was talking about the deposit charging the growth in asia the increased payment fees the growth in the tas business and all that only to name a few is supporting the underlying 4 growth james was referring to the episodic items which we plan a little bit more conservative for 2020 but the underlying engagement the client feedback and that what we can see in terms of mandate clearly supports that what we told you on the investor day also these items which i just mentioned deposit change charging growth in asia the increased payment fees each of those is estimate to provide approximately eur100 million over the next three years and hence we will start seeing that in 2020 and it makes us comfortable that we achieve our goals on the capital side i have nothing to add james all laid it out exactly to the point james von moltke chief financial officer andy i m reminded sorry for the long answer but you asked about the investment cycle in corporate bank and i think this is also an important area to describe to you look first of all as you remember there was a restatement exercise we went through last year there have been changes in funds transfer pricing and internal cost allocation so a lot of moving parts inside our segments and in some ways none more so than the corporate bank we think we are at or very close to if you like a finalization a final basis for our external reporting of that segment which now gives us a clear basis for future reporting and performance in other words comparisons would not be influenced by these items that said as you point out there have been investments so the technology and particularly kyc cost increases are real and pertain to that business i would say we seek to continue investing in it in that business it s a critical element of our competitive position and frankly it s the largest beneficiary if you like of a reallocation of our tech budget away from equities as we wind down that business and kyc remains critical although in that area one would hope that in the not too distant future we sort of crest the wave in terms of our investment and begin to deliver efficiencies based on the accumulative investment over the past several years andy stimpson bank of america analyst that s very helpful thank you very much operator next question is from daniele brupbacher from ubs please go ahead daniele brupbacher ubs analyst hi good afternoon and thank you first question is just on the rate headwinds and on the media call again you mentioned those and you i think you quantified them at around eur230 million in the private bank so i was wondering whether you could give us similar numbers for other units and how you how you think about that going into 2020 what more is to come here and probably in this context as well how you think about then how much of that can be compensated by volumes and margins it feels like your working assumption seems to be that this should be largely compensated by volumes but if you could just confirm that and then you mentioned a few times the ftp model and that it impact also the divisional or i think you mentioned it in the context of the corporate bank i know you described it in the past but could you be a little bit more specific and give us some numbers around what that really means is there still a transition period do we have to take that into account when we model future revenues for the divisions and just very lastly also on the media call you stressed the importance of the u s market for deutsche i think that s well understood could you just give us some examples of submarkets where you feel you re gaining or regaining market share that would be very useful thank you christian sewing chief executive officer dan potentially i take the first one and the ftp is then done by james and the last one we can do together we simply gave the one number for the private bank because obviously this is most dependent and sensitive to the interest rate in particular to the decision which we saw in september last year and yes we are planning to compensate that in full going forward also in that business how we said that in the private bank but also in the corporate bank we are consistently growing loans by the way we re not increasing our risk appetite so within the risk framework we have for instance we drove an initiative in the german mortgage business last year in the private bank which went very well we are very active as manfred knof said on the idd in december in swapping deposits into investment funds and actually we are making good progress on that also in january that looks quite favorable what the private bank is doing and as for the corporate bank as i just lined out there are other initiatives not only the active repricing where we have very constructive discussions with our clients and where we think we will see the first positive impact from the repricing in 2020 but also there we have the underlying growth in the other business segments being the growth in asia in trade finance and so on so overall while obviously this interest rate environment is hurting we have reacted appropriately and think we can compensate that for the ftp james potentially you james von moltke chief financial officer sure and so we ve talked about this a little bit the work that dixit and the treasury team have been doing together with the business to revamp our funds transfer pricing framework what we re doing is essentially aligning it with the liquidity buffers the unsecured spread the capital charges that the businesses bring to the balance sheet if you like benefits and burdens of balance sheet usage in a way that aligns that charging more closely with clear drivers and frankly the regulatory environment that we operate in so that s the principle behind it we think it gives the businesses much better more precise and also more controllable drivers and also funding cost numbers that they can then build into the third party pricing we will provide some disclosure of the impacts of these businesses as we get to the annual report so that you can trace it through the number in corporate bank year on year is probably in and around eur23 million there are frankly other treasury effects as well that go in and out so it s one of a number of factors but to your point we will and we have at this point gotten on to a steady state of ftp in the first and second quarters of next year there will be still be some small variances driven by it your market share question has to do with the united states in nib i ll leave that to christian and maybe add some christian sewing chief executive officer yes i think the first answer to that is what we have done globally daniele also refers to the u s we believe that with the focus of the business on that where we are relevant and where we have a leading market position we can also grow our business in the u s exactly that we have done there but just give you some examples like in the high yield issuance but also in the investment grade issuance but in particular in areas where we have been strong and will be strong like commercial real estate we clearly have performed well in 2019 and we have seen increasing revenues again with the risk appetite we have in place with the risk management we are confident that we can stay the course you referred a little bit from james that obviously we are starting from a better position from a capital point of view that also allow us here and there of course in a selective way to also allocate a bit more capital to the one or the other business where we are strong and we are making use of it but i think the focus which we have applied for the investment bank but also corporate bank globally is also applying to the u s and there we see the growth in there and those areas where we are leading daniele brupbacher ubs analyst thank you operator next question is from andrew lim from societe generale please go ahead andrew lim societe generale analyst hi good afternoon thanks for taking my questions i just wanted a bit more clarity on that capital guidance that you gave i think last year you said that you would have a q1 trim impact amounting to about 40 basis points you didn t talk about it here are you saying then that this falls into 2020 and it s within that 60 basis points impact that brings you down to around 13 and then just on the corporate bank if you can clarify on that tax spend so your overall costs have jumped up for the fourth quarter i think you said that that was going to be the run rate going forward and that we should wait until the second half of this year before we can start to see that maybe come down a little bit perhaps if you could give a bit more color there thank you james von moltke chief financial officer so let me jump in on the cet one guidance yes the regulatory impacts barring one smaller item were recognized in 2019 so we go into 2020 really almost 100 in line with the guidance we gave you in december again that small item there s one small item that moved from q4 to q1 but by and large you should focus on that eur15 billion number that we gave you for reg inflation on the rwa line for 2020 christian sewing chief executive officer on the costs on the corporate bank we have seen higher adjusted costs mainly from higher technology costs and control costs also changes in the way we have charged the internal services to the businesses of course with the efficiencies which we have in mind and in plan for the group that over time will also positively affect the corporate group so again we are absolutely in line with our plan the adjusted return on equity for the corporate group was around 7 we gave you the target for 22 that is driven by growth which we outlined but also by taking certain efficiencies which are also beneficial to the corporate bank over time andrew lim societe generale analyst that s great thank you very much next question is from jernej omahen from goldman sachs please go ahead jernej omahen goldman sachs analyst yes hi i have two questions please the first one is on page two when you lay out the achievements for this year and i don t want to take away from these achievements because i agree with you i think that they are substantial but obviously there s one category missing here which is the profitability or the profitability target and i wanted to ask you the profitability question in the following way for the full year and for the quarter what was the underlying return on tangible equity for the bank as a whole and i guess by underlying i would just also like to ask a subquestion as to what your preferred definition of that would be and my second question would be on the performance of the investment bank and again i think it s healthy to see that the revenues are up year on year and particularly in fic that you re up 1 3 or 33 year on year in the quarter but again it was a very good quarter for fic your some of your global competitors well your global competitors on average are up 64 in fic year on year would suggest that the market share loss continues and i just wonder to what extent do you feel you have stemmed that market share attrition and the final subquestion i guess that s now number three i said it s going to be 2 i m sorry but the final subquestion on the investment banking is revenues are up but returns as i understand it or as you presented it are down to 1 how do you think about that as well christian sewing chief executive officer let me potentially start with my view on the investment bank and then for the returns question i hand over to james first of all jernej if you have been three years down revenue wise year over year it is very reassuring that also in the investment bank with the focus which we have decided in july we see the turnaround and to be very honest we have seen that momentum and that turnaround now consistently since september we did the necessary changes for certain business within the investment bank in july and august and from september on we see quite a good momentum now are we already there from a profitability point of view and also from a growth rate point of view where potentially all our peers are no because we always said that this is a long term transformation we need to focus we need to adjust we need to also invest into the simplification of our fic business which we are doing and hence i do believe that also in particular from a profitability point of view and from a further growth point of view that will be a gradual improvement however the most important is the client engagement and the client engagement is clearly up and that obviously is supported by our cds prices but that is also supported simply by the focus and clarity we have now what we serve in the investment bank and what not so last but not least from a market share point of view now let s wait i think for all the institutions coming out with the numbers for the fourth quarter including all europeans secondly i would also say in the fic business let s not only do year on year but quarter over quarter but because in particular i think in the fic business quarter over quarter we are not looking too bad and hence i think we should take a little bit more time to justify or to judge on our market shares james james von moltke chief financial officer sure jernej on profitability obviously we re acutely aware of a sizable loss this year net income loss and hence the focus that we put on the transformation effects to help you understand the what the underlying performance looks like now of course we want to limit the time we speak about underlying performance but if you to answer your question i think the core bank numbers excluding transformation charges is probably the best number to look at so that number pre tax is about eur2 8 billion against eur42 5 billion of allocated equity if you tax effect it it gives you an rotce somewhere in the 4 to 5 range and it s that number we have to drive up as we talked about to 9 as being our goal in 2022 the way we ve presented the transformation charges is intended and also by the way the bnp paribas transaction which includes leverage and expenses is intended to give you a sense of all the things that then fall away by 2022 making 2022 pretty much a clean year barring small restructuring expense and obviously the net loss if you like or the loss mostly from expenses that remains in cru that we want to lift from that point so i think that gives you probably the best answer and also why it is that we ve done our presentation and restatement the way we have for the all of which you can find in the fds on page 10 is the core bank representation jernej omahen goldman sachs analyst that s very helpful thank you very much operator next question is from adam terelak from mediobanca please go ahead adam terelak mediobanca analyst good afternoon first i put a question on capital outlook and then a follow up on the investment bank balance sheet on the capital outlook can you just confirm that your year end cru balance sheet targets still hold for 2020 and then one of the moving pieces i think we haven t got much color on is operational risk you clearly come in ahead again this quarter could you give us some guidance on where that might go as it remains pretty material for the walk this year and if it does come down further does that change the eur25 billion guidance you have for basel iv in 2024 which i understand has a reduction of oprisk embedded into it and just a technical point is there an at1 accrual in cet1 capital at year end and then moving on to the investment bank you flagged lower leverage ratio denominator from liquidity management i want to understand how much funding benefit has come through into the fourth quarter print as a result and how much more you can do on liquidity because i ve also noticed that the lcr is actually up q on q despite this is this something in the denominator we need to worry about that might rebound into the first quarter james von moltke chief financial officer so lots of questions and questions that warm a former treasurer s heart so capital release unit we are sticking to the targets that we laid out we think we ve given ourselves a helpful hand in terms of where we got to at the end of the last year it gives us a little bit more flexibility in terms of timing and the manner of disposal of assets which is encouraging on the oprisk rwa as you say we have i think been very successful in bringing forward effects that we described to you in july as potential outcomes and with the hard work particularly of our risk colleagues we were able to exceed our own expectations as to how much and how soon we were able to achieve methodology and model related benefits in rwa at this point i would probably guide to flat from here so we re not expecting additional significant moves there but we do expect and have built into our forward capital planning some additional benefit as you point out with the impact of biv or overall basel iv glide path on the leverage ratio we ve been talking to you and also to our fixed income investors for some time on work we ve been doing to improve the efficiency of our balance sheet the leverage ratio did benefit as you point out seasonally from lower cash we think that by and large is sustainable and also seasonally from pending settlements which as you know do go up again as activity increases so the leverage ratio i wouldn t expect to stick in the first quarter necessarily perhaps dip and then go back over the course of the year to our year end target i don t see anything frankly unusual in the lcr we have been working to bring it down frankly as we drive efficiency in the balance sheet but what you re seeing is significant declines in the outflow component of the lcr ratio essentially offsetting declines in the hqla and net inflows so we ve been seeing essentially efficiency offset the reduction in cash and liquidity reserves which is good for the company and our earnings profile in other words improving earnings efficiency without sacrificing distressed liquidity value that we see on our balance sheet the at1 coupon is paid is accrued when paid so that s a 2020 event christian sewing chief executive officer it s built into delta catch up james von moltke chief financial officer exactly built into our as you ve seen in prior years first and second quarters are burdened with some catch up there but that s all of course built into our capital planning adam terelak mediobanca analyst right thank you operator next question is from kian abouhossein from jpmorgan please go ahead kian abouhossein jpmorgan analyst yes hi thanks for taking my questions two more detailed ones and one just more general first of all the eur100 million plus in tiering of deposits benefits and net number of 100 plus can you talk about how much you have achieved at this point and actually where you book it in what division in the fourth quarter and then secondly the bnp transaction you mentioned the associated benefit on the revenue side that you booked and you talked about part of it being booked i m wondering how much more there is to come and in what quarter and should we assume there s more to come in the 2020 year in the first quarter and would you actually book that reimbursement and then third one is just on fixed income i mean the environment from what i can see is very strong in credit the breakdown you gave at the investor day illustrates you re very heavily credit be it now in fixed income and clearly you indicated the year has started well but can you be a little bit more specific around your thoughts around your fixed income business considering your material gearing to the best part of performance year to date how you re seeing the environment from your business perspective on the credit side james von moltke chief financial officer thanks kian so tiering goes to the businesses essentially through fed funds transfer pricing so the benefits accrued to them in proportion to the liquidity reserves that they generate for the company we began to see that benefit in november when it became effective so essentially 2 3 of the run rate you would have seen in q4 on the bnp paribas side that transaction so we don t want to confuse you with this presentation but we want to stay consistent with our original targets that we set for eur21 5 billion for this year eur19 5 billion for next year we haven t moved them to reflect the incremental expense relative to our original planning which had not foreseen that we keep the prime finance business operating as part of our expense base but rather had we not pursued the transaction with bnp paribas it would have run down much more quickly so what we re describing to you is the incremental expenses that we will book in essentially operating that business for bnp paribas at the level that is reimbursable under the agreement and that will be reflected in cru revenues as a positive now we called out eur102 million in the fourth quarter that is the level of expenses that would have been reimbursable had the transaction closed on the 1st of october in fact it closed effective the first of december so we received we are eligible to have about 1 3 of that reimbursed for the fourth quarter going forward it will be the full run rate through 19 over time a slightly declining reimbursable cost base frankly as we transfer over time small elements of the business to them our personnel and infrastructure to bnp paribas but what we will essentially adjust out of our cost base is the reimbursement recapture that essentially nets out at the pre tax profit line christian sewing chief executive officer kian on your fixed income question so overall in fixed income be it in rates in currencies emerging markets we did changes last year as we said on the investor day and it simply gains momentum so it s not only a credit story i also said that the improved cds level and the perception around deutsche bank also in the debt capital markets obviously help us in our day to day flow business so i m we are satisfied with the momentum we see in the various products now on the credit side this is our strength let me also talk a little bit more broadly from an economic point of view i think we are even seeing a slight improvement in the economic environment globally at least two uncertainties have been slightly taken away with the phase one of the trade agreement between the u s and china we also have less uncertainty all around the brexit and we can see that in economic forecasts which are slightly up compared to our last earnings call end of october we also see in our portfolio that there is no deterioration from an overall credit point of view so yes momentum given our changes in that business is clearly picking up not only in credit but also in the others and on the credit side these are our i think one of our key strengths we have and we are dealing in an economic environment which is still weaker than we have seen it in 17 or 18 but clearly a slight upgrade since october kian abouhossein jpmorgan analyst and christian if i may just add one more quick one i mean if i look at your performance this year the restructuring clearly is on plan you could make some arguments around revenues in the transaction bank etc but generally you explained that very well where do you see from a bottom up perspective leaving macro issues aside the geopolitical issues where do you see what s keeping you up at night where you re most concerned about or where you believe ok this is an area where you really need to still turn around that particular issue christian sewing chief executive officer kian to be honest and it s a very simple answer we have to apply day by day the same discipline on execution like we have done it for the last 20 months if we do this we have so granular plans we are playing so much to the strength of deutsche bank in each and every business if we keep that discipline if we keep that execution focus then i m not worried kian abouhossein jpmorgan analyst okay thank you very much operator next question is from jon peace from credit suisse please go ahead jon peace credit suisse analyst yes thank you i had a couple of questions to help understand the run rate in the c o line the corporate center so firstly the valuation and timing differences has been quite positive now for about six quarters and particularly this quarter and should we expect this to reverse at some point and if so what would the triggers be for recognizing that and the second question is on the funding line in c o which was quite negative this quarter how should we think about that as a trend and should will you be allocating more of that into the divisions james von moltke chief financial officer thanks jon great question and it s rare that we get questions on the corporate other slide on page 24 in the deck but it is a good question because corporate other some elements of it frankly are hard to run rate if i were to just go quickly through the lines that you see here funding and liquidity as we ve mentioned has the eur200 million drags from the ftp amortization that we have outlined other than that it should clear to 0 there s obviously going to be in every given quarter there s going to be a little bit of variance in the clear out from treasury valuation and timing as you point out is volatile the principal drivers are essentially interest rate hedging of the balance sheet as well as fx hedging and so it depends on both the level of rates steep as the yield curve and also fx basis which are the main drivers of that you had a 2018 that there was a fair amount that went adverse particularly fx basis in 2019 some of that fx basis reversed and at the end of the year we got some uplift from interest rates but frankly it s hard to predict and we manage it as close to 0 as we can within the range of tools in hedging and also from an accounting perspective that we can the shareholder expenses should be relatively stable we ve guided to around eur400 million in shareholder expenses consistently that s a we operate to an oecd definition of expenses that are not that are applicably not part of the businesses and the only real variance you see there is when there s a significant restructuring and severance that applies to activities that are outside of the businesses litigation of course varies and the noncontrolling but it s litigation that is not specifically pertaining to events or matters that are inside the businesses and then noncontrolling interests is really the reversal at this level of the dws minorities that we report in the segment there s lots of other things as you can imagine should kind of clear out relatively neutral i hope that s helpful for your modeling jon peace credit suisse analyst yes thank you operator next question is from amit goel from barclays please go ahead amit goel barclays analyst hi thank you i ve got a kind of question on the fic business and on the investment bank clearly there are a few headlines in the press in the last few days about various kind of compensation related and timing discussions when i look at how head count evolves over the course of the year i see kind of last year there was about a 5 drop into q2 i m just kind of curious how you re looking to manage that this year as we kind of go into q2 and what we should expect are you expecting the same type of attrition as you had last year or perhaps a bit less or a bit more and how are you trying to motivate and continue to drive the employees to get that top line to continue to tick over thank you christian sewing chief executive officer well thank you first of all the attrition in 2019 was actually better than in 2018 we improved and i think one reason why we improved and we said it on the investment investor day is yes that we took some harsh and tough decisions but that stands for nothing else than corporate clarity people know in which direction we go and actually they appreciate and support that clarity and that clear way and pass ahead when it comes to compensation this year we obviously will not yet provide details that is for a later time but we are steering that we will see a reduction in overall variable comp but the way we have done it we have clearly seen and looked at the operating performance and the adjusted performance james was outlining before and we have done everything in order to appreciate and acknowledge the performance in particular of those colleagues and those businesses which from an operational point of view have reached their targets in this regard it is very much about differentiation but let me also say and i ve worked here for 30 years it s also very much about motivation and day to day leadership and i do think that we have a management team which has clearly adopted that we have a very close communication and cooperation with our teams and by differentiating and clearly looking for the operational performance and balancing the compensation around this one i m confident that we will not see a higher attrition in 2020 versus 2019 amit goel barclays analyst thank you operator next question is from anke reingen from rbc please go ahead anke reingen rbc analyst yes thank you very much for taking my question firstly i wanted to come back on to the bnp transaction can you just please confirm that it s already out of your risk weighted assets and leverage exposure and as a result of the different impact on the costs should we basically expect the cost base at eur19 9 billion rather than the eur19 5 billion but adjusted eur19 5 billion just to understand what number i should be looking for and then the investment banking risk weighted assets i mean obviously that came down quite materially in q4 outside of the operational risk weighted assets do you think the q4 level is just seasonally lower and we should expect that to pick up again or is there any structural change outside the oprisk weighted assets that should keep the level lower and just one follow up question please on the you made comments about your revenue assumption for most of the divisions and for the private client division is it fair to summarize you expect revenues to broadly stay flat or is the assumption actually you can do better thank you very much james von moltke chief financial officer so on the bnp paribas transaction there is literally immaterial rwas still on our balance sheet for that business pursuant to a structural feature in the transaction that shifts that to bnp paribas we do carry leverage exposure on behalf of bnp paribas hence we kind of removed that from our leverage ratio targets again it will be gone by the end of 2021 but there is leverage exposure on our balance sheet relating to the a portion of it relating to the prime finance business on the expense side you re absolutely right all things equal we would report eur19 9 billion of expenses but we want to stick to our target and not be in a position of moving targets so the eur19 5 billion is the number that would be if you added back that revenue recapture but you should be looking for the eur19 9 billion in the financial statement disclosure in terms of revenue assumptions in the business i think we gave a reasonably complete outlook i m not sure i d want to add to it and christian talked to the performance that he s expecting obviously there s the market conditions and the path of interest rates are important you ve heard us talk about the momentum that we saw in the late last year especially in investment banking and asset management and you ve talked us heard about you ve heard us talk about the efforts that are under way in the corporate bank and private bank to offset the interest rate headwinds we think the drivers of growth in those businesses are there and over time you ll start to see that underlying performance come through operator the next question is from the line of andrew coombs from citi please go ahead andrew coombs citi analyst good afternoon two questions please one on the transformation charges and then one just on deposit charging firstly on the transformation charges on slide 11 on software impairments cumulative over 2019 to 22 i think your original guidance back in the middle of last year was eur0 6 billion they went to eur1 2 billion in december and now stands at eur1 5 billion i m just interested what s driving the incremental increase there i just wanted to reaffirm that that does not impact on your capital position my second question on deposit charging back at the investor day you said eur20 billion had already been implemented there was eur110 billion of additional deposits under review can you just update us on that situation please and whether the eur100 million incremental revenues is still the right guidance and how much of that s already been booked in the 4q run rate james von moltke chief financial officer sure andrew thank you for the questions look on the software it what has changed is the deeper and deeper we got into the what we think of as the application estate within our technology under bernd leukert s leadership and his cios the more we saw that we could take out of the company as we significantly simplify that estate so we see this as a benefit to the company so to the extent that this is the area where there s an expense miss on the total noninterest expense line we see that as at worse neutral frankly positive both in simplifying the company and providing a benefit to future expenses and you re absolutely right that number walked up over time but and it was based on getting deeper and deeper into our software estate i would say that the pricing of deposits we are working on it in that exhibit from the investor deep dive we wanted to describe to you what the addressable balances might be obviously it s a long way to go from eur20 billion to eur110 billion and that s a lot of client related client discussions many of our new pricing agreements are now effective essentially 1 1 2020 hence our view that you ll see an increasing amount i think the guidance that we provided for both corporate bank and private bank back in december still applies in terms of what we expect to see from deposit charging and as stefan and also the private bank team i think said at the time we ve been favorably surprised by the quality of the client dialogue in terms of turning that from a negative conversation about handing them a check to a positive conversation about how they can optimize their liquidity use we also from just a deposit outflow perspective i think continue to feel we re outperforming our assumptions and frankly again if you like an upside surprise in this process is we ve actually had improvements in the what we think of as the liquidity quality of the deposit base that remains with us so early days but frankly good signs across the businesses of the impact there andrew coombs citi analyst and can i just confirm the software it impairment doesn t impact on capital james von moltke chief financial officer sorry yes absolutely it does not it s already disregarded from cet1 capital so no impact andrew coombs citi analyst right thank you very much operator next question is from jeremy sigee from exane bnp paribas please go ahead jeremy sigee exane bnp paribas analyst hi just a couple of follow ups please one was if you can talk a bit more about the advisory revenues within the investment bank which were quite a lot weaker in the quarter as you touched on as they were for a number of people we know that completions were lower but other firms have talked about pipelines being a lot stronger coming into this year and i wondered if you can sort of echo a similar sort of picture that gives you confidence for why that revenue stream remains intact and viable so if you could talk about that a bit more that would be great and then the second question was really just continuing on the question around the eur19 5 billion or eur19 9 billion cost target are there any dependencies in hitting that number are there any events that you need to happen to do it whether it s agreeing more head count cuts or getting a step down in cru costs or anything like that christian sewing chief executive officer so let me take the first question you re right we have seen kind of softness in the fourth quarter it has nothing to do that this is something structural if we look at our pipeline if i look at the market response and also the mandates which we get then i do think that we have a very stable franchise here and where i m not nervous that the kind of partial softness we have seen in the fourth quarter is a directional guidance for 2020 we also have very strong performances in the origination advisory business in particular we have been very happy with the performance of our debt origination both in the investment grade as well as in the high yield and we cannot see that this is stopping and hence this is in our view a core business to deutsche bank which we obviously will pursue and we are confident that we will show satisfactory results and revenues going forward james von moltke chief financial officer on the eur19 5 billion cost target i would just say many many things need to continue to happen across the organization as we continue on our cost discipline and this sort of run rate decline that we have exhibited for the past eight quarters i will say with the appointment of fabrizio campelli as chief transformation officer we get a new partner at the management board table along with all of the business leadership and frank kuhnke focusing on a variety of issues but importantly cost management in many respects it is a role to that includes helping on the implementation of cost measures and we ve identified many many cost measures across the organization which we will then partner closely that is financed with the transformation organization under fabrizio to execute on jeremy sigee exane bnp paribas analyst thank you operator and the last question comes from stuart graham from autonomous research llp please go ahead stuart graham autonomous research llp analyst hi thanks for taking my question i had two please first on fic christian you talked about having stabilized the franchise and yet i see ongoing market share losses but from your answer to jernej s question maybe i shouldn t be worried about fic market share losses at this stage so i guess my question is how you re defining that stabilization please and then the second question is you talked back in july about the benefits from lower funding costs i think the figure out to 2022 is something like eur500 million or so how much of that s already been achieved at the q4 stage and what do you expect for 2020 please thank you christian sewing chief executive officer thanks stuart well i said the to the question from jernej that obviously the u s competitors have shown very strong fic numbers in the fourth quarter there is no doubt but i said that if we compare quarter over quarter fourth quarter versus the third quarter i think we can compare ourselves well with our competitors number one number two i really think that we should wait for kind of all financial institutions coming in now also our european peers to finally validate where we stand from a market share number three my positive comments on the fixed income is that it s not only on the credit business but that across our offerings we see a momentum and the nice thing stuart about this one is on the back of client flow clients are reengaging clients reach out to us the handover between corporate bank and investment bank is working very well in all kind of segments be it the rates business or the fx business and hence we think it s a solid foundation with the first time a year over year growth and hence we feel positive about the momentum and the underlying growth we see and again let s wait for all the peers coming in and then we can see finally on the market shares stuart graham autonomous research llp analyst how do you know if that s your value add or just the market environment i get it that both of them are good but obviously one is better than the other christian sewing chief executive officer well i can also see it with the number of clients coming in reengaging with us that is always a good signal that we had through the years clients who did not engage with us who are clearly coming back and that is not only the favorable market which i agree we had more favorable markets in the fourth quarter 19 than in 18 no doubt at all i also said that in the media conference but with clients coming back and being very active with us that is for me one of the major positive signals james von moltke chief financial officer stuart on the funding costs one thing i d point you to is the net interest margin disclosure that we now provide in the financial data supplement i can t give you a euro number of how much of the eur500 million has come through at this point off the top of my head but there are elements of the things we ve been talking about for a while that are entering into the margin and helping support the margin you ll see that the history is of an increasing margin that s obviously difficult to sustain in the interest rate environment that we re in but i think the various items whether it was putting together an investment portfolio in treasury significant deleveraging in the form of pay down of long term debt that has already flown in at least in part it s sort of bled in if you like to the p l over time some of the other things that we ve talked about like taking advantage of greater hedging tools to manage our interest rate risk and also sort of balance sheet productivity that s really only just getting started so i would see over time in a very slow build to that number in 2022 hopefully helps us sustain a margin relative to what are otherwise typically pressures on the margin in addition to loan growth and some of the other structural improvements on the balance sheet stuart graham autonomous research llp analyst okay thank you operator there are no further questions at this time and i would like to hand back to james rivett for any closing comments please go ahead james rivett head of investor relations thank you very much for your time we can see there

feature article 31 01 2020 listen as the political temperature heats up to the upcoming general elections many politicians will be tempted to make grand promises in their bid to win the hearts of voters we will soon hear free this free that but what is the price of the free if you follow any international tv or radio channel a week won t pass without a news item about venezuela the country that used to be the richest country in latin america and became a global model for its meteoric economic miracles is now in tatters it is estimated that close to five million people have reportedly left venezuela since 2014 the scale of the country s economic decline can be comparable to zimbabwe s in the late 1990s the country s gdp has fallen more than 35 percent a sharper drop than the one seen during the great depression in the us the country is spiraling into hyperinflation in 2018 the country s inflation exceeded 1 000 000 percent since early 2018 the government of venezuela has essentially stopped producing official inflation estimates yes that s how dire the situation is this state of affairs has led to shortages of everything including food medicine and other essential commodities things have gone from bad to worse these conditions have sparked a series of unending protests since 2014 the coalition of opposition political parties backed by the us wants president nicolÃ¡s maduro out their leader juan guaido has also declared himself president but how did the country with the world s largest oil reserves get here venezuela before the crisis venezuela has been blessed with oil far more than any nation on earth but the wealth from the oil failed to trickle down to the masses unsatisfied by this state of affairs lieutenant colonel hugo chavez attempted a coup in 1992 he was unsuccessful and thus was thrown into jail for two years when he came out of jail he transformed himself to the man of the masses and stood against the political establishment he contested for the presidency and won to become the president of venezuela in 1998 having assumed the reign of power chavez decided that the bulk of the profit from the country s oil should go to the masses this was opposed by the elite establishment who made frantic efforts to get him out of office through a coup this forced hugo chavez to travel to the socialist republic of cuba in 2003 on his return chavez decided to make venezuela a socilaist state he started by nationalising or giving state control to many businesses including electricity telecommunication and the oil sector luckily for him in 2004 the global oil prices began to surge oil prices increased from 27 in 2003 to 91 in 2013 hugo chavez embarked on social programmes with proceeds from the oil his social programmes included subsidising the cost of food investing in the country s education building affordable housing for the poor among many other programmes in fact within a record time hugo chavez had reduced poverty by more than half at one point venezuela even provided free heating oil for impoverished americans yes americans then out of nowhere oil prices started to go down because countries such as the us and canada began to increase their oil production since venezuela needed more money to sustain its numerous social programmes the easiest option was to print more money to meet the short to medium term demands with the hope that the tide will turn president hugo chavez died of cancer in 2013 and was succeeded by his right hand man nicolÃ¡s maduro who narrowly won and was sworn in as president but oil prices continued to go down and fell as low as 41 in 2015 foreign demand for venezuela s currency bolÃ­var to buy venezuelan oil crashed maduro was forced to print more money and cancel some of the social programmes initiated by hugo chavez his predecessor the printing of money led to high inflation and high depreciation people then began to save their money in foreign currency like the us dollar to hedge against the fast depreciation as the country s currency s value fell the cost of imported goods rose the venezuelan economy went into crisis international investors began looking elsewhere driving the value of the bolÃ­var even lower the government responded by issuing currency controls it set a fixed exchange rate to stop the official value of the bolÃ­var dropping against the us dollar and made it difficult to actually get permission to exchange bolÃ­vares into us dollars the idea was to stabilise the currency by effectively shutting down all currency transactions this led to mass protests these protests forced a coalition of opposition political parties called the democratic unity roundtable or mud to come together and form a coalition the opposition coalition contested and won two thirds of the national assembly putting the president s rule at risk in response maduro forced out several supreme court justices and filled in with fresh judges loyal to him in march 2016 the court ruled to strip the opposition led national assembly of its powers which escalated the protest on the streets of caracas this forced the supreme court to reverse its decision but the damage had already been inflicted and the protest continued the us then issued sanctions on venezuela us sanctions means the country could not re finance its debt leading to high and high inflation amidst these protests president nicolÃ¡s maduro launched his re election bid the opposition coalition boycotted the elections but maduro won amidst accusations of irregularities and voter intimidation backed by the us the opposition leader juan guaido declared himself interim president in january this year after invoking the venezuelan constitution this has set up a power struggle that is yet to be resolved lessons for ghana ghana is not immune to the crisis in venezuela if we don t watch our expenditure and the desire by the political class to promise free things to woo voters the hard truth is that nothing is free if a politician promises you something free ask yourself who is paying for it if our politicians will continue to make hefty electoral promises with the view that we have oil revenue that will pay for such promises what become of such promises when oil prices take a nosedive the global slam down in oil prices was one of the key reasons why ghana had to run to the international monetary fund imf for help this is because ghana s economic growth has been hedged on oil since 2010 when the country became a full blown commercial oil producer ghana was not the only country that suffered when oil prices dropped oil dependent countries including giants like saudi arabia nigeria and others had to take some austerity measures to survive this is because they all had failed to diversify their economies and given the volatility of oil prices their economies suffered some shocks ghana s situation was pretty precarious because the drop in oil prices also coincided with the energy sector crisis popularly known as dumsor this drop in foreign exchange through the sale of oil forced up inflation and led to high depreciation of the cedi leading to the cedi recording one of its highest depreciation in recent history as the country is gearing up for the 2020 elections our politicians should not be carried away by the desire to win power to the extent of forgetting about how and where they will get money to finance their campaign pledges we should realise that oil is a finite resource and we do not also control its prices as a country have we thought about how we are going to sustain the social programmes that are funded by our oil resources when we deplete our oil reserves so dear mr politician what is the price of your free promises writer abdul karim

in hindsight for investors 2019 was about as easy as it gets aside from a few temporary pullbacks most asset classes surged on january 1st and never looked back by the end of the year nearly every asset class posted positive returns with many delivering double digits equity investors were rewarded for continuing to ride out this record breaking bull market with us large caps up 31 49 and mid and small caps not far behind at 30 54 and 25 96 respectively developed international stocks returned 22 01 despite the ongoing brexit saga and even the trade war drama couldn t keep emerging market stocks from posting a solid 18 42 return fixed income returns were similarly impressive across the board with high yield bonds up 14 41 in 2019 to put into context how well every asset class performed in 2019 consider the 8 72 return from the bloomberg barclays us aggregate bond index the agg near the bottom of the table on opposite page figure 1 while this return looks disappointing relative to other asset classes on the table it was the best year for the agg since 2001 for all around asset class performance this was the best year for investors since 2009 taking a 10 year lookback is a good way to remind ourselves that long term market outcomes are often shaped not so much by the large singular headline events but by the aftershocks the 2008 financial crisis is no longer in our 10 year rearview mirror but the resulting effects economic regulatory and behavioral continue to define markets as we enter the next decade some of these effects like regulations on banks and more restrictive consumer lending standards are beginning to lessen central banks however after a decade of accommodative monetary policy are finding it much more difficult to put the genie back in the bottle finally the behavioral impact may be the longest lasting a generation of investors came of age during a devastating financial and housing crisis making them far more riskaverse than prior generations and skeptical of home ownership yet amidst these challenges there is much reason to be optimistic as we enter the new decade yes the 2000s have thus far been shaped by two of history s biggest stock market crashes this does not mean that another crash will be the defining event of the 2020s rather the next major catalyst may be a positive event spurred from one of the breakthroughs in technology that are occurring every day it wasn t long ago that 2020 sounded like the faroff future we may not have flying cars but we do have self driving ones powered by technology that seemed like science fiction a decade ago this technological renaissance makes it incredibly difficult to forecast 10 years out but it is a necessary exercise to evaluate what has changed since last year and update our baseline asset allocation expectations we hope you find our 2020 outlook helpful and wish you the best of success in your next decade of investing economic backdrop the most significant development in 2019 was a policy shift from the us federal reserve the fed pausing for the first half of the year and then ultimately reversing the prior three hikes to bring the federal funds rate to 1 50 1 75 the dovish pivot put the us central bank more in sync with its international peers many of which have eased their respective benchmark rates to negative territory as we close the year the fed seems content to hold rates steady for the time being inflation data has been consistently soft at just 1 6 as measured by the core personal consumption expenditures index there was not much justification for the fed to raise rates in the first place and the fed was possibly looking to get its benchmark rate up to a level that would provide capacity for future cuts i e create some dry powder the fed is now determined to lift prices inflation to or symmetrically above its 2 target on a persistent basis by keeping rates unchanged through 2020 the us economy is on stable footing heading into the new year unemployment is at a 50 year low giving consumers confidence to continue to spend consumers have been carrying the bull market as businesses have shown reluctance to engage in significant capital spending largely due to uncertainty surrounding the trade war us gdp grew at a 2 1 pace in the third quarter but is widely expected to soften slightly to just under 2 in the coming year the expected slowdown in us gdp coincides with an anticipated global growth decline euro area gdp growth continues to sputter along around 1 2 and will likely remain around this level the chinese economy is the driving force for growth in emerging markets but this too has fallen to the low end of the government s target range at 6 in 2019 even with a phase i resolution to the tariff dispute high levels of consumer debt should keep chinese gdp growth below 6 in the coming year the years of explosive 7 9 chinese growth are behind us how economic data is measured in a modern service driven economy has increasingly become the subject of debate federal reserve chairman jerome powell raised the topic in october suggesting that productivity measures which have been relatively weak are inadequate and missing a good deal of the actual output produced in modern society the traditional formula for measuring productivity gdp divided by total hours worked is a good enough approximation for hourly employees in a manufacturing driven society however the us economy and most developed economies worldwide are now heavily driven by services which can be much more difficult to distill into units of output furthermore nearly 50 of us workers are salaried employees and with the advent of technology many workers are always on the clock with the workday extending into late night and weekend emails as technology continues to advance we anticipate changes to the way we measure economic output will be needed us equity a year ago we cautioned that while the record setting bull market was potentially winding down it was likely too early to rotate out of high growth names and into value stocks as prior market cycles have demonstrated equity bull markets typically have a blow off top rather than a slow fade to black with the most substantial gains to be had in the high momentum growth stocks for most of the year the s p 500 growth index outpaced the s p 500 value index however value stocks have come into favor in the last quarter bringing 2019 total returns for the growth and value indices near parity at 31 13 and 31 93 respectively was this year the last gasp of the venerable bull market considering that over the long run growth in gdp correlates with growth in corporate earnings it would be reasonable to expect us equities to cool off a bit from this year s excellent returns as overall economic output declines however we don t anticipate a rush out of us equities just yet given the dominant role us companies play in the global marketplace us equity valuations are slightly high with the price to earnings p e ratio of the s p 500 at around 20 3 based on actual and estimated fullyear 2019 operating earnings compared to a 25 year average trailing p e of 19 6 but the trade war resolution would provide potential for improved earnings prospects and propel stocks higher while a surprise from the fed is no longer a major concern uncertainty over the outcome of the 2020 us presidential and congressional november elections will undoubtedly weigh on us equities for much of the year buying opportunities will likely arise for financial sector stocks particularly bank stocks which were beaten down as interest rates declined banking industry stocks look attractively priced with a p e multiple of just 11 5 as measured by the spdr s p 500 bank etf ticker kbe significantly below most of their peers in the s p 500 while also providing higher than average dividend yield the big banks have long served as the democratic punching bag and calls for tougher regulation will surely occur in the debates however privacy and 1st amendment issues have made big tech a favorite target of late and the sector may share the attention of the candidates criticism during the democratic primaries for most investors we believe maintaining us equity exposure is necessary even though markets could be choppy or move sideways until there is more clarity on the election outcome and earnings prospects in the event of a trade resolution or with a trump re election markets would likely maintain their positive trend with longer term forecasts calling for lower us equity returns over the next decade event driven opportunities like this could become increasingly rare developed international equity compared to us equities developed market dm and emerging market em equities looked like the walking dead for the last decade with annualized returns of just 5 43 and 2 91 respectively compared to the s p 500 s 13 46 annualized rate eurozone economies stumbled out of the great recession like zombies that continue to stagger on one reason for the difference in returns is america s dominance in the technology sector globally aggressive central bank stimulus has thus far failed to improve german manufacturing activity while adversely affecting the large european financial sector as we have pointed out in prior years however long term investors who omit dm equities from their asset allocation are ignoring roughly 35 of the global equity market many investors have shunned dm equities as the brexit debacle played out over the past several years but with a resolution in sight inflows may return and prices appreciate dm equity valuations are only slightly higher than historical averages with some areas such a japanese equity still priced relatively cheap japanese equities measured by the nikkei 225 index are currently priced at a multiple of around 17 times estimated 2020 earnings below historical norm the low multiples have triggered a surge in share buybacks and a 4 5 20 72 return in 2019 a trade war resolution and a weakening in the us dollar could give japanese equities a further boost emerging market equity many emerging market stocks that rely heavily on exports have suffered the most under president trump s aggressive trade tactics in addition to tariffs em economies can be highly concentrated in only 1 2 economic sectors and are subject to currency and commodity related volatility as well as political risks from governmental instability societal volatility and wars for the past decade em stocks have failed to deliver returns that justify the additional risks inconsistent earnings growth has disappointed investors and led to em equities becoming less attractive heading into 2020 em is finally starting to show some relative strength against domestic equities a de escalation in the trade war dubbed phase one of the ongoing talks provided a preview of what can be expected if a larger agreement finally materializes with the us presidency in play in 2020 common sense continues to dictate that it is in president trump s best interest to get a comprehensive deal completed if this occurs the upside moves in em may be swift and considerable despite the uncertainty and volatility inherent in em investing we feel the potential returns that will occur outweigh the current risks and advocate for continued em exposure em equities also can provide attractive dividend flows while one waits for anticipated price appreciation longer term the story remains the same as in prior years the potential for economic growth is heavily concentrated in the em economies even as china transitions to a consumption led economy the gdp growth rates should still be roughly triple that of the us the demographics also favor em where populations are heavily skewed towards younger workers and absent a comprehensive trade agreement other em markets such as vietnam and mexico stand to gain from a supply chain restructuring that is already under way technology will increasingly become the equalizer with em populations aggressively adopting new technologies to enable commerce and connectivity the last decade was painful for emerging market equity investors but we know from prior decades that the asset class can quickly make up lost ground therefore we continue to recommend most investors stay the course and own at least a market weight position in em with an overweight position for aggressive investors fixed income the outlook for fixed income investors in both the short and long term is challenging yield continues to be scarce with us fixed income heavily in demand from both domestic and foreign investors in 2019 the downward pressure on the long end of the yield curve resulting from huge investor demand led to a temporary yield curve inversion a phenomenon considered to be a harbinger of recession the yield curve has since reverted to its normal state though this does not guarantee a recession has been avoided the prior three yield curve inversions all reverted in advance of their respective subsequent recessions the desperate search for yield has also extended into credit markets with high yield hy bonds heavily in demand as we close out 2019 pushing spreads down to 3 5 the tightest reading since october of 2018 investors are showing a larger risk appetite as the year ends bidding up the riskiest bonds for much of the year the most speculative triple c rated segment of the bank of america merrill lynch us hy index was relatively unchanged while the higher rated bb and b bonds saw significant spread compression however cccs have experienced solid demand late in 2019 increased risk tolerance is also evident in the investment grade ig credit market despite alarms over the proliferation of triple b rated bonds in recent years the bbb segment sits just above hy in credit rating and are therefore susceptible to forced selling if eventually downgraded to below bbb aka junk status bbbs now hold a dominant position in broad ig bond markets at the expense of a diminished proportion of highly rated aaa bonds our long term forecasts for fixed income asset returns reflect these challenges and we see little chance of global central banks turning hawkish in unison we believe investors should allocate more heavily to the shorter end of the yield curve and pay close attention to the high yield market which looks expensive and vulnerable to a pullback we continue to recommend investors diversify exposure by allocating to local currency dm and em bonds as well to capitalize on the potential for a weakening us dollar which coincides with the fed s desire for higher domestic inflation commodities and alternatives broad basket commodities underperformed in 2019 with tariff induced weaker demand and efficiency driven increased supply exerting downward pressure on prices crude oil prices surged at the start of the year but for the 2nd half west texas intermediate has been trading firmly in the 55 60 range with less volatility than in prior years opec actively intervened throughout the year attempting to support prices with dubiously adhered to production cuts an attack on saudi arabian oil fields attributable to iran resulted in the biggest daily price spike since the financial crisis but the capacity was quickly restored with minimal impact in addition to oil other commodities stand to benefit from a us china trade deal with chinese agricultural purchases being a key component and the potential for increased natural gas exports also on the table while in the near term we may see a solid year from commodities dependent on the trade war outcome our longer term expectations are constrained by globally low inflation and a generally lowered global gdp moreover just in time delivery supported by massive improvements in supply chain management and commodity harvesting techniques will also provide for a smoother ride and less upside in prices for commodities among the other alternatives real estate investment trusts reits were the standout performer in 2019 keeping pace with the s p 500 for most of the year before fading in november we anticipate reits will continue to deliver given their historical ability to grow dividends the sector yields roughly 3 2 more than 50 higher than the s p 500 making reits an attractive way to diversify portfolios while generating income within the sector performances can be disparate with high growth tech oriented reits specializing in data centers or cell phone towers at one end compared to deep value brick and mortar retail reits at the other final thoughts the start of a new decade is always an exciting event with the prospect of a blank slate for the next 10 years of investing it seems near certain that this bull will eventually breathe its last breath at some point before 2030 but the stage is set for continued positive returns albeit potentially less than the long term averages the next ten years will likely come with a new set of challenges with the maturing business cycle bringing lower return forecasts across the board despite this more challenging environment exploitable opportunities are bound to arise for investors who maintain a flexible approach to asset allocation source forbes

oil and petroleum products carolyn kissane academic director and clinical professor at the center for global affairs at new york university leads the conversation on the geopolitics of oil faskianos thank you welcome to the final session of the winter spring 2023 cfr academic webinar series i m irina faskianos vice president of the national program and outreach here at cfr today s discussion is on the record and the video and transcript will be available on our website cfr org academic if you would like to share these materials with your colleagues or classmates as always cfr takes no institutional positions on matters of policy we are delighted to have carolyn kissane with us to discuss the geopolitics of oil dr kissane is the academic director of both the graduate program in global affairs and the graduate program in global security conflict and cybercrime at nyu s center for global affairs where she is also a clinical professor she also serves as director of the energy climate justice and sustainability lab in the school of professional studies at nyu she was named in 2013 by breaking energy as one of the top ten new york women in energy and top ten energy communicator she s a member of the council on foreign relations and the national committee on u s china relations and serves on several boards so carolyn thanks very much for doing this we really appreciate it i thought we could begin by talking about how has the geopolitics of oil changed especially vis Ã  vis russia s war in ukraine and opec s recent announcement to cut oil production kissane well first of all i d just like to say thank you so very much for having me i m really delighted i am a big fan of cfr s academic webinars so to have the opportunity to participate in this in this way is very meaningful to me so thank you so wow there is so much happening in this space the geopolitics of oil this has been a tremendous fourteen months russia s reinvasion of ukraine very much upended the geopolitics of oil because russia is a significant producer one of the top three in the world and it s you know it s caused a kind of a reshaping a kind of a remapping of the of oil geopolitics and we ve seen some you know shifts in how countries think about oil security in light of larger questions about broader energy security questions and also on top of that is the ongoing energy transition coupled with you know climate change and the need to decarbonize so there s just it s been quite a you know a year and a half that has really sort of put energy security and oil security very much at the forefront of people s minds faskianos fantastic i thought maybe you had some really interesting data to show us and if you could walk us through those the trends you are seeing and really bring it to life that would be fantastic kissane sure so before i do i have a couple of slides and before i share my slides i think it s really important that sort of we understand how interconnected sort of the global energy system is and how interconnected we are when it comes to the flows of oil you know some countries are very well resourced endowed so they have oil and other countries do not so they need to import oil there s really no country in the world that doesn t need oil for larger national security issues and i think one of things that many people sort of are not necessarily aware of or think about is the amount of oil that gets produced every day so every day the world consumes over 100 million barrels a day and every day that 100 million barrels has to be has to be moved it has to be you know as part of getting it into the system getting it to its respective destinations and what we re not seeing which maybe some people may have thought that we would see at this point is we re not seeing a reduction in demand but we re seeing an expansion in demand and much of that global demand is coming out of asia and we re also of course seeing the with the reopening of china lots of really interesting questions as to what oil demand will be in china for the 2023 2024 years whether or not they will they will sort of put extra pressure on global demand and you know irina just also you know it s i m going to share this in my slides but you know last week s decision from opec to reduce production of course had an impact on the price of oil so when the decision was announced on sunday by monday morning we saw an uptick in the price it s stabilized but we are sort of looking at 80 plus a barrel oil and again lots of uncertainty as to what that s going to mean across economies that are in recessions experiencing sort of the beginnings of a recession and sort of what does it mean for the global economy where we may see sort of more energy inflation so one of the things that i really like to do when i teach the geopolitics of oil is sort of show some visuals because i think again sort of really reinforcing the interconnected nature of our global energy system but also sort of seeing where in the world is oil produced and where in the world are the are the importers and also just a couple of sort of fun pieces on what we have seen just this you know in the last week of course some of this you ll be familiar with those in the audience but this decision on the part of opec to reduce production by 1 2 million barrels a day again happening at a time not when we have an excess supply but when we re seeing a tight supply across the oil market so it came as a bit of a surprise to you know to even the most you know longstanding analysts and opec observers and again part of this is directed probably toward self interests on the part of saudi arabia and the oil producers that are really going to make the cuts but of course it also has an impact here for those of you that are sitting in the united states what does it mean then for prices that americans pay at the gas pump so the biden administration sort of came out after this decision was made in sort of being disappointed surprised that opec would make this decision now it s also important to sort of recognize that this is not just a singular opec decision this is part of now a larger opec and opec does also include russia as well as other countries like kazakhstan and mexico so the opec that we have historically known is now different because you have other countries that are not official members but nonetheless are part of what we now refer to as opec and these are the countries that are part of opec and really the country that s considered to be sort of in the driver s seat of opec is that of saudi arabia because saudi arabia is the largest producer within the opec organization producing anywhere from 10 to 11 million barrels a day venezuela has the largest reserves but it is far from being at capacity in terms of what it can what it can produce so just to kind of put that into perspective these are opec countries and their respective reserves and then non opec the united states being a non opec country but again this sort of this chart to the right shows you know again the world is consuming a little over 100 million barrels a day expected to increase over 2023 and into 2024 question marks as to when we may see peak oil demand but again to sort of link this to energy security energy security especially when it s in the context of oil security is making sure that we have adequate supply at affordable prices so when we see a reduction in supply at a time of tight markets that suggests that we re also going to see higher prices that s going to directly hit vulnerable economies and so again just to sort of point out sort of where in the world sort of are the top three oil producers the united states saudi arabia and russia russia remains in the top three canada as well our you know neighbor to the north and china is also a producer of oil the united states figure here also includes gas liquefied so liquid petroleum which the united states is endowed with a lot of both oil and natural gas and then the top oil consuming countries you have u s china and india now the united states is not the largest importer that position is now held by china but as far as consumption goes we consume over 20 million barrels a day again big question mark about china in terms of whether or not we will see higher demand coming out of china over the next year two years with china s reopening and what is being you know discussed as revenge tourism and more chinese who have accumulated a lot of savings 2 1 trillion how are they going to use that savings and whether or not after three years of being under lockdown restrictions whether or not we ll see impacts to demand and i think russia is there s lots of questions about russia and this is now we re fourteen months into you know russia s reinvasion of ukraine and i emphasize reinvasion because oftentimes we forget that you know russia invaded ukraine in 2014 but russia is still moving its oil and up until you know a few months ago its overall production and exports were as high at some points even higher than pre invasion now you have new countries that are takers of russian oil and they re buying it at discounted prices we see turkey singapore china has been a big buyer as well as india that they have been buying discounted russian oil lots of interesting questions that we could discuss about the oil price cap and seaborne embargo to europe but i think the takeaway from this slide is that russia continues to produce oil continues to sell it selling at a discounted price but there are still many countries in the world that are eager to take russian oil and again i m not going to go into this but i just love this slide to just emphasize the you know the world s pipelines these are the pipelines that help sort of the transit of oil something also that s really unique and interesting to look at is just tanker traffic so the tankers that carry oil around the world but again you know there are a lot of pipelines so twenty three two thousand three hundred and eighty one operational oil and gas pipelines again these are it s moving a lot of the oil that is consumed every day and then finally is this is you know one of the things that we oftentimes we think about the hundred million barrels a day that the world is consuming over 75 percent of the world s oil is controlled managed by state owned oil companies so saudi aramco being one pdvsa of venezuela being another but it s really important to sort of recognize the position that state owned companies have the rest is controlled or managed by international oil companies exxonmobil chevron eni total and a host of other host of other companies but again i think the you know to understand that nocs as they re referred to are very very important for understanding their role in the larger context of the geopolitics of oil and again what we saw last week coming out of opec this decision this is also being driven by state budget concerns this is again it s about the production of oil but it s also about you know governments and their budgets and oftentimes you know there is a desire to add more rather than you know more revenues rather than less so those are the slides that i have and i hope that they sort of provide some sort of context and a little bit of you know that we can discuss in the questions that i really look forward to answering from the audience faskianos thank you carolyn that was great so now we re going to go to all of you for your questions and comments gives queuing instructions all right so i m going to go to the first raised hand in the thing amadine hom go to you first and please accept the unmute yourself pause you are still muted pause ok i don t know are you there oh i think ok let s go to morton holbrook q yes good afternoon dr kissane what a shocking presentation laughs a hundred million barrels a day and it s going up notwithstanding the paris climate agreement of 2015 is that agreement simply a dead letter or is it having any effect on oil on fossil fuel production particularly oil production or what s the best scenario in terms of reducing dependence on fossil fuels considering the oil market thank you kissane well hi morton thank you so much for that excellent question yeah that s kind of why i emphasize that number is because a lot of people sort of just aren t aware of how much oil we continue to consume and again what the demand expectations are moving forward and these demand expectations are you know coming out of forecasts from the international energy agency so i think there s a big question as to when we see peak demand and you know if you look at bp scenarios they expect peak demand to happen you know before 2030 where as you know others kind of contest that they that they think that peak demand won t happen until after 2030 i mean again a lot depends on you know what we are now experiencing in the energy transition and how sort of quickly are we can we transition away from oil i think what s really critical when we re looking at oil is oftentimes we think only about the transportation sector so we re thinking about cars we re thinking about planes you know we re thinking about trucks and tankers and all these things but it s petrochemicals you know there s just a lot of oil that also goes into fertilizer so it really is across our economy and across economies across the global system one of the things that i always tell my students is even during covid where you had many countries right much of the world was experiencing some level of lockdown we did have a reduction in oil demand but it wasn t it wasn t like 20 million barrels it was under ten so the fact that now it s 2023 the world has reopened it s really hard to sort of see or to know with certainty is when we re going to see that see that reduction in demand now i think with the paris agreement what s also important is to note is you know if you re if you re in the oil and gas space and i was just at a conference earlier this morning where this was a point of conversation was you know what are the companies doing to reduce the emissions from production so how are they integrating carbon capture sequestration you know how are they managing the emissions that come from the production of fossil energy in this case that we re talking about oil and i think one of the things that i think if you sort of follow oil markets or a country like saudi arabia they are marketing low emission oil now we could you know we could sort of challenge well what does that you know what does that really mean but you are having you know countries that are now sort of competing to state that they have lower emitting carbon in the production in the production of oil and that s a whole other interesting sort of thing to look at in the context of the geopolitics of oil is to kind of understand the variation across emissions across different countries in the production of oil so we are you know again we are going to be going into cop 28 this fall again we are not seeing you know and we haven t seen a you know reduction in fossil energy demand again lots of people are sort of you know hoping that we ll start to see it sooner rather than later but for the time being and again you know to irina s first question that you know the last fourteen months and with you know with russia s invasion of ukraine it has both shown us that you know europe is sort of seeking to hasten the energy transition by building out more renewable energy and creating more opportunities to buy electric vehicles but there s still big swaths of the world that you know are still and have yet to move towards you know really reducing and that are actually going to see higher demand moving forward as their economies grow faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from jovana vujanic who is a graduate student at lewis university how big of an of an impact will the decision of the saudi energy minister to cut oil production have on the relationship between the united states and saudi arabia kissane love the question thank you so much yeah no it s a great one so my take is that of course this decision came as a bit of a surprise and it wasn t something that the united states you know wanted but i would say that the u s saudi relationship has been very tense for the last ten years and as part of that there are lots of different reasons for that but this is yet kind of another thing that saudi has done and again i think it s also saudi has taken a non alignment policy with relation to its position on russia and ukraine so it continues to you know it continues to have a relationship with russia it also has the relationship with ukraine as we saw you know china just brokered a very significant deal between saudi arabia and iran you know again saudi arabia and iran are two are two important producers for china so china is a large importer of oil so if you go back to world war the end of world war ii that s when the united states established the oil for security relationship with saudi arabia and as we have grown sort of more i wouldn t say independent but our as our own oil production has increased especially through the shale revolution our dependence on the middle east and saudi arabia more specifically has shifted so i think we re seeing a very different saudi arabia today which i think is going to be a challenge for the united states i think it s going to be very interesting to see what the summer holds last summer the biden administration did tap into the u s strategic petroleum reserves the largest the largest take in the history of the reserves which started in 1975 you know taking 180 million barrels out you know not because there was massive supply disruptions but because you know as the administration said it was you know it was it was it was a war it was a war specific decision because the you know russia s invasion of ukraine was causing energy prices to skyrocket and to cushion the american consumer and to better cushion the sort of the global economy the united states withdrew from the spr so i think the summer is going to be very interesting but i think we re going to see definitely much more attention in the years to come between the united states and saudi arabia it s not the relationship of the past this is a kind of a very new relationship that s a great question faskianos thank you thank you let s go curran flynn who has a raised hand q hello faskianos we can hear you but we re getting feedback so you might have two devices open q can you hear me now faskianos yes q that s better ok faskianos that s better thank you thank you so much q so i m here at king fahd university in saudi arabia right next to aramco here with my class from international relations and one of my students has a question nasser al nasir ph here he is q so thank you mrs carolyn my question is how could russia s use of alternative transportation methods such as the east siberian pipeline to china impact the u s market the domestic market and the role of the spr given potential insurance workarounds from russia s side such as ensuring russian tankers through their rdif fund and thank you to mrs irina kissane thank you and dr flynn thank you so much for having your students join this webinar so i m a little so the question is about the east siberian pipeline just could you would you mind repeating it i just want to make sure i have it i m clear on the question q so how could russia s use of alternative transportation methods such as the east siberian pipeline to china impact the u s energy markets i mean domestically and the spr given potential insurance workarounds from russia s side such as ensuring russian tankers to the rdif fund kissane yeah and that s a great question you know i think that you know begs a lot of things that we could be looking at right in terms of you know russia s kind of ability or capacity to sort of work around or find workarounds to the sanctions that were imposed and i think we ve seen sort of new markets so this kind of reshaping of the energy map with oil we see that as kind of in technicolor right whereas you know a lot of russian oil would go west is now going east you know china india being takers and of course you know other countries as well you know what will be its impact on the on the u s market i think that s you know again i do think the sanctions were sort of carefully put into place so that there wouldn t be massive disruptions so we again you know russia produces over 10 million barrels a day and about 7 million of those barrels are exported so you know if we lost all of that that would be a you know that would cause some very significant economic disruption globally we already saw you know impacts to sort of grains grain exports and food security in many different parts of the world so you know russia is finding different ways you have shadow tankers that russia is using to move to move its oil as you pointed out the east siberian pipeline you know i think there s only so much the united states can do or and european countries that are part of the sanctions regime can do to curtail russian exports of oil but i think that you know i think russia again has a has a desire and also you know revenue needs they re funding a very expensive war that they re finding ways to get their to get their oil out i think an interesting question is you know what does this mean in the years ahead the lack of investment for example that s going into russian energy infrastructure a lack of sort of any kind of western investment that is that is going in and what that is going to mean but again you know i think to your question i think we will see some you know we are seeing some impacts right there s a big question as to what you know what the next six months to a year will look like with regards to the reduction from opec and if we were to see a deeper curtailment on russian oil and you know would the united states then tap more into the spr we re now at you know we re down to seven hundred thousand barrels which of course is not insignificant but we also sort of have to be you know judicious about how we use the spr but thank you for the question faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from michael let s see trevett a ph d candidate at the university of southern mississippi china and other countries claim there are petroleum reserves under the south china sea what are your estimates of the potential amount there and has china begun to extract any of this oil kissane michael thank you so much that s a great question so china already is an oil producing country so you do have oil production in china in the south china sea i can t i can t say exactly i know that there have been geological tests that have shown the reserves again you do have you know you do have territorial concerns about sort of where is this you know can china can china tap those or seek to explore and tap those reserves again if there are if there is contention over the territory in which these reserves are located so you know china again one of the things that s very interesting about china is that china is an oil producer but china has seen over the last you know the last decade they have seen that they have experienced peak demand so i mean sorry peak supply so they are not producing as much as they used to and so you re seeing a year on year reduction in the producing capacity you know if you go back maybe five or six years ago there was lots of questions about if china could kind of replicate what happened in the united states around the shale oil revolution i think one of the big challenges for china is that of the you know where the shale reserves are located it s not near water lots of questions as to and some of it basically some of the tests have shown that it s it definitely is proving harder that you know they cannot sort of model the same level of development that we have seen in the united states so yeah no i think in the south china sea again i think we it s potentially possible that we might see it i wouldn t i wouldn t i wouldn t say it s soon faskianos thank you i m taking the next question from rob warren at the anglo american university of prague this question also got an upvote how do you foresee venezuela s role in the global oil market changing moving forward and can it be reintegrated into the global economy kissane oh these are all fantastic questions thank you all so much yeah venezuela is again you know venezuela has they have the largest reserves in the world as part of this webinar right you cfr had a kind of a primer on venezuelan and kind of you know you look at sort of where venezuela is and one of the biggest challenges confronting venezuela is both its politics but it s also it basically you know you don t have you don t have international oil service providers in the country i think the only the only one now that the u s the u s has sort of given a sanctions exemption to is that of chevron but i think yeah i mean if you were to see you know kind of shifts in the political regime and you were to see more openness then i think you could imagine you know venezuela having an opportunity or a pathway forward to be more integrated into the global energy system and the global oil system you know i think one of the big problems that venezuela faces is that most of its infrastructure is really old at this point and it would need a significant amount of reinvestment to get it up to a place that it could sort of meet its potential so you know venezuela is one of these countries that s not producing as much as it could right it has the potential to be producing 2 million plus more barrels per day but you know we ve seen that they really have just they went into freefall so i think that s a big issue and another big issue which god it goes back to an earlier question is that of emissions so the oil that comes out of venezuela is a very very heavy oil so it s it has very large carbon emissions associated with the production of that oil so that i think is again as we you know think about the emissions from oil production in countries that are sort of seeking to kind of market themselves as low emission producers you know venezuela definitely will have a very hard time recouping its where its oil sector was again it has the capacity it has the reserves but getting that getting that oil out of the ground right now you have a lot of significant above ground risks faskianos thank you i m going to go next to clemente abrokwaa raised hand so please unmute yourself q can you hear me please faskianos yes we can q thank you thank you so much for your for your talk i was also very shocked about the amount of barrels that we consume every day laughs i didn t know that but anyway i m from penn state university and my question is you just mentioned about the above ground you know effects and so the movement towards like electric vehicles and so on how do you think it is going to affect the african continent kissane thank you q i am i m thinking you know the economies and then infrastructure it will be very difficult for them to laughs move with the rest of the world in terms of electric vehicles and so on i just wanted your take on that kissane thank you clemente it s an excellent question yeah i mean you have countries across the african continent that not only have oil reserves but are already producing right nigeria is a is an oil producing country also has more capacity but again you have some above ground risks you also have the need for investment of new infrastructure i think one of the things that has been very interesting and i think it s getting it s getting more attention as it deserves is how western governments are some of i think a challenge across africa is that a lot of western governments have sort of said listen we re not going to invest in fossil fuels or also financial institutions western financial institutions we re not going to invest in fossil fuels or new projects that are fossil based and that you know that s problematic when you look across the african continent where you still don t have you know 100 percent energy access you know the idea of the transition to electric vehicles which is taking a very very long time even here across the across developed economies so the need for the infusion of more capital to go into you know across the continent of africa for oil and gas that s for their economies and for their own economic growth i think is really really pivotal and i think this is something that you know is being discussed across multilateral financial institutions and also you know is it hypocrisy right for western banks that have you know kind of funded the oil and gas industry or helped to fund the oil and gas industry in the united states and many different parts of the world and that are now sort of not allowing those funds to flow to africa and they have the again they have the they have the resources so you know is it you know the equity of some of these decisions that are being made i think is one that s is one that s really important and again i you know i said earlier in this talk is that you know all most of the demand for oil is not coming from north america and from europe all of the demand that we re seeing and new demand that we re going to see is coming from asia and is going to come from africa so again you know how are we going to make sure that that demand is met again going back to that idea of energy security so there is there is accessibility so there is reliable sources of energy at affordable prices you know without sort of thinking about kind of a whole of energy approach so i think it s very it s a very complex issue and i think you know western banks who have sort of taken very sharp positions on what they will and will not fund when it comes to new oil and gas projects are getting sort of challenged as to you know what does that mean then for you know countries across africa that are still very much in need of more energy not less and again recognizing that you know evs that again are still are you know we re seeing adoption here in the united states and across europe but it s a big big big adoption in china but it s very uneven so how do we ensure greater energy security for the continent of africa i think is a really critical question faskianos thank you i ll take the next question from kyle bales who is a senior at lewis university in romeoville illinois how is the war between russia and ukraine having an effect on the progress of the european green deal maybe you can tell us what the european define the european green deal for us carolyn give us the context for that kissane yes so again this is another fantastic question yeah the european green deal it s this is this is great yeah i mean a lot of people would say that the european green deal now is that the russia s invasion of ukraine has sort of said hey this is why the green deal is so important this is why we really need to more quickly transition to renewable energy because look what look what happened when we were dependent on russia for over 30 percent of our natural gas and look when russia you know illegally invades ukraine and suddenly weaponizes gas we are left very energy insecure it affects it affects consumers it affects industry across the continent so i think we re seeing not just through the green deal but we re also seeing through sort of european green industrial policy so in some ways akin to what you know we put into effect in this past summer is the inflation reduction act and we re seeing almost kind of this industrial competition around clean energy technologies and so europe is investing you know i think it s about 250 billion the united states it s about 370 billion towards the kind of the energy transition and helping to support domestic industries and companies to you know to be able to you know develop the technologies and to have the you know the opportunity to contribute to the energy transition so i think one thing though whenever i talk about europe it s really important is to sort of recognize that you know when you look across europe you have very different policies and kind of approaches to sort of thinking about energy and how quickly some countries want to transition and can transition whereas others you know are probably going to experience a slower transition so just really interesting example as you talked about the green deal is the eu taxonomy the green taxonomy that went into effect in the january of 2022 and there you had like really a lot of contention between france and germany because france wanted to make sure that nuclear was part of the green taxonomy germany was opposed right but germany wanted to make sure natural gas was part of the green taxonomy so ultimately in the end both natural gas and nuclear and again this was this predated russia s invasion of ukraine but in the eu green taxonomy you have you know you have both nuclear and natural gas in addition to other renewable energies that can make up this taxonomy that includes specific measures towards adaptation and mitigation for climate change so you know i think you re seeing this kind of some people call it a race a competition you know ideally it s you know we re kind of working together to because we re all sort of going in the same direction to you know support the transition and to reduce to reduce carbon emissions and to bring in more sort of cleaner energy technologies into our system faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from dr laeed zaghlami q yes good afternoon this is laeed good afternoon irina good afternoon carolyn i m very pleased to be part of your program just to want to be back to africa and particularly to nigeria how practical the two projects that nigeria is advocating for pipelines one from through algeria and the other one to morocco through western african countries how practical are these pipelines to supply gas to europe and parts of some african countries faskianos and dr zaghlami you are at algiers university correct q indeed irina yes i am professor at university of algiers faculty of information and communication faskianos thank you kissane dr laeed can i can i keep you on for just one second can i ask you what is the what is the status right now is it it s planned under construction where is what is the status of those two pipelines my understanding is that it s they re proposed but q yes well actually in practically the pipeline between algeria and abuja which means through niger and so forth is already in progress whereas the other project through thirteen western african countries they are supposed to be implemented by 2047 but is it is there any political game or something of strategic inaudible how practical how logical how efficiently will be for nigeria to have two similar project s kissane yeah no it s again thank you for the question you know pipelines again that s why i wanted to show the laughs kind of the map of pipelines is because you know a lot of pipelines transverse you know multiple countries right and this is this requires not just you know a lot of cooperation but it requires technically it also can be very complex to build to build pipelines and when you re talking about something like as you as you point out these are you know crossing many countries you know i think one of the again one of the issues is whether or not since you know what already is under construction i think you can you know with confidence that one will be completed anything that s not yet under construction and again the timeline 2047 is way out there a lot of a lot of uncertainty as to what the status of those projects will be moving forward for various reasons in terms of making sure that the investments are there someone i know that studies pipelines he says you know until the steel is in the ground you don t have the pipeline and so until you know that you ve got that you know you ve got all the oks and you feel that kind of security of being able to build it and being able to provide the resources to supply it and to move it i think algeria has been a really interesting case that hasn t gotten enough attention in terms of algerian gas that has that has helped support europe over the last years we ve seen an increase in algerian gas going into europe again a lot of attention on u s lng and the increase of liquefied natural gas exports into europe but also algeria has been you know very important for helping to support european energy security and make up for some of the losses of the of the russian gas and i think we ll see more attention on algeria and algeria s role as a you know as an important source of energy especially you know gas going into going into europe moving forward faskianos so i ll take the next written question from vincent brooks who is at harvard and diamondback energy board of directors how do you view the purchasing of discounted russian oil by india in particular relative to the purchasing by china how are they using the oil purchased and are you seeing more internal usage or external profit making sales in places like africa and what are the implications of all of this kissane right great great question so all of the above laughs in some ways right there is definitely sort of profits that are being made you know i was i was talking about this last week with someone and you know if you sort of put your shoe put yourself in the shoes of india right so india is a is a rapidly growing economy 1 4 billion you know if you had if you have very high energy inflation and high oil prices that s going to have ripples effects across the indian economy and so you know when you have a kind of opportunity to buy you know pretty steep discounted oil which you know they had been able to buy from russia you know for purposes of national security they ve been buying the oil and one of the things that s very interesting about india is that actually india has been building out its refining capacity so a lot of that oil is both for domestic and some of it is being sort of re exported but i think what we ve seen is that they re using that oil to also sort of enhance their capacity and capabilities as a rapidly emerging refining power in asia and we see that in some ways in china too so china even though oil demand was down in 2022 much of the oil that they were buying from russia went into its strategic supplies which you know they now have access to and again i think you know a big question is what we re going to see moving forward around oil demand in china wood mackenzie just published a really interesting piece kind of very bullish on the expectations for oil demand in china so whether or not they re going to continue to buy you know russian oil and again sort of taking advantage of these lower prices you know and i think i think one of the things that it s kind of an inconvenient truth whereas a lot of this oil trading used to happen in europe so european trading houses were kind of the main the main points of russian oil trade a lot of that has been moved out so you know russia has found ways to kind of bypass some of the sanctions and have set up in some cases they ve set up trading houses and some of those trading houses have been sort of set up in places that you know that they can sort of again bypass the compliance to the sanctions and you have some you have some russian oil traders that are making a lot of money laughs selling discounted oil and then reselling it a really interesting case a couple of months ago was out of malaysia malaysia announced or in the you know that they were that 1 5 million barrels were produced and sold but only malaysia doesn t produce that much so those were russian barrels that were sort of being sold under sort of the malaysian under the malaysian barrel so again i think china and india have you know have taken advantage some of this has again as i said has been re exported and some of it you know has been re exported through petroleum products because china and india you know both are building and have refining capacity faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from bhakti mirchandani at columbia university what global trajectory do you see for nuclear the russia ukraine crisis has taken some of the refining capacity offline and nuclear has the potential to change the geopolitics of energy and so what steps can be taken to foster nuclear energy kissane bhakti thank you and i was just at columbia earlier today for the center for global energy policy s conference yeah nuclear is very interesting right so when we re thinking about you know decarbonizing our energy systems you know nuclear plays a very important role because it s zero emitting so in certain parts of the world china being one saudi arabia you know you have a lot of new nuclear build you know in other parts of the world you have a lot of contention about nuclear we saw that even in germany which have you know three remaining nuclear power plants and even in the midst of massive energy crisis over the last year there was still sort of pushback about no those nuclear power plants need to be shut down whereas you would think ok in light of energy insecurity let s keep them open so you know france is an interesting country france had planned to reduce its nuclear capacity by 50 percent but this past year they pivoted and they ve said no we re actually going to build out more nuclear and we re sort of we re totally scrapping that idea of reducing nuclear energy and nuclear is very important for france s electricity system sweden has also announced that they are going to build new nuclear and they re going to increase by i think almost 50 percent again part of this is their to meet their targets of net zero we also see japan japan you know the fukushima disaster really turned japanese the japanese public off of nuclear very very deep opposition to restarting the nuclear power plants but this past year even though there s still safety concerns on the part of the public the public is also very concerned about energy insecurity and higher prices so nuclear being a domestic source of energy so i think when you look at you know net zero pathways i have not seen a net zero pathway that does not include nuclear so here in the united states the net zero america project out of princeton very important place for nuclear we just have a really hard time laughs building nuclear at cost so it s very expensive usually it s significant cost overruns and of course there is the i think they have a really significant pr problem people there s still a lot of concern about the safety of nuclear so i think to your point it s very very important for decarbonizing energy systems but you re going to see i think very disjointed approaches some countries are going are embracing nuclear and other countries are sort of doubling down on their opposition and are not going to allow nuclear to be part of the energy system faskianos we have so many questions and we are just not going to get to them all so i m going to take the next question from christian bonfili who s at torcuato di tella university in argentina so do you think carolyn that the landscape resulting from the ukraine invasion by russia vis Ã  vis securitization of gas and energy between europe and russia could accelerate energy transition toward greener energy kissane great question i think in europe it is and i think you know many analysts would agree that the iea for example you know you had the you know how does europe continue you know to enhance and achieve energy security without the dependence on russia gas and a lot of that is through renewable energy you also have a lot of new attention on hydrogen and the role that hydrogen will play i think i think europe is being cautious and so they are not saying that they are going to completely move away from gas so as earlier questions are they getting gas from algeria or are they getting gas from norway are they getting more gas from the united states in the form of liquefied natural gas and then also an uncomfortable truth is they continue to get liquefied natural gas from russia so we ve seen an increase in lng from russia going into europe that said i think all in you are seeing that you know countries across europe are saying ok you know how can we enhance our energy security how do we build more sort of domestic energy sources solar wind we re seeing you know more rapid deployment you ve got a lot of questions about supply chains and things like that but i think overall i think the answer would be that it s quickening the energy transition faskianos so i will take the moderator prerogative to just ask the final question for you to close on and just to give us your top three what are the major challenges for the geopolitics of oil as you look out over the next five to ten year horizon that you would leave us with to be looking for kissane ok you know so i think what we saw right tensions between saudi arabia and the united states we also have a you know a hot war cold war depending on you know the term you want to use between the united states and china and lots of sort of questions as to what that s going to look like i think there s you know i think there s concern that you know we re not reducing demands but we re seeing tightening supply and so that s going to have you know very significant impacts for economies especially economies that are already very fragile economically fragile politically fragile so that concerns me a lot in terms of you know what happens when you know economies don t have adequate access to energy to make sure that their industries that their that consumers you know are able that the lights can stay on and you can get you know if you re dependent on cars you re depending on trucks like all these kinds of things are really really critical so i think we have to be very cautious moving forward that we don t take more out of the system before we have adequately set up the system to be resilient and to be able to sort of meet the energy security demands that are not are not they re not decreasing i think they are increasing and becoming even more complex so i think there s a lot of concerns and a lot of uncertainty and you know this definitely is going to be an area to watch in the years ahead faskianos carolyn kissane kissane excuse me thank you very much for shaping and sharing this discussion for sharing your terrific insights with us and to all of you for your questions and comments i m really sorry that we could not get to them all

asia s year of the rat has begun inauspiciously with the coronavirus crisis scaring investors after the early optimism of a us china trade deal will the chinese zodiac animal live up to its promise of wealth or will it plague investors in 2020 the new year began on a bright note for asian markets after us president donald trump announced a phase one trade deal with china that eased tensions after a two year tariff war under the 15 january agreement the trump administration scrapped tariff hikes that had been scheduled for late 2019 and pledged to cut tariffs on around us 120 billion 178 billion of chinese imports in return beijing promised to buy an extra us 200 billion of us imports over two years including agricultural and manufactured goods and energy the eight chapter agreement also included pledges by china to remove barriers to us financial institutions along with protecting intellectual property and refraining from competitive currency devaluations among other issues however the deal left in place 25 per cent us tariffs on some us 250 billion of chinese imports which trump said were subject to a phase two deal being reached while welcoming the deal capital economics jennifer mckeown said it offered limited upside the deal has done little to move markets since it was largely priced in and it is unlikely to offer a significant boost to global growth either mckeown said in a 16 january report the us economy has not been hit hard by the trade war with consumer prices largely unaffected china has seen a bigger impact since exports to the us are more important to its economy but even there some of the damage has been offset by renminbi depreciation and note that any adverse effects on trade so far will not be fully unwound since tariffs are still far higher than they were in the asia pacific region taiwan vietnam malaysia south korea singapore and australia could suffer should china hike us imports at the expense of other suppliers we suspect that a substantive phase two deal will never be reached decoupling and a gradual reconfiguration of supply chains is likely to continue damaging long term growth in china and the rest of emerging asia mckeown added in its world economic outlook report released on 20 january the international monetary fund downgraded its global growth forecasts citing a slowdown in india despite upgraded growth for china following the us trade deal it predicted global gdp growth would rise from 2 9 per cent in 2019 to 3 3 per cent in 2020 down 0 1 percentage point each year from its previous forecast the us the world s largest economy is seen slowing from 2 3 per cent gdp growth last year to 2 per cent in 2020 the year of the presidential election china the world s second largest economy is expected to post a 6 per cent gdp gain this year and 5 8 per cent in 2021 with the asean 5 of indonesia malaysia the philippines singapore and thailand growing by 4 7 per cent in 2020 and 4 8 per cent in 2021 however japan the world s third largest economy is seen decelerating from 1 per cent gdp growth in 2019 to just 0 7 per cent this year and 0 5 per cent in 2021 india which until recently was the fastest growing major economy is expected to post a 5 8 per cent gdp gain this year and 6 5 per cent in 2021 due to stress in the nonbank financial sector and weak rural income growth coronavirus impacts yet the forecasts were made before the coronavirus crisis hit the region sending stocks and bond yields lower dampening tourism and turning some of china s biggest cities into virtual ghost towns capital economics warns a 50 per cent drop in chinese tourist arrivals could knock up to 3 percentage points off the most vulnerable countries gdp with hong kong cambodia and thailand the most vulnerable the impact could worsen if it disrupts the industrial sector particularly if china extends its chinese new year holidays and domestic consumption contracts according to gareth leather senior asia economist it now looks as though regional growth will slow sharply in the first quarter economic growth should rebound if or when the virus is brought under control anz research has estimated that china s gdp growth could be dragged 0 9 percentage point lower by the coronavirus outbreak resulting in headline growth of 5 per cent outside china and india the bank s economists expect asia to lose as much as 0 5 percentage points in the first quarter while australia could see a 0 2 percentage point decline in 2020 adding to the downside risks stemming from recent bushfires aussie equities feel the strain australian investors have already felt the impact with the australian bourse posting its biggest one day fall for the new year on 28 january yet should china and the world overcome the coronavirus the outlook might not be as bleak as feared robert mann head of asian equity for nikko asset management nikko am says asian stocks could outperform their us counterparts in 2020 as us growth eases the chinese market had a very good year last year as did every market despite all the trade tensions but what drove markets last year was the us federal reserve the fed s pivot in january started the rebound said the singapore based analyst in the past couple of years all you had to do was buy us stocks since us growth surprised on the upside and everyone else surprised on the downside but that s unlikely to be the case this year for asia and emerging markets generally slower growth in the united states very low interest rates from the fed oil prices not going too high and a not overly strong us dollar coinciding with the return of the tech cycle is a pretty good backdrop
ul earnings call for the period ending december 31 2019 unilever plc ul 0 47 q4 2019 earnings call 3 00 a m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks operator we are about to hand over to unilever to begin the conference call we will now hand over to richard williams richard williams executive vice president of investor relations good morning and welcome to unilever s full year results call alan will begin with an overview of 2019 before passing to graeme to cover the divisions and regions in more detail alan will wrap up with some comments on the 2020 priorities and our outlook for the year we ll keep the prepared remarks around 30 minutes leaving plenty of time for q a all of today s webcast is available live transcribed on the screen as part of our accessibility program so first let me draw your attention to the disclaimer to forward looking statements and non gaap measures and with that let me hand over to you alan alan jope chief executive officer well thanks richard and good morning in december we issued a sales update and we made it clear there that quarter four was going to be a weak quarter of growth and in the event as you ve seen from this morning s announcement we delivered underlying sales growth of 1 5 in the quarter which brings the full year growth to 2 9 frustratingly just below our guiding range given the benefit that we ve had from portfolio change we do see 2 9 as an unsatisfactory result graeme will share with you the drivers of that weak quarter in a few minutes now i say frustratingly because on our other key measures of performance 2019 was a good year the balance of volume and price was good we continued to deliver high quality margin improvement and that took us to 19 1 underlying operating margin the 50 basis points improvement came mainly from 30 bps of increased gross margin and was delivered while accelerating the absolute investment that we were making in our brands underlying eps increased by 8 1 and we delivered a record year of free cash flow at eur6 1 billion with cash conversion well above 100 so unilever remains a tightly run organization there were several good full year performances in emerging markets and home care where both grew over 5 and in e commerce where we saw 30 growth in a market that s growing at around 20 e commerce is now about 6 of unilever however our disappointing quarter four is certainly a catalyst to our entire organization that we need to improve our growth performance which remains of course our overarching priority now i will talk more about 2020 after graeme s come through the 2019 results in more detail and we will share how we plan to accelerate through the year one thing we do want to provide an update on though is the performance in some hot spots that we called out with q3 results and we ve made some good progress dressings in the us has now been gaining value share for the last two 12 weeks periods so that s six months this is a result of continued strong investment line in the hellmann s brand and some on trend innovation like vegan meals i should say that the strong growth of sir kensington s is also helping contribute to this good recovery in dressings in us ice cream we re now solidly gaining share and this has been led by our premium portfolio in us hair care while the share numbers that you see here are still negative we re pleased to see a recovery starting to come through and in fact in the most recent monthly share rates we re back in positive territory but we need a few more quarters to ensure that our marketing and innovation plans behind tresemme and suave are the best they can be before we show sustained share improvement and declare victory overall the extra investment that we put into these areas is paying off and our marketing actions are having the desired impact in tea and developed markets it s a slower recovery and there is still work to do i m obviously going to come back to tea later now 2019 was a year of significant internal change for the company we ve taken steps to make sure that unilever is organized and focused to seize the opportunities of this fast changing consumer products world and first we have a new leadership team there s been several moves on the exec we ve brought in unusually three leaders from the outside richard slater in r d sunny jain to lead beauty and personal care and most recently welcomed fabian garcia to run our north american business we ve also promoted three unilever executives to the top table peter kulve running home care sanjiv mehta in south asia and conny braams as our chief digital marketing officer nitin and hanneke in new roles and we re delighted to have the continuity that graeme leena marc and ritva bring we ve also flattened our market structure under our newly created position of chief operating officer which nitin took up in may we ve now got 15 performance manage units directly under nitin s leadership and by removing most of our regional layers we believe we re building a faster more execution focused more connected markets organization to deliver the strategic agendas of the divisions so that s on people and organization a third piece of major work that we completed last year has been to update and integrate our business and sustainability strategies into one single unified growth strategy our vision of sustainable business driving superior performance is one that has inspired the entire unilever organization the task ahead of us of course is to continue our multi year track record ensuring that unilever s leading position on environmental and social sustainability as well as our highest standards of corporate governance translate into superior stakeholder returns over the last few years we ve made quite significant changes to our portfolio acquiring businesses in new segments and disposing of parts of the company such as spreads and at our investor event in 2019 we said we would carry out an uncompromising evaluation of our current categories and brands with a very open mind and today we ve announced that we ve initiated a full strategic review of our tea business and i ll tell you more about that when we talk about the 2020 plans so before we jump to 2020 graeme maybe you could cover some more detail on last year s results graeme pitkethly chief financial officer sure thing thanks alan good morning everybody and well happy new year if it s not too late to wish you that and so looking at 2019 2 9 is broadly in line with our 3 run rate over the last few years but with a greater contribution has come from portfolio changes alan said we view it as a disappointing figure growth has been consistent in emerging markets over the last four years with emerging markets delivering between 5 and 6 of growth now of course there s always some bumpiness in between the quarters as we saw in q4 we gave you the headlines on the quarter back in december and we said we d give you a little bit more color in the new year so let s do that our run rate in q4 slowed from a little over 3 in the last few quarters prior to that to only 1 5 in q4 and there were essentially four factors behind this slowdown there ve been challenges in west africa we have two very important businesses one in ghana and one in nigeria which have grown by double digits over the last five years but both experienced a very tough second half in 2019 now ghana and nigeria have recently reported a very good quarter four on top of a weak quarter three and when we look at q4 versus the run rate of the few quarters before that we estimate the impact of that to be about a 40 basis point drag and this was a result of slowing market conditions liquidity issues and a subsequent management decision that we should reduce the high levels of stock that it built up across the trade landscape secondly coming to india market growth has slowed throughout the year in line with the gdp slowdown but our growth had held up well even into q3 when we were at 7 usg year to date in q4 however the market slowdown was sharper than expected and that coupled with some pricing actions of our own has impacted our performance in the quarter and i wouldn t say more about that now because hindustan unilever are only going to report their results tomorrow but we can talk more about that after they ve done that in north america as alan has already explained we are pleased to begin to see a recovery in some of the hot spot sales but we d to be honest hoped for a little bit more in quarter four the main reasons for the shortfall versus our expectations in the region were that our foodservice business had a poor quarter four and our hair business as alan said is taking a little longer to get back on a winning track although we are obviously encouraged by the more recent share trends finally in north africa middle east and turkey namet as we call it we saw significant slowdown much of which was expected as inflation dropped particularly in turkey and volumes were weaker across the region now we expect these factors four of them to continue into the early part of 2020 and hence our guidance of a first half growth of below 3 however all of these countries remain good long term prospects and as always we won t let a few quarters or a quarter of bumpiness put us off investing and doing the right things for the long term now let s take a look at the divisions beauty and personal care grew by 2 6 with 1 7 from volume in q4 growth of 0 5 for beauty and personal care was impacted by the slower performance in the geographies i just mentioned deodorants and skincare delivered good growth prestige again delivered double digit growth with most brands contributing and reached over eur600 million of turnover in 2019 both garancia and tatcha which we acquired this year have delivered well in deodorants we saw strong growth in brazil as we regained the consumer who had been trading down during the recession and in southeast asia the dry serum innovation has offered consumers a different way to enjoy the benefits of deodorant in humid countries aluminium free deodorant under our dove brand has performed very well across europe and north america skin cleansing in india has been impacted by both a declining market and pricing actions which we have taken in order to increase competitiveness growth was weak in hair care impacted by north america we ve more work to do here and while we are seeing green shoots we re not yet happy with our performance however as alan said the investment we ve made during the second half and particularly in quarter four has contributed to an improved performance and our investment will remain strong behind this business foods and refreshment delivered 1 5 growth with 1 7 coming from price volume declined in ice cream due to a strong comparator from hot weather back in 2018 and despite this ice cream grew 2 in the full year with good growth in turkey and in southeast asia magnum and the heart brands which we know as wall s in the uk or indeed algida in turkey etc delivered above average growth with premium innovations like white chocolate and cookies supporting the category in foods the on trend segments of snacking and scratch cooking continue to grow above average and the aar region delivered good growth although the second half was impacted by the challenges in west africa the philippines and indonesia we would call out as particularly strong in fact our sweet soy sauce brand bango continues to be very popular in indonesia and is driving strong volume growth there has been another tough year in europe where foods declined slightly led by germany and the uk the launch of the vegetarian butcher into burger king across 25 countries in europe is a significant win for us and offers a strong growth opportunity as alan mentioned we re pleased with the recovery at hellmann s in the usa where the overall dressings category has started to grow again as a result tea had a challenging year in developed markets but strong growth continued in the tea business in india turning to home care home care grew by 6 1 balanced between volume and price the strong performance was broad based with fabric solutions fabric sensations and home and hygiene all growing by mid to high single digits growth in brazil india and china has led to strong performance with successful market development across all of our brands format trade up success is very evident in our above average growth rates in capsules and liquids across china india vietnam south africa and indeed beyond concentration has been a winning initiative in 2019 particularly in brazil and we re seeing good results both in terms of growth and in margin the use of recycled plastic and less plastic is a strong focus for home care with 2019 being the year of many launches across the major brands of cif sunlight and omo seventh generation which is our plant based laundry detergent continues to grow at strong double digit rates in the united states before moving on i d just like to cover some of the successful examples of innovation that we ve had in 2019 these were successful both from a product performance point of view but also in the way we communicated the innovations to the consumer it is these examples that we will look to replicate across the whole business in 2020 and beyond we employ leading technology to create innovations such as the dove microbiome body wash which is now in 36 countries and driving microbiome awareness or indeed rexona clinical which has strongly contributed to the growth of the deo category this year doubling penetration of the clinical segment in brazil and australia insights from the plant based vegan trends in food and refreshment have resulted in on trend innovations across the division and in home care our capsules and liquids innovations are driving market development omo capsules in china have contributed to double digit growth in home care with surf excel doing the same in india market development remains a core driver of growth in home care and our emerging market footprint means that we re well placed to lead the change we are fully focused on achieving more innovation success in 2020 and alan is going to talk a little bit more about that in a minute or two moving on to the regional performance performance in asia amet rub was overall strong at 5 balanced between price and volume there have been many strong performances across this region southeast asia delivered mid single digit growth in the full year with the large countries of indonesia vietnam and the philippines growing consistently backed up by high growth in the nascent markets of myanmar and cambodia china grew high single digits ahead of the market with our premium priced portfolio across bpc and home care delivering well however in aar q4 usg was only 2 1 impacted by the factors that i explained earlier in particular price slowing down driven by india skin cleansing turkey and other countries in the middle east such as egypt latin america grew by 5 1 which is the strongest growth since 2016 in quarter four volume would have been positive had it not been for lapping the impact of the trucker strike restock from last year for the full year brazil grew by mid single digits ahead of the market with a return to strong price growth deodorants and home care performed strongly helped by innovation in both categories which is beginning to attract consumers back toward the mid tier brands we re investing behind concentration initiatives in home care in brazil in both powders and liquids and that has supported our growth mexico also grew by mid single digits with good growth in ice cream driven by magnum and in foods driven by gains in the traditional trade across our savory portfolio in argentina conditions remain tough but our business has strengthened throughout the year and importantly has outperformed the market on volume north america grew by only 0 3 with positive price growth and negative volume q4 delivered 0 6 this was a step up from q3 helped by the recovery in the hotspots as alan explained but we still have more to do deodorants continue to grow well with dove and degree maintaining the number one and number two brand positions our clean and green home care brand seventh generation has also contributed to north american growth and we ve launched love home planet during the year dressings accelerated throughout the year and the second half showed positive sales and share growth these good performances were offset as already mentioned by continued challenges in the north american hair business and a poor quarter in the foodservice business in europe underlying sales declined 0 6 with volume growth of 0 3 ice cream was the key driver of this decline following two years of hot weather pricing stepped down in quarter four a result of higher promotional spend within a deflationary environment home care delivered growth led by fabric sensations and home and hygiene with some strong naturals innovations from cif deodorants and skincare also grew in europe we saw strong gains across central and eastern europe and italy while france germany and the uk all had a tough year for growth in difficult trading environments in the uk brexit related retailer destocking impacted q4 turnover was eur52 billion in 2019 underlying sales growth added 2 9 acquisitions and disposals decreased turnover by 2 3 following the disposal of the spreads back in july 2018 although in the second half acquisitions and disposals actually increased turnover by 0 5 currency has increased turnover by 1 5 mainly due to the strength of the us dollar versus the euro plus appreciation in some asian countries such as indonesia and india and looking forward based just on the latest spot rates we expect currency to have quite a limited impact on both turnover and eps in 2020 turning to our margins we made strong progress delivering the 50 basis points increase in the underlying operating margin and that takes us to 19 1 our gross margin increased by 30 basis points helped of course by our net revenue management program and continued efficiencies from supply chain programs such as 5s our brand and marketing investment increased by eur70 million in constant currencies in the full year with all of the increase coming in the second half and it was flat as a percentage of turnover we continue to find efficiencies in our marketing spend through investment in new digital tools and capabilities and rigorous tracking of our spend effectiveness these measures ensure that we can remain strongly invested behind our core brands while also delivering productivity gains our overheads decreased by 20 basis points through a zero based budgeting and change programs and the stranded costs from the spreads disposal have now been fully addressed in line with our original plans overall underlying earnings per share increased by 8 1 in current rates and 5 8 in constant rates turnover and operational performance which of course is the combination of growth and margin contributed 6 5 to earnings the earnings dilution from the spreads disposal was mitigated by the 2018 share buyback which had a 2 6 impact minorities and pensions made up the 0 6 minorities increased as a percentage of net profit back to more normalized levels following the spreads disposal in the prior year our underlying tax rate was 25 5 and we expect our tax rate over the medium term to continue to be around 26 and we expect the interest rate on net debt to be around 3 percentage points in 2020 currency movements increased eps by 2 3 turning now to the cash flow and our balance sheet we delivered our highest ever free cash flow of eur6 1 billion in 2019 this is an increase of eur700 million over the prior year driven by higher underlying operating profit and working capital improvements which had been adversely impacted in 2018 by the disposal of spreads our cash conversion increased to 110 also the highest since we began measuring it our net debt sits at 1 9 times ebitda in line with our long term leverage target of around 2 times we expect to continue to maintain leverage at around this level our return on invested capital has improved to 19 2 versus the prior year of 18 1 following gains from operational performance offset by increases in goodwill and intangibles very much meeting our roic target of high teens our pension deficit has reduced by eur0 7 billion to eur0 2 billion which is the lowest in over 15 years that s the result of good investment returns partially offset by higher liabilities there s a strong performance on cash on financing and return on invested capital reflecting the strong financial discipline that we have throughout the business and with that let me hand you back to alan to talk more about the 2020 priorities alan jope chief executive officer thanks graeme before i actually talk about 2020 and as we near the completion of our three year strategic plan i did want to make a few comments about the overall progress on a slightly longer term frame we set out a multi year growth range of 3 to 5 and yes we ve been around the low end of that consistently for four years we are becoming a simpler faster organization we ve continued the journey that started with connected for growth by now de layering the business getting closer to the markets and putting in place a chief operating officer as i mentioned margin is probably the big story we ve improved from 16 4 at the end of 2016 to 19 1 last year and we ve delivered fully on our fuel for growth plans of eur6 billion of savings across three years although as i ve said before we intend to need to continue with the savings at least at this level to allow us to keep on investing in our business we ve evolved our portfolio through disposals notably our spreads and as everyone knows we completed a significant number of acquisitions and yes portfolio evolution will continue to form an important part of our strategy though with a more focused acquisition agenda our capital and legal structure we have improved by buying back and canceling the preference shares and measures to close the trust offers have been completed but as you know the proposal to simplify our historic dual structure was withdrawn on leverage and returns we ve returned eur11 billion in share buybacks and graeme s just demonstrated i think how disciplined we are in our approach to return on invested capital and net debt so it s crystal clear that the metric to improve upon is growth and i m absolutely determined that we will meet our ambitions in this space so let me say a little bit more about growth now we are focusing on a framework that you should get used to seeing from us from now on we re calling it the five growth fundamentals and they re shown here on the left hand side of the chart they ve been built from a deep and empirical analysis of the factors that drive growth in the types of consumer goods categories that we compete in and i m just going to rattle through them all quickly so first penetration this is a measure of how many households have bought our brands in a given period and there s an absolute direct correlation between household penetration market share and growth this is built on the premise of addressing the long tail of buyers and consumer goods and not over focusing on your core of loyal users and what we re focused here on is building mental and physical availability of our brands through improvement in things like the quality of advertising and the strength of distribution this work of course is focused on key sales and is the methodology by which we ve recently turned around a number of the hotspots that we covered earlier secondly innovation we have a proud history of innovation and green shoots and great examples have been our goal but there is more that we can do to step up the impact from our current innovation program including positive impact to the total category level for our customer partners specifically we are investing to deliver a higher proportion of functionally superior products with more leading technology and more benefits we are being more decisive on our choices of which innovations to prioritize and we re actively cutting the tail of small projects we re also making faster decisions post launch on whether to accelerate pivot or kill projects we really know after about 100 days with a high level of certainty what are the winners that we should back and where we should cut our losses quicker on something that s not working thirdly we are designing more deliberately for specific growth channels we re clear on the channels that are growing the fastest and we re organizing behind them with focused channel teams who will ensure we have the right portfolio and the executional muscle to win turning to purpose you know that we re seeing stronger growth from our purposeful brands and we re now measuring how brand purpose is perceived by the consumer whether she truly understands that our brands authentically stand for something more when she makes the choice to buy this is important for the short term but also to ensure that our brands remain relevant for generations to come and we are investing more of our marketing spend on communication which is explicitly purposeful as we get extremely strong data on the link between purposeful communication and both short and long term growth and fifthly but by no means last is the fuel for growth and we re continuing to invest very competitively in our brands and we re able to do this because we unlock savings through existing programs like 5s zbb and organizational change but as well as through new initiatives like our grow power run model that we previewed at the investor day this is the model that optimizes both global scale and focused expertise in the more transactional parts of the business so these five growth fundamentals will unlock progressive acceleration of growth in 2020 and as shown in the chart in parallel we continue to evaluate our portfolio against a number of criteria those criteria include for example are the categories high growth are they of sufficient size are they unconsolidated we should be looking for future facing markets with strong emerging market growth potential which are sensitive to unilever s marketing and technology capabilities there should also be categories where unilever has the right to play and by that i mean we ve proven some existing success let me highlight a couple these criterias help us to identify focus areas for the future such as luxury beauty and in particular skincare we ve been successful in building up a prestige portfolio and it s on track for its eur1 billion ambition but there is much more opportunity and we are raising our ambition particularly in the high growth area of asian skincare the second area which we haven t said much about till now is this overlap that s emerging between personal care and health wellness and personalized nutrition in this case we are focusing on vitamins minerals and supplements or vms we started this journey with the acquisition of equilibra in june 2018 followed by olly in april last year and both brands are growing strongly we have significant international potential and you should think about vms in the same way that we described our commitment to prestige beauty a few years ago now in contrast we have parts of the portfolio which are more mature that are consolidated that are structurally slower growing and which are less sensitive to technology and marketing capability and spreads fell into this category and we ended up making that disposal in 2018 our tea business also falls into this camp it has a disproportionate large footprint in black tea which is slower growing and also in developed markets tea now has a long track record of being dilutive to growth and margin over the long term so this strategic review announcement means that we want to investigate how we can best create value for our stakeholders we ve not reached a conclusion and all options remain on the table so to wrap up let me reconfirm our guidance for 2020 as we communicated in december we expect the first half of 2020 to be a step up from quarter four but below 3 and we expect the full year to be in the lower half of our 3 to 5 multi year range we do see the challenges that we saw in quarter four continuing as graeme said and that will have some impact in the first half of 2020 we re monitoring the effects of coronavirus most importantly on our people but we re also mindful that it s likely to affect our businesses it s too early to quantify but we already know for example that it will have a commercial impact about a fifth of our business in china is professional foodservice and that s likely to be significantly impacted by a drop in out of home consumption we expect continued improvement in underlying operating margin remaining on track for our 2020 goals and that of course will be delivered through our focus on waste and inefficiencies and through restructuring investment that takes out cost but this will of course be done while ensuring that our brands are competitively supported so that there is absolutely no tax on growth and if it does come to a trade off between margin and growth we will certainly prioritize growth we see another year of strong cash flow and with that let me thank you for your attention that s actually the end of our prepared remarks and we re going to take questions now richard questions and answers alan jope chief executive officer thanks alan thanks graeme so our first question will be from alain oberhuber from mainfirst go ahead alain alain oberhuber mainfirst analyst thank you very much richard good morning alan good morning graeme and richard two questions just regarding the tea business and the strategic review does the strategic review also include the premium tea like t2 and coca and the second question is regarding strategic review and the dressings business do you see that the dressings business also falling in the same category as breads and tea thank you very much alan jope chief executive officer yeah let me take that so alain first of all this is a review of our global tea business and to give you a blunt answer yes it does include premium tea as far as dressings is concerned actually we believe it s got some quite different characteristics to tea it s more technology and marketing sensitive and although growth has been impacted by the competitive battle in the us we do see brighter prospects of growth in dressings as we bring that business onto trends like vegan so at the moment the strategic review that we ve announced is focused on our worldwide tea business alain oberhuber mainfirst analyst thank you richard williams executive vice president of investor relations thanks okay our next call will be from richard taylor of morgan stanley go ahead with your question richard richard taylor morgan stanley analyst good morning everyone my first question is reflecting on your first year in the job alan what s the biggest change that you ve made and what impact has that had and the second one i suppose i m just reflecting on the warning in december i was pretty perplexed by the warning at the time because in effect it was about 30 basis points 20 to 30 basis points off full year expectations and looking at the results today i suppose i m even more perplexed by the warning particularly given that comments around margins were kind of earlier in the year were more material for earnings than the december statement in terms of like for like growth so i d love to get a bit of your insight in terms of why you chose to update the market in december because it didn t seem to be particularly material on analysts expectations alan jope chief executive officer okay i ll take the first question richard and graeme why don t you take the second one well it s been a busy year in 2019 and i think i d go under the headline of preparing the business for faster growth when you look that we ve changed seven members of the unilever leadership team we ve completely reorganized our markets organization we ve developed a multi year integrated growth strategy which has really now landed across the organization and most importantly we ve thoroughly analyzed our business developed the five growth fundamentals that we think will unlock growth shared those across the business so that we are fully aligned and poised for a sequential step up through 2020 and then toward the end of the year getting busy with a portfolio review where you see very significant announcement today on tea i think all of that i would put under the heading of a burning desire to get unilever prepared for faster growth in the future and putting the pieces in place i d also don t want to understate the proud achievements that graeme rattled off on the discipline that we continue to have in the business around delivering bottom line and balance sheet performance so that s kind of how i would characterize the year one a busy exciting year very much focused on future graeme pitkethly chief financial officer yeah morning richard thanks for your second question because i think we owe it to everybody to explain a little bit the choreography around these things but let me preface the comment in response to you by saying overall we find the fact that we re only growing at around 3 as alan said both disappointing and frustrating particularly when it s clear that with the actions alan s lined out we can improve our executional success rate in the business get us back up to growing winning share in our business beyond the roughly 50 of our business that is currently winning share so we know what the objective is and we know what we have to do that s why 3 is disappointing and it s frustrating now the reason i say that is because what i am about to say i don t want it to be perceived as not with a reasonable degree of humility but i would agree with you that in the way of the world though it is a little bit crazy that we are obliged and compelled to come out with a warning which ultimately as i think you alluded to in your question was a 10 basis point miss outside of a long term growth range of 3 to 5 or put another way eur50 million on a eur52 billion business but let me assure you it wouldn t have been our choice but of course we are obliged by the markets to do that by the regulations to which we re all bound and you saw the reaction of the to the announcement on the day and of course that reaction would support the regulatory view that we should have come out and explained it now do i think that personally that reaction warrants a tiny miss on a pinhead on a business of this scale and size and future value and significance and the way we manage the business of course i don t but having said that and as i began the answer it doesn t excuse the fact that we re frustrated that we re only growing at the bottom of our range right now and we ve got a job to do to deliver a step up in that growth range going forward by a combination of better execution and faster and more focused portfolio change we take accountability for that but in terms of the management around that announcement it was 100 down to the obligations that we face from regulation richard williams executive vice president of investor relations thanks graeme next question from charles eden at ubs you re on charles charles eden ubs analyst hi good morning so just a quick question on your 2020 outlook slide where you gave guidance for continued progress toward the 20 underlying operating profit margin i just wanted to pick up on the wording progress toward does that suggest you may well come in light of that 20 number and then my second question is on the commentary around improvement in brazil could you just give some color in terms of what is the improvement you re saying thank you alan jope chief executive officer thanks charles when i say that we will progress toward 20 i think what it says is we are very confident that at 19 1 it s relatively straightforward for us to continue to show margin improvement getting 50 basis points or so of margin to a number that would round to 20 we were talking about eur200 million of bottom line improvement in a context where we deliver eur2 billion of savings a year and have got the flexibility on where we reinvest that so we remain quite confident that we can properly invest in the business and continue to show bottom line evolution but i do want to underscore that we re not fixated on that 20 operating margin nor are we fixated on exactly when we deliver it and if push comes to shove we will release extra funding to support our growth agenda as in fact we did in the second half of last year the turnaround in the north american hotspots did involve us dynamically redeploying resource into north america and we wouldn t hesitate to do that again so take the 20 margin as a destination but with a management team that s not fixated on exactly when we get there graeme pitkethly chief financial officer you want me to take the brazil point alan jope chief executive officer yeah you take that graeme pitkethly chief financial officer yeah charles actually thanks for the opportunity to talk about brazil and latin america more generally as we said in the prepared words we expect to see an acceleration in growth during the course of 2020 and that s a result of several things it s a result of the growth fundamentals better execution it s the result of our innovation program coming through most of which is a lot of good stuff landing in the second half of the year and it s a consequence of lapping but it s also a consequence of recovery in some markets and there s two in particular i d like to call out we think the slowdown in india it s hard to call it but we think it s more likely that the indian government may take economic actions to support the growth rate of gdp in india toward the second half of the year and the second one is that we are expecting that latin america which has been bumping along that really historical lows of market growth following the crisis in brazil and the ongoing crisis in argentina that that will begin to recover and we re seeing that now in brazil and i think we will see brazil recover over the course of 2020 it s a very important market for us as you know it s 40 of our sales in latin america we delivered above mid single digit growth in 2019 it s ahead of market growth which is only 2 to 3 and we made some very strong share gains in the second half of 2019 so the businesses managed the crisis extremely well and as is usual we re coming out of the crisis in really good shape a lot of the comments i made on innovation a lot of the comments i made on market development previously were addressed around home care and brazil in particular a lot of the innovation we ve done around concentration we had a complete relaunch of the omo laundry brand in brazil last year as many of you will know that is the biggest brand in unilever it is bigger than most of our countries the number one sku in unilever is omo 1 kg brazil the number two sku in unilever is omo 2 kg brazil so it s a relaunch of the totality of the brand architecture and doing that really successfully i think gives us a great platform there alan jope chief executive officer and the number one most loved brand in all of brazil graeme pitkethly chief financial officer in all of brazil so we ve got great assets there we need to cherish them and sometimes you need to refresh them and i think we ve done that very well now if we start to get the market recovery that we are starting to see and we re much more optimistic about it now then i think we ll get back to stronger market growth and of course to be totally candid a big piece of the move from the bottom of our range to the upper half of our range has to be through a step up in market growth and we believe that latin america and brazil in particular can be a big component of that richard williams executive vice president of investor relations okay quickly to the next question we have a large number of questions still on the line martin deboo at jefferies go ahead marty martin deboo jefferies analyst okay thanks everyone i ll try and keep it brief graeme just on the first question let me push you a bit harder on what you ve just said i think the question in my mind is what i understand what you re saying about the laydown of the year on the top line but what does get better in h1 that raises above q4 performance so it feels like you still got the headwinds from west africa from turkey probably india in h1 so what s getting better or is it just brazil or is it something else and the second question is moving parts of margin again i heard what you were saying in response to charles question but i m not looking for a number from you i just want to make sure i m understanding it you ve got good news is there s further cost savings but i think it s only eur0 5 billion or less now the original eur6 5 billion it feels to me like bmi goes up because alan said in englewood that you ve got a big innovation pipeline so the question i don t have the answer to is what the commodities do in 2020 so those are the questions is there h1 growth and fy 20 moving parts of margin graeme pitkethly chief financial officer yeah you re going to take h1 alan jope chief executive officer i ll do margin you take h1 graeme pitkethly chief financial officer okay ok well martin we re dividing up your question here so let me take h1 and let me deconstruct first of all what happened with the momentum growth rate of around 3 dropping to 1 5 in q4 ghana nigeria was about a 40 basis points impact the impact of the deflation in the namet region was more than that india was roughly similar to ghana nigeria and it was a smaller contribution from the us now that will that adds up to somewhere north of about 150 basis points and bridges you from the 1 5 to the 3 so your question wasn t what happens to step up in h2 because i think that s clear the question is what will cause the acceleration of that through from into h1 and we do expect although ghana nigeria will continue we re working through what is a very significant and focused problem in two countries there and we re working through the trade stocks i mean to be honest when we say we re working through the trade stocks that are too high it s a little bit deeper than that we are obviously exposed with a bunch of receivables from distributors and we simply want to make sure that we can recover that money we re through the bulk of that now and so while that will continue it will mitigate over that first half period the second thing that you can expect to see and we re going back here to the progress on the hotspots that alan set out on the chart earlier three of which are in north america we fully expect that the actions we re taking in dressings the actions we re taking in ice cream and the actions we re taking in hair care will bear fruit as we come through into that period and the final one is there was some back year impact from the truckers strike relapping in brazil in q4 of 2018 and that doesn t persist into the first half so just on your question of first half sequential growth we can get growth from that that leaves aside all the things around execution or innovation in the normal workings of the business as we go forward the only counter to that there s always a caveat but as we ve said coronavirus we ll just have to park that for now because it could have an impact it will have an impact and we just don t know how much that is yet alan jope chief executive officer right on margin let me just talk a little bit about some of the drivers first of all you asked specifically about commodities what we see is mid single digit increases in commodities a lot of that is in our agricultural inputs and therefore we think that our f r business with the refreshment will possibly be more exposed to commodity increases through the first half of 2020 than the other parts of the business but let me clarify one thing when you said martin there s only about eur0 5 billion of savings left i really want to triple underscore that our model relies on well over eur2 billion of savings coming out every year and while we don t really have a crystal ball on what the markets are going to do and therefore what our top line is going to be we have an extremely strong window into our likely savings programs for the year and whether it s the remaining opportunities in zbb continued work on product and conversion cost whether it s the overheads transformation program or the big savings that we outlined in our it infrastructure then in the capital markets day we are very very confident that there is eur2 billion of real savings for us to deliver this year and that gives us the choice and flexibility on where we want to reinvest it might be in i think it will be in a step up in the number of ftes in marketing to drive the new future of marketing model i think it will be a step up in bmi definitely in the absolute and probably as a percent of turnover and there might be other areas where we choose to invest one of which will be some of the environmental commitments that we ve made so for instance accelerating our use of recycled plastic which we know makes our brands more relevant for the consumer so literally think of it as we need to improve profit by eur200 million and we ve got eur2 billion to redeploy in choosing how we get to that goal graeme pitkethly chief financial officer okay can i alan jope chief executive officer sure graeme pitkethly chief financial officer can i spend a second i want to i don t want to take too long but it s a good opportunity to talk about the mix of the savings delivery and also restructuring investment just to round out the totality of it because what s happened martin in broad brush terms the 5s supply chain savings program delivers consistent levels of savings at the elevated levels that we foresaw at the time of the 2017 strategic review when we upped the run rate of savings from eur4 billion to eur6 billion over the period from 17 to 20 and we fully did over delivered against that zbb because of the nature of the beast you get declining returns on it so that has started to fade off as a proportion of the contributor because we ve reached the benchmark levels that we feel are appropriate for the business but that has been backfilled by the change program and so it s a really important point that we asked permission to spend about eur3 5 billion plus of restructuring funds in 2017 and we ve been doing that and it sits below our underlying operating margin so really it doesn t often get a lot of attention but i would like to draw attention to it because it s real money and it s money that we re investing in changing unilever most of that money has gone into the supply chain in europe the supply chain in latin america a lot of it went into taking out stranded costs on spreads which were eur250 million a year and we ve fully taken out those stranded costs and the rest of it is going into build capability for the future as alan particularly in our back office systems run power grow powering up our global business services organization using technology and getting on the technology curve properly and that gives us the confidence that we can continue at the elevated savings rates going forward richard williams executive vice president of investor relations okay we ve still got a lot of questions on the line so we ll probably run over by five or 10 minutes alan and graeme if you can run up a little bit so try and get as many as possible so the next question from celine pannuti at jpmorgan go ahead celine celine pannuti jpmorgan analyst yes good morning everyone my first question is on pricing i was quite surprised by the deceleration in pricing which you explained by the amet region but i think as well europe was very weak too could you maybe talk about europe and then as i look into 2020 would it be fair to say that the pricing component would remain quite weak as we ve seen in q4 and then my second question is on latin america i heard your commentary on brazil can you share with us how much argentina grew in 2019 and what about the rest of latin america excluding mexico and brazil thank you alan jope chief executive officer thanks celine well i think you ve sort of answered your own question on pricing it was very much driven by the lower inflation rates in particularly turkey and arabia but i do want to call out the continued deflation in europe the deflationary trade environment where we have consistent negative upg in europe is something that we re addressing the only solution to that is a strengthened innovation program because it s when you innovate that you re able to pass along more added value and therefore take price in europe so those are the two big drivers i think as we look forward to 2020 we definitely don t guide on price but what i said on commodity inflation would suggest that it will be if there is such a thing as a normal year of price increases in unilever then that s how we re characterizing 2020 our model is that we want to see a good balance between volume and price and so far although we ve seen movements quarter to quarter for the last few years we ve continued to see that good balance between volume and price the latam question graeme why don t you expand on that a little bit graeme pitkethly chief financial officer yeah hi celine so argentina i said earlier brazil is about 40 i think of the latin american region whereas argentina is about 15 and year after year it gets smaller because obviously the value of the business in euros drops down first thing i mean a few years back our argentinian business was a eur2 billion business it was eur900 million last year and as we reset the exchange rates for this year it s only a eur600 million business for unilever so we had growth in argentina of almost 20 last year and that of course includes 26 of pricing the 2 per month non hyperinflationary component of pricing in a hyperinflationary environment if that makes sense but the important thing of course is what s happening to volume what s happening to share what s happening to margin so let me deconstruct that volume declines in argentina have slowed sequentially during the course of the year it s obviously still slightly negative given the scale of the economic challenges and the levels of inflation etc but we did have in q4 marginally positive volume growth in argentina which i think is a real turning point both for the economy and also for the business there markets still decline by the way double digit volumes so we ve got down to flat volumes in a market where volumes are declining double digit and that for us is the acid test of managing through a crisis it means we are gobbling up share people are staying with our brands we ve shifted our portfolio to be relative to a crisis stricken consumer as we do many times and we know that we re being competitive and profitable if we also look at our gross margin our margin is moving forward there so we re doing the right things pulling the right levers and one day argentina will be back and will be ever stronger i imagine richard williams executive vice president of investor relations okay thank you straight to james targett at berenberg go ahead james james targett berenberg analyst hi there morning two questions firstly could you talk a bit about how you might prioritize use of any capital released from the tea review especially in terms of m a versus or acquisitions versus buybacks and on potential acquisitions it sounds like asian skincare and vms is a number one priority and then secondly just coming back on the impactful innovation you mentioned as part of your five pillars of organic growth acceleration could you give us some color on the sort of the kill rate of the 30 or so new brands you ve launched internally over the last couple of years thanks alan jope chief executive officer okay thanks james look on capital allocation our first priority is always going to be to support the operating capital investments that we need to make to grow the business second call on that will be value creating acquisitions and you ve called out a couple of spaces that we are definitely interested in beyond that we have obviously used buybacks in an episodic way when we ve had an influx of capital at the moment i don t want to speculate on the outcome of the review because it might end up in something that generates a lot of cash but it might well not and so at this moment i don t want to be lured into a false assumption that this is necessarily a sale transaction that generates a whole lot of cash that we have to figure out what to do with so our capital allocation algorithm remains very similar going forward as it has been in the past your second question was on innovation yeah kill rate so let me just underscore the type of innovation that s doing well for us right now and i ll illustrate with three examples that sort of graeme hinted at but i want to pull them into more strategic themes the first is if you take our food business anything in the vegan space is doing very well at the moment and vegan mayonnaise vegan ice cream we really see that we re beating our business case on those types of innovations then beauty and personal care we see how important advanced technology is and so our dove product that works with your natural biome that s the bug colonies that are on your body to actually promote skin health that s using some pretty advanced technology and maybe even higher levels of technology is our we talked about our rexona clinicals range it truly a breakthrough in antiperspirant efficacy and then the third area is the whole issue of sustainability i think home care have moved fastest with things like our concentration agenda where we ll use much less plastic and really very quickly moving into high levels of use of recycled plastic and while i can t obviously talk right now about what s coming up specifically expect those themes of on trend advanced technology and eco innovation to pervade the innovation agenda going forward now as far as new brand kill rate i think we would declare right now about a third of them successful and sustainable a third of them where we will end up walking away and about a third of them we need to pivot and adjust the mix and see how they do and quite happy with that ratio with a couple of standouts that are really doing very well and we speak often about love beauty planet which is now love home planet over eur100 million business all incremental taking us into new channels and addressing a younger group so i would say think of it as a third a third a third for the time being richard williams executive vice president of investor relations okay thanks as i said we ll let the call run on a little bit longer to try and get there as many questions as we can so next question is from warren ackerman at barclays warren ackerman barclays analyst good morning alan graeme richard it s warren here at barclays two from me as well the first one is just coming back on beauty personal care growth was only 0 5 in the fourth quarter the lowest i think in about a decade you gave a lot of reasons on the call as to why it was weak could you maybe spell out for us what growth was in the quarter between the four subcategories of skin cleansing deos hair and oral and just your expectation for 2020 because when i look at the margin of the division it was up 70 bps to almost 23 in the year which is well ahead of and l oreal just wondering whether you and particularly sunny jain are comfortable with that balance between the margin and the top line because when i listen to what you re saying it kind of it sounds like you re saying it s mainly macro but is there just a competitiveness issue as well in beauty and personal care your biggest division and then secondly just on tea graeme could you just tell us what the sales and ebit are of that division please thank you graeme pitkethly chief financial officer do you want me to i ll take the first part on bpc and then you do the middle part and then we ll maybe come back on tea hello warren how are you doing so first thing maybe i can do for you is just bridge across and give you the particular bpc impact mix of the four factors that caught us in the fourth quarter so west africa had a big impact in bpc in two categories oral care and skin cleansing in particular north american hair we ve talked an awful lot about it but that obviously rolled into bpc and also and this links a little bit to celine s question on pricing in the fourth quarter is that we strongly adjusted our pricing in the business in skin cleansing in india in the fourth quarter now all of that rolls up into bpc and if you put all of that together warren that s about 180 basis points of impact from just those factors on the bpc business which bridges you across from the 0 5 much closer to the full year rate now i m not going to and i probably couldn t anyway look at the impact of all of that on the quarterly subcategories of bpc but i will give you the makeup for the full year recognizing that q4 was kind of exceptional and the full year was the full year but our skin care business grew at sort of mid single digits by 3 skin cleansing a little bit below that 2 percentage points deo had a very strong year as i said before at 6 prestige continues to crack out double digit performance in prestige beauty oral care which had a big impact of ghana nigeria at the end of the year was just 1 for the year and hair care overall was 2 percentage points for the year so that s the sort of mix of the subcategories in bpc alan jope chief executive officer graeme you re being unusually transparent on that but i think it s important that we re explicit on just how well prestige and deos are doing skin care coming in nicely and the impact that some of the specific challenges that we ve called out had on things like hair and oral and skin cleansing as far as tea is concerned warren let me say that it s a eur2 9 billion business it has been significantly dilutive on growth through unilever for 10 years as best we can see and the truth is we don t know the full ebit margin until we do the strategic review but as best we can tell it is slightly dilutive to unilever graeme pitkethly chief financial officer because of alan jope chief executive officer shared costs graeme pitkethly chief financial officer because of shared costs and allocations and spreads parameters and however the strategy of what it is we re looking at comes together that s the reason for that richard williams executive vice president of investor relations okay thanks okay now to david hayes at socgen go on david hello david are you still there are you on mute okay let s try chris pitcher at redburn are you still there chris chris pitcher redburn analyst yes i am thank you very much a quick question just on the timing of the tea strategic review and your broader m a strategy and the reason for saying that is obviously tea is a big business in india and the middle east and it appears to be sort of the low point in the cycle there and can you give us evidence of how you ve tried to make it grow as the category leader in terms of incremental investment over that 10 years that means you think it isn t achievable the reason i say that is that you talk about keeping dressings because of its vegan potential and if i look at upfield s website they re making a big thing about the growth from vegan and plant based food and i just worry slightly the timing of disposals isn t perhaps creating maximum value and secondly on that have you discussed obviously with hindustan unilever because in terms of unrecovered costs that would have quite a significant impact on that business thanks alan jope chief executive officer okay first let me say that in the tea market and you re really talking about sort of consumer trends there s a really quite dramatic shift from black tea to initially green tea and now we re seeing more and more herbal teas and infusions and we ve done a lot of work to add that leg to the portfolio both inorganically within the brands that we had but also by building in some new brands that we ve acquired but the harsh reality is that two thirds of our tea business remains core black tea which is declining and we have really seen this trend play out it s not a short term thing it s a long term trend over a decade we ve had a lot of good effort at getting the core black tea back to growth but we just don t see it happening and you ve referred back to our spreads business and upfield we stay closely involved with upfield partly through the transition service agreements that we built with them and they re very open with how that business is doing and suffice to say they ve pulled various levers to get the growth improved from where it was but it would still be massively dilutive to unilever even with the good efforts that they re putting in secondarily we believe we got outstanding value from that transaction we more than covered the retention value and we think it was a very very good thing for our shareholders both top line and earnings impact and in many ways tea falls into a similar camp and so we re going to do a full review to see if there are ways to unlock value that would include different ways of organizing the business partnerships different ownership structures i don t want to presuppose that the outcome will get an exact mirror image of our spreads business richard williams executive vice president of investor relations okay i think we have david hayes back on the line david do you want to go with your question david hayes societe generale analyst i m trying again there was a technical issue can you hear me now alan jope chief executive officer yeah we can graeme pitkethly chief financial officer hi david david hayes societe generale analyst hi thank you so two for me firstly back to tea i mean in november this was obviously speculated on as a review process i think you alan and couple of the execs were on record saying we ve got no interest in selling these brands and that we can we re the best owners and we can make it work better i guess the questions are one why did that change and when did that change and secondly what is it that another owner from bringing to those brands at unilever as the owner cannot achieve which means they can get more value and cover tax leakage and so forth and the second question is just on innovation you talked about being heightened brand awareness availability being heightened purposefulness as well but that all sounds more expensive to achieve i guess the two questions related to that what you re one is it more expensive to compete than it was when you thought it was going to be maybe two or three years ago and then if that is the case where is it that you re seeing that offset which means the margin commitment is still there i know you ve kind of addressed it in pieces through the call but just trying to understand it it feels more expensive to be effective and to get the growth so why is that margin commitment not having this year thanks so much alan jope chief executive officer thanks for the question so first of all we initiated the strategic review of our portfolio in november and at the time there were immediately quite public speculation on multiple different parts of the business including tea and what we said at the time was we have no plans to sell tea and we didn t go as far as you indicate in terms of declaring our eternal undying love for the category so we just basically we get these speculative rumors all the time we quash them and now that we are initiating a strategic review we have been very open about it so please count that when we re doing when we re thinking about these things we ll communicate transparently secondly in describing the five growth fundamentals what i was trying to do is lay out a very important growth lever for us which is just execution getting the basics operating at a very very high level we often spend a lot of time talking about portfolio change as the unlock for everything but actually the easiest growth for us to unlock is just a step up in executing on things like product quality availability quality of advertising distribution and so on and that s what the five growth fundamentals are all about finally on your point around is it going to be more expensive to compete there are pockets in the world where we run into a stepped up cost to compete so we ran into simultaneously in three places in north america in the middle of last year where the heat went up in dressings the heat went up in hair and the heat went up in ice cream and we reinvested back immediately i think at an aggregate level in fact we know for a fact high quality innovation is a more efficient thing to spend against the two areas where we get the biggest bang for our buck is really motivating purposefully brand communication and when we have genuine product news in the form of innovation actually those are a multiplier on the effectiveness of our spend and don t require an increment in our spending graeme pitkethly chief financial officer can i use the opportunity to drill in a wee bit to this the change in the cost to compete alan jope chief executive officer yeah graeme pitkethly chief financial officer because it s the nature of the competition that s really changing much more so than the cost and i think we need to appreciate the extent to which the overall cost base of the company is changing now there s obvious stuff here if you go back to unilever of decades ago like all large companies a bit fat and happy and the sort of zbb opportunity comes in just to get normal productivity and cost discipline in place and that continues to go forward if you take things like 5s and the ability to run technology through the supply chain the ability to run e auctions on raw materials that starts to provide pools of cost shift around the business and then you think about erp you think about the application of analytics and rpa across the business it s really important that we invest to get ourselves on the technology curve a simple platform so that we can continue to get the technology cost dividend going forward and then most fundamentally and there s always the vexed question of percentage bmi or absolute bmi but if you go within that we ve built 38 digital hubs and 38 in unilever at huge cost sitting in the overheads line but at total cost which is 30 cheaper than buying in that service outside we ve got 30 people data centers again we staffed those up and that sits in overheads there are many areas david where just looking line by line on the traditional consumer p l below the surface lots and lots has changed and i think the message is that there s lots and lots of opportunity to be able to generate the fuel to continue to invest in making sure that you are successful in growing your business but the mix of doing that is quite dynamic richard williams executive vice president of investor relations okay we can take one last question i know we ve run over even an extended time but we ll take one last question we still haven t got everybody so alan erskine at credit suisse alan do you want to squeeze in a last question alan erskine credit suisse analyst oh yeah good morning guys thank you for that i mean just two very quick ones one you mentioned that prestige beauty grew double digit i think in the year could you broaden that and then tell us what the acquisitions that you ve made since 2015 in aggregate what the like for like sales growth for those were in the year and then my second question is going back to an earlier question at the capital markets day i got the impression that share buybacks were going forward would be a sort of recurring part of your earnings algorithm your net debt to ebitda at year end was below 2 so i guess i was a little surprised you didn t announce a buyback this morning could you talk through maybe where i got that wrong alan jope chief executive officer why don t i take that first question graeme and you can talk about the capital allocation so i m going to give you an uncharacteristic level of transparency on our prestige business the biggest brand that we ve bought there is dermalogica and we ve seen really an extraordinary had not grown for four years when we acquired it and it s now growing high single digits it s really been an extraordinary step up then we ve got some brands that are delivering super growth which are things like hourglass living proof and ren and we acquired two brands last year garancia and tatcha both growing well into double digits murad has been more of a struggle but actually when you put it all together it s a very strong picture and remember we re getting 10 growth plus out of prestige that has largely a north american european footprint so this is not like for like with businesses that have got a strong asian footprint for prestige and that remains really a big opportunity to strengthen our luxury beauty in asia and in travel retail notwithstanding the current coronavirus but i know your question really was around the total impact of m a and we ve been seeing that we get about a total of 70 basis points accretion from a combination of acquisitions and disposals and i think i d be being less than honest if i didn t say that when you look beyond prestige skin and when you look beyond our vitamins minerals and supplements we ve got several of the acquired businesses where we re falling short of the business case and we re having to make interventions to step up the performance there so it s kind of a balanced picture the bright spot is definitely prestige and the vitamin minerals and supplements businesses several of the others are on plan and a couple that come off plan graeme do you want to talk about capital graeme pitkethly chief financial officer yes sure i mean alan i think what we re hoping at the capital markets day is to be really clear on the kind of capital allocation priorities and framework in the company which we think is very tight and we just wanted to be clear on that alan said earlier philosophically perhaps in the past we ve been episodic with regard to share buybacks and we wanted to be clear that we view it as a part of our capital allocation framework and a perfectly valid method of shareholder return etc i hope it didn t create the impression though that we were going to come forward in the first quarter with a plan obviously the biggest factor because our cash flow is good and strong and we re confident in the delivery of the shape of the p l etc the biggest determinant is the balance of acquisition and disposal obviously the announcement today we think there might be more of a bias toward disposal and as alan said acquisitions are likely to be more focused than they have been in the past and perhaps a slower rate of maybe slightly larger transactions if we can do that but it s assessing that balance of acquisition and disposal that s important typically at this point in the year we don t have that same degree of visibility over the year so it s really just too early to say and obviously we don t want to do something that is frequent and small we d rather do something that was more important and please remember that we still got horlicks to close out in the first quarter of this year so that s in our acquisition and disposal pipeline and funnel as well alan jope chief executive officer okay thank you alan thank you graeme we re going to have to close there thanks everybody for staying with us overtime we tried to get as many questions as we could we still have a few questions we haven t answered so sorry about that but please call us in the ir team and we ll get back to you as soon as we can so thanks everybody and let s close the call thank you graeme pitkethly chief financial officer thank you bye alan jope chief

the san diego union tribune editorial board interviewed four candidates in the 53rd congressional district race ahead of the march 3 2020 primary election in which the top two vote getters will advance to a runoff election in november below is the transcript of our dec 10 2019 interview with democrat sara jacobs who is running to succeed susan davis in a district that includes western el cajon eastern chula vista parts of central and eastern san diego as well as bonita la mesa lemon grove and spring valley this interview was transcribed using the digital transcription service temi and checked for accuracy by a staffer to call any errors to our attention or to ask any questions about our interviews please email matthew hall sduniontribune com with the subject line election interviews union tribune thanks for joining us today tell us why you re running once again for congress advertisement sara jacobs of course it s great to be here with you all thank you for taking the time so as you all know i m a third generation san diego born and raised went to local public schools and then worked at the state department in the obama administration worked at the at unicef uh and then was the ceo of an international education nonprofit before coming back home uh running for congress last cycle as you all know losing by 1 actually won the san diego county part of the district uh and for the past year uh i ve been working as a scholar in residence at the university of san diego s kroc school of peace studies uh and uh setting up and chairing a county wide initiative to end child poverty here in san diego county uh which will be formally launching in the new year uh and honestly i didn t think i would run for congress again uh i was happy living the more academic lifestyle working uh to on issues that i cared about uh but when susan davis announced her retirement i felt that it was important that i step up again um because we re going to be losing 20 years of seniority and uh regardless of who wins the presidency in 2020 although i hope it s not donald trump uh and uh the we know that this next legislative cycle is going to be a big one we re going to be passing big generation changing legislation and i think it s really important that our region has someone who s worked on making an implementing federal policy before and to make sure that we re well represented in that first two year period that we know is going to be a really important meet the other candidates in this race below opinion meet the candidates for the 53rd congressional district the candidates we interviews for the 53rd congressional district are jose caballero sara jacobs georgette gomez and janessa goldbeck q you say you support the green new deal what does that mean a it s a great question so i support a green new deal because i believe that climate change is an urgent threat and that we need to be tackling it with the urgency that it requires uh which means that we need to be having a whole of government whole of set society mobilization to address it now the green new deal resolution is a nonbinding resolution uh so to me what a green new deal would look like what we need to do is work on uh transitioning our economy to an entire clean energy entirely clean energy economy uh by 2030 uh and as we re doing that starting with the most polluting sources of energy first always centering communities that are are already feeling the effects of climate change right now and doing it in a way that protects and mitigates the damages that it could have on our workers uh i also think we know that even looking uh even if we are able to reach the levels that we set out in the paris climate accord that that won t be enough to mitigate the worst uh parts of climate change and so we also need to be looking at what other kinds of innovations what other kinds of investments we need to be making uh looking at how we can supplement our transition to a clean energy economy with direct air capture with other types of solutions so that we have all of the different pieces where we re trying to prevent more carbon from being emitted we re trying to limit the carbon that is already emitted uh and make sure that we re doing everything we can in an equitable way to mitigate the consequences what we need to do is work on transitioning our economy to an entirely clean energy economy by 2030 sara jacobs q economists say that the green new deal never addresses the immense cost and how hard it would be on poor people and that s a criticism of california out of all the environmental things we do in california we need the higher costs for housing and other things like that so how do you how do you finesse it a so to me i think in a lot of these questions we are asking a false question we re asking the green new deal or some status quo where things aren t getting worse but that s not the reality we re living in the reality we re living in is the cost of not acting is much higher than the cost of acting so do we need to make sure that we design it in the right way in an equitable way so that we re not unfairly burdening um people who are experiencing poverty not unfairly burdening middle class people yes but i think it s a false dichotomy to say that the cost of acting is too high because the cost of not acting is so much higher i mean i m a millennial i m a lot of my friends are not having kids because they don t think there s a world that they can leave their kids to live in a i would like to have kids one day i would like there to be a world that they can live in a i would like my grandkids to be able to live in a world too q but even though green even though most people acknowledge this is an existential threat in europe the response when people are actually asked to sacrifice was not entirely positive so the idea is you ve got the you know you ve got the twitterati behind you you ve got the scientists behind you you ve got most people educated bewind you but the public has never shown any appetite for sacrifice on this issue a uh i think like in all public policy how you implement it is as important as anything else so i think what you re referencing is the strikes in france the yellow vest strikes um that was because it was a highly progressive way of implementing a carbon tax um there are ways you can do this that are less regressive that that make uh individual people feel less especially in the middle and lower income spectrum and so a lot of this does come down to how we do it what exactly are we putting in place how do we make sure that we re not doing carbon pricing in a way that is uh unduly impacting our lowest and middle income families um and i think we re really seeing a change in public perception because of young people uh i was at san diego state for the climate walkout that the young people uh led and uh it s incredible to see the amount of passion and urgency that young people feel on this issue um because we are the ones who are going to be living with the consequences of not if we don t act now um and i do think that that is starting to change the perception of everyone much like we ve seen how young people have changed how we uh are thinking about gun violence prevention much how we ve seen frankly that throughout history it s been young people who have led change on civil rights on lgbtq plus rights q if you buy the theory that money drives the world then last week we saw the motley fool recommend people buy exxon mobil that s a pretty stunning thing given that the state of california is telling its pension agencies not to invest anymore in energy companies because it s allegedly worried about their health so i don t know it just seems like there s a difference between what s achievable and what s being touted a but i think that s an exactly perfect example we have a market failure right now because the externalities that are uh uh in line with exxon s business model are not being priced into exxon stock or not being priced in to their business model whereas if we were able to find a way to actually have the externalities be part of the way people are thinking about this then it is uh it is actually going to change the way people invest i mean uh if you think about it there s there s a whole field of investors now who are pushing for environmental social and governance focused investment and what they will often say is that there is no such thing as an investment that doesn t have an impact it s that the impact is either positive negative or neutral and right now we count negative and neutral as no as no impact so what we really need to be doing is actually creating the way that we evaluate this in a more holistic way so that we are pricing in those externalities and looking at the full range of impact that any investment will have q let me ask you this in your concession speech to mike levin last time around you listed what are the main issues in the district i m going to read them back to you and see which ones you think are the big issues in this district um at the time you said medicare for all protecting woman s right to choose protecting our environment fighting for quality public education and criminal justice reform standing up to the nra and getting corporate money out of politics is that list different in this other district a uh i wouldn t say it s different those are definitely priorities of people um in talking to voters across this district there ve been some clear themes that have emerged um climate change and the urgent threat it poses is one that we hear a lot especially from young people uh the gun violence uh i cannot tell you the horrific stories i hear from young people who are absolutely terrified to go to school parents who don t want to send their kids to school uh and it s a solvable problem in that for a lot of these uh these policy initiatives we actually have 94 of americans support universal background checks so we can do something and lastly we know um we know here in san diego families are facing a high cost of living um healthcare is a component of that uh but also uh this uh in this district hear a lot about uh the need for uh housing that s affordable and uh frankly something i hear from everybody is the need for affordable childcare and early childhood education the setting sun is reflected in the windows of the u s capitol on capitol hill ap q how so where do you stand on medicare for all we had ammar campa najjar in here yesterday who said when he ran two years ago he was a supportive of that and since then he s put out his own policy proposal on it a so i support medicare for all uh i think health care is a human right and i think we need to be doing everything we can to get universal coverage um i ve lived in countries around the world i ve studied countries around the world it s clear that in every country that has uh uh a way to get to universal coverage it s because of a strong public role in the health care sector uh i know that conservatives like to talk about the singapore model i actually think the singapore model shows more than anything else how strong of a government role you actually need to make a universal coverage system work um so i think that medicare for all is the best way to get uh to universal coverage now i know we have about four or five different medicare for all plans right now um that are all called medicare for all um there are parts i like about some parts i don t like about others i think if i were to design a transition i would do it a little bit differently than some of the leading plans but i think what s important is that we are not just thinking about the cost of medicare for all vis a vis again the status quo but the cost of medicare for all versus the cost of what our health care system is actually costing us now um because it s costing so much more for us to have to deliver emergency services instead of basic preventative care um not to mention the fact that uh we have a public health threat we ve seen it here in san diego if our most vulnerable populations are not getting the vaccinations are not getting the basic health care that they need the rest of us are more susceptible to pandemic health threats and to epidemics and so we can t be evaluating it on price per price we have to really be looking holistically at the costs across the board and and i think on that level medicare for all um makes the most sense q in 2009 polls showed that more than 70 of americans are satisfied with their health care then congress went ahead and obama went ahead and signed affordable care act and they lost 63 seats in 2010 and so you see polls now and they show people in the mid sixties support the present system so is the are democrats proceeding an appetite for something that the public doesn t broadly share a i don t think that s right because what i ve seen in all these different polls is that how you ask the question changes the response and so people are happy with their health care now if you told them that they wouldn t have to pay a premium they d be happier with that um medicare for all is very popular most people don t know what it means so i think that uh part of being a leader is actually not only going by what the polls tell you but you know leading the polls guiding the poll saying what is the world we want to live in and then figuring out the best way to get us there but always staying true to that where do we want to go instead of being so susceptible to these changes in in um public perception that are really about the tactics of how to get there not about where we re trying to go q well what s interesting about elizabeth warren s plan when she says we have to be in a private insurance she says we ll never have enough money to make the system work unless we ban private insurance and that is a hugely unpopular idea among americans so i don t know if you ve got an easy path to this a well like i said there are parts of all of the different plans that i like some i don t like we ve seen actually that in a lot of countries you don t have to ban private insurance now what s interesting is in the medicare for all plan that warren and sanders and pramila jayapal in the house are pushing you would have no need for private health insurance because everything is covered there s no cost at point of service and there s no premiums so it would in essence get rid of private insurance even if you didn t formally ban it but what we see in other countries even the uk which is often a model um in france there s a strong single payer health care system with private health insurance the same in australia um taiwan exactly so we have models where you can make it work uh and i think we need to be taking the best practices from other countries um you know taiwan was the most recent country to transition to a medic to a single payer system um and so there s also a lot we can learn in their transition q yeah you know i was thinking about this a little bit uh yesterday we saw the sale of the local biotech think it s 2 5 billion on solid tumor treatment so this is like 600 000 people die of cancer every year so here s one drug incremental in one company it s two and a half billion dollars you start to get a sense oh the numbers around health care are tremendous and so like if we change the other end medicare for all okay pretty good idea the changes upstream are huge for san diego huge for the pharma industry huge for innovate so like all of that would have to go away i mean have you thought through that end a you bet i have um so we know that biotech is a big industry here in san diego um and uh we know that uh drug innovation is very important that it has extended lives that it s cured drug uh cure diseases that we ve have more better preventative vaccines um i actually uh on the clinton campaign was uh her advisor for uh public health and global public health during the zika uh epidemic so we were looking at what kinds of investments we can make to help us speed up a zika vaccine and treatment options so i actually think though that so much of the money for innovation in the biotech industry is not coming from the prices that we pay for prescription drugs and and i ll tell you why big pharmaceutical companies spend more money on marketing than they do on r and d uh and we re one of only two countries around the world that allow our pharmaceutical companies to market directly to consumers so first of all i think we should get rid of that which also frees up some funding for them to put into r and d but if you really look at most of the big important uh uh pharmaceutical innovations almost all of them or all of them i can t think of an exception right now we re based on uh basic science research that was funded by the u s government funded by nih and when you talk to biotech people in san diego which i ve done what they ll tell you is that the small biotech companies absorb all of the risk in r and d and it s only after they ve developed something that s worked gone through the fda process that big pharma comes in and buys it so we there s a lot that we can do to help make sure that those companies that are actually doing the innovation and the r and d um can have access to the capital they need that we re funding the nih that we re making sure that we have this basic science research that we know is so important into that pipeline um and frankly there are some things we can do actually one of the very few things i agree with the trump administration on is uh some of the things they ve done to modernize the fda process to make it uh faster to get uh some of these uh things to market even without sacrificing uh safety concerns so i would argue you don t actually need to get rid of innovation to be able to make healthcare more accessible and affordable one of the very few things i agree with the trump administration on is some of the things they ve done to modernize the fda process to make it faster to get some of these things to market even without sacrificing safety concerns sara jacobs q most of the candidates that have come in so far have listed homelessness as their first or second priority i m wondering where you stand on what the solution is the president has made some uh statements that you d like to see the federal government get more involved if that were the case what form would that take a so we know uh homelessness is a big issue here uh we have the fourth largest homeless population in the country uh and actually though we are only about 20th in terms of the funding we get from the department of housing and urban development uh and that s mostly because of the what has it what homelessness looks like here is not what the federal definition of homelessness is so first i would work with other members of our san diego delegation who i know are already thinking about how we can work with the department of housing and urban development to modernize their funding formula so that we re actually getting the funding comensurate with uh the challenge that we re facing uh in addition to that i think there is more we can do at the federal government level to prevent homelessness um i think we need federal grants to make sure that people have access to council in eviction courts um in this in the city of new york they piloted letting their public defenders um defend people in eviction court and it reduced the rate of eviction uh by a large amount with a very low cost to the government actually and we know that if you can prevent someone becoming homeless that s much easier than working to get them rehoused once they do become homeless um once they do experience homelessness uh and uh grant money so that in those eviction courts the judges can give out other uh other forms of grant assistance as needed to prevent uh people becoming homeless um we also know that we need more housing here in uh san diego and in california um and uh especially on the low and middle income spectrum uh and so you know i support a rental tax credit rental tax deduction so that we re not unduly burdening people who rent in the tax code it s similar to the mortgage tax deduction but for your rental income as well not income from rental payments as well um i also think the federal government needs to put more into the uh housing trust fund need to increase funding for the capital magnet fund which helps leverage public dollars to get more private investment and then of course expanding uh the low income housing tax credit and making it work again given that in the republican tax bill because they changed corporate tax structure at the low income housing tax credit is not actually working as intended at this moment um so we can do all of that to build out more access to housing prevent people from becoming homeless uh to begin with with these um preventative methods and then of course we know that there will always be some part of the homeless population that are chronically homeless that need um better and more access to mental health services better and more access to addiction treatment and that i believe we can build out through our health care reform um at the federal level uh we can do a lot more in terms of veterans homelessness we know the obama administration had um almost gotten to functional zero with their plan on veterans homelessness and so working to continue and build up uh what the obama administration was doing and make sure the va is providing those preventative services and uh has money for rapid rehousing and has the mental health treatment that we know so many veterans are in need q in 2015 jerry brown ridiculed the idea that housing programs would ever solve the housing crisis he said the only way we re ever going to do it is to massively increase housing stock do you buy that a it s clear we need more housing stock um the the issue is we need more housing stock across the income spectrum so i think what we need to do is make sure that we are expanding housing but expanding it in a way that it s not resulting in a bunch of empty condos sitting luxury condo sitting you know right around here but actually in a way that actually provides housing that we know families need so that means just more building um but it also means making sure we re expanding this low income housing tax credit so that builders can find a way to in the private market build housing for people at you know 50 to below of the medium income uh and then one of uh one of the areas that hasn t gotten funded as much lately because of what happened in 2009 is this capital magnet fund but it had historically been very effective in leveraging public dollars to get more private building which we know is the only way we ll really be able to get to the scale that we need q if we follow the best practices you mentioned best practices earlier in uh tokyo they have huge apartment buildings in which people share bathrooms and kitchens inexpensive and a great way for young professionals in japan and in the united kingdom of prefab housing is now 15 or more on the market because it s so much better as sturdier than it used to be if you re in california despite all the crisis we re not copying what s worked elsewhere it just seems to me like is there solutions out there to this terrible problem if we just copy what other nations have done but i talked to people in sacramento and they say well no construction you will never let that happen here in california so it just feels like immensely frustrating it s what other countries are doing works and yet we re not pursuing it here what s your take a uh well my take is that uh well first of all i m a millennial so i actually have some friends who live in those kinds of uh units where you re sharing a bathroom sharing uh kitchens and they quite enjoy it it sounds actually kind of delightful to me i think the point is that that can t be something we impose on everyone that it s clearly not what most families here in san diego are looking for um but i think it is clear we need to learn from best practices uh actually on veteran s homelessness um in uh kansas city uh they ve used uh prefab housing uh to create small homes for veterans who are experiencing homelessness and it s been very successful and they re working on expanding that out nationally and i think that s something we should consider here now all that being said at the federal level what we can mostly do is make sure that we have federal dollars that we can leverage for private building um make sure that we are providing a relief to low income people who need it by changing the tax code so that people who are renting are not unduly burdened um and there have been some small pilots where actually the federal government is paying some of the fees uh for uh you know development fees other some of the infrastructure needs um so that you could minimize the cost to builders for low income housing so that might be something we want to explore as well in addition to the fact that we need to pass an infrastructure bill so that we have infrastructure dollars going into the kinds of new things we know that we need um because you know we have older infrastructure here in san diego we need to be able to modernize that to really be able to uh uh have people living in more dense more dense conditions a homeless man sleeps on the sidewalk in downtown san diego on dec 16 2019 k c alfred the san diego union tribune q trump and congress agreed on a budget with a trillion dollar deficit yeah continuing on continuing america on the pace towards a day when interest on the debt will be the third biggest item of the budget after entitlements and the military that s not sustainable so what taxes would you raise to pay for the programs you want to add a uh so uh i agree it s unsustainable and i was not in favor of the republican tax bill that raised our deficit without doing anything in my view to grow our economy let alone everything it did to hurt uh families here in san diego so you know i think we need to reverse some of the most harmful provisions in the republican tax bill uh i agree that we should have lowered corporate tax rates i think we lowered them too far and we can only lower them if we re also closing the loophole so that we re actually getting the tax revenue that we should be getting uh and i think on the uh personal income side that we need to raise the highest marginal tax rate um i think we need to make sure we have a tax code that values the hard work of people more than passive capital accumulation and so i think capital gains should be the same rate as the highest marginal tax rate um i think we should raise the estate tax i realize it s not in my own personal best interest i still think we should raise the estate tax um and i think we should close some other loopholes like the carried interest loophole that allow uh money managers to pay a lower tax rate uh that would also be fixed by raising the capital gains tax rate um and i think we should look at new new some new things we can do like a financial transaction tax that uh will be good for two reasons it will raise revenue it will uh make it harder to do some of the high speed trading that creates increased volatility in our stock market and uh europe has already implemented it so we know that it s possible q in 2001 david cay johnson of the new york times wrote a book that says that the amount of taxes that rich people pay is now a function of the quality of their tax lawyer isn t the answer just a much simpler tax system that makes it much easier to see who owes what and to make it much harder for people to use tax lawyers to get out of paying money and this didn t happen under the obama administration it s not just the problem under republican presidents yeah there was no progress on this front under obama a that s true so um i have uh a very specific philosophy of governing um and one piece of this philosophy uh is that complexity favors the wealthy and well connected because they are the only ones who have the lawyers who are able to identify so one of the things we need to do to make everything more equitable is actually to simplify and make in plain english a lot of these regulations and taxes that was one of i think the best innovations in the consumer fnancial protection bureau that the regulations that they are enforcing are relatively easily understandable so the average person knows what they re eligible for and what they can claim um so i agree we do need to simplify and a lot of that is in closing these loopholes where the republican tax bill actually made more loopholes um i also think it s important to note though that it s not just a question of the tax law itself it s also enforcement so propublica did a very uh big study on uh the irs enforcement and it showed that the irs spends a lot more money uh enforcing small infractions of families who accidentally filed for the earned income tax credit than any sort of uh large scale tax evasion um by corporations by individual people who are high net worth and that as eh irs enforcement funding increased it increased the funding that they spent in forcing small infractions on low and middle income families so we also need to reframe how we do enforcement focusing more on these bigger tax evaders um and uh ensuring that we re not penalizing families who are trying to claim uh what they think they re eligible for but in the complexity make small mistakes and that will require oversight from congress to make sure that s how the irs is implementing their enforcement q sara what do you make of the uh some of these debt forgiveness conversations like i ve sort of seen and it s a little bit on both sides like remember trump early on said let let s default let s not pay back which seemed to preposterous a for the federal government q both like both sides right so now but on the other side you see okay student loans it s like it s never going to get paid let s just default it all out so it s like we re sort of moving into this era where there s a new conversation where it seems like the debt is so large there really isn t a path to paying it back by anybody so as a federal candidate what what s your take on all what do we what kind of era are we getting into and what should we do a so i will separate out the student loan question from the deficit and federal debt question on that i think there are a revenue raisers that seem to me to be common sense uh like reversing some of these things in the republican tax plan closing loopholes um et cetera and i think it s clear that we need to really be thinking about the kinds of investments we need to make to be growing our economy in the future and what that looks like in terms of how that uh what the long term horizon is for our tax base um so harvard uh just did a study of i think something like a hundred public policy interventions uh and what they and they scored them all based on how uh how much revenue they uh regenerated for the government so basically uh how revenue neutral they were and what it showed on average was that investments in the early part of a child s life are the best bang for your buck you actually have uh you raise more money from the increased uh wages of those children as they grow up then you spend on any of that programming and yet we re cutting those that funding at the federal level so it s not just a question of looking at the snapshot that is our federal government right now but really looking at what kinds of investments we need to be making that will set us up towards a path for a better future i think it s clear that we need to really be thinking about the kinds of investments we need to make to be growing our economy in the future and what that looks like in terms of what the long term horizon is for our tax base sara jacobs q tell me about the student loan how does that philosophy apply there a so on student loans um i am of the generation that holds about one point 3 trillion worth of student loans my friends are not buying houses they re not starting companies they re not making investments they are working and paying off their student loan debt and barely getting by um and that is a drag on our economy it really is it s a huge drag on our economy now i personally believe that with limited federal dollars that it s not the most progressive way to address the crisis by just blanketly forgiving all loans uh all debt and i think there s a lot more we need to do to address the student loan debt crisis uh including making it dischargeable in bankruptcy um because right now it s not so even if you go bankrupt for other reasons you can t discharge your student loans i think that will go far for a lot of people um i also think we need to vastly expand uh the public service forgiveness program we know that there are industries that we need more people going into like teaching like nursing uh like home health care work like you know other public service uh and i think we should expand it so that we are doing uh mass amounts of public loan uh public service loan forgiveness way more than we re doing right now and making it simpler um again back to this simple question right now every year you have to recertify how much money you make um for the uh income based repayment for this public service loan forgiveness program and yet the irs actually knows how much money you make because you pay taxes every year so we can simplify some of that as well to make it easier for people to have access to the programs that they re eligible for and then the group of people who are actually most impacted by uh the student loan crisis are a very small group of people who who actually hold small amounts of debt and it s a small amount of debt because they re the people who started a college or university and never finished so they have the burden of the debt but without the benefit in their earnings and for those people i do think we need a very targeted approach to uh to forgive their debt to have programs that encourage them to finish their degree and to crack down on the for profit institutions that are really preying on our vulnerable members of our society to incur this debt without any sort of wage earning benefit at the end q you talked about early childhood benefit interventions the research on this field is all over the place there s plenty of people who don t think head start works at all meanwhile there s the woman scholar who won the genius grant about 10 years ago she said the kindergarten teacher is the third or in some cases the second most important adult in life and that they should be paid 200 000 a year now it just seems to me like if we have a rational society organized around interesting and thoughtful ways to run things we would do that we wouldn t have head start programs that don t necessarily work we would pay kindergarten teachers a ton so i see no movement on this it s just like we accept the status quo and we treat the 10th grade gym teacher the same way we treat the kindergarten teacher it just doesn t make sense a yeah uh well i never never settled for the status quo i think actually one of the reasons i am running is because we need a new generation of leaders who is questioning why we re doing things the same way they ve always been done and looking for new solutions um my understanding of the research is there is some research that shows that uh there have not been as many benefits on a head start if you look only at head start to the third grade reading level um but if you actually continue and do a 10 year horizon the benefits come back in terms of uh behavioral differences um so you see less punishments of people who were in head start programs and not in head start programs uh at the i believe it s the 10th grade year but don t quote me on that what we re on the record but you know um and uh and that if you actually look at the research on early childhood education that one of the most important factors on whether or not you see increases in the third grade reading level is the transition from uh the early childhood education to kindergarten that if you do it in a way where the kindergarten teacher uh has talked to the early childhood educator has us has information on how they did in the early childhood program that then you actually do see higher levels of achievement in the third grade reading level so i agree with you i think that the early time of a child s life is uh incredibly important uh i think we should be having a universal pre k um i think that we should be paying our early childhood uh educators at the same level of as kindergarten teachers and boost all of excuse me boost all of their pay um and we know that a lot of the most vulnerable children are actually in home based care uh which uh we know the quality tends to be lower so we in addition to increasing head start increasing early head start working on figuring out ways to have it be more tied in with the schools so the kindergarten teachers are having the uh the handoff that makes it uh more impactful uh that we need to be working on programs for these in home providers making it easy easier for them to get training making it easier for us to ensure that they have high quality care in these um in home providers as well q under early child care one of your proposals is federal leave for any family who spends more than 10 of its income up front do you know universally what that dollar amount is and how would you pay a there s no exact dollar amount and actually the newest legislation that s come out of the senate uh has a goal of 7 so maybe i m behind the times on this um but basically what i hear from families is that they are paying right now upwards of 30 of their income on child care and that s even if they can find child care i was talking to a family in south park just last week who was telling me that you know they they would ve paid anything they could not find an open child care slot um and i know you all here in downtown are facing uh similar challenges um so in my mind um we need to have a a real focus on making sure that there s both access and affordability now i know you asked about the dollar amount one of the interesting things about childcare is that it can if you implement it right be relatively revenue neutral when the city of quebec i m sorry the state of quebec implemented universal childcare uh this is actually where some of those studies came from on the quality question um when the state of quebec instituted universal childcare they actually ended up making more money in increased uh labor force participation and therefore increased taxation than they spent on subsidizing and providing childcare so uh i think that it s something that we can do in a relatively revenue neutral way ensuring high quality uh and that will have huge payoffs down the road because of the increased uh wage earnings of kids who receive quality early childhood education q you talked earlier about the money california isn t getting for the homeless there s a lot of places where california isn t getting money from the federal government and part of that is blamed on the relationship that the federal government has with the state of california should california be doing a better job of being more friendly to the federal government or should they stand out as a beacon of uh how to stand up to the federal government a this particular federal government i believe that uh i m very in favor of what our governor and our state has done to really show that you don t need to have this politics of divisiveness to still have a growing economy uh we know here in california that our diversity is our strength um and that and i really do think that what we re doing here in california to really uphold our values as california and support frankly our values as americans is very important um and that that federalism is very important um it s true that the trump administration is punishing california for that um but i think it s it s really important that we we stand up to the trump administration and some of the really horrific things they re doing to californians q here s kind of an off the wall question a great q we talk about fake news and we talked about it from most false narratives and so now this year we ve witnessed the public health establishment invent invent a crisis over vaping it s an adulterated product and instead they use that to indict the entire thing even though we ve had vaping across the world for 15 years they are lying to us with their campaigns that go on the air and say vaping kills people no adulterated products kill people so should the government lie to us for our own good q are you a vaper q no i m an advocate for the public health establishment lied to us for years a sounds like you re going to miss duncan hunter king of vapers in congress q i just it s just shocking when adulterated products come along you don t ban the adulterated product you go after the adulterated products and here we have a public health establishment that s revved up to banner product but has been used by people for 15 years it s just like lying in real time a so i have not read the studies that show that vaping is not doing these things so i cannot speak to that q the cdc put out the report last week that said every single case was linked to adulterated products a i will read that and get back to you on the broader question um i actually think that one of the biggest crises facing our country is that we have lost trust in institutions and in leaders uh and that we don t have unifying institutions that can bring us together and that we don t trust the information that comes to us whether it s from the government or from a new source or from quote fake news um and i think there s a lot we need to do to fix that um should government lie to people absolutely not um should we be q i think afghanistan would have been a better example a yeah the afghanistan papers um those were quite eyeopening and i worked on uh some of that so they were still eye opening um i think there s lot we need to do to regulate um information and especially social media uh honestly uh one of the reasons i m running is because i cannot watch another congressional hearing with a bunch of people asking mark zuckerberg questions who have never used such tools before in their life i mean it s just not the way you should be making policy um i i grew up in the generation that is the digital natives um i ve had facebook since i was in high school um and so uh i do think we need to be doing more on that uh and there s a lot of interesting proposals uh some that passed in hr 1 in terms of disclosure and transparency i think we can go even further and really try and push to make sure that we are again building in the external externalities and costs into those business models themselves so that data is not considered this sort of like easy commodity um and i think there s a lot that we need to do to rebuild trust in institutions and in government um and i believe that it s always better for someone to trust me then agree with me and i will frankly very often look someone in the eye and disagree with them and they will end up supporting me because of it because it s not something they re used to seeing from their leaders um i think that we also haven t really modernized the way that members of congress that congressional offices interact with people in a long time um you know right now you can come to a town hall if you have time to come to a town hall uh you can write or call and you can come have meetings but there are some members of congress right now for piloting uh this idea called deliberative democracy where every week they have a random selection of their constituents that they have a phone call with on a different topic um and that random selection is really meant to be designed from the whole spectrum of their district not only people who agree with them and every week have this call on a different topic with different randomly selected constituents uh which has been very effective so far and that s something i would like to be part of and build out i also think we have other ways that we can start rebuilding that trust in net to a feedback loop so it s not just every two years in an election that people feel like they have a say but you can really bring them into the policymaking processes really um empower them to be part of the decision making um we ve seen a lot of interesting pilots around participatory budgeting um when i worked at unicef one of the things that we really tried to do was we would not design anything in new york headquarters we would only design things in the field working directly with people who were going to be using it because that s the only way you can make sure that you re actually doing what they need using user centered design processes and others and so i think there s a lot more we can be doing to really rebuild that trust and bring bring people into believing that government is there to work q yeah talk a little bit more about congress s role there because like one of the things that i observe is people s highly cynical and partisan views mostly targeted at like the federal level so when we look at how people feel about news generally they don t complain about the local coverage very much they said like okay that s good but man your national stuff and i think that s because those are like things about local people are people they know or somebody knows it s a little bit of a connection there a check there s accountability get into these national issues and these are like people i don t know and i don t know whether it s true and you re much more vulnerable to manipulation so just strikes me that congress is that piece it s supposed to build this confederation of locality into a nation but oh my god it seems like congress is where we have the biggest problem so how would you fix that i like those ideas are super interesting by the way i d like as a congressperson yeah what can be done a so as an individual congress person i believe that i can use some of those ideas to build up that idea in my own district where people have the same feeling um feel like they re part of my process uh feel like they uh they know me and there is accountability and i m i m there i believe a big part of leadership is showing up um and just being there and people seeing you um and that s something i would really uh focus on in terms of the beyond just you know me and my office and our role here in the district uh yeah i can t blame people congress is not you know we ve seen that they have not really been able to get a lot done now this current house has passed a lot of bills that they re sitting on mitch mcconnell s desk waiting to be taken up by the senate even if we have the votes to pass them in the senate uh like universal background checks um and uh so i do think part of it is actually sending new people there who uh people identify with and uh you know i believe one of the things i bring is a different approach to governing uh really thinking about why we don t have to settle for the way things have always been done how we can bring more people in and also you know in doing work at the state department at unicef uh i really think that you make the best public policy by bringing everyone together on an issue from across the board um all of the spectrums and i ve found as a policy person that once you get all of the policy people in the room you can actually find a solution that most people are fine with um it s then the politics that get in the way and we need to get back to being able to come together bringing everyone together and really finding solutions that actually work i was the ceo of an international education nonprofit for a year after the clinton campaign before i ran for office last cycle uh and we the whole point of that nonprofit was bringing together uh unicef and tech companies unicef who has responsibility for oversight of education around the world uh for younger children uh unesco is for older children uh and tech companies who had made a commitment to connect schools around the world to the internet and we brought them together and figured out a way that we could map schools and do it in a way that allowed unicef to do their job better allowed tech companies to do their connectivity in a more equitable way so that they weren t just focusing on the schools that always get the resources in the urban centers but actually in the harder to reach schools where internet connectivity was more important you know and found out and i found a way to bring together bureaucrats from unicef and people in tech companies who speak very different languages but we were able to find a solution that worked for all of us and that s the same approach that i ll bring to washington q tech and privacy has gotten lots and lots of attention but i don t think tech and social and mental illness has gotten enough attention two years ago san diego state professor jean twenge put out a book that said basically around 2009 adolescents are increasingly likely to go through depression even severe depression this led to france s ban of phones from schools in south korea and in japan they actually say the birth rate is going down and we re going to depopulate and they ve blamed phones isn t this time we have some kind of like a national initiative or a task force or something that addresses the idea that these electronic devices are actually making us less happy a like in a lot of uh problems that have to do with technology i think we often give technology more a causality than it has um both in problem causing and in solutions techno technologies are tools um these are human problems that we re trying to solve that technology can exacerbate or technology can help um and how we use technology is what is what determines whether it exacerbates or helps but at the end of the day these are not technology problems they re human problems and so they require human solutions even if technology is a tool for those solutions so yes i have read a lot of those studies there are more young people who experience feelings of loneliness who um have ideation around suicide who um feel more disconnected uh but i would argue that s not only because of technology it s also because as a society we don t have these uh we don t have bowling leagues anymore a lot of uh younger generations are not affiliated with a formal church in the same way right there s there s a lot of fragmentation that s happening in our society beyond the fact that people use social media i do think there s a lot we need to do to make social media better and to make it a better experience for our kids um including uh working on anti bullying um we have seen a lot of young people who uh have had horrible cyber bullying um and that s really a problem and it again bullying has always happened um but now it s a technology that exacerbates that bullying um so i think there s a lot we can do to make social media better including working on creating some of these rules around some of the algorithms that these technology companies use um there was a study that showed that regardless of where you start on youtube if you keep it going on autoplay for 10 10 frames i think you ll eventually get to something extreme because uh that is the kind of thing that keeps you watching right that s what the algorithm is trained for um so those are the kinds of things actually that if we had members of congress who understood technology we maybe would be creating some framework around what kinds of rules we would need to prevent uh social media exacerbating the worst parts of human nature and actually have it be a space where you can find more human connection not less i do think there s a lot we need to do to make social media better and to make it a better experience for our kids including working on anti bullying sara jacobs q what do you see as the biggest international threat to america a uh well i think the biggest international threat to america is the fact that uh our democracy isn t functioning we ve and we ve lost faith in our institutions and uh in our leaders uh we saw thank you um we ve seen russia uh use those fault lines uh to sway our elections uh we re seeing just today i believe the house of representatives is uh starting the process of filing articles of impeachment because the president has tried to use foreign actors to exacerbate those fault lines in our society um and honestly in working around the world for the u s government for um the un one of the biggest assets that we had as a u s government was our ideal was that we could go to a country and say like it s possible to have a democracy that works um you should support human rights you should abide by human rights law and we have lost uh that moral authority uh donald trump has eroded our ability to play that leadership role around the world and that i think is uh the biggest threat facing us q what do you think of his handling of nato is it a good thing that he s got more members to pony up a little bit more or the way he s doing it as a problem a i think the way he s doing it is a problem so it s it s true we needed more burden sharing in nato we needed our european allies to actually be abiding by the commitments they made in the nato treaty to spend uh i 1 of gdp 2 of gdp on uh defense uh which they were not all doing so that that was important and frankly that was something that the obama administration was working on and i don t think that the way trump has gone about it is helpful because we have lost our ability to convene nato and we ve lost uh nato and our european allies trust that any agreement that we try and lead them on any agreement that we try and make with them will actually be uh uh enforced and will actually last beyond a single uh president and that is a real problem because it means that they re now making other agreements without us and they will never trust us in the same way uh and that was really a really important way that we were able to get things done in this image from video alan dershowitz an attorney for president donald trump speaks during the impeachment trial against trump in the senate at the u s capitol in washington monday jan 27 2020 senate television via ap associated press q if you were in congress would you vote to impeach a yes uh i worked in uh foreign policy national security uh and so i know for a fact that the way that the president engaged with the ukrainians was outside the scope of normal diplomatic negotiations and i think it s really important that we uh not only set the stage here domestically that no one is above the law and that this is not appropriate behavior by a president but in my mind as important if not more important is that we are showing the world that our foreign policy is not for sale uh and that i think is a really important message that we need to send to the world right now q any questions thanks for coming in give us your elevator pitch your closing statement why voters should choose you a all right well thank you so much for having me and for spending the time uh talking with me um i hope i didn t get too in the weeds um i uh i love san diego san diego is my home uh and i know that san diego has given me and my family so much which is why i ve dedicated my life to trying to build a more equitable san diego and world whether that was working at the state department working at the youth at unicef or uh what i ve been doing for the past year here on child poverty um and i believe that right now it s more important than ever that we have someone in congress who has worked in the federal government before has experienced making and implementing policy at the federal level can hit the ground running on day one and ensure that we are well represented and is not only focusing on repairing what s been damaged by the trump administration but really has an approach of bringing everyone together at actually getting things done so that we can set in place the foundations that we need to build a more equitable future q yes thank you

it reflects an additional 0 5 billion in our five year capital plan at the utility which supports our long term annual adjusted eps and dividend growth of 6 to 8 and is in line with our previously

although 2019 has been another excellent year of solid performance and record achievements we are still dissatisfied we ll continue to keep improving as we work to deliver our financial and operational commitments year after year now every year you ll see the ups and downs that come our way as illustrated on slide 6 and every year our unique capability of adapting to changing conditions enables us to deliver the results you expect year in and year out in 2019 we were met with challenge after challenge as storm restoration costs surpassed our full year budget to six months into the year but we don t make excuses for storms or other weather related impacts on revenue this is what i love about our model where we ride the roller coaster for you so you can enjoy the smooth and predictable outcome highlighted by the green line this model has served our customers and view over the last decade plus and we ll continue to utilize it going forward i feel compelled to give a shout out to the entire cms energy team for the tenacity and the agility they demonstrated in 2019 given the headwinds we faced and challenges we overcame i could not be more proud of the results and thankful for the efforts of my co workers like we do every year we re celebrating on the run and moving on to our next set of priorities and setting new goals with 2019 behind us and as we prepare to deliver in 2020 we ll continue to make progress on ensuring the safety of our gas system driving customer satisfaction and delivering on our clean energy plan the goals we ve set for ourselves in 2020 are ambitious and as always they re fueled by the continuing maturity of our lean operating system the ce way our ability to execute on our capital plan and make the investments our system needs will depend on our ability to see and eliminate waste wherever it is as we continue to mature in the ce way we are creating a culture where all of our co workers are both motivated and able to fulfill our purpose world class performance delivering hometown service these simple words mean a lot to us our systems capital demands at the utility continued to grow and to that end we re rolling our capital plan forward an additional year which will increase the spend over the next five years to about 12 25 billion and supports rate base growth of 7 over that period this increase reflects the continued ramp up in annual capital investments in our electric and gas infrastructure to improve the safety and reliability of our systems as well as increased investments in solar generation assets agreed to in our irp which was approved by the commission last year it s worth noting that only about 15 of these projects over the next five years are above 200 million and about 75 of those projects are addressed in multiyear commission orders such as the irp which mitigates risk and provides more certainty around execution and regulatory outcomes we ll also remind you that our five year customer investment plan is limited not by the needs of our system as that stretches vast and wide across the great state of michigan but instead by balance sheet constraints workforce capacity and customer affordability looking now toward regulatory matters with the 2016 energy loss fully implemented and with the benefits of tax reform addressed in recent commission orders our regulatory calendar for 2020 is much lighter than in recent years last year we agreed to stay out of an electric rate case and the strategy served us well as we were able to capitalize on some of the cost performance efforts by leveraging the ce way now we ll have the opportunity to funnel some of those cost savings back to our customers and offset some of the capital investment need coupled with our efforts to ramp our energy efficiency savings to 2 by 2021 we ll keep customers bills affordable we anticipate filing our next electric rate case by the end of this quarter in december 2019 we filed a request in our gas rate case for 245 million of incremental revenue including a 10 5 roe and an equity ratio of 52 5 relative to debt as we continue to focus on the safety and reliability of our gas delivery system this case builds on the order in our last gas case where nearly all of the capital investments were approved because you would expect the needs of our system haven t changed that much in just one year in conjunction with our gas case we also filed our 10 year natural gas delivery plan which provides a detailed look into the long term needs of our gas delivery system and supports our 10 year capital plan we re thankful for the constructive regulatory environment in michigan that allows for timely rate orders and forward planning and the commission s commitment to working with us to continuously improve the safety and reliability of our system i ll remind you regardless of changing conditions around us our triple bottom line and simple business model have served our customers and investors well and allows us to perform consistently year in and year out as highlighted on slide 10 our track record demonstrates our ability to deliver the consistent premium results you ve come to expect year after year after year and this year you can expect the same with that i ll turn the call over to rejji rejji hayes executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you patti and good morning everyone before i get into the details i d like to share the wonderful news that travis uphaus from our ir team and his wife maryland welcome their seventh child mara christine uphaus on tuesday morning so we are wishing the uphaus family our very best from our headquarters in jackson michigan as patti highlighted we re pleased to report our 2019 adjusted net income of 708 million with 2 49 per share up 7 year over year our adjusted eps excludes select non recurring items including estimated severance and retention costs for our co workers at our corn coal facilities which is scheduled to be retired in 2023 as well as the recognition of an expense related to the potential settlement of legacy legal matters 2019 results of the utility were largely driven by constructive outcomes from our electric rate case settlement in january of 2019 and the gas rate order we received in september which were partially offset by heavy storm activity particularly in the first three quarters of the year our non utility segments beat guidance by 0 02 in aggregate largely due to low cost financings at cms energy and solid performance from enerbank as we review our full suite of financial and customer affordability targets for 2019 on slide 12 you ll note that in addition to achieving 7 annual adjusted eps growth we grew our dividend commensurately and generated approximately 1 8 billion of operating cash flow our steady cash flow generation and conservative financing strategy over the years continue to fortify our balance sheet as evidenced by our strong ffo to debt ratio which is approximately 17 5 at year end and required no equity issuances in 2019 lastly in accordance with our self funding model we effectively met our customer affordability targets by keeping bills at or below inflation for both the gas and electric businesses all while investing a record level of capital of approximately 2 3 billion at the utility moving on to 2020 as patti noted we are raising our 2020 adjusted earnings guidance from 2 64 to 2 68 per share which implies 6 to 8 annual growth off of our 2019 actuals unsurprisingly we expect utility to drive the vast majority of our consolidated financial performance with the usual steady contribution from the non utility business segments one item to note is that enterprises eps guidance is slightly down from their 2019 results given the absence of a gain on the sale of select assets in the second quarter of 2019 all in we ll continue to target the midpoint of our consolidated eps growth range at year end to elaborate on the glide path to achieve our 2020 eps guidance range as you ll note on the waterfall chart on slide 14 we plan for normal weather which in this case amounts to an estimated 0 06 of negative variance negative year over year variance given the cold of the normal weather experienced in 2019 to the benefit of our gas business we anticipate that cost reduction initiatives largely driven by this eu wave and other expected sources of year over year favorability such as lower storm restoration expenses after an unprecedented level of storm activity last year will fully offset the absence of favorable weather in 2019 it is also worth noting that we capitalize on an opportunity to fully fund our defined benefit pension plan earlier this month which provides additional non operating cost savings and eps risk mitigation moving on to rate relief we anticipate approximately 0 17 of eps pickup in 2020 as mentioned during our q3 call about two thirds of this pickup has already been approved by the commission in the gas rate order we received in september and the approval of our renewable energy plan in the first quarter of 2019 we ll expect the final order in our pending gas case in october of this year which effectively makes up the balance of our expected rate relief driven eps contribution in 2020 while we plan to file an electric case in q1 of this year the test year for that case will start in 2021 lastly we apply our usual conservative assumptions around sales financings and other variables as always we ll adapt to new conditions and circumstances throughout the year to mitigate risk and increase the likelihood of meeting our financial and operational objectives to the benefit of customers and investors as we work toward delivering our 2020 eps target we remain focused on cost reduction opportunities within our entire 5 5 billion cost structure the core components of which are illustrated on slide 15 for well over a decade we have managed to achieve planned and unplanned cost savings to mitigate intra year risk and create long term headroom in our electric and gas bills to support our substantial customer investments at the utility as we look to 2020 and beyond we continue to believe there are numerous cost reduction opportunities throughout our cost structure these opportunities include but are not limited to the expiration of high priced ppas the retirement of our coal fleet capital enabled savings as we modernize our electric and gas distribution systems and the continued maturation of our lean operating system the ce way these opportunities will provide sources of intra year risk mitigation as well as a sustainable funding strategy for our long term customer investment plan which will keep customer s bills low on an absolute basis and relative to other household staples in michigan as depicted in the chart on the right hand side of the page moving on to weather normalized sales as we ve discussed in the past economic conditions in michigan remain positive particularly in our electric service territory which is anchored by grand rapids one of the fastest growing cities in the country as evidenced by the statistics on the upper left hand corner of slide 16 and when it comes to michigan s economy we re not passive participants in fact in addition to directly investing billions of dollars throughout the state annually we collaborate with key stakeholders across the state to drive industrial activity through our economic development efforts these efforts have attracted nearly 300 megawatts of new electric load in our service territory since 2016 and in 2019 alone the contracts we signed will support over 3 600 jobs and bring in more than 1 5 billion of investment to michigan a prosperous michigan supported by our economic development efforts offers multiple benefits to our business model in the near term it drives volumetric sales which support our financial objectives and the longer term it creates headroom in customer bills by reducing our rates as mentioned in the past we also continue to see the positive spillover effects of that industrial activity on our higher margin residential and commercial segments over time in the form of steady customer count growth and favorable load trends as you will note in the chart on the right hand side of the slide we ve seen average residential load growth of one percent and one and a half percent for the electric and gas businesses respectively over the past five years when normalized for weather and our energy efficiency programs to summarize our financial and customer affordability targets for 2020 and beyond we expect another solid year of 6 to 8 adjusted eps growth solid operating cash flow growth exclusive of the aforementioned discretionary pension contribution and customer prices at or below inflation from a balance sheet perspective we continue to target solid investment grade credit metrics and as you ll note our equity needs are approximately 250 million in 2020 due to the previously noted deferral of our equity issuance needs in 2019 we expect our equity needs to be roughly 150 million per year in 2021 and beyond which can be completed through our atm equity issuance program which we ll likely file along with our shelf during the first half of this year our model has served our stakeholders well in the past as customers receive safe reliable and clean electric and gas and affordable prices and our investors benefit from consistent industry leading financial performance on slide 18 we ve refreshed our sensitivity analysis on key variables for your modeling assumptions as you ll note with reasonable planning assumptions and robust risk mitigation the probability of large variances from our plan are minimized there will always be sources of volatility in this business be they weather fuel costs regulatory outcomes or otherwise and every year we view it as our mandate to do the warning for you and mitigate the risk accordingly and with that i ll hand it back to patti for her concluding remarks before q a patti poppe president and chief executive officer thank you rejji our investment thesis is compelling and we ll serve our customers our planet and our investors for years to come and with that chad would you please open the line for q a questions answers operator certainly thank you very much patti the first question will come from greg gordon with evercore isi please go ahead greg gordon evercore isi analyst hey good morning patti rejji patti poppe president and chief executive officer good morning greg rejji hayes executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning greg greg gordon evercore isi analyst a couple of questions on the year so did you rejji did you say that that small asset sale gain from enterprises was in the second quarter is that correct rejji hayes executive vice president and chief financial officer that s right greg gordon evercore isi analyst can you just give us a little more description of what asset it was and what you saw and the rationale for that rejji hayes executive vice president and chief financial officer absolutely absolutely so enterprises specifically dig add some transmission related assets so the informal parlance is switchyard assets which they sold to itc transmission in the second quarter and so we booked a gain of roughly 16 million or 0 04 in q2 that was part of our plan throughout the year which is why you ll see sort of an aberrant trend between our 19 actuals and what we anticipate for 2020 greg gordon evercore isi analyst understood i may be wrong but i think you re breaking enerbank out separately now for the first time i m happy to get the incremental disclosure but can you just give us the rationale for that and then i have one more question rejji hayes executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah happy to so enerbank this year and they had a wonderful year as patti noted they hit about 2 6 a little over 2 6 billion in assets which is in excess of 10 of our consolidated asset threshold and so we chose to report out the segment at this point greg gordon evercore isi analyst great my final question is the decision to fund the pension how much sort of in dollars did you top off the pension and can we think about the financial benefit of that being sort of the delta between the financing costs and the expected pension return rejji hayes executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so starting with your last question first yes we did take into account and you should assume that the eps related pickup is net of the funding costs and so we anticipate about 0 05 of earnings per share upside attributable to that the amount and you ll see this in the appendix is a little over 530 million and so that allowed us to fully fund our inactive defined benefit plan greg gordon evercore isi analyst and that was funded from a parent infusion or from off of the actual operating company balance sheet rejji hayes executive vice president and chief financial officer the latter so we did a term loan in the interim at consumer s energy and it s interesting the term loan funding of that was about 300 million we actually had a little bit of excess cash flow that we allotted us to fund it with a bit of excess cash which also helped the eps accretion attributable to that greg gordon evercore isi analyst ok thank you all very much have a great morning rejji hayes executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you greg patti poppe president and chief executive officer thanks greg operator the next question comes from julien dumoulin smith with bank of america please go ahead julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey good morning to you patti poppe president and chief executive officer good morning julien julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey so perhaps just kicking off first as usual we re focused on the capex and the upward trend and nicely done on the upper half billion increase here as you roll forward can you talk a little bit about the upside trajectory i suppose if you take that half billion dollars as just kind of the latest single year in isolation roll forward and you continue to use that you end up somewhat in excess of your kind of 10 year plan so obviously you ve talked about this a little bit but perhaps this might be an opportunity to elaborate a little bit and then i ll start with your second question at the same time dte had some pushback on their latest process on procurement in their irp any reasons with respect to your ongoing efforts on the renewable side specifically i just want to clarify that patti poppe president and chief executive officer well i ll take the first part and i ll let raj take the second part julien the capital plan the 25 billion capital plan does have fluctuations year to year some and you ll see we ve got a five year look in the appendix of the deck so you can see what the plan is by year and we do have some opportunities in that 25 billion and we talked about that after the third quarter you know there s certainly demand for additional spend on electric reliability and grid modernization and our gas business and as always we re working to balance the competing demands for capital internally having our internal capital battles if you will but also making sure that our bills remain affordable making sure that the capacity to do the work is possible so that we have good credibility with our regulators that we do what we said we re going to do and so the upside that you see in this first five year forward adding additional year is the natural fluctuation but it all supports the 25 billion plan and that supports our 6 to 8 growth trajectory rejji hayes executive vice president and chief financial officer yes julien you also just asked about what could allow us to i think if i heard you correctly just dip into those upside opportunities and as patti and i have talked about in the past the constraints are primarily you know customer affordability and so that is the primary constraint on whether we ll be able to dip into those upside opportunities of 3 to 4 billion in that 10 year plan as well as balance sheet constraints and potentially workforce capacity and so over time as all of those potentially move favorably we ll consider recalibrating but for now that s where the plan sits now getting to your second question related to if i heard you correctly again the feed wasn t all that good but it sounded like a potential reaction to i think the alj s decision and dte s integrated research plan needless to say we re not going to speak for dte on their regulatory filings but if you re asking whether that has an impact on our irp and the execution of our irp the answer to that is no we obviously just concluded the rfp well first we got approval for irp in mid last year and we just concluded in september or deep into q4 the request for proposal for the first tranche of 300 megawatts of solar and this is part of a longer term effort to really build out solar generating assets to the tune of six gigawatts by 2040 and this first tranche of call it 1 1 gigawatts that were approved in the settlement we just did about 300 megawatts this year we ll do another 300 megawatts in rfp in september this year and the balance of 500 megawatts in 2021 half of which will be rate base half of which will be ppa and so we re in execution mode and obviously we ll look to file a new irp in june of 21 for the settlements so where that s where we stand on that julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst all right excellent i ll leave it there thank you all best of luck patti poppe president and chief executive officer thanks julien rejji hayes executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator the next question will be from michael weinstein with credit suisse please go ahead michael weinstein credit suisse analyst hi good morning guys patti poppe president and chief executive officer good morning michael michael weinstein credit suisse analyst i just wanted to confirm that the extra 500 million of capital spending that s planned for the next five years is not part of the 3 to 4 billion of upside opportunities right because the total 10 year plan didn t really change that much patti poppe president and chief executive officer that s right michael you ve got that right this is just the one year roll forward so it shows the modification in the plan michael weinstein credit suisse analyst got it so this is is it an acceleration of spending that you would ve done in the second five years of that 10 year plan basically patti poppe president and chief executive officer no it s right in line with our plan it adds some additional the irp solar that was approved as well as some additional electric reliability and really the you can plan on fluctuation between the gas the electric the renewable parts of the spend as the years go forward so that we can optimize that capital spend to the benefit of customers and again mitigating the challenges that rejji articulated around affordability balance sheet we re always just working the plan to have the highest value capital year after year michael weinstein credit suisse analyst right and also i wanted to confirm that there s no incremental equity needs from any of that either obviously it doesn t look like the plan changed at all in equity and that this is all atm and internal programs right there s no block equity rejji hayes executive vice president and chief financial officer that s correct michael weinstein credit suisse analyst ok and one thing i would maybe you could talk a little bit more about is you discussed a little bit about new and the attraction of new commercial and industrial customers in your territory and can you discuss the potential impacts on electric load and on your industrial customers as electric vehicles gain traction across the supply chain for the auto industry patti poppe president and chief executive officer yeah you know the i would say the industrial loads that we re seeing being added actually ends up being very unrelated to automotive michigan is more and more diversified we ve had some big ag customer additions and some pharma additions and so i would say if anything we re seeing some diversification in michigan in our makeup of our industrial rate base but i would also say or our industrial customer base but i would also offer on the ev front that as the chair of the eei electric transportation as the co chair of that committee i ve had an opportunity to really get exposed to some of the national fleet operators we had amazon for example at our national eei meeting in january talking about their ambitions to electrify their fleet i see that as a big opportunity you know load growth for electric per capita certainly has not had significant increases in fact it goes down in many cases as equipment gets more efficient lighting gets more efficient and i see this fleet potential to be actual load growth potential in the future as their ambitions materialize now i will tell you it s not going to sneak up on us because with their first of all they need to have electric transportation at the fleet scale available the actual vehicles the trucks etc and that development cycle is you know not fast but then we ll be working with them to size their charging stations and make sure we maximize the benefit to the grid and minimize the addition to peak demand so i think it s a great opportunity frankly for the industry and michigan will certainly be participants in that michael weinstein credit suisse analyst that s super thank you very much rejji hayes executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator the next question will be from praful mehta with citigroup please go ahead praful mehta citi analyst thanks so much hi guys and congrats on a good quarter patti poppe president and chief executive officer thanks praful rejji hayes executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you praful praful mehta citi analyst so maybe first a more big picture step back question utilities clearly have been doing well in the current stock price environment and cms is clearly doing well too given the execution do you think there is any use of that currency from your perspective m a or otherwise that you think you can look at or execution is primarily the focus at this point rejji hayes executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah praful our position on m a versus organic growth has been consistent for some time and you know we are fully focused on executing on our capital plan we ve got enough to do within our walls and as i ve said in the past we re paying one times book to fund those capital investments i d rather do that than pay a premium for somebody else s capex backlog so we re acutely focused on executing on our plan praful mehta citi analyst fair enough makes sense then just quickly on the operating cash flow when you re looking at the slide 17 and you say up 100 from the 2020 1 7 billion just can you walk through that what s the increase that you re kind of seeing in the long term plan and i guess connected to that i also saw increased nol utilization on slide 23 so just try to understand a little bit of the drivers around the operating cash flow rejji hayes executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so praful as you may recall prior to the enactment of tax reform at the end of 2017 we were on this very healthy trajectory of about 100 million of year over year or at least year versus prior year budget ocf accretion per year and it has to do with just the very nice fundamentals of this business i mean we re investing capital growing rate base getting solid customer receipts and i ll give full credit to our folks who manage working capital very well in our team as well and so it s just a nice by product of all that good work there and so the only reason we paused slightly was just due to tax reform and the cash flow degradation effects of that so we basically took a two year pause on that level of growth and so we guided in 2018 at 1 65 billion we managed to exceed that and again we guided in 2019 to 1 65 billion and managed to exceed that again and so now we feel like again relative to what we budgeted the prior year we ll be back on that sort of 100 million per year increase starting this year in 2020 and so that s what we have in the forecast and we feel very good about that particularly given the magnitude of the capital investment plan our ability to manage our costs and again just execute well on the working capital front and so we feel like we have a very nice glide path to continue on that trajectory now as it pertains to nols and credits you know we obviously had a significant remeasurement going back to tax reform on our nols we still think we ve got a little bit of utilization left of what s remaining but then also we still have quite a few business credits that we ve accumulated over time and we expect modest accretion of that just given some of our efforts on the renewables side and so that s where you see still a decent amount of i ll say combination of nols and tax credits and so at this point we don t expect to be a federal taxpayer until call it 2024 there s a modest amount that we ll pay in 2023 based on our forecast but really not a partial taxpayer until 2024 is that helpful praful mehta citi analyst yeah that s super helpful thanks for that and then just finally in terms of storm impacts and storm costs is there any in the current rate case filing is there any plan there to change what gets recovered or what is allowed to be recovered in terms of storm costs patti poppe president and chief executive officer yeah in our next electric rate case certainly we want to reflect the average service restoration expenses and what we ve been recovering in rates is less than what we ve actually experienced on the last five year average and so we want that to be reflective but we also want and believe that with the age of the system that our increased spend in both the fundamental reliability of the system we ve been increasing both the actual spend as well as the requested spend we think there s a lot of justification for that to keep up with the age of the system and so we ll continue to ramp the reliability spend but we also want accurate reflection of the operating expense associated with service restoration while frankly at the same time we re working to reduce the cost of every interruption by making our processes more efficient by making our utilizing technology to respond faster and at a lower cost and so we re doing both simultaneously praful mehta citi analyst got it super helpful congrats again guys rejji hayes executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you patti poppe president and chief executive officer thank you operator and our next question comes from shar pourreza with guggenheim partners please go ahead shar pourreza guggenheim partners analyst hey good morning guys patti poppe president and chief executive officer good morning shar rejji hayes executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning shar shar pourreza guggenheim partners analyst so just on just a couple of questions on your annual capex regarding your disclosures that s closer to the back of the slide deck there s some obviously some shuffling of spend between 2020 and 2021 can you just remind us what actually drove this and can you maybe talk a little bit more about the new capex you re introducing toward the back end really more specifically on the mix between gas and electric rejji hayes executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah sure shar happy to take that so a little bit of the shift that you probably have noticed between what we re expecting or what we were expecting in 2020 in our prior five year plan that we rolled out in q1 of last year and sort of this five year plan it has everything to do with just the timing of the rate case in the four test years and so this current vintage now that we re a year smarter reflects the magnitude of spend we expect in 2021 and that aligns nicely with the gas case that s pending that we filed in december of last year and with the electric case will likely file in q1 of this year and so that s really why you see that shifting between 20 and 21 and what we ve always said and this remains true to form is that the absolute amount or the quantum of capital we anticipate spending on a five year period one year period is always pretty consistent but the composition does change over time and sometimes you get shifts intra year and so that s effectively what you re seeing and then for the outer years i think patti did a nice job summarizing this is just we re just basically losing 2019 from the prior vintage and rolling in another year so going from a 19 to 23 plan to a 20 to 24 plan and as part of that roll forward you re seeing an expansion more of the solar generation will do attributable to the irps so taking on that sort of final tranche of call it 250 megawatts that will rate base and then you couple that with additional spend in both our electric distribution reliability related capital investments as well as gas and infrastructure spend and so those are kind of the pieces you re seeing in the back end of that five year period shar pourreza guggenheim partners analyst got it got it and then sorry and then patti just sorry to beat a dead horse on this but i just have a follow up on that incremental capital opportunities you guys have been highlighting it seems like you re managing o m well you have bill headroom that continues to improve the economic backdrop remains strong in your service stories you kind of highlight you do have sort of balance sheet capacity some kind of curious what are the drivers that we are missing as far as you look to pull forward some of that spend is there anything else outside of just managing toward that 7 growth target that midpoint is it a function of trying to find the optimal capital projects internally so what s sort of the offsets to those drivers because it seems like the drivers seem to fit toward you accelerating spend versus not patti poppe president and chief executive officer yeah you know one thing i ll tell you about our 10 year capital plan i think some people might argue that it s impossible to have a 10 year capital plan because conditions change so much or you don t know enough about the future i can tell you our 10 year capital plan has a significant amount of meat on the bones and what we intend to do is make sure that we are able to execute the work that we have committed to and so i ll tell you the ramp up of capital requires a significant operational and ability to execute and prepare the workforce and when we hear nationally about constraints on ability to attract talent and to build out a workforce we have to attract the workforce to deliver all that work and so that we want to make sure is well timed and well planned so that we do precisely what we said we re going to do and it s also important that from an affordability standpoint that our customers are able to pay and would value for value the investments that we ll be making on their behalf so really customer affordability continues to be front of mind and as an operator myself i want to make sure my team is ready and prepared to execute the work that we commit to it s easy to write a number in a spreadsheet it s another thing to go dig the trench and lay the wire and roll the trucks so we ve got to make sure that we re ready all the way around shar pourreza guggenheim partners analyst got it so the human capital aspect is a bit of a concern ok great thanks so much guys congrats again patti poppe president and chief executive officer thanks shar rejji hayes executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks shar operator our next question will be from jonathan arnold with vertical research please go ahead jonathan arnold vertical research analyst good morning guys patti poppe president and chief executive officer good morning jonathan rejji hayes executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning to you jonathan jonathan arnold vertical research analyst thanks for taking my question so i was going to ask you about the shift in the capex from 20 to 21 and i think you ve addressed that so thank you for that just one other issue now you re giving this breakout of enterprises enerbank and the parent which it sounds like you will continue to do that going forward given the size but should we think already about the parent roughly consistent going forward with this number you re showing for 2020 or is that going to move around out in the five year plan rejji hayes executive vice president and chief financial officer well it should increase over time jonathan because keep in mind you know that s largely at this point interest expense at the parent and we have 12 2 billion of capital investments that we re going to be funding over this period and so obviously we do the best we can in terms of getting low interest rates realized in our debt financings but we just assume with the new money we ll be raising that that interest expense should come up over time or increase over time and so we do expect that segment to increase every now and then we overachieve of course katrina s team have been very good at getting financings at lower rates than anticipated but conservatively we ll assume that that segment does increase jonathan arnold vertical research analyst ok so you can just basically finance of a portion of the underlying growth i think that s it i really wanted to ask on the capex so thank you patti poppe president and chief executive officer thanks jonathan operator and the next question will be from ali agha with strh please go ahead ali agha suntrust robinson humphrey analyst good morning patti poppe president and chief executive officer good morning ali ali agha suntrust robinson humphrey analyst first question rejji or patti can you just remind us again as you re looking at the sales there roughly how much on an annual basis does energy efficiency sort of take away from the sales numbers rejji hayes executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so and this has been basically come out of the new well i can t call it new so much anymore but the 2016 energy law ali and so we have a one and a half percent year over year reduction target that we get economic incentives on and so you take the prior year s load and then you reduce that by one and a half percent and we do that through all the nice programs we have and rebates on led lightbulbs and things of that nature and so that s where historically we ve been the last few years our current five year plan and we ve been very public about this as part of our rrp is to expand those energy waste reduction programs and so we re on a glide path to get to a 2 year over year reduction and so that will be about 2 of our prior year s load and so i just want to reemphasize that we do get economic incentives on those programs and so historically that s been a run rate of call it 34 million pre tax combined electric and gas and so as we glide path that pre tax income will crest at about 47 million toward the latter years of this plan and we anticipate about 41 million in 2020 alone as we glide path up and so we anticipate again one and a half to 2 reduction in loan as part of that and remember it also gets trued up in rates as we file new cases and so that is also something worth noting ali agha suntrust robinson humphrey analyst ok and so just to be clear if i look at the numbers for calendar 19 as reported weather normalized was negative 1 4 if you adjust that for efficiency then it should be relatively flat and i know you re sort of on an apples to apples basis looking at that being up 1 i believe in 20 and perhaps beyond that so can you just talk a little bit more about that dynamic you had load growth going up to one and beyond rejji hayes executive vice president and chief financial officer happy to and we actually tried to get in front of that question because it comes up quite a bit by offering this new slide 16 in the presentation but you re thinking about it ali the right way and so if you look at that sort of blended weather normalized electric load for 2019 versus 2018 1 4 down think of that as flat i ll also note what s embedded in that 1 4 is a reduction in volume from a very large low margin customer and so when you back out the effects of the large low margin customer our weather normalized sales goes from 1 4 down to about half a percent down and then if you take out the effects of energy efficiency well now you re up 1 and you can look across all of our channels for electric and see that trend which we think is the right way to think about it so residential flat so you again you normalize for energy efficiency you re up one and a half percent commercial down 1 1 you normalize you re up half a percent and we have seen those organic trends in our customer counts just to make sure that we re not being too scientific here and so we feel quite good about that and think there is a very healthy economic growth in our service territory particularly with the high margin part of our supply chain or sorry our customer segments ali agha suntrust robinson humphrey analyst gotcha and one last question i know as you mentioned that the 2016 energy law is fully implemented etc anything of note in this year s legislative session for us to keep an eye on that may be relevant to you folks or something that you guys are keeping an eye on as well patti poppe president and chief executive officer no ali i would suggest particularly here in michigan the there s nothing really being driven by the elections this fall certainly the presidential election is going to be a big distraction we do have our whole house state house of course has two year terms and our congressional districts have two year terms and so there s reelections our governor did her say at the state last night and she doubled down on her commitment to fix the dam roads here in michigan that s our slogan not mine and so we re happy to support the investment and infrastructure and frankly as we do more road repairs it s a great opportunity for us to collaborate with our department of transportation and our construction work here in michigan to do our investment and infrastructure at a lower cost for all citizens so i would say nothing though new from a legislative agenda here in michigan operator our next question comes from travis miller with morningstar please go ahead travis miller morningstar equity research analyst thank you good morning on the gas case i was wondering if you could lay out some of the hate to use the word contentious but some of the more debatable issues that you see coming up there and in particular the roe and the decision to go with the higher request patti poppe president and chief executive officer yeah well a couple of things travis first of all as i mentioned we have this 10 year gas natural gas delivery plan that we filed with our case and that plan has been well vetted with and actually collaborated with our staff at the commission and its development in aligning on our priorities one thing i can firmly applaud our commission for their commitment to being able to see long term plans so they can make better decisions in a one year case and so this 10 year gas plan we filed has a lot of meat on the bones and i feel very good about it you can look at our last case and see the over 90 approval of the capital that we requested is a good indicator that that work that we have committed to doing is the work that the commission would want us to do as well so we feel good about that now on the roe of course we feel justified in 10 5 roe ask and so we always make sure that we have adequate justification for that it yields about a 25 million impact if you take the 10 5 to 9 9 and so we recognize that the commission has a job to do they ve made it clear that they recognize that a healthy roe is important to the utility low cost of capital is important for the benefit of customers and the utility and so we look forward to seeing what the final outcome of that rate case will be but what s more important i think is we really take an eye on it is the volume of capital and the alignment with the staff and the commission and the work that we re doing travis miller morningstar equity research analyst ok great you anticipated my question on the roe so i won t ask that delta number but broadly on the enterprise and enerbank and especially enterprise what s your three year strategy any updates to that here in the last quarter or two rejji hayes executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so the plant at enterprise has been pretty straightforward for some time and so obviously a dig drives the vast majority of the financial performance of enterprise and we really have tried to derisk that business and its future earnings potential quite a bit through the energy contracts that we amended and extended about a year or so ago and then we ve also locked in a good deal of our capacity open margin over the next few years as well and so we feel like there should be pretty steady predictable performance at enterprises i ll also note we ve done a few of these contract of renewable opportunities over the last sort of a year and a half and so we will look to be opportunistic if those if we find nice opportunities with third parties where we can get attractive returns creditworthy counterparties and basically have to describe very little terminal value to projects like that and so we ll look to do those from time to time but again we expect the three year forward look to be pretty straightforward travis miller morningstar equity research analyst ok great and any of those contracted renewables in the capex plan right now rejji hayes executive vice president and chief financial officer not in the 12 2 we highlighted travis miller morningstar equity research analyst ok great thank you very much patti poppe president and chief executive officer thanks travis operator the next question is from andrew weisel with scotiabank andrew weisel scotiabank analyst good morning everyone patti poppe president and chief executive officer good morning andrew andrew weisel scotiabank analyst patti i ve got one near term and one long term first in the near term if you could elaborate rejji you gave a lot of good color on the demand trends by class are you able to estimate like how much of the impact particularly industrial is related to tariffs and trade wars and then what are your assumptions for load growth embedded in the 2020 guidance rejji hayes executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so we have i ll say for 2020 guidance we are fairly conservative in our position both in 2020 and also over the course of the five year plan and so for electric and again if you got to keep it take into account that we have the energy efficiency programs embedded in that we re assuming about call it flat to slightly declining for electric and so that is our working assumption for a really 2020 and beyond and i d say gas flat to maybe slightly up based from trends we re seeing there and so that s our current position in terms of industrial activity clearly we ve talked in the past about the diversified nature of our industrial customers in our electric service territory and i ll just remind that folks at about 2 of our gross margin equivalent comes from the auto sector and so yes of course we do have exposure to companies that may have some level of exposure to export import markets the trade war whatever you want to call it but at the end of the day a lot of the margin we generate comes from our residential and commercial customers and we continue to see very nice trends there and so the industrial activity we re obviously very supportive of it through our academic development efforts we do think it s important to michigan and our efforts on the residential and commercial side but really the vast majority of our sales were driven by residential and commercial at least the margin there and we ve seen good trends the only other data point i ll leave you with is that 1 change in our industrial estimated growth probably drives about 0 05 of eps and so there really isn t a significant impact when you see variation in the industrial class because it s much lower margin andrew weisel scotiabank analyst right makes sense ok good next longer term question you continue to point to the midpoint of the 6 to 8 range and obviously you ve been delivering 7 so that s probably not a surprise my question is you show rate base growth of 7 excluding the upside opportunities on capex you have some incremental eps growth from things like the energy efficiency and demand response incentives as well as enerbank growth my question is what would prevent you from hitting the high end of the range going forward is that equity dilution or any other factors patti poppe president and chief executive officer well i d say no 1 we re always balancing the ability for our customers to afford the product so that we have a sustainable plan and i ll also offer and you can see from our track record on years when there has been some favorability on the year when we could have delivered more than the midpoint we reinvested in the business and so one of the key components of our success here is our consistent performance that you actually can set your watch to that you can rest at night that s our goal and so the idea that we would start to fluctuate in pursuit of a higher target really is not consistent with our commitment to delivering as you would expect year after year after year and actually so even at this stage of the year we re thinking two years out not just next year and so we re always looking for ways to pull ahead expenses reinvest favorability for the benefit of the consistency in the long run andrew weisel scotiabank analyst sounds good i ll speak in the last one patti no story of the month any quick one you can throw at us patti poppe president and chief executive officer let s see yeah there s many of them here s one let me just off the top of my head we had a team at one of our service centers really looking at their meter management process and when we went out to talk to them garrick rochow our head of operations observed that this team has had this problem of meter inventory and how they were managing that inventory and because they have these teams called fix it now teams which are empowered work teams right on the ground level focused on driving the business they had identified this issue with their inventories of meters and identified a 2 million savings specifically the benefits that can be actually parley to other service centers to change their work process this ce way is becoming embedded in our organization and the ability to teach our coworkers to see and eliminate waste and improve their process it reduces what we call their own human struggle when our coworkers see human struggle that they can reduce it often parlays into dollars makes their job easier to do makes them more committed to the ownership of the company and it s another good example of our real savings that get driven by real people who do the real work and i could not be more proud of the team thanks for asking we have a big debate whether i should include that in the script and i am very happy that you asked andrew andrew weisel scotiabank analyst i need heaven at your fingertips thank you very much operator and our next question comes from gregg orrill with ubs please go ahead gregg orrill ubs analyst with the renewable s capex that you outlined on slide 22 can you maybe comment on how that contributes to rate base growth or is a portion of overall rate based in the plan rejji hayes executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so gregg what that s comprised of it s the combination of renewable spend and certainly the near term portion of this five year plan to get to the rps or sorry renewable portfolio standard of 15 by 2021 as per the energy law so that s the components you ll see in sort of the 2020 2021 timeframe and we have good projects in the pipeline that we think will allow us to get there and then the latter portion as we ve talked about in the past is part of the irp related renewable spend and so again as we start to execute on this 1 1 gigawatt tranche half of which will be owned half of which will be ppa ed or contracted you know that s what s making up the balance of that in terms of the rate base component we have of the 1 8 billion of capital we plan to spend in aggregate over the five year period it probably drives about or probably represents about 6 of rate base or thereabouts so not all that significant at this moment but over time we ll expect that to grow but the vast majority of the spend as we ve talked about in the past is wires and pipes we think that s where if you really want to get the biggest bang for the buck it s really in the investment and the safety and reliability of our system both in gas infrastructure and electric infrastructure and so that s where you see the vast majority of the rate base spend and the rate base growth accordingly gregg orrill ubs analyst ok thank you and congratulations rejji hayes executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you patti poppe president and chief executive officer thanks gregg operator and our next question is from david fishman with goldman sachs david fishman goldman sachs analyst hi good morning and congrats on another consistent year rejji hayes executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you david good morning patti poppe president and chief executive officer good morning david fishman goldman sachs analyst good morning so i apologize if this has already been asked but with the natural gas distribution plan files given such a long term look effectively by program when would you expect really if at all to file for another irm or another multiyear mechanism i mean just given the detail by category in this filing along with the irp and the ediip it certainly seems like you are potentially positioning consumers to work with the commission toward a mechanism of some kind in the 2020s patti poppe president and chief executive officer you know i would offer this david i have mixed feelings about the or long term plans because the reality is the system is dynamic the demands are dynamic one of the great strengths of our plan as i highlighted in my prepared remarks is that we ve got a lot of flexibility you know this large percent of our spend under 200 million the ability to file every year simple concrete filings that are part of a long term plan allow us to adjust when conditions change and there s no big bet strategy that we have employed for over a decade now has served us well in our ability to be flexible and so when you lock in a three year filing on a system like the gas system where you can have dynamism maybe you ve got new regulations maybe there s an incident somewhere else in the country that reprioritizes our system and our investment strategy i personally like the flexibility of an annual filing that allows us to go ahead and adjust as necessary now the simplicity of a filing if you ve got multiyear plans certainly can be appealing and if our commission was leaning that way and they really preferred that then of course we would work with them on that but i think the idea that we re dynamic and so is our plan has more relevance to our ability to deliver consistently david fishman goldman sachs analyst ok that makes sense and then the other item just on the filing i thought you guys did a good job of linking out your expectation for kind of cost reductions starting in 2021 kind of through the 2020s we ve heard a lot about on the electric side the potential fuel cost savings in o m but i was wondering if you could kind of elaborate a little bit following kind of the extensive review what kind of buckets or drivers and trajectory you re seeing at the natural gas side and the 2020s patti poppe president and chief executive officer yeah i d say the natural gas side it s all about the efficiency of getting the work done and with every dollar of capital there s still associated o m that comes with that so when we can make our capital more efficient we can make our o m more efficient so we continue to work on our unit cost on driving our unit cost on reducing waste from our the ability to execute work our leak backlog and leak response is a large o m expense and so when we make the capital investments that reduce vintage services and service lines and vintage mains for example we re able to reduce operating costs and we just completed also a large capital project on our automated meter reading for our gas meters and that helps reduce o m expense as well that obviously reduces the daily walkthrough of someone s backyard and walking down into their basement to read their meter we cannot do drive by meter reads that s significantly more efficient and safer for our workforce so there s lots of operating expense benefits to waste elimination in the gas business as well david fishman goldman sachs analyst great thank you those are my questions patti poppe president and chief executive officer thanks operator the next question will come from andrew levi with exodus point please go ahead andrew levi exoduspoint analyst hey good morning i guess this patti poppe president and chief executive officer good morning andrew levi exoduspoint analyst just on enerbank obviously rejji we ve discussed kind of the company before just what are your thoughts as far as the pros of keeping it versus the pros of potentially not keeping it patti poppe president and chief executive officer you know andrew enerbank is really a value part of the cms family they had a great year and that s really what we think about enerbank they re a great contribution here last year and in many years in the past andrew levi exoduspoint analyst ok thank you operator ladies and gentlemen this concludes our question and answer session i would like to return the conference back to patti poppe for any closing remarks patti poppe president and chief executive officer well thanks chad and thanks again everyone for joining us this morning we certainly look forward to seeing you throughout the year 2020 s going to be a great one thanks so much operator and thank you duration 64 minutes call

with the impeachment trial the coronavirus and the iowa caucuses in the news dry economic statistics aren t getting much attention right now but two new reports the latest gross domestic product figures from the commerce department and a new set of budget projections from the congressional budget office shouldn t be allowed to pass without comment indeed the issues they raise should be central to the 2020 election the core of donald trump s platform is that his policies have produced what he touts as the greatest economy in american history the truth is very different by enacting a huge tax cut in late 2017 that was heavily slanted toward corporations and the rich trump and the republicans gave the economy a temporary boost in 2018 it grew at an annual rate of 2 9 per cent that has now faded in the fourth quarter of last year g d p the broadest measure of activity in the economy expanded at an annual rate of 2 1 per cent the new report from the commerce department showed taking 2019 as a whole g d p grew at 2 3 per cent these growth rates are nowhere near the four per cent growth that trump promised in 2016 instead they are in line with the average growth rate since 2000 which is 2 2 per cent and this ho hum outcome has only been achieved at a tremendous cost the federal government is now running an enormous budget deficit and accumulating vast amounts of new debt which will burden taxpayers for decades to come after three years of trump s presidency in fact the united states is starting to look like one of his highly indebted business ventures this year the new report from the c b o says the deficit will be about a trillion dollars ten years from now it will be roughly 1 3 trillion numbers like these are so big that they are hard to take in the way economists make sense of them is by comparing the dollar amount to the level of g d p much like a family might compare its mortgage to its income if you do this you can see just how out of whack with history the trump presidency really is according to the c b o s projections the budget deficit will be 4 6 per cent of g d p this year and by 2030 it will have risen to 5 4 per cent of g d p before trump took office the united states had never run sustained deficits of this magnitude except during wars when spending on armaments and other items increased sharply or during economic slumps when tax receipts plummeted other than a six year period during and immediately after world war ii the deficit over the past century has not exceeded 4 0 percent for more than five consecutive years the c b o report notes and during the past 50 years deficits have averaged 1 5 percent of gdp when the economy was relatively strong as it is now what about the level of government debt because of the large deficits federal debt held by the public is projected to grow from 81 percent of gdp in 2020 to 98 percent in 2030 its highest percentage since 1946 the c b o report says by 2050 debt would be 180 percent of gdp far higher than it has ever been it s no secret what happened during the early nineteen nineties to some of trump s business ventures including the taj mahal casino in atlantic city and the plaza on central park south they went bankrupt under the weight of the debts he had piled on them is the same fate in store for the united states probably not fortunately with interest rates at near record lows servicing large debts is easier than it used to be and in any case governments have financing options that are unavailable to private businesses such as raising taxes or in extremis having the central bank issue money and purchase bonds
to reunify a polarized peninsula complex warfare with korean characteristics thomas a drohan introduction using concepts of complex warfare from previous swj articles on china and japan this article applies the same holistic approach to korean security strategies in the information environment with comparisons to strategies from china and japan to discern how the koreas wage complex warfare using both cooperation and confrontation today we ll start with world view threat assessment and combined effects strategy understanding these aspects of the information environment is critical to producing superior effects the great results test of any power or actor korea s world view threat assessment and combined effects strategy world view both koreas share a common world view that attends to main power alignment while emphasizing self reliance each of these considerations refracts differently in the contrasting political systems of totalitarian north korea and democratic south korea the historical context of this world view remains extremely influential today for five thousand years inhabitants of the korean peninsula have dealt with prying neighbors through strategies of cooperation and confrontation predatory powers are fixtures in a korean information environment where peninsular alignment or alliance is seen as pivotal to neighborly calculations of security location and neighbors matter korean civilization developed in between expansionist empires and nation states consequently korean rulers have had to manage multiple centers of power to eke out sovereignty korean society is a resilient fabric one that has been repeatedly stretched torn and repaired in response to foreign invasions and occupations the rugged peninsula and outlying islands have been contentious territory among the koreas china russia japan and western powers main power alignment in describing the pragmatic practice of aligning with a major power the term sadaejuui attending to the big power is popularly evoked the meaning is often derisive its contemporary use tends to portray major powers condescending attitudes toward koreans with the latter having to placate the major powers dating back to korean dynasties as tributaries of chinese empires the connotation is that of being controlled after resisting and ultimately giving in to a stronger power in the late 19th century choson dynasty for instance there were two main political parties the sadae main power party in korea was status quo which prior to japan s defeat of china in the sino japanese war 1894 1895 meant pro china the domestic opposition was the reformist and pro japan kaehwa enlightenment party for korean leaders successfully managing the influence of a foreign power meant aligning with another power in their midst foreign interference remains a contentious issue today this utilitarian ethic of aligning with a main power clashes with other societal beliefs from neo confucianism and religious principles to community based populism pride in national autonomy stores intense feelings and fuels outrage which power ought to be confronted and which accommodated if any which parties factions and individuals can be trusted and under what conditions how can sovereignty be protected and reconciled with the interests of resented foreign powers these questions test deeply held concerns and convictions in korean society in both north and south korea sadaejuui characterizes a fundamental practice of korean security no official documents admit the term in contrast to this grudgingly recognized national interest self reliance is an ingrained value self reliance in north korea self reliance is officially known as juche a vague concept designed to legitimize the kim dynasty apart from its monolithic role as kim il sung ism juche s tangible facets include revenue generating activities pyongyang actively promotes money laundering narcotics smuggling counterfeiting human trafficking illegal weapons sales and other lucrative crimes tragically hate generating propaganda covers for the lack of national self reliance with respect to basic needs such as food water shelter health and electricity since the massive famine of the mid 1990s north koreans self reliance includes the not so secret embrace of illicit private capitalism in south korea assorted conceptions of self reliance float freely about from the traditional jagileul uijihaneun depending on oneself to business diversification strategies jageub ui self sufficiency to self absorbed honjok loner tribe korean cultural narratives on both sides of the de militarized zone emphasize confucian principles such as loyalty resolve harmony and justice priorities begin with the family ties that help manage life s challenges figurative analogies describe the environment as interrelated opposites um light hot and yang dark cold people are expected to accept the immutable and shape the changeable confrontation is natural a practical complement to cooperation achieving that relative harmony has been a continuous national struggle against the oft reminded 900 invasions 117 a cultivated heritage of having borne the brunt of injustices reinforces societal awareness of vulnerability and the need to compete korean ancestry includes a minjok ethnic nation identity rooted in a strong and just legendary founder king tangun mythical equivalent to china s emperors claiming a mandate of heaven and japan s sun goddess amaterasu another identity is minjung the people which conjures up populist struggles against oppression both constructs promote a self reliance imbued with values of resilience and endurance to build a strong nation capable of facing down threats threat assessment the main threat to koreans has been external invasion in the forms of chinese control russian and western probes and japanese colonization koreans have assessed foreign powers from a frame of sadaejuui and self reliance countering threats has involved both confrontation and cooperation invasions invasions of korean territory date back to china s han dynasty in 109 bc a period of aggressive expansion following the qin dynasty s unification of warring states in 221 bc sui and tang dynasty emperors launched several campaigns to subdue koreans during a period of three korean kingdoms silla paekche koguryo 57 bc 668 this contested history stirs a textbook war today koreans arguably first unified dynasty silla 668 935 was followed by koryo 935 1392 and choson 1392 1910 each dynasty confronted and cooperated with chinese russian and japanese empires to win sovereign prerogatives china s yuan dynasty mongols led invasions of korea in 1231 imposing indirect control that subjugation was followed by china s ming dynasty suzerainty until 1644 large scale japanese invasions 1592 1597 were eventually defeated however the manchus defeat of the ming brought the qing dynasty to china 1644 1912 and new invasions to choson japan s defeat of qing china in 1895 and russia in 1905 led to outright colonization of the korean peninsula 1910 1945 the stream of invasions has left indelible marks on the korean psyche as a way to characterize their impact we refer to two types of threat patterns they are described in terms of being viewed from outside the peninsula inward and then from the inside out patterns the basic outside in threat pattern has been external powers exploiting lack of domestic unity in korea to dominate the peninsula or deny it to their rivals here are a few examples from modern history great britain blocked a russian navy attempt to establish a base on tsushima island in 1861 china restricted russian diplomatic access in korea until 1884 japan defeated china 1895 115 118 and russia 1905 154 155 colonizing korea until 1945 the ussr and us accepted japan s surrender separately to occupy korea in halves 1945 in 1945 korean efforts to reunify their country evaporated in new big power disagreements the moscow agreement december 1945 had planned a five year trusteeship of four external powers the us ussr china and great britain however the joint us ussr commission charged with implementing the moscow agreement was very much the arena of ideological warfare the soviets refused to include non communist groups in the formation of a provisional korean government they subsequently rejected united nations resolution 112 which called for general elections to express the will of the korean people instead moscow reached in to groom kim il sung a soviet army anti japanese guerrilla fighter in manchuria as their proxy in pyongyang with russian support kim out maneuvered rivals to head the korean workers party and become premier of the democratic republic of north korea in the south united nations monitored elections brought anti communist rhee syng man into power as the first president of the republic of korea rhee had prepared by leading the provisional korean provisional government in shanghai while in exile 1919 1939 mostly from hawaii the basic inside out threat pattern has been koreans focusing on their common former colonizer and seeking externally favorable conditions to reunite the peninsula both korean leaders saw japan and each other as threats to a unified korea and sought reunification on their own terms kim il sung was necessarily aligned with the ussr josef stalin and prudently chose to curry china s favor mao zedong as well kim regarded us support of the south as the next greatest threat he garnered stalin s support under a wary assumption of no us intervention 33 34 rhee suffered the cost of perceived dealignment from his presumed patron power the united states south korea appeared isolated from outside support after us secretary of state dean acheson described a defensive perimeter excluding the korean peninsula within six months kim il sung invaded the south june 1950 ironically acheson s comments may have been calibrated to gain congressional approval for korean aid armistice both korean leaders saw japan and each other as threats to a unified korea and craved reunification on their own terms kim il sung necessarily aligned with the ussr josef stalin and currying china s favor mao zedong regarded us support of the south as the next greatest threat he garnered stalin s support under a wary assumption of no us intervention 33 34 rhee suffered the cost of perceived dealignment from his presumed protector the united states within six months of us secretary of state dean acheson s press club remark that described a defensive perimeter excluding the korean peninsula kim il sung invaded the south june 1950 ironically acheson s comments may have been calibrated to gain congressional approval for korean aid after three years of fighting that saw chinese forces save north korea from outright defeat a military armistice stopped most hostilities in 1953 no peace treaty was signed while rhee pointlessly rejected the armistice 38 kim blamed wartime failures on conspirators and methodically consolidated his power by eliminating externally aligned domestic factions ever since north korea s kim led syndicate has used every opportunity to eliminate domestic threats and manipulate main power rivalries south korean leaders have taken variable approaches to domestic threats and managed main power relations with non coercive methods next we describe each korea s assessment of threat in turn note that there is no mutual diplomatic recognition between north korea and south korea each state claims to be the sole legitimate government on the peninsula north korea north korea is notorious for using violence to create and control threats a congressional research service report tallies thousands of armed infiltrations at least three presidential assassination attempts nearly 500 kidnappings two large scale bombings assorted murders of south korean civilians and military personnel politically timed missile launches and nuclear detonations and threats to devastate south korea japan and the united states add to that the kim regime s use of force against its own citizens 100 000 political prisoners in labor camps and massive human rights violations pyongyang s violent blend of sadaejuui and self reliance is manifested in the foreign policy behavior of its three successive kims kim il sung great leader posthumously eternal president his eldest son kim jong il dear leader posthumously eternal general secretary and his youngest son kim jong un 2011 present dear respected comrade as of this writing synopses of the leaders follow 1 kim il sung 1948 1994 manipulated china to support his invasion of the south 1950 precluding mao s liberation of taiwan kim 1 s war engaged and entrapped china prompting mao to supplicate stalin for resources postwar aid and north korean mass labor spurred reconstruction of a great leader iconic capitol factories and cooperatives kim signed chinese and soviet friendship treaties 1961 and invoked threats to inspire forced labor and his own bloodline ideology economic growth exceeded the south s until 1965 before the ussr s collapse kim secured russian nuclear training a research reactor and debt deferments then he requested chinese technology kindle loc 93 109 of 5256 he died just before a planned first ever summit with a south korean president 6 kim young sam 2 kim jong il 1994 2011 eldest son of kim il sung had been designated successor since 1980 absent the military credibility of the great leader kim 2 master narrated a pseudo confucianist fantasy in which he gifted basic needs to his people he actually provided mismanaged projects massive famine and economic decline despite china s call for pyongyang to conform to its denuclearization commitment and back to the six party talks the dear leader achieved his father s goal of an independent nuclear weapon 2006 his shift to a songun military first policy compelled mass nationalism 7 presumably for reunification he accepted a us proposal to hold six party talks 2003 2007 seeing its six rounds and calling its bluff with a nuclear hand detonation 2 2009 3 kim jong un 2011 present youngest son of kim jong il was named successor comparatively late 2009 without the party connections of the dear leader his byungin policy 2012 para 6 calls for the dual pursuit of economic development and nuclear weapons this ambitious departure from a phased approach probably placates power brokers kim 3 has met with president xi jinping four times including once in pyongyang despite xi s objection to nuclear tests 3 in 2013 4 and 5 in 2016 6 in 2017 the young leader has had two summits apiece with president moon jae in and president donald trump plus a short notice meeting held a summit with president vladimir putin proposed four party talks and now claims thermonuclear tipped solid fueled intercontinental ballistic missiles south korea south korean administrations have balanced north korean american chinese and russian relations by modulating military economic and political priorities forty years of military dominated

threats via integration include the northeast asia plus community of responsibility new northern policy and new southern policy as the kim dynasty to the north builds its nuclear capability south koreans also debate the possibility of an independent nuclear deterrent combined effects strategy as a reminder of the complex warfare model introduced previously the following diagram depicts the eight basic types of effects interacting among sentient actors in the information environment these effects are cooperative dissuade persuade secure induce and confrontational deter compel defend coerce each desired effect may be brought about using any instrument of power diplomatic informational military economic social in comparison to 17 chinese and two japanese cases of combined effects discussed in earlier papers we consider two inter related korean examples from a common perspective of achieving reunification a north korea nuclear and complex threats north korea south korea us china japan 1953 now b south korea occupation of dokdo japan takeshima 1952 now and ieodo china suyan 1987 now both cases reflect korean struggles to achieve a reunification this assumption requires a caveat in south korea where globalization is reducing some incentives for reunification increasingly south koreans favor peaceful coexistence over reunification with a reactionary regime in north korea party propaganda exhorts an inured population to sacrifice for reunification many factors affect reunification such as main power alignments various forms of self reliance territorial disputes financial costs all domain weapons programs economic development and transnational linkages to account for this complexity yet also recommend decisions we analyze the cases in three parts historical background of each case combined effects strategy of north korea and south korea and interacting strategies of north korea south korea the united states china japan and russia historical background a north korean nuclear and complex threats in november of 1950 five months after north korea s invasion of the south chairman kim il sung absorbed president harry truman s threat to consider using atomic weapons the subsequent lack of us will to use the weapon that ended the pacific war and china s will to massively intervene with ground troops led to the armistice 1953 within a decade the soviet union had provided north korea technical training and a nuclear research reactor this effort was followed in 1964 by china s first nuclear weapon detonation by then all foreign troops except technical advisors had left north korea with domestic room to maneuver two developments pushed kim to achieve an independent nuclear capability first there were ideological differences among pyongyang purges of pro china soviet communists moscow de stalinization perestroika and glasnost nationalist capitalism and beijing post mao reforms nationalist socialist capitalism north korea s main patrons were developing politically and economically second both main powers were unreliable as allies the ussr was non committal china was difficult to work with on an equal basis and neither supported another north korean attempt at reunification in south korea leaders generally desired closer ties with american democratic capitalism all wanted an in place tripwire that committed the us to defending against another north korean invasion the same resident us influence however presented a problematic image of obliging us interests too much any alignment with us policy was subject to criticism for being too much sadaejuui and not enough self reliance us pressure for instance had prevented south korea from acquiring nuclear weapons seemingly locking seoul into a permanent us military presence in contrast the non resident ussr then non resident but closeby china actively supported north korea s nuclear program in addition both communist regimes enacted domestic reforms that kim ism would not so even though russian ties never included commitments to actually defend north korea moscow s socialist credentials remain important to pyongyang in 1989 chairman mikhail gorbachev s policy reversal that demanded north korea pay market prices for soviet oil shocked north korea s command economy however it was the specter of russian liberalization that kim saw as the greater threat similarly china s peace treaty with south korea 1992 shocked north korea diplomatically however it was beijing s post tiananmen massacre reforms that mattered more to kim the reforms strengthened communist party control of state capitalism a fix that suited pyongyang s first special economic zone rason 1991 designed to attract foreign investment in both cases the absence of chinese and soviet tripwire forces in north korea itself a deliberate kim policy designed to prevent foreign influence provided pyongyang more domestic freedom of action this domestic space empowered kim to manipulate both great powers using all instruments of national power north korea has used that maneuver space to break every agreement it has signed and to develop weapons of mass effects the payloads are nuclear biological chemical high explosive and cyber information see the arms control association s chronology of nuclear and missile programs here beginning with the 1985 non proliferation treaty up to its current pledge to denuclearize and stop long range missile tests north korea s record is to threaten promise dare demand deny and deceive all while conceding nothing in return meanwhile pyongyang continues to develop and leverage nuclear weapons biological weapons chemical weapons high explosive missiles and cyber theft kim jong un is positioned to demand an end to economic sanctions and retention of his nuclear weapons capability north korean strategy is poised to use nuclear weapons as much more than weapons of mass destruction there are many effects that do not risk retaliatory destruction mass effects weapons are part of pyongyang s basic cause and prevent strategy a cause confrontation among main powers primarily the us and china and to a lesser degree russia and japan b to prevent domestic intervention by any main power this strategy aims to ensure the kim dynasty s survival as an independent korean regime capable of achieving reunification b south korea s occupation of dokdo and ieodo since 1954 a year after us forces stopped using dokdo as a bombing range south korean forces have occupied its two small main islands located 135 miles east of the korean peninsula south korea s dokdo research institute proclaims ten truths about dokdo not known in japan the basis for these claims are ancient references to an island claimed to be dokdo followed by settlers in ulleungdo who named the rocks dok stone french russian british and japanese passers by also name claimed them 75 as liancourt rocks 1849 olivutsa rocks 1854 hornet rocks 1855 and takeshima 1905 respectively japan s ministry of foreign affairs makes detailed claims about takeshima dokdo dating back to the mid 17th century all of which are rejected by south korea s ministry of foreign affairs either as a matter for negotiation or for judicial settlement ieodo is a submerged rock where the claimed exclusive economic zones of china and south korea overlap the spot is 93 miles southwest of south korea s mara island and 178 miles from china s yushan island while the south korean government proposes that the midpoint be based on respective coastlines china s authoritarian regime insists on factoring in population and length of coastline just as dokdo is wrapped up in japan s colonization of south korea ieodo s context re signals imperial china s control over korean territory south korea s placement of a plaque 1951 and beacon 1987 and construction of an oceanographic research facility 2001 and helipad 2003 enable a degree of operational control seoul proactively deters and fiercely defends against illegal chinese fishing no doubt intensified by chinese economic and territorial designs on north korea china s threats to use force to block south korean forces from exercising in its own territorial waters 302 with us forces add to seoul s well founded suspicion north korea s coercion infusion strategy the chart below provides examples of north korean dimes wide all domain effects and activities that generate them these combinations of effects largely coerce domestic and main power targets in the following pattern dimes elements are capitalized to highlight instruments of power diplomatically north korea compels and coerces adversaries and persuades and induces partners tools for coercion tend to be provocations that threaten military actions or provide territorial access tools for persuasion generally consist of diatribes and visits backed by diplomatic bag bribes coercion is ever present infused information is crafted to compel and coerce adversaries and persuade partners diplomatic and informational coercion are force multiplier infusions for state sponsored crime to induce economic transactions and investment domestically authorities social persuasion is less purely ideological as in kim il sung s day and more pragmatic the proliferation of market exchanges and portable foreign information chapter 2 competes with payoffs nepotism and surveillance technology external social persuasion directed toward foreign actors seems limited to the provision of labor where that is risked against un sanctions table 1 north korea dimes wide all domain effects south korea s inducement led strategy south korean effects and activities are relatively ad hoc except for military deterrence and defense which have been deliberately planned and well sustained seoul musters combinations of effects in the following pattern diplomacy is persuasive when dialogues policies and information shape main powers interests tools for persuasion include a globalizing economy cultural social appeal and activities that enhance both peninsular and continental security information campaigns persuade actors of seoul s resolve with respect to territorial integrity dialogue based reunification and global economic competition military deterrence and defense focus more narrowly on territorial threats even as diplomatic informational and economic effects broaden in geographic scope externally directed social effects are a product of south korea s economic success and talent in contrast to north korea south korea s domestic social foundation is becoming multi racial pyongyang s racist nationalism seeks to exploit this demographic as if it were a vulnerability table 2 south korea dimes wide all domain effects interacting strategies using our description of patterns and details from the two tables above we anticipate how korean strategies interact in terms of effects first let s identify best current and future synergies best synergies north korea s current synergy is to coercively envelop south korea s military deterrence and defense with broader effects while controlling information in north korea and exploiting divisions among relevant powers the latter are south korea the us japan china and russia pyongyang is executing this strategy of manufactured hostility the overall combination of external envelopment and exploitation and internal protection creates opportunities to out maneuver main powers and build a degree of self reliance juche juche has been an economic failure in providing basic necessities but a success with respect to the ability to punish people this depraved punishment is a tragic form of self reliance that ordinary north koreans bear table 1 provides examples of how pyongyang elites combine these various cooperative and confrontational effects of compellence inducement persuasion and coercion nuclear and other mass effects weapons enable north korea s strategy but the critical element is information control the kim regime s ideology relies on near total control of information a problematic requirement we can expect any decentralized engagement therefore to be regarded as a threat that assessment is a strategic vulnerability to the extent that resilient command and control relies on distributed authorities to out compete adversary strategies future kim cronyism will need to be flexible such as promoting initiative within its narrative while tolerating self interested loyalty the expansion of private markets is a potential indicator of such informal flexibility even though it departs from kim il sung ism given this ideological contradiction we can expect to see an expansion of delegated authority among trusted elites to extend the regime s monitoring of information this broadened oversight may accommodate more cooperation and less confrontation kim jong un appears to be doing this as new and formerly corrupt practices stretch his power base south korea s ideal synergy would be if seoul and washington agreed on combining cooperative and confrontational effects such as a sunshine policy with non negotiable alliance exercises that type of combination has been rare and temporary instead we see seoul policies that partly suit washington priorities and partly accommodate north korean and chinese priorities such as us south korea military exercises in rote scenarios the north massively invades the south again that do not address ongoing threats from china russia and north korea cyber attacks political interference military incursions therefore seoul s best future oriented combined effect is to globally induce pyongyang to conform to international norms by expanding economic and political engagement around north korea engagement with north korea should occur in a global rather than exclusively bilateral context engage to shape networks actors that flaunt international norms while mouthing them such as china under xi and russia under putin are the main challenge table 2 contains examples of how seoul can generate such a northern policy type effect via all tools persuasion military deterrence and defense and economic inducements our next section answers the question how will pyongyang s coercive envelopment interact with seoul s global inducement coercion meets inducement for north korea the coercive envelopment that it takes to out compete south korean global inducement requires economic modernization and unprecedented control over information achieving total control of the domestic information environment even for the kim regime is not possible if contested let s see why under the kim 3 regime so far north korea s envelopment strategy relies on two major activities first the strategy foments main power rivalries to counter and circumvent the south korea us alliance s military deterrence and defense a rising china can limit us power projection however from north korea s standpoint this is not preferable to us military superiority china not the us claims territory also claimed by north korea gando mount paektu yalu and tumen rivers and the yellow sea whether china or the united states has the advantage in a particular domain is not as relevant to pyongyang as keeping main power rivalries simmering a military standoff among main powers and a nuclear north korea leaves pyongyang more room for diplomatic and information maneuver if pyongyang succeeds in eliminating economic sanctions with the support of china and russia its options expand a limited north korean nuclear capability does not change that calculation with respect to nuclear armed main powers though it might create a new one japan if tokyo were to consider a nuclear deterrent that controversy would also provide pyongyang more opportunities to divide the main powers second pyongyang must prevent north korean elites and the public from accessing more and more information the former may be bought off but the population cannot be compensated or suppressed as portable technologies provide access to more sources of information economic development creates more information financial trade manufacturing and services all potential sources of power although north korea does not have restless minorities as in china pyongyang easily could have a restless majority as expectations exceed incentives how the kim regime s envelopment strategy requires more information and more control to out perform main powers kim s top down orchestration of diplomacy information and military activities relies on information dominance at home the social foundation for this environment is uncontested domestic control eliminating economic sanctions to open opportunities for growth can undermine pyongyang s control even if it also feeds a mass effects arsenal pyongyang will be forced to modernize its control of domestic information while chinese and russian information controls certainly provide different techniques for repression the technologies can be contested in ways that are difficult to stop as pyongyang continues to foment main power rivalries and tighten domestic control over information technology the need for economic integration becomes acute increasingly competitive economies need instantly transparent access to information criminal economies such as north korea s can be reduced via international enforcement self reliance in nuclear capability however may be possible how does pyongyang s coercion plus strategy compare to seoul s strategy of global inducement as with most democracies south korea struggles to maintain a consistent or coherent policy over time a global inducement strategy however can exploit the trends it helps create in this respect political and economic engagement on the eurasian continent and throughout the indo pacific are critical to surrounding north korea with korean branded success the sustained set of combined effects detailed in table 2 can out perform north korea s coercion heavy hand with its greater breadth and depth inducement can prevail over coercion as long as seoul has a credible military deterrent and defense economic growth is key to sustaining the strategy south korea s economy is capable of increasing its defense outlays to provide a convincing conventional superiority pyongyang elites know this political will however has been variable the military aspect of us south korean relations has indeed provided credible capability and leadership seoul needs nuclear deterrence extended us or organic the us extended deterrent can continue to underwrite south korea s economic success at a domestic political cost of self reliance and main power alignment yet strategic effects that result in desired north korean behavior matter most in that regard the economic growth and military alliance have not prevented nuclearization a better approach is to coordinate a synergistic strategy that involves all instruments of power global inducement requires expansive diplomatic and economic engagement which in turn requires more than peninsular deterrence and defense the military alliance with the us has enabled south korea s economic and technological development and promoted democratic civil military relationships for the us the benefits of the alliance are also dimes wide and should be appreciated from that broad perspective what types of military activities can combine with what types of non military activities to cause north korean de nuclearization a superior strategy of south korean global inducement is the place to start conclusions our holistic approach to strategy in the information environment considered how the koreas wage effective complex warfare through cooperation and confrontation we applied a common world view to both koreas main power alignment sadaejuui and self reliance juche and freely formed concepts that blends pragmatic interests with socially conditioned values this korean worldview refracts through starkly different political economic systems that struggle to retain sovereignty amidst interventionist powers reunification remains a common goal of north and south korea but on vastly different terms and specific conceptions of threat threat assessments which historically have been directed against invasions and domestic interference by main powers reflect strongly contested narratives narratives shape social perceptions and contain assumptions about enduring threats to korean sovereignty north korea s violent mix of sadaejuui and juche creates threats that underpin a cultish ideology of sole source rule self reliance is supposed to reinforce exclusive trust in us the kim family this construction of permanent threats selectively draws from a history of predatory powers the social manufacturing of threats is rigidly intolerant of domestic dissent to the extent that the kim regime is uncontested at home it is therefore free to manipulate main power relations this in turn helps preserve its idiosyncratic rule and set more conditions for reunification south korea s blend of sadaejuui and self reliance has been externally non violent and internally transformative economic success protected by credible military alliance with a main power the us has fueled a vibrant democracy and globalizing economy as a result seoul s main power alignment has broadened to include positive relations with all main powers self reliance is networked a business practice that generates diverse strategies to deal with competitive threats the combined effects strategies of the two koreas reflect these disparate approaches to assessing threats north korea seeks to coercively envelop the south korea us alliance with a two pronged approach pyongyang attempts to 1 compel and induce adversaries via provocations that threaten coercion and 2 persuade and induce partners via territorial access and illicit transactions that enrich its loyal elite domestically control over information sells a racist nationalism as morally legitimate south korea s strategy is one of global inducement seoul attempts to persuade and induce adversaries and partners via a globalizing economy and cultural appeal military alliance with the us deters and defends against the use of force on south korean territory a multi racial society is beginning to emerge one that will transform south korean identity in a complex domestic and global context comparing both strategies pyongyang is executing its best synergy of coop frontation while seoul either cooperates or confronts us efforts to do the same are seldom in step relative to the south the north has been able to orchestrate diplomatic informational military economic and social activities that seize the initiative and shape future outcomes the south s strategy creates its own synergistic effects but struggles to sustain them over the long term due to changing political priorities what can be done recommendations as the two strategies interact seoul s global inducement can prevail over pyongyang s coercive envelopment by exploiting the north s basic dilemma north korea s core problem is that it must simultaneously modernize its system of controlling domestic information and manipulate main powers the kim regime s authoritarianism creates a dilemma of undesirable alternatives a politically risky modernization or b increasing dependence on modernizing main powers whether north korea achieves both authoritarian modernization and national independence is not a matter of self reliance the outcome depends upon the strategies of other powers we propose the following two options for south korea and the united states first seoul and washington should agree on maintaining economic sanctions as long as pyongyang refuses to de nuclearize economic sanctions accelerate the kim regime s need to embrace capitalist reforms even if in corrupt forms sooner or later however a sunshine inspired south korean president will relax economic sanctions in the hope that the north will eventually de nuclearize this risky step might be insured by the technological feasibility of a countervailing south korean nuclear deterrent second seoul and washington should agree on how to cooperate with and confront north korea china and russia this politically ambitious course can induce the dilemma of north korean strategy the effort could combine the moon administration s new northern policy and the trump administration s and japan s abe administration s free and open indo pacific foip concepts converting these policies into effective strategies would require operationalizing them in terms of specific effects such as inducement for instance the foip vision of ensuring peace and security 22 23 by protecting the maritime domain should include exercises that develop capabilities to induce territorial withdrawal not just to deter and defend against territorial invasion this nuance means orchestrating military actions in concert with diplomatic informational economic and social activities in a similar fashion the new northern policy should specify what it intends to prevent and what it intends to cause in terms of inducing behavior broader relationships need to be considered as well such as the south korea china japan summit the us japan alliance and the australia india japan us quad building options along the eurasian pacific edge can help moderate the periodic rupturing of south korea japan relations that pyongyang is keen to exploit in comparison to north korea s dilemma south korea s dilemma is not between undesirable modernization and undesirable over dependence on main powers south korea s dilemma is between a an increasingly distinct south korean nation state compared to north korea and b a reunified korean state of two nations both of these alternatives are undesirable to different groups in south korea option a is where south koreans are today dealing with the world s most authoritarian regime armed with nuclear weapons bent on coercive reunification option b will require significant financial costs political reforms and unprecedented cooperation among main powers however a reunified korea could become a global power in its own right seoul s inducement strategy is a characteristic pathway to that goal a combined effects approach to complex warfare offers a broad perspective to holistically grasp and analyze contemporary strategies as we argued in previous articles on china and japan superior strategy involves comparing threats and integrating effects and considering all instruments of power across all domains

size and an oil price rally helped to boost local equity market in chile a reduction in violence coupled with a strong intervention program announced by the central bank of chile were the main drivers of market performance mexico underperformed the latin america region in december with declining gdp gross domestic product and pmi purchasing managers index hitting its lowest level since the us election in this context banxico dropped interest rates 25 basis points for the fourth time in 2019 peru was the worst performer in the region the company s stock selection in brazil was the largest contributor to relative returns in december while allocation to mexico weighed on relative performance the most an overweight position in companhia de locacao das americas a brazilian company engaged in the leasing of motor vehicles was the top contributor on a relative basis as the stock benefits from high growth of several sub divisions from the car rental segment good management policy and attractive valuations our holding in via varejo a brazilian retailer of electronics and furniture was also amongst the top contributors to performance during the month as the stock rose benefitting from the turnaround of the firm s e commerce platform under the new management and a record number of black friday sales the holding of ternium a manufacturer of flat and long steel products in mexico was the top detractor on a relative basis as steel price was down over the month and the stock gave up some of its gains in previous months our overweight position in cemex a mexican multinational building materials company also weighed on returns as the stock underperformed in december we continue to like the stock given strong us housing data the potential for improving economic trends in mexico the company s announcement that it plans to sell its kentucky plant as part of efforts to deleverage their balance sheet and attractive valuations over the month we added to grupo aeroportuario del pacifico the mexican airport operator which should benefit from a larger than expected tariff increase and a more pragmatic and business friendly regulatory stance in mexico we initiated a position in lojas americanas a brazilian retail chain after we attended their investor day in rio de janeiro and came away impressed with the strategy to grow in e commerce and improvements made to the convenience store business model we cut our holding in neonergia a brazilian utility services company by taking profits after the stock s strong performance we also sold our holding of enel chile an electric energy company taking advantage of its recent outperformance and locking in profits the portfolio ended the month being overweight to brazil and mexico while being underweight to chile peru colombia and argentina at the sector level we are overweight to consumer discretionary and real estate we are underweight financials and materials brazil continues to display a constructive environment in congress to advance president jair bolsonaro s ambitious set of fiscal and administrative reforms we maintain the view that brazil is on the path of modest economic recovery backed by structural tailwinds including an uptick in private investment a significant increase in oil production and increased formal job creation in mexico economic growth has grinded to a halt as the private sector has reigned in investment related to president lopez obrador s uncertain policy initiatives we see equity valuations in mexico trading at multi year lows reflecting lower growth environment and look towards easing monetary policy and eventual approval of usmca united states mexico canada trade agreement in north america and the launch of a national infrastructure plan as catalysts to improve business sentiment in peru we are underweight as we see negative newsflow on politics as president vizcarra s initiatives to dissolve congress continues to result in further political uncertainty leading to reduced business confidence the company has recently reduced its underweight position in colombia as valuations and economic stability has led to intriguing investment opportunities argentina s presidential transition continues to present uncertainty and we look to take advantage of opportunities arising from volatility and extreme pessimism in the near term finally we remain comfortable with an underweight position in chile amidst a background of protests related to social inequality and signs of economic growth deceleration in the economy while the political landscape in latin america continues to present both opportunities and challenges in equity markets we are encouraged as the external environment appears to support asset prices due to reduction in trade tensions between the u s and china and global coordination to maintain low interest rates supporting economic expansion sources 1blackrock as at 31 december 2019 2datastream as at 31 december 2019 31 january

pound sterling live bank of england keeps rates on hold gbp jumps surprise as bank in decisive vote to keep rates unchanged sterling bid higher bank sees signs of pick up in economy looming budget announcement a key part in keeping rates unchanged above boe governor mark carney image bank of england spot rates at time of writing gbp eur 1 0808 1 75 gbp usd 1 1852 2 15 bank transfer rates indicative gbp eur 1 0520 1 0596 gbp usd 1 1537 1 1620 specialist money transfer rates indicative gbp eur 1 0650 1 0701 gbp usd 1 1650 1 1745 more details the british pound advanced against its key rivals thursday after the bank of england opted to keep interest rates unchanged at their january 30 meeting saying they saw early signs that the uk economy was picking up some fresh momentum in the wake of the december 12 general election this was perhaps the most difficult meeting to predict for many years with money market pricing suggesting odds of a rate cut were at 50 50 heading into the meeting meaning which ever way the bank opted to go they would deliver a surprise the bigger the surprise the more pronounced the currency market reaction is likely to be hence we are seeing moves of over a percent against the australian dollar and new zealand dollar the official bank rate was kept at 0 75 in what eventually turned out to be a relatively hawkish event in that only two members of the nine strong monetary policy committee mpc opted to cut rates the 7 2 vote will come as a surprise as it suggests those mpc members who warned earlier in janaury that rates might need to come down have ultimately been convinced that the recent pickup in uk economic activity might be more enduring that more members did not vote for a rate cut appears to suggest there is no imminent likelihood of lower rates and this is seen to be behind an initial boost in sterling value michael saunders and jonathan haskel were the two mpc members who voted for a cut to rates the message from the bank was that they saw signs that the uk economy had picked up some traction since december s election while a stabilisation in the global economy meant there was no need to provide stimulus via lower interest rates above sterling euro rallies on the boe decision confirming the market guages the outcome to be relatively hawkish i e the prospect of lower interest rates in the near future is falling sterling set off higher on basis that no additional members called for a cut this time round 7 2 in favour of hold despite comments from the likes of vlieghe tenreyro and carney himself suggesting that further accommodation in the short term may be warranted says john goldie fx strategist at argentex group plc for the pound a cut was likely needed to warrant a concerted move lower while the upside appears to remain capped by the recent range highs especially on gbp eur and gpb usd the bank said in a statement that majority of members on the mpc expect further recovery in near term growth amidst reduced brexit uncertainties and expectations for a fiscal boost to the economy in the forthcoming march budget the statement added it is meanwhile too early to gauge any negative effects of the neo coronavirus outbreak in china the bank said that interest rates would however only stay at current levels if the pickup in economic activity is sustained over coming months if not then a cut to the interest rate would be required with an economy growing below potential and inflation well below target it is likely just a matter of time before the bank reduces rates as the tentative bounce in sentiment may prove to be temporary given the uncertainty that still remains around the uk s future relationship with the eu and its other trading partners says cj cowan assistant portfolio manager at quilter investors however the bank also added that should growth be sustained then the next move to rates would have to be higher today s bank of england interest rate announcement has caused the pound to strengthen by around 0 5 against the u s dollar and 0 35 against the euro this has broken a five day losing streak for the pound its longest this year evidently positive data in the lead up to the decision such as strong figures for the manufacturing and service sectors plus robust employment growth is likely to have convinced 7 of the 9 mpc committee members at the boe not to act today says christopher redfern corporate dealing manager at moneycorp at the time of writing the pound to euro exchange rate is trading 0 5 higher on the day at 1 1877 but had been as high as 1 1886 the pound to dollar exchange rate is meanwhile trading 0 55 higher at 1 3092 but has been as high as 1 3106 market expectations leading into today s boe statement were split and the slight hawkish surprise has the gbp bid nonetheless gbp usd will need to clear the 1 3150 mark in order to open up upside risk more conclusively says rai bipan foreign exchange strategist with cibc capital markets thus far it has only been survey data that has suggested the uk economy is improving and for the pound to gain any meaningful upside traction official data which starts coming through in february would have to reflect what the surveys are showing expectations for further gains in the value of sterling over coming weeks will now ultimately be dependent on the direction of travel in uk economic growth if official growth fails to show a post election bounce then expect the pricing for an interest rate cut at some point in 2020 to start creeping higher again such a development would cap the pound s strength and potentially introduce some weakness we think any relief rally in sterling will prove short lived as we believe markets are likely to roll out their rate cut expectations into the coming months we continue to emphasise that the burden of proof remains on the data to drive gbp sentiment so far and outside of the housing data the evidence of a meaningful rebound in confidence has been lacking says kamal sharma fx strategist at bank of america a rate cut in may or august is now looking increasingly likely so the healthy gains the pound has seen aren t expected to last all eyes will now be on upcoming uk technical data releases which will play an extremely important role in the coming months says sebastien clements currency analyst at ofx lower economic forecasts perhaps the most dovish element of january s mpc event was the lowering of economic forecasts which in itself hints at the need for lower interest rates over coming months forecasts for the economy contained in the quarterly monetary policy report show the bank s economists have lowered their expectations for growth when compared to the previous set of forecasts the bank forecasts growth in 2020 of 0 8 down from 1 2 forecast back in november 2021 growth is forecast at 1 4 against 1 8 previously and 2022 growth is forecast at 1 7 against the 2 0 previously forecast forecasts show inflation bottoming out at 1 24 in the third quarter of 2020 the november forecast showed the bottom being at 1 2 in the second third quarter inflation in one year s time is forecast at 1 53 against the november forecast for 1 51 inflation in two year s time is forecast to be at 2 01 vs the november forecast for 2 03 inflation forecasts therefore suggest cpi inflation will only reach the 2 target at the very end of the three year outlook period should rates remain at 0 75 the mpc expects inflation to only just reach the 2 target in two years time accordingly the mpc seems to have endorsed market expectations that interest rates need to fall to 0 50 and stay there says ruth gregory senior uk economist at capital economics uk gdp growth is projected to pick up a little in early 2020 further ahead and conditioned on a market path for bank rate that falls slightly over the forecast period the recovery in uk growth is supported by a pickup in global activity a further decline in brexit uncertainties and the government s announced spending measures reads the monetary policy report the forthcoming budget almost certainly influenced the monetary policy committee s decision as that is expected to provide a degree of stimulus in itself says ayush ansal chief investment officer at crimson black capital the fact that the bank announced rates could even be hiked underlines just how mixed the signals are that the economy is currently giving out

the orcel family s plans to swap its mansion in holland park london for a nice place in madrid sources with knowledge of the matter said but for all its promise terms of the september 2018 offer to hire orcel reviewed by reuters were not clear crucially santander promised to pay up to 35 million euros of a 55 million euro package that orcel was due to receive in future years from his employer at the time swiss bank ubs the letter said orcel would make his best efforts to cap that cost for santander by getting the swiss bank to contribute some of it ubs refused and orcel would not accept less than 35 million euros by the end the bankers and their spouses would have a frosty encounter in a coffee shop near london s mayfair and santander s board had issued a statement questioning what it called orcel s dubious ethical and moral behavior alleging he was secretly taping private conversations which a source close to orcel told reuters he had done on legal advice advertisement 5 story

dealmakers it also raised questions about how one of europe s most important banks santander has 144 million customers worldwide could name a new ceo without first finalizing his pay santander founded by royal decree in 1857 has been run by the botins for four generations its style has long been to move swiftly when needed said mauro guillen a management professor at wharton school in pennsylvania who has written a book on santander s development into a global bank the bank is always very nimble when it comes to making bold decisions he said adding that in a rapidly changing environment this made it popular with investors but the way orcel s appointment was handled shows santander s speediness does not always pay off if the bank wants to hire not just a ceo but top executives a lot of people may think twice in the wake of the orcel debacle invited to comment on the details of its rupture with orcel the bank referred to a statement it made last year in response to orcel s suit and media reports saying it had followed a robust appointment process that met the highest standards of corporate governance and giving its reasons not to proceed with his appointment orcel declined to comment ahead of the court hearing and ubs declined to comment advertisement 6 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content gladiator orcel knows santander better than any other investment banker over nearly three decades as a dealmaker at bank of america merrill lynch and ubs he worked on dozens of transactions that helped emilio botin transform the bank the biggest of these was when santander joined a consortium and bought parts of abn amro a major dutch bank in 2007 orcel is a driven and talented banker interviews with former colleagues show having run investment banking at ubs since 2012 he had also made clear his desire for a ceo post telling the financial times in 2015 that of course he wanted to run a bank some day and if he could choose ubs would be a good place to start when emilio botin died suddenly in september 2014 ana the eldest of his six children was swiftly named to follow him she would continue the family line in a bank whose shares are now mostly owned by institutional investors and funds by appointing her santander followed a spanish tradition of banks controlled by a single head rather than a separate chairman and ceo as the european central bank has said should be the norm advertisement 7 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the botin family is part of spain s aristocracy the king of spain made botin s mother a marchioness in 2008 ana whose full name is ana patricia botin sanz de sautuola o shea was made an honorary dame commander of the order of the british empire by britain s queen for services to the british financial sector in 2015 a keen golfer who describes herself as highly competitive botin was ranked by forbes as one of the world s most powerful women she told spanish tv in january the special thing about her job is the power it gives to change lives for many people she started her career at jpmorgan successfully turned around santander s spanish subsidiary banesto and ran its business in the uk one of the bank s largest in santander s top slot she faced a challenge to sustain the growth rate her father had achieved emilio s strategy of swallowing businesses in emerging markets had won plaudits for shielding santander from the worst of the 2008 financial crisis even as its home market was in deep recession but when emilio died growth in latin america was slowing and santander s business in britain and the united states faced strong headwinds like other banks it was under pressure to bolster its capital in september 2015 a year after emilio s death santander s share price was down around 30 from when ana had started advertisement 8 story continues below this

he arranged a 7 billion euro capital boost for santander to cover popular s bad debts in early 2018 with santander s stock still lagging botin asked orcel to outline a strategic plan to help lift the bank s share price a source familiar with the matter told reuters that july when the two met for dinner at the loews regency hotel on park avenue in new york she had a proposal join the bank as ceo and implement the plan one idea they discussed was that santander could sell its underperforming u s and british units a task orcel would execute people familiar with the discussions said orcel pledged loyalty to botin he compared his new role to that of the fighter maximus played by russell crowe in the 2000 movie gladiator leading the troops into battle for his emperor advertisement 9

and investment funds while commercial ones serve small companies and individuals he would be leaving the relationship driven world of investment banking which he has likened to selling designer handbags such as louis vuitton to a hands on role in a major commercial bank which he has said is more potatoes and tomatoes comparable to wal mart working on details with the offer in place the next topic was pay orcel was used to big money while working at merrill lynch he had made headlines after receiving a 33 8 million bonus from the wall street investment bank for 2008 a year when merrill s net loss swelled to 27 6 billion ubs had granted him a compensation package due to be paid out over several years including roughly 55 million euros worth of stock to be paid in future four sources familiar with the matter said such deferred pay is one of the ways investment bankers in the european union where bonuses have been capped since 2014 have found to keep up their incomes said anna marietta co founder and managing partner of london based headhunting firm vici advisory which specializes in investment banking advertisement 10 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded

t work like that when investment bankers move jobs the new employer usually makes them whole by paying their deferred compensation in the investment banking world this is seldom a point of contention ubs had done it for orcel when he joined from bank of america in 2012 the swiss bank topped up his 7 million in base salary with 26 million in deferred compensation carried over from his former employer its annual report showed it is very rare that compensation over deferred pay becomes a problem said marietta in fact none of my clients has ever experienced issues with it it s also very rare for a top investment banker to go directly into a top position in commercial banking usually they take a break between posts in september 2018 ana botin messaged orcel to say colleagues at santander

sidelines of an internal meeting in zurich there is no record of exactly how the ceo sergio ermotti responded and ubs declined to comment orcel later messaged botin saying his boss had said that if the italian was moving on it would be good to announce this before a planned investor day in october but there was a problem as spain s biggest lender santander needed to be mindful of the public mood as well as the reaction of its 200 000 staff around the world this was particularly true in the summer of 2018 the country was still recovering from a devastating recession a socialist government had just taken power and some people thought it would impose a new bank tax santander was negotiating a large round of job cuts trade unions said it cut 1 100 staff in spain in 2018 a figure santander did not dispute botin saw room to maneuver thanks to santander s relationship with ubs her father s dealings with orcel had turned santander into a big client for the swiss bank in each year the spanish bank did a major deal it brought ubs more than 50 million euros in fees according to people familiar with their relationship the banks declined to comment advertisement 12 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content botin saw a chance that ubs chairman axel weber would want to keep that business going the messages show ubs itself might stump up some of the deferred compensation that orcel stood to lose if weber decided not to botin told orcel in a message santander would threaten to pull their business there is a line i had reserved for axel if they decide not to pay you anything because we are their competitors then it is good to know this that they will not act as our strategic advisors this is irrefutable and an elegant way of not beating around the bush sept 10 message from botin to orcel a few days later botin approached ubs to pave the way for discussions with its chairman axel weber the swiss bank s executives were all meeting in singapore where orcel spoke to its ceo sergio ermotti and another ubs board member they are helping us he messaged to botin i have the green light from sergio can you

wanted orcel to stay weber wrote an email to orcel s wife clara whom orcel consults closely on major career moves saying the swiss bank wanted to offer her husband a more senior role at ubs that could pave the way to him succeeding ermotti dear clara we have tried to offer him a way to stay at ubs with the same job perspective as outside ubs the board is unanimous on this and committed to facilitating an orderly transition it is now his choice and his decision i appreciate it is a difficult choice i have also talked to ana and i was clear to her so that she does not base her actions and her offers on assumptions i am aware that this will have consequences down the road but everything we do or don t do has but as long as what we do is the right thing in our mind we will have to be happy to live with these consequences sept 19 email from ubs chairman axel weber to clara batalim orcel weber said in the message that he had spoken to botin and i was clear to her so that she does not base her actions and her offers on assumptions advertisement 14 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content orcel messaged botin

decided not to take up the counter offer and to quit ubs meanwhile botin was still trying to persuade ubs s weber to stump up some of orcel s deferred pay without success no se mueve he is not budging says none of it at all sept 23 message from botin to orcel the numbers have gone up despite this lack of movement from ubs on sept 24 santander s board went ahead with an offer letter for orcel orcel s wife clara was keen she messaged botin the same day to express support for what she called an agreement it was not clear exactly what she meant saying orcel had told her that botin s word was worth more than a thousand contracts cara ana i am super happy that you have finally reached an agreement for andrea to join he has told me that your word is worth more than a thousand contracts and i know that andrea will give his best to deliver what you need you know i am backing him up 150 in this change thanks for your trust regards clara advertisement 15 story continues below this advertisement

it would make orcel the highest paid bank ceo in the euro zone and put his annual pay on par with botin who was paid almost 10 6 million euros in 2017 her pension pot is worth about 46 million euros according to santander s annual report santander promised orcel a sign on bonus of 17 million euros annual salary including bonus of 10 million euros and deferred compensation in the form of shares but the details on that were vague banco santander expects that you will do your best efforts to ensure that your current employer will continue to pay the long term incentive plans of which you are a beneficiary under the same conditions as if you were employed should your current employer pay only partially your long term incentives or an amount lower than the one you would have received remaining in the company we will pay a buyout of a maximum of 35 million gross euros sept 24 letter from santander to orcel the next day orcel was appointed ceo with the paperwork still to be finalized he was invited to join discussions with santander executives and a month later made a member of an internal whatsapp group called promontorio court documents show santander released the first video where he was pictured gesticulating in a meeting with botin and the man he was due to replace jose antonio alvarez advertisement 16 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content behind the scenes negotiations on orcel s pay were intense rather than letting the italian go quickly his swiss employer insisted orcel take a full six month gardening leave the gap top financiers usually take between jobs with a competing institution this meant he would not be able to join santander until april 2019 financially for santander this could be good news it meant part of orcel s deferred pay would fall due while he was still on ubs s payroll santander figured therefore that its costs would be reduced its board calculated the reduction at around 13 7 million euros it said in a later statement but orcel saw it differently he did not think santander should deduct pay from his deferred package while he was still a ubs employee some of it was a straight bonus for the previous year and in his view taking into account that his deferred package at ubs was worth about 55 million euros he had already agreed to an effective pay cut of roughly 20 million euros said sources familiar with his thinking his last day at ubs was sept 30 but by october things with santander were going nowhere advertisement 17 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content orcel apologized to botin reminding her that ubs had stumped up people s deferred pay in the past and hinting at a possible legal response i am very sorry to have to put you in this position it seems like we are begging when it s something that they have done before if he doesn t move we ll have to take legal steps oct 19 2018 message from orcel to botin botin asked a santander board member to speak to a counterpart in ubs who refused to discuss the matter saying ubs s board was united behind weber s position she told orcel i understand then you must stay until the end gardening period which includes the vesting period for february let s talk next week let s not keep going around on this un abrazo oct 20 message from botin to orcel the next month orcel s figures changed he told santander that his original pay calculations had missed a few million euros that were due to him in dividends this according to a statement from the bank last july would add more than 3 million euros to santander s bill it seems that we have missed a piece advertisement 18 story continues below this

santander hr executive the necessary empowerment on dec 17 santander s remuneration committee met it noted a degree of discomfort at the revised claim from orcel it noted as well the fact that ubs was not paying up as much as it said orcel had predicted and the reputational risk of failing to cap his buyout board secretary renovales called orcel who by then was on a family holiday in machu pichu peru but orcel said he would only discuss the matter with ana botin he typed her a long message on dec 20 he said any buyout of less than 35 million euros would no longer make sense for him insisting he had already suffered a significant pay cut from his ubs package he also asserted his need to subordinate other executives in the bank using the image of a cascade system in which he would be their boss as chairman she would have the opportunity to redirect him as well as the final word i realize that we must motivate and empower the execs and country heads but also subordinate them to the group objectives to a discipline of execution of our decisions and to the necessary empowerment that i need to have so we can achieve the objectives of the group and my mandate advertisement 19 story

said suggesting a meeting in madrid andrea we need to stop and see where we are at to do this we need to meet up and have a quiet and down to earth conversation in person tuesday 8th january in madrid dec 20 message from botin to orcel santander s board was uncomfortable with the money and with ubs not budging ana botin was no longer sure her new right hand man was putting enough pressure on weber on the issue of compensation axel is not budging basically 0 it is important that you continue to put pressure on your side regards ana dec 20 message from botin to orcel the pair met a day earlier than she first suggested on jan 7 in santander s headquarters botin told orcel she was withdrawing her offer the spanish political climate meant they couldn t meet his pay demands advertisement 20

court show but she said there was no scope for further negotiation because all the relevant authorities had been informed at this point a source close to him said he started recording their conversations a practice which is legal in spain on jan 15 santander issued a statement saying orcel would not be joining the bank and its ceo alvarez would remain in post orcel wrote to renovales withdrawing his permission for santander to use the second video in which he had been filmed accepting botin s decision he said he had agreed to film the video on the understanding that he and santander could resolve the issue in a friendly way but as this was not possible he considered it to have been made on a false premise and so withdrew his permission for the bank to use it if you proceed you do so without any agreement with all the possible consequences of the case he wrote you have destroyed my career my reputation and have inflicted huge economic loss jan 15 orcel to renovales advertisement 21 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content ana botin tried to smooth things over she made various suggestions to orcel including possible financial backing to set up his own advisory boutique firm or private equity fund or a top job in a santander subsidiary according to court documents i promise you that there are many ways of doing this obviously i will presume that ubs has said no to everything and i want to know that but i have companies in spain where i could appoint you ceo or president

by pamela barbaglia rachel armstrong and alessandra galloni london reuters in september 2018 santander one of europe s biggest banks tweeted a video of its incoming new chief executive an italian investment banker named andrea orcel depicting a meeting with the bank s boss ana botin the clip showed the silver haired italian cutting the air with a decisive gesture related stories a few months later the bank shot a new video intended for investors and the media at its madrid headquarters it shows botin who heads a 150 year old banking dynasty saying she has withdrawn the offer because the new man s pay would be too high for the bank according to two people with direct knowledge of the sequence in the video orcel is shown appearing to agree with the outcome that clip was never released in fact the italian now says he was misled the rupture that followed the meeting has turned into one of the bitterest and highest profile employment disputes in recent european history yielding a lawsuit that is due later this year in a spanish civil court this account of the botin orcel clash the most comprehensive yet assembled offers a rare glimpse inside the top level of one of the world s largest banks a family led giant with a culture all its own it is also a story of how a decade after bankers were blamed for a crippling global financial crisis the reality of austerity has been slow to fully sink in in may orcel sued santander demanding that the bank honor its offer or pay him 112 million euros 123 million in damages equivalent to equivalent to about 1 of the bank s profits in 2018 in his suit orcel says a letter laying out his pay was a binding contract and that the video showing him accepting its withdrawal was shot on a false pretext according to documents he submitted in court in response santander said that under spanish law an offer letter is not a contract and that orcel s behavior during negotiations led the bank to lose confidence in him whatever the court decides a rich body of evidence texts and online messages between the pair and their family members extracts from court documents and interviews with eight people involved shows a cosy relationship corroding the messages some reported here for the first time suggest the hiring process for one of europe s most important financial jobs went awry partly because old ties between powerful people led to hasty assurances and false assumptions ana botin now 59 was a senior banker who had been named executive chairman of the group to succeed her late father emilio a legendary patriarch who had built santander into a global business through savvy acquisitions orcel 56 a widely respected banker who according to some media looks like the george clooney of investment banking had been botin s go to investment banker for advice on deal making and strategy what is most important to me is your energy and enthusiasm and i know that both for you personally and for your family this will be a good thing july 25 message from ana botin to andrea orcel this and other reproductions of text messages are based on original texts or submissions to court seen by reuters some were originally written in whole or part in spanish and have been translated some were redacted and reuters has edited two to preserve the anonymity of people with incidental roles in the story when the wooing began in mid 2018 botin and orcel s portuguese wife clara batalim orcel chatted about the orcel family s plans to swap its mansion in holland park london for a nice place in madrid sources with knowledge of the matter said but for all its promise terms of the september 2018 offer to hire orcel reviewed by reuters were not clear crucially santander promised to pay up to 35 million euros of a 55 million euro package that orcel was due to receive in future years from his employer at the time swiss bank ubs the letter said orcel would make his best efforts to cap that cost for santander by getting the swiss bank to contribute some of it ubs refused and orcel would not accept less than 35 million euros by the end the bankers and their spouses would have a frosty encounter in a coffee shop near london s mayfair and santander s board had issued a statement questioning what it called orcel s dubious ethical and moral behavior alleging he was secretly taping private conversations which a source close to orcel told reuters he had done on legal advice the fallout has gripped europe s investment banking industry where orcel is one of the best known dealmakers it also raised questions about how one of europe s most important banks santander has 144 million customers worldwide could name a new ceo without first finalizing his pay santander founded by royal decree in 1857 has been run by the botins for four generations its style has long been to move swiftly when needed said mauro guillen a management professor at wharton school in pennsylvania who has written a book on santander s development into a global bank the bank is always very nimble when it comes to making bold decisions he said adding that in a rapidly changing environment this made it popular with investors but the way orcel s appointment was handled shows santander s speediness does not always pay off if the bank wants to hire not just a ceo but top executives a lot of people may think twice in the wake of the orcel debacle invited to comment on the details of its rupture with orcel the bank referred to a statement it made last year in response to orcel s suit and media reports saying it had followed a robust appointment process that met the highest standards of corporate governance and giving its reasons not to proceed with his appointment orcel declined to comment ahead of the court hearing and ubs declined to comment gladiator orcel knows santander better than any other investment banker over nearly three decades as a dealmaker at bank of america merrill lynch and ubs he worked on dozens of transactions that helped emilio botin transform the bank the biggest of these was when santander joined a consortium and bought parts of abn amro a major dutch bank in 2007 orcel is a driven and talented banker interviews with former colleagues show having run investment banking at ubs since 2012 he had also made clear his desire for a ceo post telling the financial times in 2015 that of course he wanted to run a bank some day and if he could choose ubs would be a good place to start when emilio botin died suddenly in september 2014 ana the eldest of his six children was swiftly named to follow him she would continue the family line in a bank whose shares are now mostly owned by institutional investors and funds by appointing her santander followed a spanish tradition of banks controlled by a single head rather than a separate chairman and ceo as the european central bank has said should be the norm the botin family is part of spain s aristocracy the king of spain made botin s mother a marchioness in 2008 ana whose full name is ana patricia botin sanz de sautuola o shea was made an honorary dame commander of the order of the british empire by britain s queen for services to the british financial sector in 2015 a keen golfer who describes herself as highly competitive botin was ranked by forbes as one of the world s most powerful women she told spanish tv in january the special thing about her job is the power it gives to change lives for many people she started her career at jpmorgan successfully turned around santander s spanish subsidiary banesto and ran its business in the uk one of the bank s largest in santander s top slot she faced a challenge to sustain the growth rate her father had achieved emilio s strategy of swallowing businesses in emerging markets had won plaudits for shielding santander from the worst of the 2008 financial crisis even as its home market was in deep recession but when emilio died growth in latin america was slowing and santander s business in britain and the united states faced strong headwinds like other banks it was under pressure to bolster its capital in september 2015 a year after emilio s death santander s share price was down around 30 from when ana had started orcel the adviser was on hand four months after ana botin s elevation he helped arrange a massive 7 5 billion euro capital increase which took place overnight and was called ballsy by trade magazine euromoney again in 2017 orcel advised when santander picked up an ailing domestic rival banco popular for one euro he arranged a 7 billion euro capital boost for santander to cover popular s bad debts in early 2018 with santander s stock still lagging botin asked orcel to outline a strategic plan to help lift the bank s share price a source familiar with the matter told reuters that july when the two met for dinner at the loews regency hotel on park avenue in new york she had a proposal join the bank as ceo and implement the plan one idea they discussed was that santander could sell its underperforming u s and british units a task orcel would execute people familiar with the discussions said orcel pledged loyalty to botin he compared his new role to that of the fighter maximus played by russell crowe in the 2000 movie gladiator leading the troops into battle for his emperor for orcel santander would be a radical switch investment bankers deal with big corporations and investment funds while commercial ones serve small companies and individuals he would be leaving the relationship driven world of investment banking which he has likened to selling designer handbags such as louis vuitton to a hands on role in a major commercial bank which he has said is more potatoes and tomatoes comparable to wal mart working on details with the offer in place the next topic was pay orcel was used to big money while working at merrill lynch he had made headlines after receiving a 33 8 million bonus from the wall street investment bank for 2008 a year when merrill s net loss swelled to 27 6 billion ubs had granted him a compensation package due to be paid out over several years including roughly 55 million euros worth of stock to be paid in future four sources familiar with the matter said such deferred pay is one of the ways investment bankers in the european union where bonuses have been capped since 2014 have found to keep up their incomes said anna marietta co founder and managing partner of london based headhunting firm vici advisory which specializes in investment banking it is meant as an incentive to lock executives into a bank if they leave executives in theory forfeit pay they ve accumulated in practice it doesn t work like that when investment bankers move jobs the new employer usually makes them whole by paying their deferred compensation in the investment banking world this is seldom a point of contention ubs had done it for orcel when he joined from bank of america in 2012 the swiss bank topped up his 7 million in base salary with 26 million in deferred compensation carried over from his former employer its annual report showed it is very rare that compensation over deferred pay becomes a problem said marietta in fact none of my clients has ever experienced issues with it it s also very rare for a top investment banker to go directly into a top position in commercial banking usually they take a break between posts in september 2018 ana botin messaged orcel to say colleagues at santander were on board with his appointment and a staffing committee was working on financial details andrea nomco nominations committee 100pc supportive and working on details regards sept 10 message from botin to orcel orcel had told his boss at ubs about botin s approach on the sidelines of an internal meeting in zurich there is no record of exactly how the ceo sergio ermotti responded and ubs declined to comment orcel later messaged botin saying his boss had said that if the italian was moving on it would be good to announce this before a planned investor day in october but there was a problem as spain s biggest lender santander needed to be mindful of the public mood as well as the reaction of its 200 000 staff around the world this was particularly true in the summer of 2018 the country was still recovering from a devastating recession a socialist government had just taken power and some people thought it would impose a new bank tax santander was negotiating a large round of job cuts trade unions said it cut 1 100 staff in spain in 2018 a figure santander did not dispute botin saw room to maneuver thanks to santander s relationship with ubs her father s dealings with orcel had turned santander into a big client for the swiss bank in each year the spanish bank did a major deal it brought ubs more than 50 million euros in fees according to people familiar with their relationship the banks declined to comment botin saw a chance that ubs chairman axel weber would want to keep that business going the messages show ubs itself might stump up some of the deferred compensation that orcel stood to lose if weber decided not to botin told orcel in a message santander would threaten to pull their business there is a line i had reserved for axel if they decide not to pay you anything because we are their competitors then it is good to know this that they will not act as our strategic advisors this is irrefutable and an elegant way of not beating around the bush sept 10 message from botin to orcel a few days later botin approached ubs to pave the way for discussions with its chairman axel weber the swiss bank s executives were all meeting in singapore where orcel spoke to its ceo sergio ermotti and another ubs board member they are helping us he messaged to botin i have the green light from sergio can you send me axel s mobile for me to call him sergio has already given me the green light i ll call you later and tell you about it un abrazo ana sept 17 message from botin to orcel but when santander s boss got to speak to ubs chairman weber she found out he was not on board he wanted orcel to stay weber wrote an email to orcel s wife clara whom orcel consults closely on major career moves saying the swiss bank wanted to offer her husband a more senior role at ubs that could pave the way to him succeeding ermotti dear clara we have tried to offer him a way to stay at ubs with the same job perspective as outside ubs the board is unanimous on this and committed to facilitating an orderly transition it is now his choice and his decision i appreciate it is a difficult choice i have also talked to ana and i was clear to her so that she does not base her actions and her offers on assumptions i am aware that this will have consequences down the road but everything we do or don t do has but as long as what we do is the right thing in our mind we will have to be happy to live with these consequences sept 19 email from ubs chairman axel weber to clara batalim orcel weber said in the message that he had spoken to botin and i was clear to her so that she does not base her actions and her offers on assumptions orcel messaged botin later about ubs s offer board made a counter offer sergio promised he ll talk to board today and ask them to put me in a fair position sept 20 2018 message from orcel to botin on sunday sept 23 orcel decided not to take up the counter offer and to quit ubs meanwhile botin was still trying to persuade ubs s weber to stump up some of orcel s deferred pay without success no se mueve he is not budging says none of it at all sept 23 message from botin to orcel the numbers have gone up despite this lack of movement from ubs on sept 24 santander s board went ahead with an offer letter for orcel orcel s wife clara was keen she messaged botin the same day to express support for what she called an agreement it was not clear exactly what she meant saying orcel had told her that botin s word was worth more than a thousand contracts cara ana i am super happy that you have finally reached an agreement for andrea to join he has told me that your word is worth more than a thousand contracts and i know that andrea will give his best to deliver what you need you know i am backing him up 150 in this change thanks for your trust regards clara sept 24 message from clara batalim orcel to ana botin santander s offer was signed by santander s general secretary jaime renovales it would make orcel the highest paid bank ceo in the euro zone and put his annual pay on par with botin who was paid almost 10 6 million euros in 2017 her pension pot is worth about 46 million euros according to santander s annual report santander promised orcel a sign on bonus of 17 million euros annual salary including bonus of 10 million euros and deferred compensation in the form of shares but the details on that were vague banco santander expects that you will do your best efforts to ensure that your current employer will continue to pay the long term incentive plans of which you are a beneficiary under the same conditions as if you were employed should your current employer pay only partially your long term incentives or an amount lower than the one you would have received remaining in the company we will pay a buyout of a maximum of 35 million gross euros sept 24 letter from santander to orcel the next day orcel was appointed ceo with the paperwork still to be finalised he was invited to join discussions with santander executives and a month later made a member of an internal whatsapp group called promontorio court documents show santander released the first video where he was pictured gesticulating in a meeting with botin and the man he was due to replace jose antonio alvarez behind the scenes negotiations on orcel s pay were intense rather than letting the italian go quickly his swiss employer insisted orcel take a full six month gardening leave the gap top financiers usually take between jobs with a competing institution this meant he would not be able to join santander until april 2019 financially for santander this could be good news it meant part of orcel s deferred pay would fall due while he was still on ubs s payroll santander figured therefore that its costs would be reduced its board calculated the reduction at around 13 7 million euros it said in a later statement but orcel saw it differently he did not think santander should deduct pay from his deferred package while he was still a ubs employee some of it was a straight bonus for the previous year and in his view taking into account that his deferred package at ubs was worth about 55 million euros he had already agreed to an effective pay cut of roughly 20 million euros said sources familiar with his thinking his last day at ubs was sept 30 but by october things with santander were going nowhere orcel apologized to botin reminding her that ubs had stumped up people s deferred pay in the past and hinting at a possible legal response i am very sorry to have to put you in this position it seems like we are begging when it s something that they have done before if he doesn t move we ll have to take legal steps oct 19 2018 message from orcel to botin botin asked a santander board member to speak to a counterpart in ubs who refused to discuss the matter saying ubs s board was united behind weber s position she told orcel i understand then you must stay until the end gardening period which includes the vesting period for february let s talk next week let s not keep going around on this un abrazo oct 20 message from botin to orcel the next month orcel s figures changed he told santander that his original pay calculations had missed a few million euros that were due to him in dividends this according to a statement from the bank last july would add more than 3 million euros to santander s bill it seems that we have missed a piece dec 10 message from orcel to a santander hr executive for numbers they have gone up dec 15 message from orcel a santander hr executive the necessary empowerment on dec 17 santander s remuneration committee met it noted a degree of discomfort at the revised claim from orcel it noted as well the fact that ubs was not paying up as much as it said orcel had predicted and the reputational risk of failing to cap his buyout board secretary renovales called orcel who by then was on a family holiday in machu pichu peru but orcel said he would only discuss the matter with ana botin he typed her a long message on dec 20 he said any buyout of less than 35 million euros would no longer make sense for him insisting he had already suffered a significant pay cut from his ubs package he also asserted his need to subordinate other executives in the bank using the image of a cascade system in which he would be their boss as chairman she would have the opportunity to redirect him as well as the final word i realize that we must motivate and empower the execs and country heads but also subordinate them to the group objectives to a discipline of execution of our decisions and to the necessary empowerment that i need to have so we can achieve the objectives of the group and my mandate dec 20 message from orcel to botin from peru in the spanish banking world to date the executive chairman has been the one with all the power all the other executives defer to them orcel s call for the necessary empowerment received a curt response we need to stop and see where we are at botin said suggesting a meeting in madrid andrea we need to stop and see where we are at to do this we need to meet up and have a quiet and down to earth conversation in person tuesday 8th january in madrid dec 20 message from botin to orcel santander s board was uncomfortable with the money and with ubs not budging ana botin was no longer sure her new right hand man was putting enough pressure on weber on the issue of compensation axel is not budging basically 0 it is important that you continue to put pressure on your side regards ana dec 20 message from botin to orcel the pair met a day earlier than she first suggested on jan 7 in santander s headquarters botin told orcel she was withdrawing her offer the spanish political climate meant they couldn t meet his pay demands he was shocked believing everything was still under negotiation documents he submitted in court show but she said there was no scope for further negotiation because all the relevant authorities had been informed at this point a source close to him said he started recording their conversations a practice which is legal in spain on jan 15 santander issued a statement saying orcel would not be joining the bank and its ceo alvarez would remain in post orcel wrote to renovales withdrawing his permission for santander to use the second video in which he had been filmed accepting botin s decision he said he had agreed to film the video on the understanding that he and santander could resolve the issue in a friendly way but as this was not possible he considered it to have been made on a false premise and so withdrew his permission for the bank to use it if you proceed you do so without any agreement with all the possible consequences of the case he wrote you have destroyed my career my reputation and have inflicted huge economic loss jan 15 orcel to renovales ana botin tried to smooth things over she made various suggestions to orcel including possible financial backing to set up his own advisory boutique firm or private equity fund or a top job in a santander subsidiary according to court documents i promise you that there are many ways of doing this obviously i will presume that ubs has said no to everything and i want to know that but i have companies in spain where i could appoint you ceo or president tomorrow listed real estate companies i mean this cannot be part of in other words i have many options to compensate you in areas that you are also qualified for jan 15 message from botin to orcel but no agreement could be found the bankers last meeting was in early february in a coffee shop in belgravia one of london s most affluent areas with orcel s wife clara they discussed other possible roles that orcel could take but he did not accept any according to two people familiar with the events botin s husband guillermo morenÃ©s dropped in on them while he was jogging past in may orcel sued santander for the job the case is due to start being heard in april and could run well beyond a year unless the parties settle for its most recent corporate deal santander turned to ubs s arch rival credit suisse santander s shares are around half the price when botin started orcel remains in london he has yet to take another post reporting by pamela barbaglia alessandra galloni and rachel armstrong additional reporting by jesus aguado in madrid and christopher thompson in

extract taken from the mergers acquisitions review edition 13 overview of m a activity panama s economy continues to lead in latin america with a growth in gross domestic product gdp of 3 7 per cent in 2018 the economy has been supported by the expanded panama canal and the appreciating us dollar with a forecast a real gdp growth above 5 8 per cent for 2019 to that end standard poor s recently upgraded panama s sovereign credit rating to bbb announcing the improved rating together with a stable outlook at least a month before the outcome of presidential elections on 5 may 2019 m a activity in panama was expected to remain robust throughout 2019 as industries such as logistics energy and mining maintained a vibrant economic growth while others companies in the retail and financial sectors are ripe for consolidation or acquisition large infrastructure projects such as the us 2 6 billion construction of a third metro line are also contributing factors in the increase in foreign direct investment in panama the third metro line a monorail system stretching 25km west of panama city is currently at the bidding process stage with four bidders aiming to procure the contract it will cross the canal over the fourth bridge which will house the metro line and eight lanes to meet the needs of the rapidly growing cities west of the capital the fourth bridge project has an expected cost of around us 1 5 billion and was granted to consorcio panamÃ¡ cuarto puente a joint venture between china communications construction company ltc and china harbour engineering company ltd the energy sector in panama will continue to experience government and foreign direct investment given panama s long running sustained economic growth it is unsurprising that energy demand in the country is expected to keep increasing the difference between the first trimester of 2018 and 2019 reflects a growth of 4 1 per cent investment in the clean energy sector has also experienced significant growth and at the going rate clean energy production has produced significant achievements such as the inauguration of the ikakos power plant a solar energy plant that produces around 40 megawatts yearly the government is currently working on the bidding process for transmission line 4 which will have cost approximately us 450 million and which will cement the connection between heavy hydroelectric energy production in the west part of the country and the east part of the country s increasing demand this project has attracted foreign investment but the bidding process has not found a bidder that can comply with the requirements set forth by the government the international monetary fund imf western hemisphere department recognised panama s positive future growth due to the expansion of the panama canal the development of several services industries the approval of free trade agreements with the united states the european union and canada and the growth of the mining industry the latter has increased thanks to copper mining which element has only recently started to be tapped the cobre panama copper mine controlled by first quantum minerals is said to be practically operational cobre panama is the nation s most important private investment project with an estimated production of 320 000 tonnes of copper per year as noted in an imf country report for 2014 the copper mine was expected to bring about us 6Â½ billion over 2013 17 about us 1Â½ billion of which have already invested the imf calculates that the mining project will contribute around 1 5 per cent of panama s gdp in 2019 panama is consistently rated by international indexes as one of the best countries in latin america for business and investment the world bank s doing business 2019 ease of doing business index ranked panama 79th of the 190 surveyed countries this may be due to its encouragement of foreign investment through legal incentives in 1998 the government enacted the investment stability law which guarantees equal treatment to foreign investors under the law as is given to their domestic competition and guarantees the same commercial and fiscal conditions for 10 years to foreign investors who invest at least us 2 million in panama under law 41 2007 panama has motivated multinational companies to locate their headquarters in panama through tax incentives as of may 2019 147 international companies have been established under the law including major multinationals such as hyundai procter gamble aes halliburton hewlett packard peugeot citroÃ«n pan american life insurance company caterpillar lg 3m western union and roche owing to the various taxation immigration labour and employment incentives offered specifically to benefit multinationals that establish their regional offices or headquarters in panama general introduction to the legal framework for m a the relevant panamanian laws and regulations governing business combinations include the corporations law the limited liability company law and the commercial code which is supplemented by the civil code as combinations generally cause taxable events the tax code and its regulations especially executive decree 18 of 1994 which establishes a special regime regarding share for share mergers and law no 18 of 2006 which created a special capital gains regime are also pertinent in the case of publicly traded companies the securities law and its regulations govern tender offers proxy statements and rules of disclosure among other matters business combinations in panama are usually structured as share or asset purchases tender offers or mergers but other techniques can also be used one example is the capitalisation of shares of two operating companies to a holding company incorporated for that purpose with joint participation in the holding company in the case of publicly traded companies combinations usually involve a two step process that begins with a tender offer either for shares cash or a combination of both followed by an actual merger
risk aversion has hit asset markets as the world reacts to news of the coronavirus uncertainty stands to demand a further risk premium of assets exposed to chinese demand that probably means interest rates stay lower for longer china intensive commodities stay under pressure and the re rating story for commodity linked currencies is postponed parallels to sars ever since 7 january when chinese authorities confirmed that they had identified a new virus global financial markets have increasingly taken notice of the coronavirus this follows the us iran conflict and further threatens to undermine what was expected to be a gradual rebound of the global economy in 2020 of course we do not know for sure but any potential spreading of the virus across the globe currently the virus has already been reported in 18 countries from asia to north america could last until march april and mark a new downside risk to the global economy in the first half of 2020 the fact that the world health organization has said that the coronavirus comes from the same family of viruses as sars and mers have prompted comparisons with the sars outbreak in 2003 at the time the news of the sars outbreak only hit financial headlines in march 2003 and then dominated the headlines for an eight week period we can only hope that containment measures prevent an acceleration in the number of cases identified and that the mortality rate does not rise above current reported levels of 4 in economic terms however the global economy has become more integrated and intertwined since 2003 global air traffic for example is currently more than twice as big as in 2003 also contrary to 2003 when chinese tourism was mainly inbound oriented chinese tourists have become a significant driver of global tourism consequently the speed of the virus spreading could be faster than in 2003 while at the same time the negative impact on global growth could also be higher than in 2003 what weaker chinese growth means for trading partners as iris pang notes the largest impact on chinese consumption will come through retail sales travel tourism and clearly the ability of chinese residents to return to work sars is believed to have knocked 1 0 off chinese gdp back in 2003 but the huge uncertainty around the spread of the coronavirus makes the macro impact very difficult to forecast a study by jong wha lee and warwick j mckibbin from the korea university and the australian national university found that the full impact of sars on the global economy came close to usd 40 bn in 2003 taking second round effects between sectors into account accurate forecasting of that impact will take time but clearly slowing chinese domestic demand will impact the global economy just as it is trying to recover from the effects of the 2018 19 trade war just think of the fact that for some global hotel chains or companies of luxury goods china and greater asia accounts already for 10 to 20 percent of their annual sales the precise extent to which a weaker chinese economy impacts its global trading partners will also be uncertain but a 2016 imf study may offer some insights here even though the study focused on the spill over effects of china s maturing economy one of the simulations included a chinese cyclical slowdown prompted by financial stress that stress triggered by a credit event a re assessment of growth prospects or another shock the impact of a 1 cyclical slowdown in china is largely felt in the apac region where trade linkages are the highest and also in the commodity producing countries notably the fall out on the us economy was seen as limited possibly resurrecting the narrative of wider us rest of world growth differentials a dollar bullish story commodities china is the kingpin china is the kingpin of the global commodities market the longer factories remain closed travel restricted and construction stalled the larger the ramification for commodities demand this asset class has seen a massive sell off since the outbreak of coronavirus in china at the time of writing copper prices have fallen by 8 5 from their mid january peak singapore iron ore has collapsed more than 6 and ice brent plunged by nearly 10 it is very hard to say how quickly this virus will spread but suffice to say we see mounting pressure on commodities however the level of damage to their market price will also depend on their exposure to china and their own fundamental story copper and iron ore vulnerable opec may support crude looking first at the metals the key question is how long will travel restrictions last and when construction and industrial activities resume a prolonged delay would have an impact on supply chains this would likely feed through to major sectors where metals demand has significant relevance including infrastructure property construction automotive and other manufacturing industries copper has relatively healthier fundamentals than the rest as a result of tightened supply in global mine production last year and production growth is expected to be largely muted this year the market had expected to see demand recover from china in 2020 supporting a constructive fundamental picture copper is regarded as the economic barometer and china accounts for 50 of global copper usage however with the absence of china demand short term downbeat sentiment may be exacerbated since some investors tend to short copper to express bearishness on the global macro view for iron ore china accounts for 70 of the global seaborne market should the coronavirus prompt a long delay in construction activities any demand pick up in iron ore may be postponed on the oil side wider travel restrictions are apparently hitting oil demand through jet fuels gasoil and other middle distillates within china along with any spillover across the region overall the global transportation industry accounts for around half of the demand for global crude imports and has been rising rapidly concerns are unsurprisingly reflected in refinery margins which continue to trade at depressed levels in fact the spot gasoil crack in nw europe is trading under us 10 bbl now levels last seen in early 2017 the weakness in gasoil cracks has surprised many given the broadly constructive view held due to imo 2020 shipping regulations however as oil sink lowers there is increasing pressure for opec to extend cuts through until at least mid year and that may provide some psychological support however the opec members will be watching developments in libya closely any extended outage there would mean less need to curtail supply amongst the rest of opec fx commodity currency rally postponed events in china impact the global currency markets via two channels 1 the risk channel as global growth concerns hit equity markets and b the commodity channel given the importance of china in global commodity demand in the chart below we blend the two channels unsurprisingly in the g10 space it is aud nzd and nok as well as cad that stand out given their high beta to risk and the commodity nature of the currencies we continue to see aud nzd and nok as the most exposed if market sentiment remains weak with our commodities team seeing larger downside to metals than oil prices where opec may extend cuts versus a softer floor under metal prices aud looks the most vulnerable among these currencies supporting this view is also the prospect of rba easing over the next months we expect a cut in 1q and the ongoing bushfire emergency which may have a sizeable impact on the australian economy all this underlines our preference for lower aud nzd in the relative value space where we look for a decline to aud nzd 1 02 among scandies this means lower nok sek as sek exposure to commodity prices is limited among the majors jpy and usd should continue their out performance given their safe haven characteristics we look for a lower eur usd as the dollar continues to benefit from its safe haven appeal while the open eurozone economy is more vulnerable to any impact on the global economy the story of us exceptionalism growth outperformance may return as well as long as the situation will be seen as unresolved the skew to both risk appetite and commodity prices remains on the downside with g10 commodity currencies largely reversing all their december gains at the time caused by anticipation of the phase one deal this currency segment is now as undervalued as it was prior to the december rally still unless both risk sentiment and commodity prices stabilize a sustainable rebound is unlikely at this point as for em fx we have observed a similar pattern to g10 deteriorating risk sentiment is weighing on the generally higher beta em fx where the currencies with a commodity exposure are leading the losses clp rub or zar while asian fx remains vulnerable due to its direct trade links to china it is the higher beta commodity exposed em fx leading the losses partly because the managed decline in cny is limiting the spillover into regional em asia currencies should the situation deteriorate we would expect the same pattern to continue with commodity em fx leading the losses typically latam fx and its big metals exposure perform poorly in this environment rates low or lower rates with flatter curves market psychology is an important starting point as we progressed towards the end of 2019 there were numerous good reasons for the 10yr us yield to attempt a break back above 2 but despite elevated us consumer confidence tight labour market and an improved trade war narrative that break higher never really materialised we saw this from the structure of the curve too as the 5yr remained very rich to 2 s and 10 s which is a classic sign that a preference was there to test the downside rather than the upside this is why backed by weak pmis our projections pitched a lower rates bias fast forward to january 2020 and it has just taken a flu from china to cause a significant move down to 1 6 that is not to underplay the event as one thing we do know is we are at the beginning of an event that could easily stretch for months the sars virus is a go to template as there are more similarities than differences and it stretched from november 2002 to june 2003 remarkably back then the fed funds rate was very similar to where it is today 1 75 it had been cut from 6 5 on the dot com crash and ultimately got down to 1 after the flu had faded it is not easy to break out precise market reactions but before the flu had receded the 10yr yield had fallen from around 4 down to a little under 3 25 part of this was the virus but a large part was also the other background noise the curve was already steep c 200bp and only steepened further on the final fed cut to 1 away from the virus itself it is interesting to note the difference in the shape of the 2 10yr curve 200bp and the level of the 10yr yield back then 4 compared to now where we have a 20bp sub 2 combo a good illustration of the excess of demand oversupply that is driving yields today so there are numerous nuances to consider as we examine the current circumstances first and foremost rates were already in a stressed mode before the flu virus narrative hit and the subsequent move has confirmed the path of least resistance lower rates second risk assets have been worried about a catalyst that could take back the outsized gains made in 2019 and this virus event is as good a catalyst as any that vulnerability can become circular and push core rates even lower however let s not get carried away here it does not mean we need to push our 1 5 target for the 10yr lower though for that to happen we d need to see a more definitive turn for the worse from a eurozone perspective this is the last thing the ecb needs europe is already down with germany and italy at the bottom of the spectrum of contemporaneous growth observations as the ecb practically is out of bullets the german 10yr yield has shot down to almost 40bp that said the treasury bund spread has tightened which means that the move in us treasuries has been more significant there is already a deep negative discount in the price for eurozone bonds but with the likely ecb standing pat at 50bp there is a limit to how bad things can get for that to change again we d need to see a clear turn for the worse on the virus impact bottom line market rates are likely to remain low at about current levels or lower in the coming weeks and likely months curves will maintain a flattening bias as central bank action is unlikely given what we know so far reversion to higher rates would need evidence that there has been a positive turn of the tide in the meantime an information vacuum perception sustains vulnerability credit rollercoaster european credit spreads widened significantly earlier in the week on the back of the virus news however it seems spreads have simmered now this all comes after we have seen some substantial performance in january with spreads tightening down to the lower levels seen in 2019 this was in line with our mildly bullish view on credit for 2020 driven by a swing in technicals lower net supply and of course cspp we stand by our long term call of tighter spreads and flatter curves but of course the coronavirus is a potential threat as for the underperformance autos were hit worst as well as the longer end of the curve causing some steepening the chinese car market the largest in the world is very important for european car producers 2019 had been a dismal year for chinese car sales and further spreading of the virus could dampen any hope of a recovery this year pressuring spreads further in addition wuhan accounts for a sizeable portion of chinese car production energy and some consumer names were also amongst the worst performers on monday it is clear that if things are set to get worse it will be these higher beta names that will underperform most significantly for instance the consumer sector is looking tighter compared to the industrials particularly because they have traded very in line in the past we may see consumers pull back up to this level we therefore stand by our call for being overweight non cyclical of course if the news turns more positive we will likely see euro spreads return down to the tight spreads we saw last week in em credit space the fallout has been limited on balance credit spreads widened by 17bp based on bloomberg barclays em usd aggregate index over the last week but this has been matched by a decrease in underlying core rates with us 10yr treasuries also rallying 15bp meaning that all in yields have little changed on balance that said we have seen a spread decompression across the lines of credit quality with high yield widening by 34bp while investment grade names remained fairly insulated 9bp only implying that there has been a shift into safe havens within the asset class technicals have remained supportive so far with efpr global reporting us 8bn of inflows into em debt in the first three weeks of january following us 40bn of inflows throughout 2019 notwithstanding we expect some softening of technicals and sentiment as the spread of the virus continues while the fallout on the economic picture is still unclear we see a key risk for em sovereigns with weaker fiscal and external balance sheets as well as those more exposed to a slowdown in china aside from trade and investment channels with em asia sub saharan africa and commodity producers most affected we would be concerned on a reversal in the strong investor sentiment in em credit source ing

washington dc jan 30 ips economic activity in latin america and the caribbean stagnated in 2019 continuing with the weak growth momentum of the previous five years and adding more urgency and new challenges to reignite growth indeed real gdp per capita in the region has declined by 0 6 percent per year on average during 2014 2019 a sharp contrast from the commodity boom s average increase of two percent per year during 2000 2013 this weak momentum reflects structural and cyclical factors on the structural side potential growth remains constrained by low investment slow productivity growth a weak business climate and the low quality of infrastructure and education on the cyclical side growth has been held back by low global growth and commodity prices elevated economic policy uncertainty economic rebalancing in some economies and social unrest in others regional challenges elevated policy uncertainty in several large latin american countries continues to weigh on growth for example uncertainty about the course of economic policy and reforms in brazil and mexico likely contributed to the slowdown in real gdp and investment growth in 2019 continued economic rebalancing in stressed economies that experienced sudden stops in capital flows in 2018 19 argentina ecuador while helping restore internal and external balances have also acted as a drag on economic growth more recently a few countries in the region experienced social unrest bolivia colombia chile and ecuador which in some cases disrupted economic activity economic policy uncertainty has also risen in these countries as governments consider alternative policies and reforms to make growth more inclusive and address social demands outlook and risks as noted in the recent world economic outlook update growth in the region is projected to rebound to 1 6 percent in 2020 and 2 3 percent in 2021 supported by a gradual pick up in global growth and commodity prices continued monetary support reduced economic policy uncertainty and a gradual recovery in stressed economies however there are also prominent downside risks while previous external downside risks have moderated following globally synchronized monetary policy easing and the signing of the u s china phase one trade deal some new risks have appeared including the potential global spread of the coronavirus which could significantly disrupt global economic activity trade and travel domestic and regional downside risks have also intensified social unrest could spike throughout the region while economic policy uncertainty could rise further due to both heightened social tensions and policy slippages policy priorities economic policies will need to strike a balance between rebuilding policy space and maintaining economic stability on the one hand and supporting economic activity and strengthening the social safety net on the other hand although the causes and triggers of social unrest have varied across countries they generally reflect discontent with some aspects of the economic and political systems a key priority going forward is to reignite growth while making it more inclusive promoting competition will be important to avoid monopolistic practices that may hurt the poor disproportionally tackling corruption and weak governance will help make political systems more representative although deeper political reforms may be needed fiscal policy will need to support to growth expand the social safety net and improve the quality of public goods and services however in many countries spending room in the budget remains constrained by high deficits and public debt these countries will need to improve spending efficiency reallocate spending from nonpriority areas to public investment and social transfers and increase revenues over the medium term to finance additional increases in these areas monetary policy can remain accommodative to support growth given the stable inflation outlook well anchored inflation expectations and declining neutral rates worldwide south america in brazil growth remained subdued at 1 2 percent in 2019 but is projected to accelerate to 2 2 percent in 2020 due to improving confidence following the approval of the pension reform and lower monetary policy interest rates in the context of low inflation steady implementation of the government s broad fiscal and structural reform agenda will be essential to safeguard public debt sustainability and boost potential growth in chile the outlook is subject to uncertainty resulting from social unrest and the evolving policy responses to the social demands following a sharp decline in late 2019 economic activity is expected to recover gradually supported by a significant fiscal expansion and looser monetary policy with growth reaching about 1 percent in 2020 in colombia strong domestic demand led to a pickup in growth to 3 3 percent in 2019 and a widening of the current account deficit to 4Â½ percent of gdp growth is projected to accelerate to around 3Â½ percent in 2020 due to continued monetary support migration from venezuela remittances civil works and higher investment due to recent tax policy changes in peru growth is estimated to have slowed to 2 4 percent in 2019 hampered by lower global trade and under execution of government spending with these factors dissipating in the coming years growth is projected to recover to 3 2 percent in 2020 and 3 7 percent in 2021 with inflation remaining well anchored within the central bank s target range venezuela remains immersed in a deep economic and humanitarian crisis since the end of 2013 real gdp has contracted by 65 percent driven by declining oil production hyperinflation collapsing public services and plummeting purchasing power a continuation of these trends is projected for 2020 although at a slower pace the acute humanitarian crisis has led to one of the largest migratory crises in history with migration to neighboring countries expected to surpass 6 million 20 percent of the population by 2020 mexico central america and the caribbean in mexico economic activity stagnated in 2019 due to policy uncertainty and slower global and u s manufacturing production growth is expected to recover to 1 percent in 2020 as conditions normalize including with the ratification of the trade agreement between the united states mexico and canada usmca and the recent easing of monetary policy which should continue as along as inflation expectations are well anchored fiscal policy should be geared at putting the public debt to gdp ratio on a downward trajectory with priority on increasing revenues improving the efficiency of spending and enhancing the fiscal framework in central america panama and the dominican republic growth is projected to rebound to 3 9 percent in 2020 from 3 2 percent in 2019 supported by the beginning of operations of a large copper mine in panama and accommodative monetary policy in costa rica and the dominican republic in costa rica continued implementation of all measures in the fiscal reform bill will be key to rebuild market confidence and fiscal space in honduras the economic plan includes important efforts to improve institutional governance and anti corruption frameworks supporting business confidence while guatemala is expected to continue benefitting from a fiscal impulse and economic reform plans of the new administration el salvador is already reaping the effects of the pro growth agenda of the new administration inaugurated in june while unfavorable political tensions in nicaragua are creating a significant headwind to economic recovery in the caribbean economic prospects are improving but with substantial variation across countries growth in tourism dependent economies is expected to strengthen in 2020 with commodity prices remaining broadly stable commodity exporters are expected to see modest recovery in growth while large oil discoveries and the start of their production in 2020 is expected to boost growth in guyana the region s exposure to climate risks continues to require strong policies potential growth continues to be impeded by lingering structural problems including high public debt weaker financial systems high unemployment and vulnerability to commodity and climate

still trading in the united states and elsewhere these exchange traded funds or etfs are moving on investors expectations for where chinese stocks would be if markets in mainland china were still open the xtrackers harvest csi 300 china a shares etf tracks an index of large stocks that trade in shanghai and shenzhen for example it s down roughly 9 since jan 23 the virus has infected almost 10 000

the yield on the 10 year treasury fell to 1 51 from 1 55 late thursday in another sign of how much fear is in the market the yield on the three month treasury rose above the 10 year yield a relatively rare occurrence that hasn t happened since october investors see such inversions as a fairly reliable warning signal of a recession within a year or so though the track record isn t perfect economists are scrambling to calculate the virus impact on china s economy the chinese economy is far bigger and more closely integrated with the rest of the world than it was at the time of the sars outbreak 17 years ago china now accounts for 16 of global economic output up from 4 in 2003 ben may director of global macro research at oxford economics estimates that the virus will shave 0 4 percentage points off chinese economic growth this year leaving it at 5 6 the slowest since 1990 and reduce global growth by 0 2 percentage points to 2 3 the weakest since the financial crisis others expect a repeat of the sars experience a quarter or two of weaker chinese growth followed by a quick and full recovery with limited fallout worldwide history suggests that unless the end of the world is going to be caused by this flu like virus it will prove to be only a slight headwind for the global economy carl weinberg chief economist at high frequency economics wrote in a research report concerns over the potential impact the virus could have intensified friday after the u s state department warned against travel to china and some u s carriers responded by suspending flights the move by u s airlines helped deepen a slide in oil prices u s crude fell nearly 6 in january a decline that coincides with a sell off on energy stocks the sector is down 11 2 for the year the biggest decliner in the s p 500 industrial stocks which include airlines and other transportation companies also ended the month in the red the economic and market impact now are becoming much more significant and those two sectors are probably the most important to keep an eye on said samana if you re going to restrict travel and you re going to restrict movement you re by default going to hit energy prices exxon mobil

rating agency moody s investors service moody s has affirmed ghana s long term issuer and senior unsecure bond ratings at b3 it has also changed the outlook of ghana from stable to positive the decisions were announced last friday in a statement issued by moody s in new york positive reasons according to the statement moody s has concurrently affirmed the rating of the bond enhanced by a partial guarantee from the international development association ida aaa stable at b1 the decision to assign a positive outlook the statement noted reflected moody s rising confidence that the country s institutions and policy settings would foster improved macroeconomic and fiscal stability over the medium term in part as a consequence of the reforms implemented under the recent imf reform programme those reforms are beginning to bear fruit as seen for example in the return to primary fiscal surpluses measures to smooth the debt maturity profile and increasingly sustainable growth prospects it said pressures and risks remain as evidenced by persistent revenue challenges a potential repeat of pre election fiscal cycles and the emergence of significant arrears and further contingent liabilities in the energy sector all contributing to rising public debt it added increasing confidence it stated that the positive outlook reflected increasing confidence that the government would manage those pressures in such a way as to sustain and enhance external and fiscal stability the decision to affirm the b3 rating balances for now those positive medium term trends and existing challenges it added flow reversals the statement however indicated that a key constraint on the rating was the country s significant exposure to international capital flow reversals which tended to coincide with exchange rate volatility and rising external and domestic borrowing costs putting pressure on already weak debt affordability measures which reduce that exposure by demonstrating reliable liquidity risk management and increasingly firm control over the debt position would support an upgrade to a b2 rating it said however those measures will take time to evidence impact as a consequence the outlook is unlikely to be resolved quickly and may even extend beyond the usual 18 month period in order to monitor how the policy unfolds following the forthcoming election and in particular the government s progress in implementing its energy recovery strategy it added deposit ceilings ghana s foreign and local currency bond and deposit ceilings it observed remain unchanged namely the foreign currency bond ceiling at b1 the foreign currency deposit ceiling at caa1 and the local currency bond and deposit ceilings at ba3 giving the rationale behind the rating the statement explained that for some time ghana s rating had been constrained by two related factors first by the challenges its policymaking institutions have experienced in establishing a consistent set of policies which support macroeconomic and financial stability and which survive changes of government second by the high level of external commercial debt holdings which taken alongside limited net foreign exchange reserves exposes the government and the balance of payments to a loss of international investors confidence in policymakers ability to sustain economic and financial stability raising the risk of a fiscal or balance of payments crisis positive dev t however it noted in recent years that ghana had seen a number of positive developments in key credit metrics which partly reflect the institutional and fiscal reforms implemented under the four year imf programme that was completed in april 2019 according to the statement these include a return to sustained economic growth at around five per cent on average supported by the development of domestic hydrocarbon resources and the prospect of sustained non oil growth driven by the restoration of power supply and renewed infrastructure investment a structural improvement in the current account dynamics and fiscal reforms which have resulted in primary surpluses since 2017 key fiscal reforms include the public financial management act 2016 which improves fiscal governance and the fiscal responsibility law 2018 requiring adherence to an overall fiscal deficit ceiling of five per cent of gdp and a primary surplus 2019 saw a cash deficit of 4 8 of gdp and a primary surplus of 0 9 of gdp weaker than the initial targets but within overall limits it explained key expectation moody s said it expects a similar outcome this year and a renewed shift to fiscal consolidation following the election it added that measures taken over the past couple of years to recapitalize the financial sector and to address the country s power deficit albeit the latter with problematic unintended consequences also suggested active moderately effective policymaking and supported rising confidence in policymakers ability to sustain economic and financial stability and to limit the risk of external shocks in the coming years nevertheless challenges remain alongside developments which suggest that the roots of the institutional reforms are for now at least shallow the rise in deficits in 2019 as the election approaches as in past cycles suggests a high likelihood that the usual pre election fiscal stimulus will emerge in 2020 the statement noted fiscal targets had been achieved in part by recording as below the line items fiscal costs relating to the recapitalization of the banking sector and to energy legacy debts which had caused the overall debt burden to continue to rise it added the government is contemplating issuing additional collateralized debt to support investment in bauxite refining in part to absorb surplus energy downgrading ghana in june 2014 under then president john mahama moody s downgraded ghana s credit rating to b2 with negative outlook it got worse a year later in march 2015 when ghana went further down to b3 with a negative outlook as a result borrowing became more expensive and ghana had to secure guarantees from the world bank to even go to the international bond market it was the same year ghana ran to the imf for a bailout but since 2017 the recovery has been on and the necessary platform for protecting businesses and creating jobs has been strengthened other ratings in september 2018 the other credit rating agency standard and poor s for the first time in almost a decade upgraded ghana from b to b experts have said in sourcing for cheaper funds on the international capital market with ghana going for another eurobond early next month the positive rating should make the yield on our bonds even better for ghana than in previous

chief executive officer of southside at december 31 2019 our nonperforming assets to total assets ratio decreased to 0 26 for the quarter ended december 31 2019 provision for loan losses increased 1 5 million on a linked quarter basis largely due to a partial charge off of a previously reported nonaccrual loan that paid off in the fourth quarter linked quarter our net interest spread and margin declined two and five basis points respectively primarily due to securities increasing more than loans and representing a larger percentage of average earning assets when compared to the third quarter in november we opened our 60th branch location in kingwood just north of houston we have loaned into the houston market for several years and have recently hired a commercial lender designated to this

increase in net interest income for the linked quarter was due to the decrease in interest expense on our interest bearing liabilities a result of a decrease in average rate paid on our interest bearing liabilities during the three months ended december 31 2019 our tax equivalent net interest margin was 2 98 for the three months ended december 31 2019 compared to 3 21 for the same period in 2018 the decrease was due to a decrease in average yield on interest earning assets of 20 basis points and an increase in average interest bearing liabilities partially offset by an increase in interest earnings assets the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was 1 46 for the three months ended december 31 2019 and 2018 our tax equivalent net interest margin decreased 5 basis points compared to 3 03 for the three months ended september 30 2019 this decrease was due to a decrease in the average yield on interest earning assets of 16 basis points and the increase in average interest bearing liabilities noninterest income was 10 5 million for the three months ended december 31 2019 an increase of 3 3 compared to 10 1 million for the same period in 2018 the increase was primarily due to an increase in deposit services income and trust fees on a linked quarter basis noninterest income decreased 0 6 million or 5 8 primarily due to a decrease in swap fee income and fair value of written loan commitments both included in other noninterest income noninterest expense was 30 9 million for the three months ended december 31 2019 an increase of 2 5 compared to 30 2 million for the same period in 2018 the increase was due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits partially offset by decreases in net occupancy expense and fdic insurance expense on a linked quarter basis noninterest expense increased 1 9 million or 6 6 compared to the three months ended september 30 2019 the 1 0 million increase in salaries and employee benefits was primarily related to employee benefits which included 0 6 million of increase in health insurance expense and 0 2 million in salaries and payroll taxes additionally we incurred losses on the disposition of certain assets of

2018 and decreased compared to 15 6 for the three months ended september 30 2019 the higher etr for the three months ended december 31 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in tax exempt income as a percentage of pre tax income for the three months ended december 31 2019 operating results for the year ended december 31 2019 net income was 74 6 million for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to 74 1 million for the same period in 2018 an increase of 0 4 million or 0 6 earnings per diluted common share was 2 20 for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to 2 11 for the same period in 2018 an increase of 4 3 the increase in net income was largely driven by increases in interest income and the net gain on the sale of available for sale securities as well as the decrease in provision for loan losses partially offset by an increase in interest expense and income tax expense returns on average assets and average shareholders equity for the year ended december 31 2019 were 1 17 and 9 53 respectively our efficiency ratio fte was 52 36 1 for the year ended december 31 2019 net interest income for the year ended december 31 2019 was 169 8 million compared to 172 1 million during the same period in 2018 a decrease of 2 3 million or 1 3 the decrease in net interest income was due to an increase in interest expense a result of the higher funding costs of our interest bearing liabilities and to a lesser extent an increase in the average balance of our interest bearing liabilities the increase in interest expense was partially offset by the increase in interest income on our interest earning assets a result of higher interest rates and a shift in the mix of earning assets our tax equivalent net interest margin was 3 06 for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to 3 18 for the same period in 2018 the decrease was primarily due to the higher rates paid on interest bearing liabilities and the increase in average interest bearing liabilities noninterest income was 42 4 million for the year ended december 31 2019 an increase of 3 9 compared to 40 8 million for the same period in 2018 the increase was primarily due to an increase in net gain on sale of securities available for sale and deposit services income partially offset by decreases in other noninterest income bank owned life insurance trust fees and gain on sale of loans noninterest expense was 119 3 million for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to 120 1 million for the same period in 2018 a decrease of 0 8 million or 0 7 the decrease was

for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively the higher etr for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in tax exempt income as a percentage of pre tax income for the year ended december 31 2019 and a discrete tax benefit of approximately 0 8 million recorded in 2018 associated with the remeasurement of our net deferred tax asset balance sheet data at december 31 2019 we had 6 75 billion in total assets compared to 6 12 billion at december 31 2018 and 6 54 billion at september 30 2019 loans at december 31

in the united states and prevailing practices in the banking industry however certain non gaap measures are used by management to supplement the evaluation of our performance these include the following fully taxable equivalent measures fte i net interest income fte ii net interest margin fte iii net interest spread fte and iv efficiency ratio fte which include the effects of taxable equivalent adjustments using a federal income tax rate of 21 for the year ended december 31 2019 and 2018 to increase tax exempt interest income to a tax equivalent basis interest income earned on certain assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax as such these tax exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than taxable investments net interest income fte net interest margin fte and net interest spread fte net interest income fte is a non gaap measure that adjusts for the tax favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments we believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax exempt sources the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap is our net interest income net interest margin fte is the ratio of net interest income fte to average earning assets the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap is our net interest margin net interest spread fte is the difference in the average yield on average earning assets on a tax equivalent basis and the average rate paid on average interest bearing liabilities the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap is our net interest spread efficiency ratio fte the efficiency ratio fte is a non gaap measure that provides a measure of productivity in the banking industry this ratio is calculated to measure the cost of generating one dollar of revenue the ratio is designed to reflect the percentage of one dollar which must be expended to generate that dollar of revenue we calculate this ratio by dividing noninterest expense excluding amortization expense on intangibles and certain nonrecurring expense by the sum of net interest income fte and noninterest income excluding net gain loss on sale of securities available for sale and certain nonrecurring impairments the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap is our efficiency ratio these non gaap financial measures should not be considered alternatives to gaap basis financial statements and other bank holding companies may define or calculate these non gaap measures or similar measures differently whenever we present a non gaap financial measure in an sec filing we are also required to present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap and reconcile the differences between the non gaap financial measure and such comparable gaap measure management believes adjusting net interest income net interest margin and net interest spread to a fully taxable equivalent basis is a standard practice in the banking industry as these measures provide useful information to make peer comparisons tax equivalent adjustments are reflected in the respective earning asset categories as listed in the average balances with average yields and rates tables a reconciliation of our non gaap financial measures to the comparable gaap financial measures is included at the end of the

appendix non gaap financial measures the following definitions are provided for the non gaap financial measures these non gaap financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by u s gaap and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to the calculation of similar measures for other companies management does not intend these items to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measures adjusted profit the company believes it is important to separately quantify the profit impact of four significant items in order for the company s results to be meaningful to readers these items consist of i pension and opeb mark to market losses resulting from plan remeasurements ii u s tax reform impact iii restructuring costs in 2018 which were incurred to generate longer term benefits and iv certain deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments the company does not consider these items indicative of earnings from ongoing business activities and believes the non

karl popper in the open society and its enemies warned against utopian engineering massive social transformations led by those who believe they found a revealed truth these utopian engineers carry out the wholesale destruction of systems institutions and social and cultural structures in a vain effort to achieve their vision in the process they dismantle the self correcting mechanisms of incremental and piecemeal reform that are impediments to that vision history is replete with disastrous utopians the jacobins the marxists the fascists and now in our own age the globalists or neoliberal imperialists the ideology of neoliberalism which makes no economic sense and requires a willful ignorance of social and economic history is the latest iteration of utopian projects it posits that human society achieves its apex when individual entrepreneurial actions are free from government constraints society and culture should be dictated by the primacy of property rights open trade which sends manufacturing jobs to sweatshops in china and the global south and permits the flow of money across borders and unfettered global markets labor and product markets should be deregulated and freed from government oversight global financiers should be given control of the economies of nation states the role of the state should be reduced to ensuring the quality and integrity of money along with internal and external security and to privatizing control of land water public utilities education and government services such as intelligence and often the military prisons health care and the management of natural resources neoliberalism turns capitalism into a religious idol this utopian vision of the market of course bears no relationship to its reality capitalists hate free markets they seek to control markets through mergers and acquisitions buying out the competition they saturate the culture with advertising to manipulate public tastes and consumption they engage in price fixing they build unassailable monopolies they carry out schemes without checks or oversight of wild speculation predation fraud and theft they enrich themselves through stock buybacks ponzi schemes structured asset destruction through inflation asset stripping and the imposition of crippling debt peonage on the public in the united states they saturate the electoral process with money buying the allegiance of elected officials from the two ruling parties to legislate tax boycotts demolish regulations and further consolidate their wealth and power these corporate capitalists spend hundreds of millions of dollars to fund organizations such as business roundtable and the chamber of commerce and think tanks such as the heritage foundation to sell the ideology to the public they lavish universities with donations as long as the universities pay fealty to the ruling ideology they use their influence and wealth as well as their ownership of media platforms to transform the press into their mouthpiece and they silence heretics or make it hard for them to find employment soaring stock values rather than production become the new measure of the economy everything is financialized and commodified these utopians mutilate the social fabric through deindustrialization turning once great manufacturing centers into decayed wastelands and the middle and working class the bulwark of any democracy into a frustrated and enraged precariat they offshore work carry out massive layoffs and depress wages they destroy unions neoliberalism because it was always a class project and this was its goal redistributes wealth upward robbed of the protective covering of cultural institutions karl polanyi writes in his book the great transformation human beings perish from the effects of social exposure and die as victims of acute social dislocation neoliberalism as a class project is a brilliant success eight families now hold as much wealth as 50 of the world s population the world s 500 richest people in 2019 added 12 trillion to their assets while nearly half of all americans had no savings and nearly 70 could not have come up with 1 000 in an emergency without going into debt david harvey calls this accumulation by dispossession this neoliberal assault antagonistic to all forms of social solidarity that put restraints on amassing capital has obliterated the self corrective democratic mechanisms that once made incremental and piecemeal reform possible it has turned human beings and the natural world into commodities to be exploited until exhaustion or collapse the ruling elites slavish devotion to corporate profit and the accumulation of wealth by the global oligarchy means they are unwilling or incapable of addressing perhaps the greatest existential crisis facing the human species the climate emergency all competing centers of power including government have now been seized by corporate power and corrupted or destroyed we have undergone what john ralston saul calls a coup d Ã©tat in slow motion it is over they won at the same time these utopians attempting to project american power and global dominance launched invasions and occupations throughout the middle east that have descended into futile quagmires costing the united states between 5 trillion and 7 trillion dollars this utopian project in afghanistan iraq libya syria and by proxy in yemen has killed hundreds of thousands displaced or made refugees of millions wrecked cities and nations created failed states that incubate radical jihadist groups and fatally weakened american power indeed these wars some now in their 18th year are the greatest strategic blunder in american history the utopians culturally linguistically and historically ignorant of the countries they occupied believed in their naivetÃ© that they could implant democracy in places like baghdad and see it emanate out across the middle east they assured us we would be greeted as liberators the oil revenues would pay for reconstruction and iran would be cowed and defanged this was no more achievable or grounded in reality than the utopian scheme to unfetter the market and unleash worldwide prosperity and liberty once a cabal monarchial communist fascist or neoliberal seizes power its dismantling of the mechanisms that make reform possible leaves those who seek an open society no option but to bring the system down the corporate state like the communist regimes i covered in eastern europe is not reformable from within the failures that plague us are bipartisan failures on all of the major structural issues including war and the economy there is little or no divergence between the two ruling political parties of the u s the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of an oligarchic elite as aristotle warned leaves only two options tyranny or revolution and we are fast on the road to tyranny neoliberal utopianism because it suppresses the freedoms to organize to regulate and to protect the common good and empowers the freedoms to exploit and consolidate wealth and power is always fated polanyi writes to end in authoritarianism or outright fascism the good freedoms are lost the bad ones take over neoliberalism has given rise to the worst form of monopoly capitalism and greatest level of income inequality in american history the banks and the agricultural food arms and communications industries have destroyed regulations that once impeded their monopolies allowing them to fix prices suppress wages guarantee profits abolish environmental controls and abuse their workers they have obliterated free market competition unfettered capitalism as karl marx pointed out destroys the so called free market it is hostile to the values and traditions of a capitalist democracy capitalism s final stage marx wrote is marked by the pillage of the systems and structures that make capitalism possible it is not capitalism at all the arms industry for example with its official 612 billion defense authorization bill a figure that ignores numerous other military expenditures tucked away in other budgets masking the fact that our real expenditure on national security expenses is over 1 trillion a year has gotten the government to commit to spending 348 billion over the next decade to modernize our nuclear weapons and build 12 new ohio class nuclear submarines estimated at 8 billion each we spend some 100 billion a year on intelligence read surveillance and 70 of that money goes to private contractors such as booz allen hamilton which gets 99 of its revenues from the u s government we are the largest exporters of arms in the world the fossil fuel industry swallows up 5 3 trillion a year worldwide in hidden costs to keep burning fossil fuels according to the international monetary fund this money the imf notes is in addition to the 492 billion in direct subsidies offered by governments around the world through write offs write downs and land use loopholes taxpayer subsidies to the big banks jpmorgan chase bank of america citigroup wells fargo and goldman sachs are estimated at 64 billion a year an amount roughly equal to their typical annual profits in 1980 freight trains were deregulated the number of class i railroads shrank from 40 to 7 four account for 90 of the industry s revenue nearly one third of all shippers have access to only one railroad president bill clinton s telecommunications act of 1996 was touted as a way to open the cable industry to competition instead it saw a massive consolidation of the industry into the hands of about half a dozen corporations that control what 90 of americans watch or hear on the airwaves the airline industry freed from regulation was rapidly consolidated four airlines control 85 of the domestic market they have divided the country into regional hubs where they extort fees fix prices cancel flights at will leaving passengers stranded without compensation and provide shoddy service the pharmaceutical and insurance corporations that manage our for profit health care industry extracted 812 billion from americans in 2017 this represents more than one third 34 2 of total expenditures for doctor visits hospitals long term care and health insurance if we had a public health system such as in canada it would save us 600 billion in costs in a single year according to a report by physicians for a national health plan health administration costs in 2017 were more than fourfold higher per capita in the u s than in canada 2 479 versus 551 per person the group notes canada implemented a single payer medicare for all system in 1962 in 2017 americans spent 844 per person on insurers overhead canadians spent 146 neoliberalism cannot be defended as more innovative or more efficient it has not spread democracy and by orchestrating unprecedented levels of income inequality and political stagnation has vomited up demagogues and authoritarian regimes that falsely promise vengeance against ruling elites who betrayed the people our democracy under this assault has been replaced with meaningless political theater as the academics benjamin page and martin gilens detailed in their exhaustive 2017 study democracy in america the best evidence indicates that the wishes of ordinary americans little or no impact on the making of federal government policy wealthy individuals and organized interest groups especially business corporations have much more political clout he general public virtually powerless the will of majorities is thwarted by the affluent and the well organized who block popular policy proposals and enact special favors for themselves majorities of americans favor specific policies designed to deal with such problems as climate change gun violence an untenable immigration system inadequate public schools and crumbling bridges and highways large majorities of america favor various programs to help provide jobs increase wages help the unemployed provide universal medical insurance ensure decent retirement pensions and pay for such programs with progressive taxes most americans also want to cut corporate welfare yet the wealthy business groups and structural gridlock have mostly blocked such new policies there should be no debate about how to effect change piecemeal and incremental reform is always preferable to the inevitable anarchy any power vacuum creates the problem is that our utopian engineers in their giddy dismantling of an economic and democratic system as well as their draining of state resources in the wars they prosecute overseas have dynamited the tools that could save us they have left us no option but to revolt and remove them from power we will carry out sustained acts of civil disobedience to bring down these corporate oligarchs or live in an orwellian tyranny at least until the climate emergency renders the human species extinct regulations laws planning and control are not the enemies of freedom they keep capitalists from extinguishing freedom denying justice and abolishing the common good the freedom of the capitalist class to exploit human beings and the natural world without restraint transforms the freedom for the many into freedom for the few that was always the point

appendix non gaap financial measures the following definitions are provided for the non gaap financial measures these non gaap financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by u s gaap and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to the calculation of similar measures for other companies management does not intend these items to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measures adjusted profit the company believes it is important to separately quantify the profit impact of four significant items in order for the company s results to be meaningful to readers these items consist of i pension and opeb mark to market losses resulting from plan remeasurements ii u s tax reform impact iii restructuring costs in 2018 which were incurred to generate longer term benefits and iv certain deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments the company does not consider these items indicative of earnings from ongoing business activities and believes the non

its fitness business starting with the second quarter of 2019 the historical and future results of this business are now reported as discontinued operations therefore for all periods presented in this release all figures and outlook statements incorporate this change and reflect continuing operations only unless otherwise noted i would now like to turn the call over to dave dave foulkes chief executive officer thanks al and good morning everybody 2019 was a very successful year for brunswick and our shareholders we delivered record earnings for the 10th consecutive year substantially grew margins made significant additions to our product portfolio manufacturing capacity in technology platforms completed meaningful cost reduction actions and have emerged as the world s premier recreational marine company our solid fourth quarter performance reflects the continued successful execution of our marine strategy and reinforces the tremendous confidence we have in the future growth opportunities within each of our businesses the more favorable retail trends in the u s persisted in the quarter and together with planned lower wholesale shipment activity resulted in us achieving our stated goals in the lower field inventory than 2018 and relatively flat pipelines on a weeks on hand basis aside from our updated estimates on tariffs our views on our 2020 financial goals have not changed and i have a high degree of confidence that we will execute our strategy and deliver strong shareholder returns in 2020 we started the year off an exciting fashion with a spectacular debut at ces and new product launches at early boat shows and i look forward to leading brunswick through further successes in our first full year as an integrated marine powerhouse i ll now provide some highlights on our segments and the overall marine market the marine engine segment had tremendous success in 2019 again posting record earnings and significant margin increases this was in the face of approximately 25 million of headwinds from unfavorable changes in foreign currency rates in tariffs and partially mitigated by a full year of solid performance by power products demand for higher horsepower outboard engines remains particularly strong especially in the 175 to 300 horsepower categories introduced in 2018 and the 400 and 500 horsepower engines released in 2019 during the fourth quarter we brought online additional capacity allowing us to manufacture significantly more of these engines in 2020 with dealers and international channels already seeing some of the benefits in the fourth quarter we also continue to expand our outboard engine presence in saltwater markets our industry leading engine lineup was on full display at the fort lauderdale boat show where we again had a leading engine share and we plan to continue our success at miami in two weeks finally in december we announced the formation of the advanced systems group which is comprised of the power products brands and the attwood group of businesses which include attwood whale garelick and motorguide power products continues to perform in line with our expectations and is accretive to the overall growth and margins of the parts and accessories portfolio brett dibkey who joined us at the start of the year from whirlpool will be leading asg that brings a great combination of talent and relevant experience to deliver future growth in these outstanding businesses in the boat segment revenue and earnings in 2019 were lower as anticipated but we are primed for sizable improvement in 2020 due to our new products focus on operating efficiency and wholesale volume improvements enabled by the lowering of pipeline inventories in 2019 to appropriate levels our premium boat brands including boston whaler sea ray and lund all performed strongly at retail in their key product categories sea ray also had strong wholesale sales growth with larger higher content product driving the improved sales as we discussed on recent calls boston whaler continues to have very strong retail momentum as we exit 2019 however wholesale sales in the second half of the year faced challenging comparisons versus 2018 in 2019 the business has been leaning pipelines in advance of new product introductions in 2020 compared to strong pipeline increases in 2018 due to the introduction of new rail models as we enter 2020 with a substantial offering of new products we anticipate a very strong retail and wholesale performance from this brand in our upcoming year the boat business continues to focus on product leadership and expanding operating margins the cost reduction and organizational initiatives that we undertook in the back half of 2019 are already driving efficiencies and allowing us to fully leverage our scale and drive operational excellence sharing knowledge engineering capabilities and best practices across brands is enhancing our product and technology development and design excellence while lowering related costs and accelerating time to market lastly freedom boat club celebrated the opening of its 200th franchise location early in the quarter on its way to a current total of 210 locations and continues to perform as anticipated freedom was also named as a top 500 franchise with the top spot in the miscellaneous recreational business category by entrepreneur magazine which is a further testament to the substantial opportunities associated with this business next i would like to review the year to date sales performance of our segments by region on a constant currency basis excluding acquisitions in the u s total revenues were down 4 while international sales in total were up 4 international sales for the engine segment increased by 6 with gains in all regions except canada the engine segment performance relates mostly to increased demand for 175 to 300 horsepower engines boat segment international sales were down 4 as expected european sales continue to be lower due to the slower market condition and the supply constraint caused by the transition from a contract manufacturing relationship that we noted at the beginning of the year this capacity is anticipated to be fully recovered as we exit 2020 as a result of production expansion efforts at our manufacturing facility in portugal with minimal investment finally canadian boat revenue remained flat versus prior year this table provides some color on the performance of the u s marine retail market in the fourth quarter which comprises only 10 of the total sales for the year retail trends continue to be slightly ahead of our expectations for the second half of 2019 retail sales of outboard boats were up 3 while the main powerboat segments were up 1 outboard engine sales were up 1 for the year ssi data for the main powerboat segments was down 4 for the year nmma outboard engine unit registrations are up slightly year to date with outboards 150 horsepower and above up 9 for the year these results reflect the softness experienced in value pontoon and aluminum fish categories in the first half of the year and strength in premium offerings which is generating dollar growth that is outpacing unit performance we remain confident in the market environment as we move into 2020 dealer sentiment is positive with well positioned pipeline inventories and strong early season dealership traffic we believe that retail unit growth for both u s and global markets will be flat to slightly positive in 2020 with outperformance of premium offerings again benefiting dollar growth 2019 was also a very significant year for capital strategy actions as anticipated we completed the remainder of our 400 million share repurchase commitment in the quarter which together with the purchase of freedom boat club in may fully deploys the new proceeds from our fitness sale in addition we completed the exit of our defined benefit pension plans retired 300 million of near term debt through the retirement of our 2021 notes and refinancing of acquisition related debt raised dividends and invested over 350 million in growth related r d and capital expenditures our year end balance sheet position and cash flow generation capabilities continue to afford us the opportunity to deploy capital in a variety of ways depending on market conditions including for acquisitions capacity enhancements debt reduction or further share repurchases bill will speak more on our specific plans for 2020 during his outlook section later on this call i ll now turn the call over to bill for additional comments on our financial performance bill metzger chief financial officer thanks dave for the full year net sales were up 1 versus 2018 with acquisitions providing four points of growth operating earnings on an as adjusted basis increased by 6 with solid margin expansion of 50 basis points we finished the year with an adjusted eps of 4 33 per share which exceeded our most recent guidance this reflected a more favorable tax rate and strong execution by our businesses particularly mercury as anticipated fourth quarter sales were down 4 with slight decreases in operating earnings and margin our operating deleverage reflects the timing of some tariff related activity in 2018 which i will address in upcoming comments in the marine engine segment revenue was also relatively consistent with q4 of 2018 as continued robust demand for higher horsepower outboard engines especially in dealer and international sales channels and gains in p a sales led by solid growth at power products were offset by anticipated softness in outboard engines 150 horsepower and below in sterndrive engines for the full year mercury sales were up 3 with power products contributing 5 of growth mercury s adjusted operating margins and operating earnings were also slightly lower in the quarter as comparisons between years were unfavorably influenced by the impact of a tariff exemption received in december 2018 for the full year adjusted operating margins increased by a substantial 100 basis points outpacing our expectations this performance included contributions from power products improving sales mix and operating efficiency gains which exceeded the impact of tariffs and unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates in the boat segment adjusted revenues were lower by 15 in the fourth quarter as we completed our planned pipeline rebalancing efforts for the full year sales were lower by 6 versus 2018 but were in line with our revised expectations from july by category in the quarter aluminum freshwater sales were down primarily due to the planned reductions in value pontoons and aluminum fish products recreational fiberglass remained essentially flat and saltwater fishing performance was lower but in line and with our expectations due to the wholesale and pipeline dynamics dave described earlier wholesale units sold in the fourth quarter were down 21 versus q4 2018 with a 13 decrease for the full year average selling prices increased reflecting a more favorable mix and expanded content on boats margins for the fourth quarter and full year decreased versus prior year periods due to several factors including pressure from the impact of lower volume and production rates plant inefficiencies due in part to new product integrations higher retail discounts in previous quarters required a lower pipelines during the second half of the year the impact of these factors exceeding benefits from cost reduction and operation excellence initiatives which will also contribute to margin growth in future years pipelines are well positioned as we start the year and enter the boat show season dealer pipelines ended the year with 36 6 weeks of boats on hand measured on a trailing 12 month basis which is essentially in line with year end 2018 levels however on a unit basis field inventory is down 7 versus the end of 2018 in 2020 the plan assumes that pipelines will decrease slightly our fourth quarter continuing operations gaap results also reflect the impact of certain items that are excluded from our as adjusted results and in operating earnings these include restructuring exit impairment and other charges in the quarter totaling 3 8 million primarily related to our previously announced structural cost reductions taken across the enterprise in addition we incurred 7 5 million of purchase accounting amortization in connection with the power products and freedom boat club acquisitions finally we recorded 4 9 million of charges related to the legacy s sport yacht and yacht products moving to 2020 and guidance for the year we anticipate diluted eps as adjusted of between 5 10 and 5 40 per share taking into account our view of the market our cost reduction efforts in 19 as well as some of the more recent tariff developments which i discuss on the next slide we believe that the four main eps drivers that we have discussed on our last few calls namely the impact from successful execution of our capital strategy additional 175 plus horsepower outboard engine capacity normal p a seasonal demand and our diligent management of pipeline inventory levels each remain intact and support our view on eps our plan contemplates revenue growth of between 6 and 8 operating margin improvements of between 40 and 60 basis points continuing the favorable margin trends from recent years operating expenses should decrease as a percentage of our sales due in part to the full year impact of the cost measures taken in 2019 we are also projecting low double digit percent growth in operating earnings and free cash flow in excess of 3 and 325 million first quarter revenue growth of low single digits will under index to the full year expectations this is due mostly to the timing of wholesale shipments in 2019 and the significant reductions in the second half of the year eps in the first quarter will increase by high single digit percent versus q1 2019 mostly due to benefits from 2019 share repurchases now moving to tariffs we anticipate a net impact to 2020 pre tax earnings of between 30 million and 35 million or 10 million to 15 million incremental to the 2019 impact the incremental impact is due solely to our wave 1 exemption on the 40 to 60 horsepower engines not being extended into 2020 as you likely know very few exemptions were extended we are highly disappointed in this outcome and would note that our non u s engine competitors import cost is not affected by these tariffs despite utilizing the very same chinese supply chain for engine components otherwise there are no changes to our tariff assumptions we are anticipating wave 1 through three tariffs staying at the 25 rate and that any wave 4 tariffs will not have any material impact on our businesses we are not assuming any additional tariff exemptions being granted although we do have several wave 3 exemptions still under review by the ustr which could total up to 5 million of in relief if fully granted on the boat side the impact of retaliatory tariffs on boat exports to the eu remains unchanged and incorporated into our plan we continue to proactively take actions to minimize the impact of our tariffs on our businesses which are included in our estimates and we are evaluating alternative manufacturing and supply chain strategies to further mitigate the impacts i will conclude with an update on certain items that will impact our p l and cash flow for 2020 we are anticipating free cash flow for the year in excess of 325 million and our free cash flow conversion will approach 80 we expect to use between 30 million and 50 million of cash for working capital for the year and incur between 120 million and 130 million of depreciation and amortization our effective tax rate is estimated to be between the 21 and 22 for the year and the cash tax rate is anticipated to be in the low to mid teens percent range finally including the impact of the 400 million of share repurchases completed in 19 along with planned repurchases in 2020 our average shares outstanding for 2020 will be approximately 79 5 million shares we will execute our balanced capital strategy in 2020 leveraging our strong free cash flow generation we plan to retire approximately 100 million of our long term of our term loan obligations and expect to lower our debt to ebitda ratio to less than one point five times on a gross basis by the end of the year our net interest expense is estimated to be about 65 million for the year we anticipate spending between 20 200 million and 220 million on capital expenditures throughout the year including investments in new product in our engine p a and premium boat businesses cost reduction and automation products and additional capacity in our propulsion business finally we plan to return to a systematic approach to share repurchases and our plan includes 100 million of repurchases in 2020 spread relatively evenly across the year i ll now turn the call back to dave to continue our outlook comments dave foulkes chief executive officer thanks bill i d like to provide some commentary on our new segment reporting which we signaled on our third quarter call during 2019 brunswick implemented a series of strategic and organizational initiatives to sharpen the focus of the company on the recreational marine market and adjacent opportunities starting in 2020 the company s strategies are now focused on four business pillars propulsion parts and accessories boats and business aceleration as a result the existing marine engine segment will now be broken into two segments beginning in the first quarter of 2020 the propulsion segment which will contain both outboard and sterndrive engine businesses along with controls and rigging products which are closely associated with our propulsion businesses and the p a segment which will contain all of the p a categories including engine parts and consumables electrical products boat parts and systems and our distribution business concurrent with this change our company has also decided to change its measurement of segment profit and loss due to a decision to streamline internal and external reporting practices related to marine engine sold from the propulsion segment to the boat segment this change in presentation which is not the result of a change in business practice more closely follows current market dynamics and provides improved comparability with other boat companies consistent with past practice we have provided select historical information reflecting this new reporting structure in today s form 8 k we believe that these changes will allow investors to more clearly evaluate the performance and value of each business especially the aftermarket focused inn the p a business which contributes nearly half of the earnings of the corporation moving to our outlook by segment under the new structure 2020 is setting up to be a fantastic year for all of our businesses for our propulsion segment we anticipate net sales growth for the first for the year of between 6 to 8 with operating margins that are flat to up slightly versus 2019 we expect earnings growth even with currency headwinds and the significant incremental tariff impact that bill discussed earlier our top priority for this segment continues to be satisfying outboard engine demand and expanding market share especially in the greater than 175 horsepower categories enabled by the added production capacity that now our online for higher horsepower engines we also anticipate additional margin benefits as we satisfy greater levels of demand in the dealer repower and international channels we remain focused on developing new platforms and technology for our engines and related control systems and are investing in a robust new product pipeline to enable top line and earnings growth into the future finally we remain committed to delivering improved technology and performance in our sterndrive and inboard lineup of engines although a much smaller component of our business versus a decade ago these products serve a loyal customer base and it remains our goal to retain our market leadership position in this category turning to our parts and accessories segment we anticipate organic net sales growth of between 4 and 6 accompanied by solid margin improvement as a reminder operating margins in this segment were just shy of 20 in 2019 with more than 75 of segment revenues derived from the aftermarket if you include the controls and rigging business which is now part of the propulsion segment operating margins were in the low 20 range consistent with what we have articulated in the past we will continue to concentrate our m a efforts in this area as we have the ability to build out our technology stack and fill white space product areas through acquisitions potential bolt on deals in this area are generally in the 20 million to 50 million range which could be funded from free cash flow the growth of power products which is now part of the advanced systems group as i discussed earlier continues to outpace the rest of our p a business and should benefit from more normal aftermarket demand and improved oem outlook in 2020 along with new products and other business opportunities our attwood group which is the other portion of asg also plans to leverage new products and a streamlined operating model to increase margins and earnings this year we are very excited and confident in the outlook and growth opportunities for this business under brett s leadership finally our boat business as keenly focused on improving operational performance and completing significant product launches and integrations in 2020 the combination of which should lead to top line growth of between 6 and 8 and strong improvement in operating earnings and margins including the change in the reporting segments i discussed earlier we anticipate exiting 2021 with double digit margins in this segment in miami in a few weeks we will give further information on how we can reach even more aggressive margin targets by the end of our new three year plan our efforts in the back half of 2019 to manage pipeline inventory levels put us in a favorable position entering this year with 2020 wholesale sales expected to be to more closely match retail sales for the year resulting in top line growth versus 2019 additionally our structural cost reductions as well as the strategic actions within this segment that i referenced earlier in the call will both provide benefits to our margin expansion plans in 2020 and beyond we will continue to expand freedom boat club and execute against its strategic growth strategy we anticipate adding another 30 locations in 2020 and capitalizing on our synergy opportunities notably for the freedom fleet conversion to brunswick boats and mercury engines is ahead of plan and we anticipate strong sales into the franchisee base in 2020 lastly as shown in fort lauderdale with the launch of the boston whaler 315 and 405 conquest models at ces where we debuted the sea ray slx r 400e and in new york with the whaler 280 vantage launch our aggressive new product cadence is generating additional higher margin sales and capturing market share although the integration of these new products will likely result in a slight operational headwind during the first half of the year these new products leverage technology capabilities from across our integrated marine platform that enable users to more easily enjoy their day on the water finally as many of you know brunswick exhibited for the first time at the consumer electronics show in 2020 showcasing our technology on a global stage we not only launched the new sea ray slx r 400e with our unique fathom power management system but our team created a concept helm that illustrated what the future of boating could look like the exhibit was awarded an a grade and we engaged with more than 40 potential partners that are interested in collaboration with us in areas such as artificial intelligence sensors autonomy and more the traffic in our exhibit far exceeded our expectations and we counted anywhere between 30 and 60 people per minute taking pictures in our exhibit eight hours a day for four days we also garnered national media attention and still have more stories in the queue ces 2020 was so successful that we have already signed up for ces 2021 in case you are wondering yes we sold the boats on display it will be delivered after the miami boat show two people said that they wanted that exact boat and we have taken orders for several more just like it in closing we had record earnings in 2019 and are proud of what we accomplished as a company but our focus has now turned to 2020 and beyond we will introduce an updated 2020 to 2022 strategic plan at our investor day in miami on tuesday february 11 and hope you will join us for this event 2020 is our first full year of operations as an integrated marine enterprise we have the best recreational marine brands in the world the most capable workforce and a streamlined strategy that has positioned us for success in any economic environment we plan on executing against our strategic plan and delivering shareholder returns consistent with our long term goals we are confident that you will see that innovation and inspiration on water isn t just a phase but it s the purpose that separates us and from all other companies in our space and that drives us to be to deliver the best on water experiences for our customers which in turn will create and sustain lasting value for all our stakeholders i ll now open the line for questions questions answers operator and our first question comes from james hardiman with wedbush your line is open james hardiman wedbush securities analyst hey good morning thanks for taking my call it was a strong finish to the year so i figured i d start with a nitpick here so inventory three months ago you said you thought they d be flat to down in terms of weeks on hand it seems like the retail environment was if anything better than expected they finished up just a fair what s the difference there and then as i think about competitive inventory levels i think that certainly the checks that we have done would suggest that you guys have been a lot more aggressive maybe than some of your peers is there any concern that that could create sort of a heightened competitive environment here in 2020 dave foulkes chief executive officer james and thanks for joining us yes i think it s not possible for us to manage inventories down to the nearest 0 1 but i would tell you given the start to the retail season in 2020 i m pleased that we finished slightly on the upside versus slightly on the downside because i think that we have this potential risk of it s more of a risk of it s not having enough than there is of having too much right now so i think we managed very diligently we managed units down very well managing exactly to the ten of a week is probably is not something we can do but i think to all intents and purposes we finished as we planned and i have no problem with that very slight kind of half a week i think what we have seen more broadly across our competitors and is good behavior i think some started a little later than we did coming down so i don t see broadly across the industry that excess inventory of competitors is going to be a hurdle for us going into the year james hardiman wedbush securities analyst ok and should i interpret the first answer as you feel a little bit better about where demand is likely to go than maybe you did three months ago dave foulkes chief executive officer yes you should interpret it that way i think the early season dealer traffic has been good boat shows have been good and dealer sentiment is positive so i would say that the season is off to a good start for us so yes so that s a good interpretation i m glad we are where we are james hardiman wedbush securities analyst ok got it and then i think you essentially answered this but the incremental tariff on the 40 to 60 horsepower outboards that request actually got denied or have you just not gotten any approval yet so i guess what i m asking is there any chance that that could come back it sounds like the answer to the question is no is that the way to think about it dave foulkes chief executive officer yes so i think the process as it turns out is different every time and when we first were granted the exemption the u s was speaking with companies individually this time of this i think in several hundred extension requests only a handful were granted and the message that we got was that that was it so i don t know if we actually finally got our company communication but the message that we have is that no further exemptions are on the table operator thank you and our next question comes from craig kennison with baird your line is open craig kennison robert w baird analyst good morning thanks very much for taking my questions and congratulations on a big year last year bill i had a question on gross margin is there any way you can frame gross margin for both propulsion and the p a segment i know you are not going to give me a precise number but any light you can shed there would help us build our models bill metzger chief financial officer craig we really don t get to that level of specificity in anything that we report externally i think we do talk generally about kind of how things may index above or below the boat companies where i think we have been pretty clear to people under indexed overall to company gross margins the propulsion business is more in line maybe a bit more favorable that to company margins and then the p a business the new p a segment would over index to overall company margins craig kennison robert w baird analyst ok thanks and then dave a question for you i mean there have been just so many changes here including changes in the boat group and i m just trying to maybe wrap my head around it but you have made changes to the aluminum boat growth and then the technology center i m wondering if we can provide an anecdote or two that ll help illustrate what those changes have created from a product standpoint dave foulkes chief executive officer yes craig and thank you for joining us too yes i think the way to think about this is that we are continuing to build strong brands but it s brand focused as opposed to individual businesses so we see a lot of benefits in consolidating some of the kind of back end operations if you like of the closely related businesses to leverage scale and increase the expertise available to all of our brands so the aluminum boat group which is lund lowe crestliner harris a lot of commonality on our operations a lot of need to enhance the digital marketing which is not necessarily possible on individual brand basis but is very possible on a collective basis so and then on the value fiberglass side we formed a venture group to achieve something similar so this is really about making sure we have strong brands but we leverage our scale and bring to bear the highest possible of level of expertise through leverage kind of back end operations if you like and so on the two brands that we have not done that fully on yet are or don t intend to do are sea ray and whaler they have very strong kind of individual operations but we have put together the fiberglass tech center which is serving both of those brands and you will see possibly already seen but certainly will see over the next year the rate at which that tech center can push out new products for both of those brands and others is extremely high and we have 160 engineers and technicians in that group now and that s more horsepower than any other company can bring to bear in that kind of product line so think about it as maintaining strong brands leveraging infrastructure improving capability and but sharing our best practices operator thank you and our next question comes from michael swartz with suntrust your line is open michael swartz suntrust robinson humphrey analyst hey good morning guys dave foulkes chief executive officer good morning bill metzger chief financial officer good morning michael swartz suntrust robinson humphrey analyst david i just wanted to talk about your commentary around the your retail expectations for 2020 i think you have said flat to low single digit growth and just i guess a point of clarification is that global growth or u s growth and now how do you think about the cadence of retail through 2020 bill metzger chief financial officer yes that s a global it s a global view so i think typically the u s over indexes u s will europe will probably under index a bit but it s broadly global in terms of cadence i guess versus last year we were at this point in the year still anticipating a stronger first half to the year than we actually achieved so we were still building wholesale and the retail activity obviously didn t emerge quite as we expected it to so i think this year will be now a much more balanced year we go in with lower pipelines so i think we ll better match wholesale and retail throughout the year this year obviously we ll still be building inventory in the first part of the year to serve the demand of the peak season but i expect just an overall more balanced wholesale and retail across all our quarters michael swartz suntrust robinson humphrey analyst but just go ahead dave foulkes chief executive officer i think michael the only thing i d add to that is that i think we are kind of expecting or anticipating more normal seasonality and 2019 probably didn t have exhibit kind of normal seasonality it was a bit more back end loaded than front end loaded on the retail side wholesale was exactly the opposite more front end loaded than back end loaded so i think as you look at wholesale comparisons 19 to 20 the comps gets to be a little bit more challenging in first half back half obviously much more favorable on the retail side the performance in the back half of the year was a little bit more or the front half of 19 a bit more challenged we d expect maybe the comps to be a little bit more favorable in the first half of the year michael swartz suntrust robinson humphrey analyst ok great that s very helpful and then just maybe i think you have given us the total tariff impact you expect for 2020 and then the incremental versus 19 so i guess how much of that increase was due solely to not getting the your exemptions on the smaller horsepower engines if i go back to 18 and i think the number was some kind of in the high teens millions as far as that impact is that still the way to think about it from just this piece ryan gwillim vice president finance and treasurer no mike this is ryan the way to think of it is 10 million to 15 million incremental for the year and it is all related to the 40 to 60 horsepower exemption not being renewed there s very little difference in volume there s a little bit of difference in how many engines we had on the way over here and inventory position so it s within a margin of error but 10 to 15 this is the best way to think of it michael swartz suntrust robinson humphrey analyst ok great great and then david i think in your closing comments you had mentioned on the boat group you think you can get the margins back to double digits by 2021 i guess that caught me a little off guard so maybe and i m sure we ll get more color in miami but maybe give just us a sense of some of the larger levers you can pull getting there because i and i think the guidance for this year implies 8 5 so 8 5 plus so that seems like a pretty big jump dave foulkes chief executive officer yes so i think we have articulated the kind of things that we are doing in the boat group around a couple of areas one is as i referenced with craig earlier we have significantly leaned out the boat group organization including the management structure so sg a levels will be also significantly lower especially as we get into this year and beyond and we see a full year effect of the actions that we took in the back half of 2019 and then we have a lot going on operational excellence supply chain management that we will reap significant benefits from in this year and next year as well and that is those are progressive benefits that will build over time if you like we also have some additional capacity in place that allows us to build more of that higher content larger boat product that is helpful to margins for us of course in the just in the last three months boston whaler which was leaning out its pipelines ahead of product introductions has already introduced three brand new models and that is just the start for whaler and there s more to come from our other brands as well so i think a lot of efficiency in operating model sg a in our plans and our supply chain and then some very nice new product coming through as well operator thank you and our next question comes from steve zaccone with jp morgan your line is open steve zaccone j p morgan analyst good morning guys thanks for taking my question dave first question was just on the marine industry following up on the first question today where do we stand on the health of channel inventories when you segment value versus premium or maybe saltwater markets versus freshwater markets and so are all markets pretty stable or are there some areas where maybe inventory is still a little bit high dave foulkes chief executive officer i think that i think we have done a pretty good job of bringing inventory down in all segments and i think i mentioned on the last call that what we have been trying to achieve is not just an aggregate number it is by segment number as far as we possibly can making sure that our inventories are in line with these anticipated needs for 2020 i would say that the sell through of premium products at the back half of 2019 in retail was probably a little higher than we anticipated and in some earnings calls earlier you also probably heard a little bit more about that but so i would say that we are below average on premium product particularly whaler but really we are not in bad shape anywhere now steve zaccone j p morgan analyst great and then just the second question was just talking through the top line expectations for the boat segment through the year any help around thinking about performance by specific category and then one clarification with in that segment how much revenue should we be expecting from the business acceleration division just trying to figure out what the organic growth rate is for the boat segment versus the guided 6 to the 8 dave foulkes chief executive officer ok so bill do you want to answer the last one bill metzger chief financial officer right i think it s going to be pretty similar to what it was this year which is a couple of points yes ryan gwillim vice president finance and treasurer yes that s exactly right bill metzger chief financial officer a couple of points for full year of freedom ryan gwillim vice president finance and treasurer for freedom dave foulkes chief executive officer revenue acceleration for the boat group by segment i think whaler will be particularly strong for us but our other premium brands we are anticipating good years for that as well so we are expecting everybody to contribute here we the realignment of wholesale and retail given our the wholesale was so far behind retail in the back of 2019 allows a lot of options for a lot of possibilities across our brands but i would say the premium brands again will be really strong operator thank you and our next question comes from tim conder with wells fargo your line is open tim conder wells fargo securities analyst thank you and gentlemen congrats on racking a strong year just a couple here if i may the freedom boat club how you commented that the adoption of brunswick products is maybe trending a little bit ahead of your expectations and i think you said also 210 locations or franchises by the end of the 2020 from the current 200 so what do you have built into that 6 to 8 growth that due to the conversion or a picking up of brunswick products by in those locations dave foulkes chief executive officer so yes tim good morning to you so we just achieved 210 locations we are expecting probably another 30 this year so we ll be up in the 230 240 range by the end of the year yes the conversion rates we have been very very pleased engaging with our franchisees on the very compelling product and service offerings that we can provide and the uptake of both our boat products and our engine products has been really very strong so that s really good as we mentioned earlier the fleet size of freedom is roughly in the 2 500 range it turns over every kind of two to three years so you can expect roughly 800 new boats into the franchise every year and we are expecting to become a significant portion of that the rate that we ll accelerate will be accelerating more strongly in probably 20 back half of this year and 2021 but we ll make good progress already in 2020 and i m not going to give you an exact number here but we ll make strong progress in penetrating that 800 this year both on the boat side and more on the engine side tim conder wells fargo securities analyst ok ok no helpful david and then gentlemen how would you frame i mean you narrowed your the range to your guidance kept your midpoint the same despite these incremental tariffs being folded in there but how would you frame at this point the upside downside scenarios let s just say if the marine industry globally is down 5 or plus 5 versus you are kind of saying globally flat to maybe slightly up what if we hit that down 5 plus 5 or is that 5 10 5 40 still achievable or would that fall outside of that range under the down 5 plus 5 scenario dave foulkes chief executive officer yes so yes so we as we set our guidance we go through a list of risks in ops for the year and we make an assessment and i think what we have in place here is a very balanced assessment that includes considerations of potential downside and potential upsides to the market in various other factors so i would say that we our guidance is robust and we have considered various other scenarios obviously not extreme scenarios but certainly plausible scenarios on the up and downside bill metzger chief financial officer i think it kind of depends tim of what other things accompany a market adjustment and how much of our portfolio is adjusted i think we consider some of the opportunities on the premium boat side high horsepower engines and things like that not to be potentially as variable as the overall market might be if the 5 market difference in kind of the value end similar to what we now experienced this year our ability to manage the cost structure and things like that i think is pretty reasonable and you could stay within that 5 10 area in that sort of scenario but with things like currency and tariffs and other parts of the market start to get influence and gets to be a little bit more difficult but i think in general when we have set a bottom end of the guidance range we generally have tried to understand what sort of things do we need to compensate for and so we feel pretty comfortable that we have got a pretty balanced view of that given what we know today ryan gwillim vice president finance and treasurer so one of the remember tim remember also that when we went back to the dollar that took you from the 4 25 midpoint to the 5 25 midpoint about 0 40 of that was capital strategy which is now relatively already completed due to the share repurchases last year so there s a little bit more certainty on that piece because it relies on our actions that have already been taken tim conder wells fargo securities analyst ok ok thanks again gentlemen see you in a few weeks dave foulkes chief executive officer yes bill metzger chief financial officer thanks operator thank you our next question comes from eric wold with b riley your line is open eric wold b riley fbr analyst thank you good morning guys a couple of questions i guess one your follow up on the last one around the guidance for 2020 so obviously you kept the midpoint of the range unchanged with the incremental tariffs being in there i guess what was the main factor that or factors that allows you to kind of absorb that to be the incremental 10 to 15 because obviously now you are giving some better outlook on the sales side is the sales growth a little bit more robust than you would have thought given this what you have done to the pipeline etc or kind of maybe what were the factors that are going to kept that and will keep that unchanged dave foulkes chief executive officer well i think certainly there was the unexpected tariff headwind but if you think about the back half of the year a lot of things are going very positively and providing a tailwind i think when we talked to the kind of analyst investment community about that manufacturing expansions that we were doing on mercury and the extent of them there was some nervousness about that but in fact they went without a hitch and we added that additional capacity with no issues we saw retail tick up in the back half of the year which was positive for us when we started to get that manufacturing capacity in place we also started to see clearly the margin benefits in mercury from being able to serve the some of the higher margin customers so that is a validation of part of our strategy and then our launch of the new boat products has also gone to be flawless in the reception has been absolutely wonderful we saw this unexpected headwind but overall if you think about what i have just described plus a pretty decent start to the year this year so i think we are in pretty good shape to offset that eric wold b riley fbr analyst perfect and then just the follow up on the engine capacity you obviously noted in the capex plan for this year possibly additional expansion kind of what was added in the fourth quarter around the engines is that fully in place and does it need to kind of ramp a little bit in 2020 or what else could you add this year dave foulkes chief executive officer no it s fully executed it was fully executed in the back half of 2019 so we are able to take full advantage as we enter 2020 and as we have entered 2020 certainly there s mercury is always looking at making its operations more efficient and so if we need to add more capacity and we certainly will but i think we are in very good shape as we enter the season to service all of our customers right now and to go after the conquest opportunities that have really been in reach but we couldn t quite get to them because of capacity so i think the whole mercury team is very very excited about having capacity behind it to go after those additional opportunities operator thank you and our next question comes from gerrick johnson with bmo capital your line is open gerrick johnson bmo capital markets analyst hey good morning bill on the new segment reporting reallocation of operating profit two boats from engines can you talk a little bit more specifically about that and what is actually causing that bill metzger chief financial officer yes gerrick thanks for the question we the process that we are following here we have decided to make an adjustment to the measure of segment profitability i d say what we are doing now is very consistent with kind of an ex internal reporting methodology that we have followed for quite a while or had in place for quite a while that we think that it s better reflects market dynamics and comparability to external comps i think it is really important to note that it s not the result of a change in business practice i think if you look at what s implied on the company sales that amount is unchanged we have had a kind of a parallel methodology internally that we have used externally that kind of reflects business practices that date back to over a decade ago we are which maintain consistency with historical practices but as we sit here today we have made a decision to streamline and follow this kind of what i would consider to be more current and relevant kind of economics between the boat and or between the engine and boat segment and the new segment change was an ideal time to do this gerrick johnson bmo capital markets analyst ok i don t think i still understand but we can take that off line later moving on on your realignment actions announced last year in june and july you said you also get about 50 million in annual run rate savings so are you now still expecting this 50 million and is all of that being realized in 2020 and how do we face toward that through the year dave foulkes chief executive officer yes so the structural actions that we took in 2019 we expect the full benefit of in 2020 you ll note i think that we noted operating expenses down as a percent of sales this year versus last year that this is despite the fact that we have a full year of freedom boat club expenses despite the fact that we have put a full variable compensation provision back in and despite inflation so yes the structural cost reductions of 50 million we are firmly holding operator thank you at this time we would like to turn the call back to dave for some concluding remarks dave foulkes chief executive officer well to thank you very very much for joining us today we are very pleased about 2019 not only for the financial results but also because it was a transformational year for us we are delighted with the way that the company is operating we are delighted with the foundation that we put in place both physically through product technology and capacity but also via our capital strategy so i enter 2020 with tremendous expectations for our business we are built to win right now and it s going to be very exciting new year for us i cannot wait to share our 2020 to 2022 three year strategy with you guys in miami i think you will be just as excited as we are so i can t wait to see you in two weeks time operator duration 63 minutes call participants al marchetti senior

you jim good morning everyone thanks for joining us i d like to make just a few additional comments on our fourth quarter and full year 2019 before moving on to our outlook for 2020 we ended the year on a strong note growing adjusted diluted earnings per share by 21 compared to last year s fourth quarter in terms of the full year we delivered another year of excellent results for our shareholders sales grew by 2 1 to a record 17 9 billion adjusted gross margin improved to 45 1 reflecting our pricing efforts and moderation of raw material inflation adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 14 to a record 21 12 per share adjusted ebitda increased 235 million to a record 3 1 billion or 17 1 of sales net operating cash increased 378 million to a record 2 32 billion or 13 of sales return on net assets employed increased to 15 1 on core profit before tax total shareholder return for the year was 49 7 and we returned approximately 1 2 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks an increase of 28 over the prior year we reduced our debt by 660 million and we ended the year with net debt to ebitda below 3x before moving on to my comments on our segments i d like to take a moment to provide an update on the integration of valspar well there s so much to be accomplished particularly outside the u s i want to thank our teams for their tremendous hard work today and bringing our two businesses together and for increasing the value we are and will be able to deliver to our customers and to our shareholders since the beginning of 2017 sherwin williams has generated 6 1 billion in net operating cash or 12 2 of sales we ve used that cash to invest approximately 800 million back into the business reduced debt by nearly 3 billion and returned approximately 2 5 billion to shareholders including 1 1 billion in dividends and 1 4 billion in share buybacks we will no longer be calling out synergies related to the valspar acquisition as it becomes more difficult to distinguish between acquisition synergies and our ongoing continuous improvements initiatives we exit 2019 having a benefit of about 315 million from synergies in the p l including about 75 million that was realized in 2019 we ve identified approximately another 100 million in opportunity largely related to our supply chain optimization efforts in europe and asia as previously communicated we expect to realize a small portion of this benefit in 2020 with the majority being realized in 2021 and 2022 as projects are completed let me now turn to just a few comments on our operating segments all of which contributed to our record performance in 2019 within the americas group full year sales increased 5 7 against the prior year comparison of 5 6 residential repaint remained our strongest customer segment up by double digit percentage year over year this is the sixth year in a row we ve grown residential repaint at a double digit level all other segments grew in the mid single digit range for the year full year segment profit dollars and margin also improved year over year we continue to invest in innovation and service introducing 27 new products our ninth consecutive year of double digit product introductions we opened 94 new paint stores in the americas group this year and closed 32 to be clear we opened 84 net new stores and added 150 new sales territories in the u s and canada of the 32 stores we closed 26 were in latin america and were related to changing market dynamics in the consumer segment we generated growth with our largest retail partners in north america though full year segment sales decreased due to lower than expected sales in asia and australia and the impact of the guardsman divestiture adjusted segment margin improved to 17 5 driven by synergies operating efficiencies pricing moderating raw material costs and lower acquisition related amortization expense performance coatings group sales for the year were variable by geography and end market and were impacted by unfavorable currency translation rate changes growth in north america and latin america was more than offset by softness in europe and asia mid single digit growth in our packaging and coil lines was offset by softness in other product lines most notably industrial wood adjusted segment margin increased to 14 1 from 12 9 in the prior year pricing synergies and good cost control drove the improvement turning to our 2020 outlook we currently see a similar environment to last year with north america architectural demand remaining solid and industrial demand remaining variable by geography and end market we have many opportunities to grow share in all of our businesses and i remain highly confident in our ability to provide customers with solutions based on innovation value added service and differentiated distribution we enter 2020 well positioned and focused on what we can control for the first quarter of 2020 we anticipate our consolidated net sales will increase by 2 to 5 compared to the first quarter of 2019 we expect the americas group to be at or above the high end of that range we expect consumer brands to be flat or slightly up excluding the impact of the ace business we exited in 2019 and we expect performance coatings to be up by low single digits for the full year 2020 we expect net sales to increase by 2 to 4 with segment performance similar to what i described for the first quarter on an earnings per share basis we believe the most meaningful way to provide guidance is to exclude valspar acquisition costs and onetime items on this basis and given our sales outlook we expect adjusted 2020 full year diluted net income per common share to be in the range of 22 70 to 23 50 per share an increase of approximately 9 4 at the midpoint compared to the 21 12 reported in 2019 on a comparable basis this adjusted 2020 guidance excludes approximately 2 79 per share for acquisition related expense the regulation g reconciliation table in our press release illustrates these moving parts we expect our 2020 effective tax rate to be in the low 20 range one key assumption embedded in our outlook is that the market rate of inflation for our raw materials basket in 2020 will be flat compared to 2019 assuming stable petrochemical feedstocks and no supply disruptions we expect the basket to be lower year over year in the first quarter and to a lesser extent in the second quarter with year over year costs flattening out or slightly increasing in the back half of the year a few additional data points may be helpful for modeling purposes we ll continue to make investments across the enterprise that will enhance our ability to provide differentiated solutions to our customers these investments include new stores and reps capacity and productivity improvements systems and product innovation in both our architectural and industrial businesses we also plan additional incremental investments in our digital platform and the home center channel these investments are embedded in our full year guidance we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 320 million which is about 1 7 of anticipated sales note that this estimate does not include any expenditure related to our previously announced headquarters and r d center project we expect to provide you with an update on this project in the near future depreciation should be 275 million and amortization will be about 310 million historically we have targeted dividends of about 30 of prior year gaap earnings next month at our board of directors meetings we ll recommend a quarterly dividend increase of 18 6 to 1 34 per share up from 1 13 last year we expect to continue making opportunistic share repurchases we ll also continue to evaluate acquisitions that fit our strategy before moving on to your questions let me wrap up today by asking you to save the date of wednesday june 3 on your calendars that will be the day we ll host our annual financial community presentation at the marriott marquis hotel in new york the program will include presentations by several members of our leadership team we ll host our customary q a session followed by a reception and lunch again that date is wednesday june 3 we ll be sending out invitations and related information and a link to our registration site in april with that i d like to thank you for joining us this morning and we ll be happy to take your questions questions and answers operator thank you our first question comes from christopher parkinson with credit suisse please proceed with your question christopher parkinson credit suisse analyst thank you can you just talk a little bit more about your expectations for u s housing and the consequence of architectural volumes outlook just given some more constructive data just in terms of what you re hearing from the americas group heads and their customers do you expect broader volume participation this year or just what are the key puts and takes thanks james r jaye senior vice president investor relations corporate communications thank you sure chris good morning it s jim what we always talk about when we have this question is we look at our sentiment from our 4 500 store managers and our 3 000 sales reps and they continue to be very optimistic about what they re seeing as we end the year and as we head into 2020 as we ve talked about this in the past from a big picture perspective certainly we believe that the continuing household formations in that 1 3 million range annually will support what s going on as we go forward but as you point out chris the more recent data is encouraging we re seeing strengthening in single and multifamily permits starts and completions at the year end and really the three month trailing average for all of those was up double digits we were at the builder show that just happened and i would tell you optimism at that builder show among our customers was very positive and you have other things out there that are supportive as well the mortgage rate remains very reasonable and some of the recent reports by some of the national homebuilders are also talking about strong orders so i think we feel very good about where housing is headed from a macro perspective allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer chris this is al i d just like to add on to that comment by saying as you look at how our north america paint stores group unfolded throughout the year our second half was stronger than our first half and even as you look at what tag performed we re at 4 8 you look at our same store sales up 4 6 to put that in perspective architectural gallons were high single digits in the quarter because as you as a reminder we did not go out with price in our fourth quarter and historically as we ve seen momentum in our second half and in our fourth quarter that translates to growth in our first half so that s what makes us feel pretty good about the paint stores in architectural in north america christopher parkinson credit suisse analyst great and just a quick follow up you previously discussed potentially getting your margins in consumer performance back up to toward let s say 20 was targeted but can you just simply update us on your conviction and your ability to do this and just also highlight to the investment community any key non raw material levers you can continue to pull to potentially make this happen in each segment allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes chris we re not coming off our numbers i am confident in our ability to hit those financial targets we laid out for 2020 as i talked about on the june investor day i confirm that we ll hit those targets but on a lag and i think throughout 2019 we made significant progress and are on the right path to attaining those goals and we ve even attained some of those goals already if you look at our core gross margin at 45 1 for the year it s at the low end of the targeted range that i had laid out at 45 to 48 and you look at our strong net operating cash and if i looked at net operating cash at 13 less capex you get a little over 11 net operating cash less capex which is the target that we have laid out so i am very confident in our ability on performance coatings and consumer brands to expand their margins to that mid to high teens low 20s and they made good progress this year christopher parkinson credit suisse analyst thank you operator thank you our next question comes from stephen byrne with bank of america merrill lynch please proceed with your question stephen byrne bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey hi you just mentioned that the same store sales metric in the fourth quarter was mostly volume in tag just because you lapped the year ago price and jim you mentioned the strongest region was the southeast where in october they were really underwater in that region so can you just comment on where you think backlog is in architectural paint contractors and where do you think this could drive same store sales in 2020 john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer well steve i think we re feeling really good about the market and the feedback that we re getting from our customers as you ve just mentioned there is a backlog part of it i think has to do with labor we continue to believe that backlog if you will in labor supports our model and helps build loyalty to what it is that we re trying to do for our customers which is driving the technology and services that help them to be more successful and we ve got a lot of new products that we re launching going into this year a lot of services that we re introducing all directly pointed at trying to help those customers to attack those so to your question we think geographically it s pretty solid there s no pockets that i ve been in yet or nor that we ve heard from our teams where people are feeling softness there s a general consensus that contractors are feeling very good could do more if they had more labor and we want to be there to help support them accomplish their goals stephen byrne bank of america merrill lynch analyst and john did you anticipate that changing some of the acquired brands to the sherwin brand would impact the outlook for sales for those products john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes i d like al to talk to it from a financial perspective but absolutely in fact i would say we re feeling really good about the fact that we ve gotten here as fast as we have as we entered into the integration we re always listening to our customers and always listening to our employees and the fact that our customers the retention of both our customers and our employees is so high in allowing us to move aggressively in this brand consolidation gives us really a great sense of pride of the speed and execution that we re moving in allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes and steve i would just add this is not indicative of the underlying businesses if you look at healthy businesses operating margins are expanding and we saw that in consumer brands and in our performance coatings groups this year and as john talked about in his opening remarks i mean we generated strong cash flow over the period end of 17 through 19 and we ll continue to do that we saw strong cash flow in 2019 so as a reminder we looked at this valspar acquisition over the long term it s hard when you re going into an acquisition to predict timing of when certain events happen but as john said improving our operating efficiencies by consolidating brands that s only going to help us going forward stephen byrne bank of america merrill lynch analyst thank you allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer thanks steve operator thank you our next question comes from jeff zekauskas with jpmorgan please proceed with your question jeff zekauskas jpmorgan analyst thanks very much can you talk about business conditions in china and in europe and maybe your offshore operations generally in 2019 how much did they grow in revenue terms or how much did they shrink and whether business conditions in china in the first quarter of 2020 are very different than what they were in the fourth quarter of 2019 john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer right well i think specifically to china i d say that the environment that we find ourselves in some of our business has been a challenge if you look at our industrial wood for example with the tariffs and generally a weaker economy it s had an impact on our business we ve had pockets of strength in southeast asia particularly in the cabinets area wood so i d say from a wood perspective it s been the most challenging that said if you look at our packaging business as an example we had a terrific run there in asia actually across the globe in packaging our coil business in asia was positive we had some pressure in our general industrial business there our automotive business is pretty small jeff in asia but it was positive so i d say a mixed bag there clearly some pressure but our market share there is such that it gives us terrific opportunity for growth and that s where we re headed jeff zekauskas jpmorgan analyst okay and then just a small question you talked about most of the growth in the stores business in the fourth quarter coming from volume but in previous quarters it seemed that price was a larger element did you simply annualize your price increases or was there some competitive activity that led to a lower price benefit or was there a mix effect why was price a smaller component in the fourth quarter john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes there was virtually no price in the quarter and it was because last year 2018 the price increase went in the 1st of october jeff in this year we rolled it in january 1 so the fourth quarter was exposed from a pricings perspective and i d just point out as al mentioned so when we look at the architectural gallons in that fourth quarter up the high single digits it was a really good quarter for our team in our tag business jeff zekauskas jpmorgan analyst thanks operator thank you our next question comes from ghansham panjabi with baird please proceed with your question ghansham panjabi baird analyst guys good morning can you help us with the margins on the americas group segment did that play out the way you thought it would during the fourth quarter during the third quarter you had a nice year over year acceleration in margins i think it was up 120 basis points 4q was closer to 70 basis points and that was also in a very healthy increase in sales what were the offsets there allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes so ghansham the way i look at i start with the flow through when you look at flow through in tag in the fourth quarter and it was over 33 so we saw nice leverage on our gallon increased as john talked about in his opening remarks about investments and additional opportunities and we have taken a long term strategic view of the market and aside from just new stores and new reps that we talked about john talked about expanding our digital platform that i think and we believe will give us a competitive advantage in the marketplace and we re expanding and investing in that tool to get better aligned with our customer to offer better services to make them more efficient ultimately as we ve talked about we want to drive higher top line growth for them and profitability so we started that really coming in third quarter and fourth quarter and you ll see us continue investing at the next year john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes ghansham i think when we were together actually we talked a little bit about some of the investments we were making on that digital and we re really proud to be announcing that we ll be rolling this out nationally at the end of the first quarter we think this is the start of a we have a number of products in the pipeline here but the start of a process that we ve been really investing in and to al s point we re cranking that up and the idea here is increasing that loyalty and the contractors leaning on us to be more efficient in what it is that they re trying to do we talked early about labor and this the launch of this digital platform will help them run a more efficient business it s not just external though we re also investing internally we didn t talk about this last year we ve made it through one year now with our sales reps now having had ipads for one year we think that s improving the productivity of our sales organization to be more responsive to our customers this year we ve just announced to our team we re rolling out ipads into our stores to make them more productive and more efficient and more responsive to the needs of our customers so we are investing we re investing in this business we have great confidence of our position right now and quite frankly we see some competitive opportunities that we want to take advantage of so we re putting our foot on the gas here ghansham panjabi baird analyst okay and then just for my second question on the performance coatings segment even with the industrial markets having been weaker for everybody including you the margins were still up year over year was there any residual price catch up or any significant mix benefit from businesses like packaging that drove the margin expansion apart from just synergy flow through allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes ghansham that s a very astute point as packaging and coil sales have expanded faster than the rest of the businesses we do see some lift in the margin on that yes as we ve talked about in the past our industrial business took the brunt of the run up in raw materials in 17 and 18 we ve been chasing that for the last few years it doesn t come in uniformly like our paint stores group so yes we saw some pricing flow through in our fourth quarter and then the other thing i would say is as we are investing in growth opportunities we are also laser focused on controlling and managing our costs where our businesses and or regions aren t performing to where you expect them to perform or seeing a path to a set target so we re controlling our costs and consolidating operations as well so you can expect that to continue as we go forward as we continue to invest in other areas ghansham panjabi baird analyst thanks so much allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer thank you operator thank you our next question is from john mcnulty with bmo capital markets please proceed with your question john mcnulty bmo capital markets analyst yes thanks for taking my question with regard to in the release you had laid out some acquisition related costs still in 2020 kind of to the tune of what looks to be 300 million to 350 million or so i guess what is that still being spent on and i guess how much of it is how much should we be thinking about as actually a cash hit and then i guess tied to that how are you thinking about cash conversion as we look to 2020 because it obviously took a big step up in 19 but curious how or where we go from here allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes john i m glad you brought that up because it s important that for an apples to apples comparison we wanted to call out acquisition related costs and the amortization depreciation year over year is very similar embedded in that number is about 30 million in additional integration costs and we wanted to include that in our guidance in the reg g table but we re not going to be laying that out going forward that breaks out just so for modeling purposes a little more back half versus front half loaded but this gets us in the next phase like john talked about synergies is part of our continuous improvement process we re going to get back to integration activities it s just part of our normal operating process as far as cash flow john you ve followed us for a very long time 13 that s always the new high watermark and as i talked about in our investor day and earlier net operating cash less capex we re targeting 11 and we expect to continue to hit that target as we go forward john mcnulty bmo capital markets analyst got it and then just a quick follow up with regard to the pipeline that you re seeing from your customers it sounds like the residential side is pretty solid can you speak to the non resi side and what you re seeing there john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes it s very good if you look at the commercial side property management i d say john trying not to get ahead of myself here but we re feeling really good i was just came back from our national sales meeting we had 8 500 of our closest friends together talking about just that and very bullish environment very positive and if you go from the commercial to property management into healthcare i mean there s a general feeling that our customers are really excited about what s ahead for 2020 so we re really looking forward to this year john mcnulty bmo capital markets analyst great thanks very much for the call john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yeah thank you john operator thank you our next question is from the line of arun viswanathan with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst good morning just curious on the paint store side was there any change in the quarter i know that you put up an 8 comp in q3 and that would imply like a 6 volume and you did a 5 3 here so it doesn t appear that way i m just curious if you noticed an improvement in q4 or a deceleration and do you expect kind of similar kind of mid single digit volume growth in 2020 john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes ron i d say the largest impact that we had was our protective marine business that runs through our tag business the architectural business as we mentioned was up high single digits we talked about the fact that we ve had another double digit increase in residential repaint and just talked about some of the other segments and the confidence that we have there if you look at those indicators that we often cite spray equipment nonpaint items everything points in the right direction so high single digit architectural gallons going through impacted by the p m business and the p m business through our stores was largely impacted by oil and gas which was under pressure and we had some timing of some big projects likely not going to be starting out until the beginning of the second quarter so we saw a little bit of softness in p m in the fourth quarter probably going to see a little bit in the first quarter but again the pipeline that we re looking at here is really solid allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes and arun i would just add to that the price increase that we went out with in our north america stores on january 1 was 3 to 4 we expect an effective rate of just below 2 and as john laid out in the opening remarks we expect paints our tag organization to be at the high end of our 2 to 4 so you think 4 to 6 if there s less than 2 in price the rest is volume arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst great that s very helpful and then just as a quick follow up on pcg obviously there s macro pressures and regional variability as you said do you think that is kind of tilted to the downside just given the coronavirus or maybe you can just offer your thoughts on where we are potentially destocking wise or especially in europe and asia is there any potential for stability there as we move through 2020 john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes i think we look at the comparisons of 2019 to 2020 and we have higher expectations moving forward it might be helpful or maybe i could just talk about each of the segments just briefly if we look at our auto and maybe i ll just do it for a number of the regions rather than just the two because i m sure there s some more questions there on auto we d say north america we feel really good probably the best i felt in the time i ve been ceo or coo collision shop business here is very strong i think we re in a really strong position and we re going to take advantage of that going forward europe i d say we had a little bit of softness in our auto business in europe asia as i mentioned earlier it s a small business up mid single digits in latin america we have a leadership position it was impacted primarily by currency we had a good quarter in auto in latin america packaging clearly the non bpa is giving us a terrific opportunity we believe that s an ongoing transition with plenty of opportunity for us ahead and so we re investing in this business we re investing in technology and in capacity and really trying to stay aligned with our customers we ve got great partners that we re trying to support and if you look at this this was a double digit quarter for them north america was strong double digits to your question about europe and asia europe was up but asia was up really really strong double digits and there our business in packaging is growing both in beverage and in food in coil new business wins really across the region north america throughout everyone we did have a little bit of softness in comparison in europe but this is a team that s really hitting on all cylinders and we re working hard so those are the ones that are really performing quite well gi asia we felt some impact there in our general industrial largely in the heavy equipment and ag equipment but we have a good pipeline of projects and good really good people there we expect to really see some improvement in our performance in this business industrial wood i talked about earlier china a lot of pressure feeling good about southeast asia europe was another area of pressure as well so among all the businesses i would say the one we re feeling the most pressure in would be the industrial wood and then protective marine i talked about largely running through our north american business through our tag but if i look at our smaller businesses albeit asia is a very small business it was up strong double digits for us europe down slightly as we had some pressure and some comparisons to some business there latin america was up slightly as well so that kind of captures all the regions all the businesses arun hopefully satisfied some other questions with that response arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst great thanks operator thank you our next question is from kevin mccarthy with vertical research partners please proceed with your question kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst yes good morning i was wondering if you could comment a little bit further on capital deployment you ve made some nice progress again on the balance sheet john just wondering if you would foresee any material change in the balance of acquisition activity versus repurchases as you look ahead into 2020 john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer i think the m a activity is something that we re really focused on we think it s an important part of our future although we don t feel as though we have a gun to our head we ve got the challenge for us right now quite frankly internally is prioritization of the opportunities so we re very active and i would say to answer your question you should see us deploying more cash into m a i don t think you re going to see the transformational type of acquisition that valspar was but we re working business by business to understand region by region where it is there are opportunities i want to clearly point out that we are not trying to be everything to everyone everywhere we are absolutely determined to invest where we can return generate a return of share for our shareholders and each of our businesses have developed a really good strategy that they re executing and any of those m a opportunities include the right to win in those markets so we re not going to be there we re not deploying cash in commodity areas and we re not deploying cash for the sake of saying that we can be somewhere we re there to make money kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst understood that s helpful my second question relates to raw materials it sounds like you anticipate some relief to start the year just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color as to the individual categories like pigment and petrochemicals etc and then with regard to resins in particular just wondering if you could comment on your degree of internal integration versus external purchases of resins and how that s evolved in recent years if it has james r jaye senior vice president investor relations corporate communications sure sure kevin glad to answer that as john said in his comments and you re right our outlook for this year is that the overall basket will be flat compared to 2019 and that s assuming stable petrochemical feedstocks no supply disruptions it will be lower year over year in the first quarter it will be a lesser extent in the second quarter and then sort of flatten out maybe increase in the back half if you remember we had our highest rate of inflation in 2019 it was in the first quarter which moderated through the year so our full year outlook that s our best estimate at this time the visibility once you get a couple of quarters out is a little bit murkier when you get to the specific categories kevin we expect the petrochemical basket to be in line with our overall raw material outlook probably a tailwind in the first quarter maybe into the second quarter before flattening and again increasing in the back half we re seeing right now key feedstocks propylene ethylene are down year over year as we enter 2020 and other key materials like epoxy for example more on our industrial side are also down year over year from a tio2 perspective right now what we re seeing is relatively stable moving into 2020 based on the current demand environment that we re in so that s kind of a big picture look at it from a resin internalization standpoint i ll let al take that one allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes kevin i don t think our strategy has changed we ve picked up a nice business with eps as part of the valspar acquisition we ve got to even invest in more assets to internalize resins but it s a balance we look at where we can make the most from a not just not a cost necessarily but from a differentiation standpoint and we have as we ve talked about a number of projects in the pipeline across each of the segments to continue to drive what i d call continuous improvement opportunities you saw some of that benefit in our consumer brands group this year and helping their margin expansion and you should expect that going forward john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes kevin if i could i d just like to add just one other component that was just slightly touched on by al on the proprietary development of technology we re looking at this opportunity to serve our customers particularly the painting contractor who s looking to maximize productivity and we re combining the asset that you re asking about in a way i think that s really unique for sherwin we re trying to position ourselves to provide solutions and technology to help those customers to be more productive i mentioned earlier the number of products that we are introducing and here i d just like to take the opportunity to talk about three of those because i think it highlights what al just talked about from a resin capability standpoint and i ll be very brief on this but this gives us the opportunity to develop products that really help our customers in a unique way we re introducing a product this year called flex temp that provides a contractor the ability to get out earlier colder temperatures and stay out longer in hotter temperatures it actually has a spread of ability to be applied from 35 degrees fahrenheit up to 120 degrees fahrenheit with no change in viscosity terrific uniform application and so it extends the ability of these painting contractors to be out so when we talk about labor and the challenges of getting caught up we re looking at ways to make them more productive we re introducing a new product called emerald rain refresh that again same platform of technology proprietary we ll hold on to this no one else will have it but this is a product that not only optimizes applications so that you have more productivity from painters with less experience this is a product that when it rains or it is hosed down it looks like it was just painted so after every rain the home or commercial building to look as if it was just painted brand new clean so these painters that have applied this in the commercialization process have just been really raving about it and the last one just to be brief again we re introducing a new extension on our emerald line which is our top of the line product this will be the finest paint that we ve produced yet outstanding hiding great applications so again painters with limited experience we re making limited experienced painters better painters best application better touch up all with this idea that if we re developing resins and products for them the loyalty to sherwin increases kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst thank you so much john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer thanks kevin operator thank you our next question comes from bob koort with goldman sachs please proceed with your question anthony walker goldman sachs analyst hi guys this is anthony walker on for bob maybe just two quick ones can you talk about the performance of the international businesses within the consumer segment which you acquired through the valspar transaction in the past you ve talked about potential strategic or rationalization opportunities there assuming the businesses continued to underperform how should we think about the timing and the opportunity there john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes i think let me just walk through the three areas there just briefly first asia i d say the business is certainly going through a transition we ve talked about the fact that this walroom brand was predominantly focused on interior wood so we re shifting that strategy as much of that business internally and region is now shifting to a shop or factory applied application and so the teams are developing a strategy and executing pieces of it to pursue and reposition the brand there again a small piece of the business but we think this is an important one future opportunity here is terrific we re gaining we re making some progress in the quarter we started to see a positive trend in asia so i d say that one is trending the right way europe we made significant progress this past year sales were positive in mid single digits operating profit improved to a low double digit percentage so feeling that we are pointing in the right direction there australia is a bird of another color we ve got some challenges there and quite frankly we re not performing as needed we have plans and teams executing on this this is one that you should expect us to get closer to and see some improvement or making some tough changes anthony walker goldman sachs analyst great and then just one on the price increase that you announced for the paint stores group how should we think about that flowing through the results in the year will we start to see that show up in the first quarter in full and then how should we also think about the magnitude of what i assume are labor freight and distribution expenses as sort of tempting to offset allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes the pricing will roll out on a similar cadence to past price increases you ll see some of that for sure in the first quarter and then as it takes hold over the next six months we ll get full effectiveness as it flows through all of our customers when you look at our cost basket that we ve talked about merit increases are higher than what they ve been in the past healthcare benefits continue to rise and as we ve absorbed those over the past number of years but this price increase is not unprecedented to cover costs other than raw materials and if you go back in the first quarter of 2014 we went out a price increase to cover those costs because as you can imagine it s a compounding if you don t get it in the first year and it compounds over three or four years it gets to be pretty steep so that s kind of why this justification with this price increase john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes we re not getting thank you notes from our customers obviously but many of them are facing similar situations so the fact that we waited until january 1 gave our customers an opportunity to kind of recalibrate as they re bidding going forward in the new year and secondly the fact that they re experiencing the same thing i think has helped in the execution as well operator thank you we ll move on to our next question which comes from the line of mike harrison with seaport global securities please proceed with your question mike harrison seaport global securities analyst hi good afternoon they might be wondering if you could give us an update on the progress at lowe s and maybe just more broadly speaking your expectations for diy in the first half of 19 it seems like with refinancing activity having picked up and the easy weather comps and the store resets and the training that s been going on at lowe s that maybe that business could be stronger yet you guys provided guidance that suggests that consumer is more flattish for the full year john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes so a piece of that just a reminder as we have the ace business that s coming out so that s a piece of the go forward forecast mike but i would describe our opportunity at lowe s quite simply as we think we re moving the ball in the right direction but we re never satisfied and we re investing i mentioned earlier in my remarks about that we re stepping up our investments in the home center channel obviously they would be a big part of that we see that there are opportunities in both the consumer side and the professional side those pros that paint we think it s a terrific opportunity for us to help our customer on the consumer side we have a lot of opportunities to help convert shoppers into customers and we made a big commitment to this relationship and we want to see this thing through and the opportunity here is to help execute and that s on all fronts so i don t think you should ever expect us to say that we re done this is a business that we re looking at just aggressively as we do our own stores business we think there s opportunities and we re committed to helping our customer win allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer mike i would just add to that that we have talked about this in the past that embedded in our consumer brands segment is our retail channel that has been under pressure consistently and as lowe s has performed better they certainly are taking share from that segment and then we re trying to be realistic when we look outside the u s we re trying not to build although optimistic trying not to build a hockey stick to our sales guidance and but rest assured we expect more out of those teams outside the u s mike harrison seaport global securities analyst all right and then i wanted to also ask about the colorsnap consultation brand and how that s contributing to paint store sales growth how much of north america do you have covered with the colorsnap offering at this point i m just trying to get a sense of kind of what stage we re in with that rollout and how much more it could contribute john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes we re pretty early in it there was an opportunity and again this goes back to helping our customers mike you really hit on something here because this has worked out quite well for us not so much just for the consumer but our residential repaint contractors are leaning on us to help accelerate the selling process for them and as we employ this as well as the digital colorsnap which is an ai application that s new and continuing to we continue to enhance the previous platform it allows our customers to accelerate through their process of closing business this is the professional painting contractor to a homeowner so i would suspect that you re going to see that as a component one of many items that we are going to continue to leverage and add service and productivity that helps build loyalty to the painting contractor but it s still got a lot of opportunity across the country a lot mike harrison seaport global securities analyst thank you operator thank you we ll move on to our next question which comes from the line of david begleiter with deutsche bank please proceed with your question david begleiter deutsche bank analyst thank you good morning john can you discuss your plans for store openings and any closings in 2020 and any impact on the cadence of store openings from either your digital strategy or how you re trying to service some of your larger customers going forward john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer well we expect to continue in that range of 80 to 100 stores we i don t know that it s changed in any way from a store cadence we d like to see a smoother rollout of the stores rolling in i ve been trying to fix that since i ran that business 15 years ago but i d say that we feel really good about it i also want to thank our teams because i think we re getting continuing to get better at it the stores that we re opening and we re cranking up faster and the impact is better some of that has to do with the quality of people in the stores as well as the systems that we re adding to those so i d say you should expect us to continue to add in those stores at a similar rate to what we ve had allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes david i d just add when you look at tag and we closed 32 stores in the year 26 of those stores were in latin america we have talked about the pressure we ve been under latin america as you know we take a rigorous and consistent view of our portfolio of businesses brands customer programs and other investments and as we ve not been able to see a line of sight to above average growth either in sales operating margins cash we ve had to take action we re not exiting those markets but pushing those sales through what i would call more of a dealer network which is a little less asset intensive and i think you ll see some of that continue here in our first half david begleiter deutsche bank analyst very good and john just lastly what s your sense on the pool of available painters in both the quantity as well as the quality in 2020 john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer let s say it s under pressure our customers as i mentioned earlier would like to move faster and there are a number of wonderful painters and many people entering in the industry that are learning as they go and as i mentioned as i ran through those products briefly we re taking that into consideration as we re building products and helping our customers to improve their efficiency so i d say they re both under pressure people that typically enter into the trades we re working with those professionals to help train those employees but there s a pressure in finding them david begleiter deutsche bank analyst thank you john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from p j juvekar with citi please proceed with your question p j juvekar citi analyst yes hi good morning or good afternoon plastic single use plastics are coming under pressure so it s bags and bottles i was wondering if as bottles come under pressure would some of the food and beverage stuff move to cans and would that become an opportunity for you on interior or exterior coatings of the cans john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes the answer is yes we would welcome that transition and we want to work to support our customers to do that as i mentioned earlier the progress that we re making in our packaging business in both food and beverage has been fantastic and more of that transitioning into our packaging and customers business is terrific and that s why we talk a lot about this in our stores business but even on the packaging side we re really determined to help our customers through technology to help speed up lines to help minimize not damaged but trying to buy imperfections in the coatings but the idea here is as we help them become more efficient in driving efficiencies into their plant the better supplier we are so we re really focused on making them better p j juvekar citi analyst okay and then my second question is now that your leverage is below your target of 3x what is your willingness to look at m a what size and would 2020 be the year that you come back into the market for m a allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer p j we have consistently are looking for acquisitions of any size i mean i think you re right as you look at our debt to ebitda ratio under three in 2020 i don t expect to pay down debt and as our ebitda grows you ll see us drive that target down toward the two to 2 5 long term target that i have but yes we are actively looking for acquisitions but as john mentioned earlier we re taking a disciplined approach to that and i d say we raised the dividend 18 we ll keep capex below 2 but absent those m a absent any acquisitions we re going to buy back our stock this year john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes but i think to your point though our coo david sewell got his teams really leaning forward in this area looking for those opportunities not only just simply from the opportunity but from the strategic value that can be gained from it p j juvekar citi analyst thank you john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer thank you pj operator thank you our next question comes from vincent andrews with morgan stanley please proceed with your question vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst thank you all i ve got left on my list is al can you just the tax rate stepping up this year is that just sort of your starting point and then you see how the year plays out and what things your team comes up with or do you how should we be thinking about the higher tax rate allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes vincent that i m always looking at the tax rate it s a function of how many options and how our legal entity consolidations flow through to help that tax rate so i started at the low 20 range and then i expect our tax guys to develop plans and continue with the programs that are going to continue to drive that down vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst thanks very much allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from duffy fischer with barclays please proceed with your question duffy fischer barclays analyst yeah good morning just one for me volumetrically how fast did the north american architectural market grow last year do you guys think james r jaye senior vice president investor relations corporate communications we haven t seen official data yet on that duffy if i go back to probably the most recent data we have is 2018 gallon growth was a little over 2 i want to say it s probably similar in 2019 and probably at a similar level in 2020 sort of that low single digit level if i would guess duffy fischer barclays analyst thanks guys james r jaye senior vice president investor relations corporate communications you bet operator thank you the next question comes from justin speer with zelman associates please proceed with your question justin speer zelman associates analyst thank you guys i just wanted to unpack that if you could help maybe further unpack the nature of those sg a investments and how you think they ll unfold from a percentage of revenue standpoint allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes justin we re not going to go down the p l by line on the guidance i think what we ve consistently done is grow our store count grow our rep count and then these additional investments are going to come through pretty evenly throughout the year and we re not going to quantify them because it s like any other review that we do we want to see how the first half unfolds how volumes look and it may give us an opportunity to accelerate in the back half of the year like we did this year so i think it depends but they re in our guidance and we ll continue to manage those accordingly john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer i would say justin we are planning on sharing a number of these with you during our financial community presentation on that june 3 date where we ll give you some idea from in some of these areas the digital i think you ll be really impressed with and to the extent that we re comfortable in sharing obviously we don t want to point specifically for competitive reasons to what we re doing but as much as we can as things roll out we ll share what we ve done but not what we re going to do justin speer zelman associates analyst okay and i guess maybe because i m sure you pilot i know you piloted a number of these different programs but just curious how the there s like a response rate in terms of growth improvement to the model or is it just a stickiness in this widening of the moat bringing the customer closer the relationship is good but does it change the growth algorithm or the amount of gallons that flow through all else equal john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes we re doing this for growth we absolutely believe it improves the stickiness the moat any metaphor we want to use but we are growing our business and we re going to do it profitably and we think that the more solutions that we bring to our customers to help make them more profitable the more likely we re going to continue to be their supplier and so we re really focused on not just one lever one silver bullet but a number of these that will enhance their ability to be successful and as a result we become a better supplier to them justin speer zelman associates analyst and my last question is just on the consumer business just how much mix benefit from that transition in ace will you are you thinking or estimating for your 2020 targets there allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes what we talked about is the ace business that private label business was about 100 million a year considerably below the average of our consumer operating margin we didn t lay that out and we re not going to but you should expect margin improvement because of that justin speer zelman associates analyst thank you gentlemen operator thank you our next question comes from the line of garik shmois with loop capital please proceed with your question we ll move on to our next question which comes from the line of truman patterson with wells fargo please proceed with your question truman patterson wells fargo analyst hi good afternoon guys thanks for taking my questions first just wanted to make sure i m understanding this clearly on your tag in paint stores demand outlook for 2020 the full year guide i think it implies that volumes grow pretty much in line with 2019 maybe at a bit of a slower pace even when i m listening to you all you re very optimistic on the architectural volume side seems like that market is even accelerating which would imply that protective marine in that non res market might even be decelerating versus 2019 just trying to understand how you all are thinking about that and if you can walk me through the parts john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes truman i d say you re right in sensing our confidence in the architectural side having just finished the quarter in the mid single or i m sorry high single digits gives us confidence moving forward on the protective marine side that runs through there we ve got the fourth quarter and likely the first quarter right now that we re seeing is likely a little softer than we would have liked to see but feeling pretty good about it going forward so i think we re trying to be just in line with what our customers are telling us and we feel pretty good about the number that we put out here allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes truman the other comment i would make is as i mentioned earlier if you look at the way the year unfolded for paint stores in north america we had a strong second half versus the first half even a 9 8 7 tag increase in the third quarter which is a large quarter and a very good result in a large quarter like that so i think when we get through our second quarter and see how the year is unfolding we can give you an update then truman patterson wells fargo analyst okay ok and then final question for me just on the raw materials basket can you just discuss what kind of tailwinds you actually saw in the fourth quarter from an overall basket perspective and then just remind us what you ended up seeing in 2019 as a whole james r jaye senior vice president investor relations corporate communications yes truman costs for the broad basket that we buy i would say moderated slightly in the fourth quarter 19 from third quarter of 19 so it kind of played out as we thought fourth quarter 2019 was also lower year over year the year over year decrease in the fourth quarter was driven primarily by lower cost for resins solvents and we don t provide specific dollars on the savings of the raw materials but you can see the positive trend i think reflected in our year over year gross margin improvement truman patterson wells fargo analyst okay thank you james r jaye senior vice president investor relations corporate communications sure operator thank you our next question comes from rosemarie morbelli with g research please proceed with your question rosemarie morbelli g research analyst thank you good afternoon everyone john i was wondering if you could give us a little more on the impairment charges i am assuming that the bulk of it is the woods coatings in china but you also mentioned one impairment taken in the consumer brands category is that ace or a little color on which product lines you are more or less eliminating as there is no growth and those for which you are going to change the brand name john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes rosemary i would not classify it as no growth i would characterize it in gi and in automotive as we ve put in implemented our systems our legacy systems we ve gotten customers to move to a new label and that has helped us optimize or streamline our operations that s the biggest impact another example would be in australia we re under pressure that we talked about earlier about driving operating margin and cash flow improvement and one way to do that is reduce the number of brands you re trying to support and so in that area we also move from remove focus if you will on one brand and driving it more through the wattyl brand and again that s going to help us in the midterm here to reduce our costs and keep investing in labels and merchandising and different things like that so the walroom brand in china has been under pressure john talked about that transition certainly from to factory applied coatings that is an impact and as that transition continues to move and expand we re not expecting or anticipating any other impairments going forward rosemarie morbelli g research analyst okay and then the goal was very optimistic your projections of 2 to 4 on the revenue line is stronger or higher than it was 2019 versus 2018 and yet if i look at your eps projections at the midpoint it is up 9 versus up 14 in 19 over 14 if i have those numbers right so i am wondering what are the offsets allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes rosemarie i d say that we re if you re comparing last year to the go forward as i talked about the price increase that we went out with and being effective under 2 that s below what we really realized through the first three quarters of last year our raw material moderation isn t as strong as what we saw in 2019 and these investments that we talked about even though we re seeing slower in our second half of 19 on performance coatings we continue to invest back in this in our businesses that we think are going to provide growth opportunities in the future not only the new stores and the new reps that we even accelerated in the back half but this digital program that john laid out and then some other our home center channel that so yes we re continuing those investments in 2020 john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer it may not have an immediate feedback or a payback but we re running this company longer term than just one quarter and we absolutely believe these are the right investments to make and so we re moving forward aggressively taking advantage as i said of not only the market but we really think there s some competitive opportunities out here that we want to take advantage of rosemarie morbelli g research analyst okay so nothing really special just going forward and investing where you need to john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer investing where we need to skinnying back where we can but leaning forward we think that we ve described it internally rosemarie as a coil we feel we re cranking this coil down and we expect it to respond given the investments that we have in a very positive way allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer and rosemarie we don t expect the market to be this way but if you go back to 2007 08 and 09 when we added 260 new stores when we came out of that you look at our market share growth not only on the 3 year but the 5 year and the 10 year compounded average growth rates we think we re well above market growth and that s the attitude we re taking we look at it long term and expect as john mentioned that coil to grow market share faster than what we ve done in the past rosemarie morbelli g research analyst thank you operator thank you our next question comes from christopher perrella with bloomberg intelligence please proceed with your question christopher perrella bloomberg intelligence analyst hi guys quick ones on lat am volume has that flattened out for you at this point and you re looking for inflection in 2020 and then just a little color on consumer pricing do you expect to get about half of what you get in the tag group for 2020 allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes chris i would say for latin america our volumes have i would say improved as the year has gone on but where you re seeing it is as we continue to see the devaluation we re continually that team is continually having to go out with price 60 of our raw materials are dollar denominated so every deflation we see in brazil as an example we re constantly chasing with price so the biggest portion of our impact right now is price but some of the things that we re doing on streamlining sales organizations and focus on the right segments and customer segment will help drive growth in the future john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes we re just not waiting for the market we re not waiting for currency we re trying to do we mentioned earlier control the things we can control and our mexico sales were up high single digits clearly offset by argentina and brazil and some of the other regions as al mentioned we re trying to be very aggressive in brazil the store reduction is an example of that but we re looking to drive more profitable sales to the most efficient channels down there allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes and chris the second question on price yes in performance coatings we do still have opportunities for price in certain businesses and regions and as you remember 17 and 18 we saw the big run up in raw materials our industrial businesses were impacted the most although raws have moderated and our expectation is in 2020 they re not back to where they were at the beginning of 2017 so we re continuing to need price we ve expanded our margins but we expect and i feel confident that we ll get to the high teens and low 20s and recovering those raw material costs plus the incremental freight cost plus the merit increases and healthcare that i talked about on tag those are affecting our performance coatings group and we re having to offset those so yes we re going to continue with price christopher perrella bloomberg intelligence analyst thank you john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer thanks chris operator thank you our next question comes from the line of chris bottiglieri with wolfe research please proceed with your question chris bottiglieri wolfe research analyst hey guys thanks for the question first of all i want to kind of follow up on your comment earlier on the auto business looking the best that it s been in your tenure a little surprising to hear i mean are you starting to see like accident frequency inflect or total loss rates come down or is it more so just competitive dynamics where you feel like you re taking share from the channel john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer competitive dynamics we re taking share i think the market there s been some compression we think and we ve talked about that openly with safer cars and safer attributes that are going into these vehicles which are absolutely critical so we re doing it by the technology that we re bringing and the services that we re bringing the combination of valspar and sherwin together we have a new improved system that we think has been very well received by the marketplace and we re really working hard to serve those customers in a way to help their throughput through those facilities chris bottiglieri wolfe research analyst got you that s helpful and then one other question on coronavirus i just want to think there are like potential impacts maybe like a more of an indirect impact recognize you don t have high exposure to like chinese tio2 but are there any impacts to that market that could manifest in the global supply chain if the work stop continues or any other like feedstock or inputs that again if we continue to see more business shutdowns and extended holiday that could maybe have an impact on your business curious how you think about that james r jaye senior vice president investor relations corporate communications yes chris let me start just by saying first when we look at this the health and safety of our employees is 1 obviously and so we re monitoring that very carefully and the recommendations that are out there we ve suspended travel to and from china in the short term and we re limiting some travel inside the country to business critical so we re doing that but i think we re working closely with our teams there our customers our suppliers haven t seen to this point any negative impact and we ll continue to monitor that closely i think it s just too early to see john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer now we ve got some very good leadership on the ground there jason wu and his team are keeping us fully abreast and i d say right now from a procurement standpoint we re staying close so there s a couple of dynamics there s a raw material piece of it and there s also the point that jim just mentioned about trying to make sure we re doing everything we can to protect our employees and work with our customers there s a whole lot of people trying to do everything possible to do that but there s a lot of uncertainty and we ll react as it unfolds chris bottiglieri wolfe research analyst got you really helpful thank you john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer you bet operator ladies and gentlemen this concludes our question and answer session so i d like to turn the floor back over to mr jaye for any additional concluding comments james r jaye senior vice president investor relations corporate communications thank you jesse and thanks everybody for joining us on the call today myself and eric swanson will be available as we always are for your questions today tomorrow and into next week and again appreciate your interest in sherwin and we ll talk to you very soon have a good day bye bye operator duration 102

transcripts
senator bernie sanders of vermont has delivered a similar stump speech for decades championing a vision for the country that serves working and middle class americans and not just the top 1 percent at times dark more than uplifting mr sanders pointedly attacks the country s elite as well as corporations the drug industry the fossil fuel industry and the military industrial complex if you have ever heard mr sanders speak you will recognize his core principles medicare for all raising the minimum wage to 15 fighting for racial justice making public colleges tuition free you can think of his stump speech as a stir fry not every ingredient makes it in each time but the final product is always recognizable above all he urges a political revolution this is not just a campaign for the presidency he says in this version this is a political movement mr sanders was introduced by representative rashida tlaib democrat of michigan who has endorsed him the speech has been excerpted in places for length i don t have to tell anybody here that we are living in a dangerous and unprecedented moment in american history and our campaign is about several fundamental issues no 1 it is absolutely imperative that we defeat the most dangerous president in the modern history of this country and it seems to me that donald trump is getting a little bit nervous because you may have noticed that in the last few days he and his republican lieutenants are focusing their anger against our campaign because they know what we know and that is that we are the strongest campaign to defeat donald trump analysis a centerpiece of bernie sanders s argument is that he would be the strongest candidate against president trump this is a direct appeal to democrats who want above all to elevate a nominee who can beat mr trump in the general election it is also a big applause line they know that we will expose trump for the liar and the fraud that he is analysis part of his strategy is to try to unmask mr trump as a liar in an effort to appeal to the white working class voters who backed president barack obama but supported mr trump in 2016 now i have friends and colleagues who hold different political views than i do and that s fine we re a democracy but i have very little respect for somebody who campaigns in 2016 as a candidate who s going to represent the interests of the working class of this country and then proceeds to sell them out you are not a supporter of working families when as trump attempted you try to throw 32 million americans off the health care they currently have that s not a friend of working families analysis and here we go mr sanders begins to lay out how mr trump failed working class voters despite promising to help them in 2016 you are not a friend of working families when you tell the people that you are going to have a tax plan that benefits the middle class and yet you pass legislation which gives 83 percent of the benefits to the top 1 percent you are not a friend of the working class of this country when you say during your campaign that you re a different type of republican you re not going to cut medicaid medicare and social security and that as president you bring forth a budget which calls for massive cuts to medicaid medicare and social security disability fund that s not being a friend of the working class that is being a liar analysis and again mr sanders calls mr trump a liar hammering the point home and in addition to that we have a president who goes around the country every day demonizing the undocumented we re supposed to hate the undocumented and then as a businessperson hires undocumented workers to work in his resort so he can exploit them trump runs for president telling us that he s against outsourcing he doesn t want to see good jobs in america go abroad and yet as a businessman he ran his companies in countries around the world where they were paying workers extremely low wages we are going to defeat trump because our campaign is going to bring out more people and have the largest voter turnout than any campaign in the history of this country and the only way let s be clear trump will be a very formidable opponent for a number of reasons and the way you defeat trump is talk to working people in this country who are so exasperated so tired of working longer hours for lower wages so tired of working for 10 11 12 bucks an hour and not being able to afford to maintain their family with the dignity that family deserves analysis this is not just mr sanders s argument for beating trump it is his whole strategy for winning elections mobilize a working class coalition with the goal of completely changing the economic and political system the way you beat trump is to reach out to young people and get them involved in the political process in a way that we have never seen before analysis mr sanders did very well with young people in 2016 who were attracted to his outsider status and his calls for political revolution he has long bet that turning out people who do not typically vote like young people will deliver him victory the reason we re going to defeat trump is because we tell the truth and we talk about issues that other campaigns choose not to talk about we talk about the fact that we have today a corrupt political system that allows billionaires to buy elections now i may be old fashioned but i kind of believe in democracy and one person one vote analysis mr sanders who is 78 does not actually consider his views old fashioned at all he knows his supporters don t either but he is toying with detractors who view him as both too old and too radical and that is why together we will overturn the disastrous supreme court decision on citizens united analysis mr sanders wants to get big money completely out of politics his campaign is built on grass roots support and he often jabs at other candidates especially joseph r biden jr who are willing to accept the support of super pacs why together we will end voter suppression in america we will end extreme gerrymandering in america and we will move this country to public funding of elections but it is not only the political system which is corrupt we have an economy which in its essential components is rigged in favor of the wealthy and the powerful analysis this notion is at the core of mr sanders s political ideology the economy is not working for 99 percent of americans mr sanders has long vilified the wealthy and the powerful setting up an us against them message rooted in class struggle and aimed at lifting up the working class now we talk about it a lot of other people don t talk about it but i think not only is it a moral outrage but it is an economic and unsustainable situation when three people in america own more wealth than the bottom half of american society analysis this is a common refrain that highlights another campaign theme wealth inequality it is not acceptable that at a time of low unemployment we still have half of our people living paycheck to paycheck you all know what living paycheck to paycheck is about i grew up in a family that lived paycheck to paycheck analysis despite encouragement from his allies to talk more about himself mr sanders detests getting personal this sentence is about as personal as he gets on the campaign trail in this speech this is as far as he went though he will sometimes offer a little more when you live paycheck to paycheck and you get sick or your kids get sick you are worried to death about how you are going to be able to afford to take them to a doctor when you live paycheck to paycheck and your car breaks down you don t go to your second car or your third car you got to figure out how you can come up with the 500 bucks you need to repair that car because if you don t get that car repaired you don t get to work if you don t get to work you don t have an income if you don t have any income you can t put food on the table for your kids in america today unbelievably we are seeing a decline in life expectancy did you all know that instead of living longer lives we are actually as a people living shorter lives and one of the reasons the doctors believe this is happening is because of what they call diseases of despair when people give up on life when they see no hope they turn to drugs they turn to alcohol and too often increasingly they turn to suicide our job is to give people hope not despair our job is to have a government which is not based on greed and hatred and divisiveness but a government which is based on love and compassion and bringing our people together now the truth is despite what the pundits will tell you and the media may tell you politics is not all that complicated analysis mr sanders often takes swipes like this at the news media which he believes does not cover him fairly he considers the news media a cohort of the elite it is about taking a hard look at where we are as a people today trying to understand how we got to where we are and most importantly having a vision of where we want to go where do we want to go and in that regard i think of a phrase a quote from the great one of the great leaders of our lifetime nelson mandela who as you know spent his life fighting apartheid in south africa existed in hard labor in jail for decades and left jail to become president of south africa and what mandela said he said everything seems impossible until it happens everything seems impossible until it happens analysis this quote from nelson mandela is almost always included in mr sanders s stump speech and it serves as a way into the next part which asks how can we make things better that s a pretty profound phrase and what he means by that is that we are told every single day it can t happen you can t do this you ve got to settle for crumbs you ve got to settle a half baked compromises you can t think big it just can t happen but then after people struggle to make it happen i want you to think back on the major changes in our country some of them are fantastic changes the lesson there is that nothing ever really changes until millions of people stand up and fight for justice and that is why the message of our campaign is us not me analysis the slogan is actually not me us but mr sanders often reverses it in any case it embodies the idea that he wants to create a political movement and that s not just a sexy bumper sticker although it is a very good bumper sticker it is actually a very profound statement in a few words because what that statement understands is that real change never takes place from the top on down it s always from the bottom on up analysis also known as a revolution and what i will tell you and i don t believe any other candidate will tell you is that no president not bernie sanders or anybody else can do it alone we cannot take on wall street alone or the drug companies or insurance companies or the fossil fuel industry or the military industrial complex or the prison industrial complex analysis mr sanders is good at using simple slogans to articulate his proposals like medicare for all he also has easy to understand bogeymen seen here the only way that change takes place when people by the millions stand up and say you know what this is not acceptable we re going to fight for justice in america so this is not just a campaign for the presidency this is a political movement which tells the corporate elite and the 1 percent that in this country today they will no longer be able to have it all that this country belongs to all of us not just the few analysis this is it the big idea this country belongs to all of us not just the few it also captures his brand of politics people are struggling because the rich and powerful and keeping them down but he says you don t have to live like this anymore so what does that mean what does it mean in practical terms analysis mr sanders now begins to tick off his best known policy proposals many of which are designed in particular with working people in mind he starts with raising the minimum wage to 15 an hour not hard we all know what it means it means that in america if you work 40 hours a week you should not be living in poverty not a radical statement and yet i have talked to in the last few months people right here in iowa trying to get by on 9 10 bucks an hour nobody gets by on 9 or 10 bucks an hour we re going to raise that minimum wage nationally to 15 an hour women in america should not be making 80 cents on the dollar compared to men they deserve the whole damn dollar analysis a big applause line mr sanders also likes to use the word damn to emphasize a point he feels particularly strongly about you will see we re going to make it easier for workers to join unions we have introduced legislation which says that if 50 percent of the workers plus one in a bargaining unit sign a union card they have a union end of discussion and that same legislation repeals section 14b of the taft hartley act which will eliminate all so called right to work laws in this country and when we talk about defending the working families of this country it s not only about creating jobs but creating jobs that pay people good wages and that is why we re going to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure our roads our bridges our water systems our wastewater plants our schools we need millions of units of affordable housing in america let s put our people to work building that housing and when we talk about the needs of working families we have got to talk about education because everybody knows that in this day and age young people need a good education in order to make it into the middle class it is not a radical idea to say that today when we talk about free public education we re talking about making public colleges and universities tuition free eleven years ago against my vote congress voted to bail out the crooks on wall street who nearly destroyed our economy gave them trillions of dollars of zero interest loans two years ago trump and his friends gave the 1 percent and large corporations a trillion dollars in tax breaks well if you give tax breaks to billionaires you know what else you can do you can cancel all student debt in america and we do that through a modest tax on wall street speculation analysis mr sanders often points out that his ideas were once considered radical pointing out where money in government has gone today is one way he tries to combat criticism that his proposals which even he acknowledges would cost a lot of money are unfeasible and when you talk about standing up to the working families of america you got to talk about probably the issue that is most in their minds and in their hearts and that is a health care crisis analysis anyone who knows anything about mr sanders knows that his signature issue is medicare for all in his speeches he often spends a significant amount of time on this topic outlining his vision for a new single payer health care program today in america we remain the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a human right together we are going to end that embarrassment today in america i want you all to hear this because we don t discuss it enough today in america we are spending twice as much per person on health care as do the people of any other country twice as much and yet despite spending 11 000 for every man woman and child in america we end up with a system in which 87 million americans are uninsured or underinsured where 30 000 people die each year because they don t get to a doctor when they should because they re uninsured and amazingly enough we have a system in which 500 000 people go bankrupt because of medically related debt analysis these are all figures mr sanders cites consistently but there have been some questions about their accuracy i can understand and you can understand that if you go to some casino and you gamble away your money and you go bankrupt that s your responsibility if you want to get involved in some risky business scheme and it doesn t work out and you lose your money that s your choice you buy a house that you can t afford your choice but people in america should not go bankrupt because they have cancer or heart disease that is a moral outrage analysis mr sanders has long believed that the health care system is not just dysfunctional but immoral and designed to pad the pockets of drug and insurance companies it also really does make him angry his voice often takes on an even more urgent tone when he speaks about health care it is no secret everybody knows it everybody knows what the function of health care today is the function of our system the system is not designed to provide quality care for all it is designed to make huge profits for the drug companies and the insurance companies together we are going to end that type of system we pay by far the highest prices in the world for the medicine that we need the result one out of five americans cannot afford the medicine their doctors prescribe how insane is that you walk into a doctor s office because you re sick the doctor writes out a script you can t afford to fill it we have people who have serious accidents the ambulance comes and they say don t take me to the emergency room because i cannot afford to pay the bill it is disgusting it is outrageous so let me be very clear in my view the function of a rational and humane health care system is to provide health care to all us in a cost effective way not to make the drug companies and the insurance companies 100 billion in profit now the idea of universal health care guarantee of health care to all is not a new idea analysis one of mr sanders s most consistent arguments is that the ideas he is proposing are not new an effort to show that his ideas are not radical as his detractors argue certainly not something that i thought of it s been an idea that has been talked about in this country for over 100 years teddy roosevelt a good republican in the early 1900s talked about universal health care franklin delano roosevelt president in the 30s and 40s talked about health care for all analysis one of mr sanders s political heroes is f d r whom he often invokes in an attempt to demystify his ideology of democratic socialism harry truman talked about health care for all j f k talked about health care for all lyndon johnson talked about health care for all barack obama talked about health care for all after 100 plus years of talking now is the time for action now is the time finally to pass a medicare for all single payer program and i want to tell you in a few moments very briefly what medicare for all means because the health care industry will be spending hundreds of millions of dollars to misinform you so as somebody who wrote the damn bill let me tell you what s in the bill analysis i wrote the damn bill has become something of a catchphrase for mr sanders since he declared it during the second democratic debate in july this is in part to differentiate himself from rivals namely senator elizabeth warren who also back a single payer health care system medicare today is a very strong program and it s the most popular health insurance program in the country but it is far from perfect so the first thing that we do is look at medicare and say how can we expand it how can we improve it so what we do on the medicare for all is we increase benefits to include dental care a lot of people in america cannot find affordable dental care we include hearing aids we include eyeglasses and we also include home health care so that people are not driven from their home and forced to go to a nursing home so we expand the benefits on the medicare analysis mr sanders often gestures to his mouth ears and eyes when he gets to this part of his stump speech what else do we do well so it s a four year transition period first year after expanding these benefits we lower the eligibility age from 65 where it is now down to 55 from 55 the next year down to 45 third year 45 down to 35 fourth year everybody is in a medicare for all program you see the doctor you want go to the hospital that you want now what does that mean in concrete terms this is what it means it means we eliminate all premiums for you and for your employer now you can call it a premium whatever you want give it any term you want i would call it a tax to the insurance companies that s my definition of a premium that s gone for you and your employer what s gone is the co payment that you now pay when you walk into a doctor s office then when you take a step back and you kind of look at the absurdity and dysfunctionality of the current health care system you bump up against a concept which is basically insane called a deductible now we all take deductibles for granted i ve got a deductible you got a deductible but it is an insane concept because what it says is before your insurance policy kicks in you ve got to pay a certain amount of money out of your own pocket some deductibles are 2 000 some are 5 000 some are 7 000 some are 10 000 some are more than 10 000 dollars so what happens if you are a working class person and you don t have a lot of money in your pocket and you get sick you still can t afford to go to the doctor because you ve got this outrageous deductible we on the medicare for all eliminate all deductibles we eliminate all out of pocket expenses and because we are going to take on the greed and corruption of the pharmaceutical industry and very substantially lower prescription drug prices in america nobody in america will have to pay more than 200 a year for his or her prescription drugs so two questions that we have to ask having said that people are sitting there thinking well that sounds pretty good very generous benefits comprehensive health care and by the way on your minds some of you are thinking because i get this at every meeting what about the mental health crisis of course medicare for all covers all mental health treatment so the next fair question is how do we pay for health care today how do we pay for it under medicare for all i m not going to be dishonest with you i can t tell you that health care which is pretty expensive is free no one s going to have to pay anything for it you wouldn t believe me if i told you that it s not true right now we pay it out of premiums some of you are paying correct me if i m wrong 500 1 000 a month for premiums yes analysis here mr sanders solicits numbers from the audience this has become a hallmark of his rallies and town halls asking other people how much they pay for health care by doing so he wants to show everyone that they are not alone that their problems are everyone s problems that s how you re paying for it now and then you re paying for it because you ve got to pay a lot of out of pocket expenses because you ve got to take out the deductible you ve got to pay for the prescription drug costs you re paying for health care a lot now here s the bottom line the family in the middle of the american economy kind of the average family makes about 60 000 a year that family pays 12 000 a year for their health care 12 000 on an income of 60 000 20 percent of their income goes to health care you know what that is pretty crazy that is a lot of money some pay more some pay less but paying 20 percent of your income for health care is regressive and it is wrong well that s how we re paying for it today analysis mr sanders is not afraid to show his math and he does not shy away from numbers to prove his point our proposal raises money in a variety of ways but most relevant to working people is the following what we have is we get rid of all the premiums and the co payments and the deductibles the out of pocket expenses that s gone but what we do do is have a 4 percent tax on income exempting the first 29 000 that means if you are that median family a family right in the middle of our economy making 60 000 you ll pay 4 percent of 31 000 which is a little bit more than 1 200 a year for comprehensive health care pretty good deal this is what the issue comes down to do we as a people finally have the courage to take on the insurance companies and the drug companies and tell them that health care is a human right not something to be making billions of dollars over that is really what the whole issue is about and my promise to you is that as president of the united states in my first week in office we will introduce we will fight and we will succeed in creating a medicare for all single payer system audience bernie bernie bernie analysis vowing to introduce medicare for all right away is what he says differentiates him most from ms warren on health care she wants to pass an expansion of public health insurance in her first 100 days as president but would wait as long as three years to push through a single payer system and i want you to know again getting back to the mandela quote which says that everything is impossible until it happens what i m talking about here is not radical please understand it i live in burlington vt 50 miles away from the canadian border when you get sick you end up in a hospital in canada anybody here know what your bill is when you leave the hospital zero you go to any doctor you want you go to any hospital that you want you don t have to take out your wallet you don t have to take out your credit card it is paid for out of a public tax system it cost 50 percent per person compared to what we spent so this is not a radical idea the time is long overdue analysis this is another common refrain in mr sanders s stump speeches to convince the audience that his health care proposal is not radical and when we pass medicare for all what does it mean you ve got millions of people in america including some in this room who are now working at jobs they don t like but they are on those jobs because they have decent health care coverage for their family i think that s absurd when you have a health care system that guarantees health care to all people you can go out and get the job or start your own business if that is what you want to do you will have health care as an american right analysis mr sanders builds to this point in most of his speeches health care is a human right it is central to his ideology and central to who he is as a politician there s another issue that i just want to say a few words about and i wish i didn t have to talk about it and i wish i didn t have to get you nervous you re nervous enough but let me just tell you this anyone who tells you that climate change is not real or is a hoax is not only lying to you but even worse they are doing a massive disservice to their own children and their own grandchildren you know i am not a scientist but unlike the guy who s in the white house right now i actually believe in science and will listen to the scientists here is the truth what the scientists are telling us now is that they have underestimated the degree speed and severity in which climate change is ravaging not only our own country but the world that s what they re telling us analysis if health care is the primary issue for mr sanders s climate change is not far behind just as he does with medicare for all mr sanders often spends a significant amount of time on the stump discussing climate change and they are saying that we have a very short period of time less than 10 years not a long period of time to boldly transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy and we have got to do it not only here in the united states guess what we re going to have to do it all over the world now what the scientists are telling us now polar caps are melting far faster than they thought ocean is warming faster than they thought there ll be rising sea levels which if we don t get our act together will mean by the end of the century that cities in america like miami new orleans charleston south carolina new york city and many others will be partially or completely underwater it means that countries like china like vietnam like other low level countries will see massive flooding in their nations what it means is that in states like iowa such an important bastion of agriculture for america your farmers are going to have shorter growing seasons because of drought and extreme weather disturbances that means less production of food and the quality of that food being produced deteriorates it means we re going to see more extreme weather disturbances a couple of months ago you saw venice italy underwater houston texas underwater now we re seeing unbelievably the apocalypse which is taking place in australia where you have that great and beautiful country literally on fire and we saw something at a lower level devastating california more drought more fires analysis mr sanders released his green new deal plan to fight global warming last year against the backdrop of paradise calif which had been devastated by fire since then he has frequently alluded to this trip during his speeches what we are seeing is the spread of disease because bacteria do well when the weather warms so you ll see disease like malaria spreading beyond where it is right now and what you will see according to the united nations is with more drought more floods more extreme weather disturbances we will see well over 100 million climate refugees people forced to leave their homeland because they can t find water or land to grow their crops and when you ve got 100 million or more people on the move you re going to have real international crises this is what we are looking towards and yet we have a president and we have a major political party that not only is not beginning to address this existential crisis they are making it worse by trying to bring forth more fossil fuel production so on this issue what we have got to do is not only transform the energy system of our own country but we got to lead the world in that direction and my dream i don t know if it can happen or not is that we are going to reach out to countries all over the world china and russia and india and pakistan brazil countries all over the world and say to them say to the people of those countries that we are all in this together no one is going to escape china is going to be particularly hard hit by this india going to be particularly hard hit by this that instead maybe instead of spending 1 8 trillion a year every year on weapons of destruction designed to kill each other maybe we pool our resources and fight our common enemy which is climate change analysis mr sanders often speaks of international diplomacy though usually in the context of foreign policy here he shares his diplomacy centered vision for combating climate change so the bottom line here is that our message to the fossil fuel industry in this country and around the world is that their short term profits are not more important than the future of this planet i want to very briefly touch on some other issues that i know are on your mind and you ll forgive me if we can t talk about all the issues we ll be here all night to do that but this is what i want to say as americans we should be profoundly embarrassed that in the richest country in the history of the world we have more people in jail today than any country on earth we have a criminal justice system which is not only broken it is a racist system that s just the way it is analysis mr sanders now proceeds to run through issues like criminal justice immigration and gun reform sometimes he will focus on one or more of these issues during his speeches just as he spent more time on health care and climate change in this one so what we are going to do is invest in our young people in jobs and education so the kids do not fall through the cracks jobs and education not more jails and incarceration and that means also ending private prisons and detention centers it means ending the so called war on drugs and legalizing marijuana in every state in this country it means expunging the record of those arrested for possession of marijuana analysis another sanders catchphrase and when we talk about systems that are broken and racist it s not just criminal justice it is the immigration system in this country so our view my view is that instead of demonizing the undocumented we are going to move to comprehensive immigration reform and a path toward citizenship for the undocumented it means that on my first day as president we will undo all of the racist immigration executive orders promulgated by trump and that means re establishing the legal status of the 1 8 million young people and their parents eligible for the daca program it means ending the current policies at the southern border so that under our administration no federal agent will ever be grabbing babies from the arms of their mothers all of us are profoundly disgusted when we turn on the tv and we see another mass shooting and we ask ourselves when does it end and it s not only the deaths that we see as horrible as that is it is the fear that our children have i was in new hampshire a number of months ago a woman raised her hand and said bernie what am i supposed to tell my 11 year old daughter who wants me to buy her a bulletproof backpack for christmas that s how scared children are our gun safety policy will be determined by the american people not by the n r a that means universal and expanded background checks it means ending the so called gun show loophole it means ending the straw man provision and by the way it also means that the american people have now come together in rural states like iowa and vermont urban areas new york chicago los angeles with the understanding that we must end the sale and distribution of assault weapons in this country so together together we are going to do everything humanly possible to end the gun violence which is such an epidemic in america today as a united states senator i am often on the floor of the senate when i m down on the floor i hear a lot of my republican and conservative colleagues giving their speeches and often they say you know we are conservatives and we believe in small government we believe in getting the government off the backs of the american people etc etc well i say to those senators if you believe in getting the government off the backs of the american people understand that it is women who have a right to control their own bodies not politicians analysis this is another big applause line we know that as powerful as the 1 percent and the corporate elite are and they are enormously powerful that when the bottom 99 percent stands up and does not allow themselves to be divided up by trump and his friends based on the color of our skin or where we were born or our religion or our sexual orientation when we stand together around an agenda that works for all of us no matter what the power of the 1 percent is when millions stand up and fight back there is nothing that will stop us that s what this campaign is about that s what our administration will be about thank you

adjusted diluted earnings per share by 21 compared to last year s fourth quarter in terms of the full year we delivered another year of excellent results for our shareholders sales grew by 2 1 to a record 17 9 billion adjusted gross margin improved to 45 1 reflecting our pricing efforts and moderation of raw material inflation adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 14 to a record 21 12 per share adjusted ebitda increased 235 million to a record 3 1 billion or 17 1 of sales net operating cash increased 378 million to a record 2 32 billion or 13 of sales return on net assets employed increased to 15 1 on core profit before tax total shareholder return for the year was 49 7 and we returned approximately 1 2 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks an increase of 28 over the prior year we reduced our debt by 660 million and we ended the year with net debt to ebitda below 3x before moving on to my comments on our segments i d like to take a moment to provide an update on the integration of valspar well there s so much to be accomplished particularly outside the u s i want to thank our teams for their tremendous hard work today and bringing our two businesses together and for increasing the value we are and will be able to deliver to our customers and to our shareholders since the beginning of 2017 sherwin williams has generated 6 1 billion in net operating cash or 12 2 of sales we ve used that cash to invest approximately 800 million back into the business reduced debt by nearly 3 billion and returned approximately 2 5 billion to shareholders including 1 1 billion in dividends and 1 4 billion in share buybacks we will no longer be calling out synergies related to the valspar acquisition as it becomes more difficult to distinguish between acquisition synergies and our ongoing continuous improvements initiatives we exit 2019 having a benefit of about 315 million from synergies in the p l including about 75 million that was realized in 2019 we ve identified approximately another 100 million in opportunity largely related to our supply chain optimization efforts in europe and asia as previously communicated we expect to realize a small portion of this benefit in 2020 with the majority being realized in 2021 and 2022 as projects are completed let me now turn to just a few comments on our operating segments all of which contributed to our record performance in 2019 within the americas group full year sales increased 5 7 against the prior year comparison of 5 6 residential repaint remained our strongest customer segment up by double digit percentage year over year this is the sixth year in a row we ve grown residential repaint at a double digit level all other segments grew in the mid single digit range for the year full year segment profit dollars and margin also improved year over year we continue to invest in innovation and service introducing 27 new products our ninth consecutive year of double digit product introductions we opened 94 new paint stores in the americas group this year and closed 32 to be clear we opened 84 net new stores and added 150 new sales territories in the u s and canada of the 32 stores we closed 26 were in latin america and were related to changing market dynamics in the consumer segment we generated growth with our largest retail partners in north america though full year segment sales decreased due to lower than expected sales in asia and australia and the impact of the guardsman divestiture adjusted segment margin improved to 17 5 driven by synergies operating efficiencies pricing moderating raw material costs and lower acquisition related amortization expense performance coatings group sales for the year were variable by geography and end market and were impacted by unfavorable currency translation rate changes growth in north america and latin america was more than offset by softness in europe and asia mid single digit growth in our packaging and coil lines was offset by softness in other product lines most notably industrial wood adjusted segment margin increased to 14 1 from 12 9 in the prior year pricing synergies and good cost control drove the improvement turning to our 2020 outlook we currently see a similar environment to last year with north america architectural demand remaining solid and industrial demand remaining variable by geography and end market we have many opportunities to grow share in all of our businesses and i remain highly confident in our ability to provide customers with solutions based on innovation value added service and differentiated distribution we enter 2020 well positioned and focused on what we can control for the first quarter of 2020 we anticipate our consolidated net sales will increase by 2 to 5 compared to the first quarter of 2019 we expect the americas group to be at or above the high end of that range we expect consumer brands to be flat or slightly up excluding the impact of the ace business we exited in 2019 and we expect performance coatings to be up by low single digits for the full year 2020 we expect net sales to increase by 2 to 4 with segment performance similar to what i described for the first quarter on an earnings per share basis we believe the most meaningful way to provide guidance is to exclude valspar acquisition costs and onetime items on this basis and given our sales outlook we expect adjusted 2020 full year diluted net income per common share to be in the range of 22 70 to 23 50 per share an increase of approximately 9 4 at the midpoint compared to the 21 12 reported in 2019 on a comparable basis this adjusted 2020 guidance excludes approximately 2 79 per share for acquisition related expense the regulation g reconciliation table in our press release illustrates these moving parts we expect our 2020 effective tax rate to be in the low 20 range one key assumption embedded in our outlook is that the market rate of inflation for our raw materials basket in 2020 will be flat compared to 2019 assuming stable petrochemical feedstocks and no supply disruptions we expect the basket to be lower year over year in the first quarter and to a lesser extent in the second quarter with year over year costs flattening out or slightly increasing in the back half of the year a few additional data points may be helpful for modeling purposes we ll continue to make investments across the enterprise that will enhance our ability to provide differentiated solutions to our customers these investments include new stores and reps capacity and productivity improvements systems and product innovation in both our architectural and industrial businesses we also plan additional incremental investments in our digital platform and the home center channel these investments are embedded in our full year guidance we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 320 million which is about 1 7 of anticipated sales note that this estimate does not include any expenditure related to our previously announced headquarters and r d center project we expect to provide you with an update on this project in the near future depreciation should be 275 million and amortization will be about 310 million historically we have targeted dividends of about 30 of prior year gaap earnings next month at our board of directors meetings we ll recommend a quarterly dividend increase of 18 6 to 1 34 per share up from 1 13 last year we expect to continue making opportunistic share repurchases we ll also continue to evaluate acquisitions that fit our strategy before moving on to your questions let me wrap up today by asking you to save the date of wednesday june 3 on your calendars that will be the day we ll host our annual financial community presentation at the marriott marquis hotel in new york the program will include presentations by several members of our leadership team we ll host our customary q a session followed by a reception and lunch again that date is wednesday june 3 we ll be sending out invitations and related information and a link to our registration site in april with that i d like to thank you for joining us this morning and we ll be happy to take your questions questions and answers operator thank you our first question comes from christopher parkinson with credit suisse please proceed with your question christopher parkinson credit suisse analyst thank you can you just talk a little bit more about your expectations for u s housing and the consequence of architectural volumes outlook just given some more constructive data just in terms of what you re hearing from the americas group heads and their customers do you expect broader volume participation this year or just what are the key puts and takes thanks james r jaye senior vice president investor relations corporate communications thank you sure chris good morning it s jim what we always talk about when we have this question is we look at our sentiment from our 4 500 store managers and our 3 000 sales reps and they continue to be very optimistic about what they re seeing as we end the year and as we head into 2020 as we ve talked about this in the past from a big picture perspective certainly we believe that the continuing household formations in that 1 3 million range annually will support what s going on as we go forward but as you point out chris the more recent data is encouraging we re seeing strengthening in single and multifamily permits starts and completions at the year end and really the three month trailing average for all of those was up double digits we were at the builder show that just happened and i would tell you optimism at that builder show among our customers was very positive and you have other things out there that are supportive as well the mortgage rate remains very reasonable and some of the recent reports by some of the national homebuilders are also talking about strong orders so i think we feel very good about where housing is headed from a macro perspective allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer chris this is al i d just like to add on to that comment by saying as you look at how our north america paint stores group unfolded throughout the year our second half was stronger than our first half and even as you look at what tag performed we re at 4 8 you look at our same store sales up 4 6 to put that in perspective architectural gallons were high single digits in the quarter because as you as a reminder we did not go out with price in our fourth quarter and historically as we ve seen momentum in our second half and in our fourth quarter that translates to growth in our first half so that s what makes us feel pretty good about the paint stores in architectural in north america christopher parkinson credit suisse analyst great and just a quick follow up you previously discussed potentially getting your margins in consumer performance back up to toward let s say 20 was targeted but can you just simply update us on your conviction and your ability to do this and just also highlight to the investment community any key non raw material levers you can continue to pull to potentially make this happen in each segment allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes chris we re not coming off our numbers i am confident in our ability to hit those financial targets we laid out for 2020 as i talked about on the june investor day i confirm that we ll hit those targets but on a lag and i think throughout 2019 we made significant progress and are on the right path to attaining those goals and we ve even attained some of those goals already if you look at our core gross margin at 45 1 for the year it s at the low end of the targeted range that i had laid out at 45 to 48 and you look at our strong net operating cash and if i looked at net operating cash at 13 less capex you get a little over 11 net operating cash less capex which is the target that we have laid out so i am very confident in our ability on performance coatings and consumer brands to expand their margins to that mid to high teens low 20s and they made good progress this year christopher parkinson credit suisse analyst thank you operator thank you our next question comes from stephen byrne with bank of america merrill lynch please proceed with your question stephen byrne bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey hi you just mentioned that the same store sales metric in the fourth quarter was mostly volume in tag just because you lapped the year ago price and jim you mentioned the strongest region was the southeast where in october they were really underwater in that region so can you just comment on where you think backlog is in architectural paint contractors and where do you think this could drive same store sales in 2020 john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer well steve i think we re feeling really good about the market and the feedback that we re getting from our customers as you ve just mentioned there is a backlog part of it i think has to do with labor we continue to believe that backlog if you will in labor supports our model and helps build loyalty to what it is that we re trying to do for our customers which is driving the technology and services that help them to be more successful and we ve got a lot of new products that we re launching going into this year a lot of services that we re introducing all directly pointed at trying to help those customers to attack those so to your question we think geographically it s pretty solid there s no pockets that i ve been in yet or nor that we ve heard from our teams where people are feeling softness there s a general consensus that contractors are feeling very good could do more if they had more labor and we want to be there to help support them accomplish their goals stephen byrne bank of america merrill lynch analyst and john did you anticipate that changing some of the acquired brands to the sherwin brand would impact the outlook for sales for those products john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes i d like al to talk to it from a financial perspective but absolutely in fact i would say we re feeling really good about the fact that we ve gotten here as fast as we have as we entered into the integration we re always listening to our customers and always listening to our employees and the fact that our customers the retention of both our customers and our employees is so high in allowing us to move aggressively in this brand consolidation gives us really a great sense of pride of the speed and execution that we re moving in allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes and steve i would just add this is not indicative of the underlying businesses if you look at healthy businesses operating margins are expanding and we saw that in consumer brands and in our performance coatings groups this year and as john talked about in his opening remarks i mean we generated strong cash flow over the period end of 17 through 19 and we ll continue to do that we saw strong cash flow in 2019 so as a reminder we looked at this valspar acquisition over the long term it s hard when you re going into an acquisition to predict timing of when certain events happen but as john said improving our operating efficiencies by consolidating brands that s only going to help us going forward stephen byrne bank of america merrill lynch analyst thank you allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer thanks steve operator thank you our next question comes from jeff zekauskas with jpmorgan please proceed with your question jeff zekauskas jpmorgan analyst thanks very much can you talk about business conditions in china and in europe and maybe your offshore operations generally in 2019 how much did they grow in revenue terms or how much did they shrink and whether business conditions in china in the first quarter of 2020 are very different than what they were in the fourth quarter of 2019 john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer right well i think specifically to china i d say that the environment that we find ourselves in some of our business has been a challenge if you look at our industrial wood for example with the tariffs and generally a weaker economy it s had an impact on our business we ve had pockets of strength in southeast asia particularly in the cabinets area wood so i d say from a wood perspective it s been the most challenging that said if you look at our packaging business as an example we had a terrific run there in asia actually across the globe in packaging our coil business in asia was positive we had some pressure in our general industrial business there our automotive business is pretty small jeff in asia but it was positive so i d say a mixed bag there clearly some pressure but our market share there is such that it gives us terrific opportunity for growth and that s where we re headed jeff zekauskas jpmorgan analyst okay and then just a small question you talked about most of the growth in the stores business in the fourth quarter coming from volume but in previous quarters it seemed that price was a larger element did you simply annualize your price increases or was there some competitive activity that led to a lower price benefit or was there a mix effect why was price a smaller component in the fourth quarter john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes there was virtually no price in the quarter and it was because last year 2018 the price increase went in the 1st of october jeff in this year we rolled it in january 1 so the fourth quarter was exposed from a pricings perspective and i d just point out as al mentioned so when we look at the architectural gallons in that fourth quarter up the high single digits it was a really good quarter for our team in our tag business jeff zekauskas jpmorgan analyst thanks operator thank you our next question comes from ghansham panjabi with baird please proceed with your question ghansham panjabi baird analyst guys good morning can you help us with the margins on the americas group segment did that play out the way you thought it would during the fourth quarter during the third quarter you had a nice year over year acceleration in margins i think it was up 120 basis points 4q was closer to 70 basis points and that was also in a very healthy increase in sales what were the offsets there allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes so ghansham the way i look at i start with the flow through when you look at flow through in tag in the fourth quarter and it was over 33 so we saw nice leverage on our gallon increased as john talked about in his opening remarks about investments and additional opportunities and we have taken a long term strategic view of the market and aside from just new stores and new reps that we talked about john talked about expanding our digital platform that i think and we believe will give us a competitive advantage in the marketplace and we re expanding and investing in that tool to get better aligned with our customer to offer better services to make them more efficient ultimately as we ve talked about we want to drive higher top line growth for them and profitability so we started that really coming in third quarter and fourth quarter and you ll see us continue investing at the next year john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes ghansham i think when we were together actually we talked a little bit about some of the investments we were making on that digital and we re really proud to be announcing that we ll be rolling this out nationally at the end of the first quarter we think this is the start of a we have a number of products in the pipeline here but the start of a process that we ve been really investing in and to al s point we re cranking that up and the idea here is increasing that loyalty and the contractors leaning on us to be more efficient in what it is that they re trying to do we talked early about labor and this the launch of this digital platform will help them run a more efficient business it s not just external though we re also investing internally we didn t talk about this last year we ve made it through one year now with our sales reps now having had ipads for one year we think that s improving the productivity of our sales organization to be more responsive to our customers this year we ve just announced to our team we re rolling out ipads into our stores to make them more productive and more efficient and more responsive to the needs of our customers so we are investing we re investing in this business we have great confidence of our position right now and quite frankly we see some competitive opportunities that we want to take advantage of so we re putting our foot on the gas here ghansham panjabi baird analyst okay and then just for my second question on the performance coatings segment even with the industrial markets having been weaker for everybody including you the margins were still up year over year was there any residual price catch up or any significant mix benefit from businesses like packaging that drove the margin expansion apart from just synergy flow through allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes ghansham that s a very astute point as packaging and coil sales have expanded faster than the rest of the businesses we do see some lift in the margin on that yes as we ve talked about in the past our industrial business took the brunt of the run up in raw materials in 17 and 18 we ve been chasing that for the last few years it doesn t come in uniformly like our paint stores group so yes we saw some pricing flow through in our fourth quarter and then the other thing i would say is as we are investing in growth opportunities we are also laser focused on controlling and managing our costs where our businesses and or regions aren t performing to where you expect them to perform or seeing a path to a set target so we re controlling our costs and consolidating operations as well so you can expect that to continue as we go forward as we continue to invest in other areas ghansham panjabi baird analyst thanks so much allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer thank you operator thank you our next question is from john mcnulty with bmo capital markets please proceed with your question john mcnulty bmo capital markets analyst yes thanks for taking my question with regard to in the release you had laid out some acquisition related costs still in 2020 kind of to the tune of what looks to be 300 million to 350 million or so i guess what is that still being spent on and i guess how much of it is how much should we be thinking about as actually a cash hit and then i guess tied to that how are you thinking about cash conversion as we look to 2020 because it obviously took a big step up in 19 but curious how or where we go from here allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes john i m glad you brought that up because it s important that for an apples to apples comparison we wanted to call out acquisition related costs and the amortization depreciation year over year is very similar embedded in that number is about 30 million in additional integration costs and we wanted to include that in our guidance in the reg g table but we re not going to be laying that out going forward that breaks out just so for modeling purposes a little more back half versus front half loaded but this gets us in the next phase like john talked about synergies is part of our continuous improvement process we re going to get back to integration activities it s just part of our normal operating process as far as cash flow john you ve followed us for a very long time 13 that s always the new high watermark and as i talked about in our investor day and earlier net operating cash less capex we re targeting 11 and we expect to continue to hit that target as we go forward john mcnulty bmo capital markets analyst got it and then just a quick follow up with regard to the pipeline that you re seeing from your customers it sounds like the residential side is pretty solid can you speak to the non resi side and what you re seeing there john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes it s very good if you look at the commercial side property management i d say john trying not to get ahead of myself here but we re feeling really good i was just came back from our national sales meeting we had 8 500 of our closest friends together talking about just that and very bullish environment very positive and if you go from the commercial to property management into healthcare i mean there s a general feeling that our customers are really excited about what s ahead for 2020 so we re really looking forward to this year john mcnulty bmo capital markets analyst great thanks very much for the call john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yeah thank you john operator thank you our next question is from the line of arun viswanathan with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst good morning just curious on the paint store side was there any change in the quarter i know that you put up an 8 comp in q3 and that would imply like a 6 volume and you did a 5 3 here so it doesn t appear that way i m just curious if you noticed an improvement in q4 or a deceleration and do you expect kind of similar kind of mid single digit volume growth in 2020 john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes ron i d say the largest impact that we had was our protective marine business that runs through our tag business the architectural business as we mentioned was up high single digits we talked about the fact that we ve had another double digit increase in residential repaint and just talked about some of the other segments and the confidence that we have there if you look at those indicators that we often cite spray equipment nonpaint items everything points in the right direction so high single digit architectural gallons going through impacted by the p m business and the p m business through our stores was largely impacted by oil and gas which was under pressure and we had some timing of some big projects likely not going to be starting out until the beginning of the second quarter so we saw a little bit of softness in p m in the fourth quarter probably going to see a little bit in the first quarter but again the pipeline that we re looking at here is really solid allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes and arun i would just add to that the price increase that we went out with in our north america stores on january 1 was 3 to 4 we expect an effective rate of just below 2 and as john laid out in the opening remarks we expect paints our tag organization to be at the high end of our 2 to 4 so you think 4 to 6 if there s less than 2 in price the rest is volume arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst great that s very helpful and then just as a quick follow up on pcg obviously there s macro pressures and regional variability as you said do you think that is kind of tilted to the downside just given the coronavirus or maybe you can just offer your thoughts on where we are potentially destocking wise or especially in europe and asia is there any potential for stability there as we move through 2020 john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes i think we look at the comparisons of 2019 to 2020 and we have higher expectations moving forward it might be helpful or maybe i could just talk about each of the segments just briefly if we look at our auto and maybe i ll just do it for a number of the regions rather than just the two because i m sure there s some more questions there on auto we d say north america we feel really good probably the best i felt in the time i ve been ceo or coo collision shop business here is very strong i think we re in a really strong position and we re going to take advantage of that going forward europe i d say we had a little bit of softness in our auto business in europe asia as i mentioned earlier it s a small business up mid single digits in latin america we have a leadership position it was impacted primarily by currency we had a good quarter in auto in latin america packaging clearly the non bpa is giving us a terrific opportunity we believe that s an ongoing transition with plenty of opportunity for us ahead and so we re investing in this business we re investing in technology and in capacity and really trying to stay aligned with our customers we ve got great partners that we re trying to support and if you look at this this was a double digit quarter for them north america was strong double digits to your question about europe and asia europe was up but asia was up really really strong double digits and there our business in packaging is growing both in beverage and in food in coil new business wins really across the region north america throughout everyone we did have a little bit of softness in comparison in europe but this is a team that s really hitting on all cylinders and we re working hard so those are the ones that are really performing quite well gi asia we felt some impact there in our general industrial largely in the heavy equipment and ag equipment but we have a good pipeline of projects and good really good people there we expect to really see some improvement in our performance in this business industrial wood i talked about earlier china a lot of pressure feeling good about southeast asia europe was another area of pressure as well so among all the businesses i would say the one we re feeling the most pressure in would be the industrial wood and then protective marine i talked about largely running through our north american business through our tag but if i look at our smaller businesses albeit asia is a very small business it was up strong double digits for us europe down slightly as we had some pressure and some comparisons to some business there latin america was up slightly as well so that kind of captures all the regions all the businesses arun hopefully satisfied some other questions with that response arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst great thanks operator thank you our next question is from kevin mccarthy with vertical research partners please proceed with your question kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst yes good morning i was wondering if you could comment a little bit further on capital deployment you ve made some nice progress again on the balance sheet john just wondering if you would foresee any material change in the balance of acquisition activity versus repurchases as you look ahead into 2020 john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer i think the m a activity is something that we re really focused on we think it s an important part of our future although we don t feel as though we have a gun to our head we ve got the challenge for us right now quite frankly internally is prioritization of the opportunities so we re very active and i would say to answer your question you should see us deploying more cash into m a i don t think you re going to see the transformational type of acquisition that valspar was but we re working business by business to understand region by region where it is there are opportunities i want to clearly point out that we are not trying to be everything to everyone everywhere we are absolutely determined to invest where we can return generate a return of share for our shareholders and each of our businesses have developed a really good strategy that they re executing and any of those m a opportunities include the right to win in those markets so we re not going to be there we re not deploying cash in commodity areas and we re not deploying cash for the sake of saying that we can be somewhere we re there to make money kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst understood that s helpful my second question relates to raw materials it sounds like you anticipate some relief to start the year just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color as to the individual categories like pigment and petrochemicals etc and then with regard to resins in particular just wondering if you could comment on your degree of internal integration versus external purchases of resins and how that s evolved in recent years if it has james r jaye senior vice president investor relations corporate communications sure sure kevin glad to answer that as john said in his comments and you re right our outlook for this year is that the overall basket will be flat compared to 2019 and that s assuming stable petrochemical feedstocks no supply disruptions it will be lower year over year in the first quarter it will be a lesser extent in the second quarter and then sort of flatten out maybe increase in the back half if you remember we had our highest rate of inflation in 2019 it was in the first quarter which moderated through the year so our full year outlook that s our best estimate at this time the visibility once you get a couple of quarters out is a little bit murkier when you get to the specific categories kevin we expect the petrochemical basket to be in line with our overall raw material outlook probably a tailwind in the first quarter maybe into the second quarter before flattening and again increasing in the back half we re seeing right now key feedstocks propylene ethylene are down year over year as we enter 2020 and other key materials like epoxy for example more on our industrial side are also down year over year from a tio2 perspective right now what we re seeing is relatively stable moving into 2020 based on the current demand environment that we re in so that s kind of a big picture look at it from a resin internalization standpoint i ll let al take that one allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes kevin i don t think our strategy has changed we ve picked up a nice business with eps as part of the valspar acquisition we ve got to even invest in more assets to internalize resins but it s a balance we look at where we can make the most from a not just not a cost necessarily but from a differentiation standpoint and we have as we ve talked about a number of projects in the pipeline across each of the segments to continue to drive what i d call continuous improvement opportunities you saw some of that benefit in our consumer brands group this year and helping their margin expansion and you should expect that going forward john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes kevin if i could i d just like to add just one other component that was just slightly touched on by al on the proprietary development of technology we re looking at this opportunity to serve our customers particularly the painting contractor who s looking to maximize productivity and we re combining the asset that you re asking about in a way i think that s really unique for sherwin we re trying to position ourselves to provide solutions and technology to help those customers to be more productive i mentioned earlier the number of products that we are introducing and here i d just like to take the opportunity to talk about three of those because i think it highlights what al just talked about from a resin capability standpoint and i ll be very brief on this but this gives us the opportunity to develop products that really help our customers in a unique way we re introducing a product this year called flex temp that provides a contractor the ability to get out earlier colder temperatures and stay out longer in hotter temperatures it actually has a spread of ability to be applied from 35 degrees fahrenheit up to 120 degrees fahrenheit with no change in viscosity terrific uniform application and so it extends the ability of these painting contractors to be out so when we talk about labor and the challenges of getting caught up we re looking at ways to make them more productive we re introducing a new product called emerald rain refresh that again same platform of technology proprietary we ll hold on to this no one else will have it but this is a product that not only optimizes applications so that you have more productivity from painters with less experience this is a product that when it rains or it is hosed down it looks like it was just painted so after every rain the home or commercial building to look as if it was just painted brand new clean so these painters that have applied this in the commercialization process have just been really raving about it and the last one just to be brief again we re introducing a new extension on our emerald line which is our top of the line product this will be the finest paint that we ve produced yet outstanding hiding great applications so again painters with limited experience we re making limited experienced painters better painters best application better touch up all with this idea that if we re developing resins and products for them the loyalty to sherwin increases kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst thank you so much john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer thanks kevin operator thank you our next question comes from bob koort with goldman sachs please proceed with your question anthony walker goldman sachs analyst hi guys this is anthony walker on for bob maybe just two quick ones can you talk about the performance of the international businesses within the consumer segment which you acquired through the valspar transaction in the past you ve talked about potential strategic or rationalization opportunities there assuming the businesses continued to underperform how should we think about the timing and the opportunity there john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes i think let me just walk through the three areas there just briefly first asia i d say the business is certainly going through a transition we ve talked about the fact that this walroom brand was predominantly focused on interior wood so we re shifting that strategy as much of that business internally and region is now shifting to a shop or factory applied application and so the teams are developing a strategy and executing pieces of it to pursue and reposition the brand there again a small piece of the business but we think this is an important one future opportunity here is terrific we re gaining we re making some progress in the quarter we started to see a positive trend in asia so i d say that one is trending the right way europe we made significant progress this past year sales were positive in mid single digits operating profit improved to a low double digit percentage so feeling that we are pointing in the right direction there australia is a bird of another color we ve got some challenges there and quite frankly we re not performing as needed we have plans and teams executing on this this is one that you should expect us to get closer to and see some improvement or making some tough changes anthony walker goldman sachs analyst great and then just one on the price increase that you announced for the paint stores group how should we think about that flowing through the results in the year will we start to see that show up in the first quarter in full and then how should we also think about the magnitude of what i assume are labor freight and distribution expenses as sort of tempting to offset allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes the pricing will roll out on a similar cadence to past price increases you ll see some of that for sure in the first quarter and then as it takes hold over the next six months we ll get full effectiveness as it flows through all of our customers when you look at our cost basket that we ve talked about merit increases are higher than what they ve been in the past healthcare benefits continue to rise and as we ve absorbed those over the past number of years but this price increase is not unprecedented to cover costs other than raw materials and if you go back in the first quarter of 2014 we went out a price increase to cover those costs because as you can imagine it s a compounding if you don t get it in the first year and it compounds over three or four years it gets to be pretty steep so that s kind of why this justification with this price increase john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes we re not getting thank you notes from our customers obviously but many of them are facing similar situations so the fact that we waited until january 1 gave our customers an opportunity to kind of recalibrate as they re bidding going forward in the new year and secondly the fact that they re experiencing the same thing i think has helped in the execution as well operator thank you we ll move on to our next question which comes from the line of mike harrison with seaport global securities please proceed with your question mike harrison seaport global securities analyst hi good afternoon they might be wondering if you could give us an update on the progress at lowe s and maybe just more broadly speaking your expectations for diy in the first half of 19 it seems like with refinancing activity having picked up and the easy weather comps and the store resets and the training that s been going on at lowe s that maybe that business could be stronger yet you guys provided guidance that suggests that consumer is more flattish for the full year john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes so a piece of that just a reminder as we have the ace business that s coming out so that s a piece of the go forward forecast mike but i would describe our opportunity at lowe s quite simply as we think we re moving the ball in the right direction but we re never satisfied and we re investing i mentioned earlier in my remarks about that we re stepping up our investments in the home center channel obviously they would be a big part of that we see that there are opportunities in both the consumer side and the professional side those pros that paint we think it s a terrific opportunity for us to help our customer on the consumer side we have a lot of opportunities to help convert shoppers into customers and we made a big commitment to this relationship and we want to see this thing through and the opportunity here is to help execute and that s on all fronts so i don t think you should ever expect us to say that we re done this is a business that we re looking at just aggressively as we do our own stores business we think there s opportunities and we re committed to helping our customer win allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer mike i would just add to that that we have talked about this in the past that embedded in our consumer brands segment is our retail channel that has been under pressure consistently and as lowe s has performed better they certainly are taking share from that segment and then we re trying to be realistic when we look outside the u s we re trying not to build although optimistic trying not to build a hockey stick to our sales guidance and but rest assured we expect more out of those teams outside the u s mike harrison seaport global securities analyst all right and then i wanted to also ask about the colorsnap consultation brand and how that s contributing to paint store sales growth how much of north america do you have covered with the colorsnap offering at this point i m just trying to get a sense of kind of what stage we re in with that rollout and how much more it could contribute john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes we re pretty early in it there was an opportunity and again this goes back to helping our customers mike you really hit on something here because this has worked out quite well for us not so much just for the consumer but our residential repaint contractors are leaning on us to help accelerate the selling process for them and as we employ this as well as the digital colorsnap which is an ai application that s new and continuing to we continue to enhance the previous platform it allows our customers to accelerate through their process of closing business this is the professional painting contractor to a homeowner so i would suspect that you re going to see that as a component one of many items that we are going to continue to leverage and add service and productivity that helps build loyalty to the painting contractor but it s still got a lot of opportunity across the country a lot mike harrison seaport global securities analyst thank you operator thank you we ll move on to our next question which comes from the line of david begleiter with deutsche bank please proceed with your question david begleiter deutsche bank analyst thank you good morning john can you discuss your plans for store openings and any closings in 2020 and any impact on the cadence of store openings from either your digital strategy or how you re trying to service some of your larger customers going forward john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer well we expect to continue in that range of 80 to 100 stores we i don t know that it s changed in any way from a store cadence we d like to see a smoother rollout of the stores rolling in i ve been trying to fix that since i ran that business 15 years ago but i d say that we feel really good about it i also want to thank our teams because i think we re getting continuing to get better at it the stores that we re opening and we re cranking up faster and the impact is better some of that has to do with the quality of people in the stores as well as the systems that we re adding to those so i d say you should expect us to continue to add in those stores at a similar rate to what we ve had allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes david i d just add when you look at tag and we closed 32 stores in the year 26 of those stores were in latin america we have talked about the pressure we ve been under latin america as you know we take a rigorous and consistent view of our portfolio of businesses brands customer programs and other investments and as we ve not been able to see a line of sight to above average growth either in sales operating margins cash we ve had to take action we re not exiting those markets but pushing those sales through what i would call more of a dealer network which is a little less asset intensive and i think you ll see some of that continue here in our first half david begleiter deutsche bank analyst very good and john just lastly what s your sense on the pool of available painters in both the quantity as well as the quality in 2020 john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer let s say it s under pressure our customers as i mentioned earlier would like to move faster and there are a number of wonderful painters and many people entering in the industry that are learning as they go and as i mentioned as i ran through those products briefly we re taking that into consideration as we re building products and helping our customers to improve their efficiency so i d say they re both under pressure people that typically enter into the trades we re working with those professionals to help train those employees but there s a pressure in finding them david begleiter deutsche bank analyst thank you john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from p j juvekar with citi please proceed with your question p j juvekar citi analyst yes hi good morning or good afternoon plastic single use plastics are coming under pressure so it s bags and bottles i was wondering if as bottles come under pressure would some of the food and beverage stuff move to cans and would that become an opportunity for you on interior or exterior coatings of the cans john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes the answer is yes we would welcome that transition and we want to work to support our customers to do that as i mentioned earlier the progress that we re making in our packaging business in both food and beverage has been fantastic and more of that transitioning into our packaging and customers business is terrific and that s why we talk a lot about this in our stores business but even on the packaging side we re really determined to help our customers through technology to help speed up lines to help minimize not damaged but trying to buy imperfections in the coatings but the idea here is as we help them become more efficient in driving efficiencies into their plant the better supplier we are so we re really focused on making them better p j juvekar citi analyst okay and then my second question is now that your leverage is below your target of 3x what is your willingness to look at m a what size and would 2020 be the year that you come back into the market for m a allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer p j we have consistently are looking for acquisitions of any size i mean i think you re right as you look at our debt to ebitda ratio under three in 2020 i don t expect to pay down debt and as our ebitda grows you ll see us drive that target down toward the two to 2 5 long term target that i have but yes we are actively looking for acquisitions but as john mentioned earlier we re taking a disciplined approach to that and i d say we raised the dividend 18 we ll keep capex below 2 but absent those m a absent any acquisitions we re going to buy back our stock this year john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes but i think to your point though our coo david sewell got his teams really leaning forward in this area looking for those opportunities not only just simply from the opportunity but from the strategic value that can be gained from it p j juvekar citi analyst thank you john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer thank you pj operator thank you our next question comes from vincent andrews with morgan stanley please proceed with your question vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst thank you all i ve got left on my list is al can you just the tax rate stepping up this year is that just sort of your starting point and then you see how the year plays out and what things your team comes up with or do you how should we be thinking about the higher tax rate allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes vincent that i m always looking at the tax rate it s a function of how many options and how our legal entity consolidations flow through to help that tax rate so i started at the low 20 range and then i expect our tax guys to develop plans and continue with the programs that are going to continue to drive that down vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst thanks very much allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from duffy fischer with barclays please proceed with your question duffy fischer barclays analyst yeah good morning just one for me volumetrically how fast did the north american architectural market grow last year do you guys think james r jaye senior vice president investor relations corporate communications we haven t seen official data yet on that duffy if i go back to probably the most recent data we have is 2018 gallon growth was a little over 2 i want to say it s probably similar in 2019 and probably at a similar level in 2020 sort of that low single digit level if i would guess duffy fischer barclays analyst thanks guys james r jaye senior vice president investor relations corporate communications you bet operator thank you the next question comes from justin speer with zelman associates please proceed with your question justin speer zelman associates analyst thank you guys i just wanted to unpack that if you could help maybe further unpack the nature of those sg a investments and how you think they ll unfold from a percentage of revenue standpoint allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes justin we re not going to go down the p l by line on the guidance i think what we ve consistently done is grow our store count grow our rep count and then these additional investments are going to come through pretty evenly throughout the year and we re not going to quantify them because it s like any other review that we do we want to see how the first half unfolds how volumes look and it may give us an opportunity to accelerate in the back half of the year like we did this year so i think it depends but they re in our guidance and we ll continue to manage those accordingly john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer i would say justin we are planning on sharing a number of these with you during our financial community presentation on that june 3 date where we ll give you some idea from in some of these areas the digital i think you ll be really impressed with and to the extent that we re comfortable in sharing obviously we don t want to point specifically for competitive reasons to what we re doing but as much as we can as things roll out we ll share what we ve done but not what we re going to do justin speer zelman associates analyst okay and i guess maybe because i m sure you pilot i know you piloted a number of these different programs but just curious how the there s like a response rate in terms of growth improvement to the model or is it just a stickiness in this widening of the moat bringing the customer closer the relationship is good but does it change the growth algorithm or the amount of gallons that flow through all else equal john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes we re doing this for growth we absolutely believe it improves the stickiness the moat any metaphor we want to use but we are growing our business and we re going to do it profitably and we think that the more solutions that we bring to our customers to help make them more profitable the more likely we re going to continue to be their supplier and so we re really focused on not just one lever one silver bullet but a number of these that will enhance their ability to be successful and as a result we become a better supplier to them justin speer zelman associates analyst and my last question is just on the consumer business just how much mix benefit from that transition in ace will you are you thinking or estimating for your 2020 targets there allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes what we talked about is the ace business that private label business was about 100 million a year considerably below the average of our consumer operating margin we didn t lay that out and we re not going to but you should expect margin improvement because of that justin speer zelman associates analyst thank you gentlemen operator thank you our next question comes from the line of garik shmois with loop capital please proceed with your question we ll move on to our next question which comes from the line of truman patterson with wells fargo please proceed with your question truman patterson wells fargo analyst hi good afternoon guys thanks for taking my questions first just wanted to make sure i m understanding this clearly on your tag in paint stores demand outlook for 2020 the full year guide i think it implies that volumes grow pretty much in line with 2019 maybe at a bit of a slower pace even when i m listening to you all you re very optimistic on the architectural volume side seems like that market is even accelerating which would imply that protective marine in that non res market might even be decelerating versus 2019 just trying to understand how you all are thinking about that and if you can walk me through the parts john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes truman i d say you re right in sensing our confidence in the architectural side having just finished the quarter in the mid single or i m sorry high single digits gives us confidence moving forward on the protective marine side that runs through there we ve got the fourth quarter and likely the first quarter right now that we re seeing is likely a little softer than we would have liked to see but feeling pretty good about it going forward so i think we re trying to be just in line with what our customers are telling us and we feel pretty good about the number that we put out here allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes truman the other comment i would make is as i mentioned earlier if you look at the way the year unfolded for paint stores in north america we had a strong second half versus the first half even a 9 8 7 tag increase in the third quarter which is a large quarter and a very good result in a large quarter like that so i think when we get through our second quarter and see how the year is unfolding we can give you an update then truman patterson wells fargo analyst okay ok and then final question for me just on the raw materials basket can you just discuss what kind of tailwinds you actually saw in the fourth quarter from an overall basket perspective and then just remind us what you ended up seeing in 2019 as a whole james r jaye senior vice president investor relations corporate communications yes truman costs for the broad basket that we buy i would say moderated slightly in the fourth quarter 19 from third quarter of 19 so it kind of played out as we thought fourth quarter 2019 was also lower year over year the year over year decrease in the fourth quarter was driven primarily by lower cost for resins solvents and we don t provide specific dollars on the savings of the raw materials but you can see the positive trend i think reflected in our year over year gross margin improvement truman patterson wells fargo analyst okay thank you james r jaye senior vice president investor relations corporate communications sure operator thank you our next question comes from rosemarie morbelli with g research please proceed with your question rosemarie morbelli g research analyst thank you good afternoon everyone john i was wondering if you could give us a little more on the impairment charges i am assuming that the bulk of it is the woods coatings in china but you also mentioned one impairment taken in the consumer brands category is that ace or a little color on which product lines you are more or less eliminating as there is no growth and those for which you are going to change the brand name john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes rosemary i would not classify it as no growth i would characterize it in gi and in automotive as we ve put in implemented our systems our legacy systems we ve gotten customers to move to a new label and that has helped us optimize or streamline our operations that s the biggest impact another example would be in australia we re under pressure that we talked about earlier about driving operating margin and cash flow improvement and one way to do that is reduce the number of brands you re trying to support and so in that area we also move from remove focus if you will on one brand and driving it more through the wattyl brand and again that s going to help us in the midterm here to reduce our costs and keep investing in labels and merchandising and different things like that so the walroom brand in china has been under pressure john talked about that transition certainly from to factory applied coatings that is an impact and as that transition continues to move and expand we re not expecting or anticipating any other impairments going forward rosemarie morbelli g research analyst okay and then the goal was very optimistic your projections of 2 to 4 on the revenue line is stronger or higher than it was 2019 versus 2018 and yet if i look at your eps projections at the midpoint it is up 9 versus up 14 in 19 over 14 if i have those numbers right so i am wondering what are the offsets allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes rosemarie i d say that we re if you re comparing last year to the go forward as i talked about the price increase that we went out with and being effective under 2 that s below what we really realized through the first three quarters of last year our raw material moderation isn t as strong as what we saw in 2019 and these investments that we talked about even though we re seeing slower in our second half of 19 on performance coatings we continue to invest back in this in our businesses that we think are going to provide growth opportunities in the future not only the new stores and the new reps that we even accelerated in the back half but this digital program that john laid out and then some other our home center channel that so yes we re continuing those investments in 2020 john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer it may not have an immediate feedback or a payback but we re running this company longer term than just one quarter and we absolutely believe these are the right investments to make and so we re moving forward aggressively taking advantage as i said of not only the market but we really think there s some competitive opportunities out here that we want to take advantage of rosemarie morbelli g research analyst okay so nothing really special just going forward and investing where you need to john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer investing where we need to skinnying back where we can but leaning forward we think that we ve described it internally rosemarie as a coil we feel we re cranking this coil down and we expect it to respond given the investments that we have in a very positive way allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer and rosemarie we don t expect the market to be this way but if you go back to 2007 08 and 09 when we added 260 new stores when we came out of that you look at our market share growth not only on the 3 year but the 5 year and the 10 year compounded average growth rates we think we re well above market growth and that s the attitude we re taking we look at it long term and expect as john mentioned that coil to grow market share faster than what we ve done in the past rosemarie morbelli g research analyst thank you operator thank you our next question comes from christopher perrella with bloomberg intelligence please proceed with your question christopher perrella bloomberg intelligence analyst hi guys quick ones on lat am volume has that flattened out for you at this point and you re looking for inflection in 2020 and then just a little color on consumer pricing do you expect to get about half of what you get in the tag group for 2020 allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes chris i would say for latin america our volumes have i would say improved as the year has gone on but where you re seeing it is as we continue to see the devaluation we re continually that team is continually having to go out with price 60 of our raw materials are dollar denominated so every deflation we see in brazil as an example we re constantly chasing with price so the biggest portion of our impact right now is price but some of the things that we re doing on streamlining sales organizations and focus on the right segments and customer segment will help drive growth in the future john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes we re just not waiting for the market we re not waiting for currency we re trying to do we mentioned earlier control the things we can control and our mexico sales were up high single digits clearly offset by argentina and brazil and some of the other regions as al mentioned we re trying to be very aggressive in brazil the store reduction is an example of that but we re looking to drive more profitable sales to the most efficient channels down there allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes and chris the second question on price yes in performance coatings we do still have opportunities for price in certain businesses and regions and as you remember 17 and 18 we saw the big run up in raw materials our industrial businesses were impacted the most although raws have moderated and our expectation is in 2020 they re not back to where they were at the beginning of 2017 so we re continuing to need price we ve expanded our margins but we expect and i feel confident that we ll get to the high teens and low 20s and recovering those raw material costs plus the incremental freight cost plus the merit increases and healthcare that i talked about on tag those are affecting our performance coatings group and we re having to offset those so yes we re going to continue with price christopher perrella bloomberg intelligence analyst thank you john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer thanks chris operator thank you our next question comes from the line of chris bottiglieri with wolfe research please proceed with your question chris bottiglieri wolfe research analyst hey guys thanks for the question first of all i want to kind of follow up on your comment earlier on the auto business looking the best that it s been in your tenure a little surprising to hear i mean are you starting to see like accident frequency inflect or total loss rates come down or is it more so just competitive dynamics where you feel like you re taking share from the channel john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer competitive dynamics we re taking share i think the market there s been some compression we think and we ve talked about that openly with safer cars and safer attributes that are going into these vehicles which are absolutely critical so we re doing it by the technology that we re bringing and the services that we re bringing the combination of valspar and sherwin together we have a new improved system that we think has been very well received by the marketplace and we re really working hard to serve those customers in a way to help their throughput through those facilities chris bottiglieri wolfe research analyst got you that s helpful and then one other question on coronavirus i just want to think there are like potential impacts maybe like a more of an indirect impact recognize you don t have high exposure to like chinese tio2 but are there any impacts to that market that could manifest in the global supply chain if the work stop continues or any other like feedstock or inputs that again if we continue to see more business shutdowns and extended holiday that could maybe have an impact on your business curious how you think about that james r jaye senior vice president investor relations corporate communications yes chris let me start just by saying first when we look at this the health and safety of our employees is 1 obviously and so we re monitoring that very carefully and the recommendations that are out there we ve suspended travel to and from china in the short term and we re limiting some travel inside the country to business critical so we re doing that but i think we re working closely with our teams there our customers our suppliers haven t seen to this point any negative impact and we ll continue to monitor that closely i think it s just too early to see john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer now we ve got some very good leadership on the ground there jason wu and his team are keeping us fully abreast and i d say right now from a procurement standpoint we re staying close so there s a couple of dynamics there s a raw material piece of it and there s also the point that jim just mentioned about trying to make sure we re doing everything we can to protect our employees and work with our customers there s a whole lot of people trying to do everything possible to do that but there s a lot of uncertainty and we ll react as it unfolds chris bottiglieri wolfe research analyst got you really helpful thank you john g morikis chairman and chief executive officer you bet operator ladies and gentlemen this concludes our question and answer session so i d like to turn the floor back over to mr jaye for any additional concluding comments james r jaye senior vice president investor relations corporate communications thank you jesse and thanks everybody for joining us on the call today myself and eric swanson will be available

our review of our operating results for the fourth quarter and the full year so let me turn the call over to john morikis who will make some general comments and provide our outlook for fiscal year 2020 john john morikis chairman and chief executive officer thank you jim good morning everyone thanks for joining us i d like to make just a few additional comments on our fourth quarter and full year 2019 before moving on to our outlook for 2020 we ended the year on a strong note growing adjusted diluted earnings per share by 21 compared to last year s fourth quarter in terms of the full year we delivered another year of excellent results for our shareholders sales grew by 2 1 to a record 17 9 billion adjusted gross margin improved to 45 1 reflecting our pricing efforts and moderation of raw material inflation adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 14 to a record 21 12 per share adjusted ebitda increased 235 million to a record 3 1 billion or 17 1 of sales net operating cash increased 378 million to a record 2 32 billion or 13 of sales return on net assets employed increased to 15 1 on core profit before tax total shareholder return for the year was 49 7 and we returned approximately 1 2 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks an increase of 28 over the prior year we reduced our debt by 660 million and we ended the year with net debt to ebitda below three times before moving on to my comments on our segments i d like to take a moment to provide an update on the integration of valspar while there s still much to be accomplished particularly outside the u s i wanted to thank our teams for their tremendous hard work to date in bringing our two businesses together and for increasing the value we are and will be able to deliver to our customers and to our shareholders since the beginning of 2017 sherwin williams has generated 6 1 billion in net operating cash or 12 2 of sales we ve used that cash to invest approximately 800 million back into the business reduced debt by nearly 3 billion and returned approximately 2 5 billion to shareholders including 1 1 billion in dividends and 1 4 billion in share buybacks we will no longer be calling out synergies related to the valspar acquisition as it becomes more difficult to distinguish between acquisition synergies and our ongoing continuous improvements initiatives we exit 2019 having a benefit of about 315 million from synergies in the p l including about 75 million that was realized in 2019 we ve identified approximately another 100 million in opportunity largely related to our supply chain optimization efforts in europe and asia as previously communicated we expect to realize a small portion of this benefit in 2020 with the majority being realized in 2021 and 2022 as projects are completed let me now turn to just a few comments on our operating segments all of which contributed to our record performance in 2019 within the americas group full year sales increased 5 7 against the prior year comparison of 5 6 residential repaint remained our strongest customer segment up by double digit percentage year over year this is the sixth year in a row we ve grown residential repaint at a double digit level all other segments grew in the mid single digit range for the year full year segment profit dollars and margin also improved year over year we continue to invest in innovation and service introducing 27 new products our ninth consecutive year of double digit product introductions we opened 94 new paint stores in the americas group this year and closed 32 to be clear we opened 84 net new stores and added 150 new sales territories in the u s and canada of the 32 stores we closed 26 were in latin america and were related to changing market dynamics in the consumer segment we generated growth with our largest retail partners in north america though full year segment sales decreased due to lower than expected sales in asia and australia and the impact of the guardsman divestiture adjusted segment margin improved to 17 5 driven by synergies operating efficiencies pricing moderating raw material costs and lower acquisition related amortization expense performance coatings group sales for the year were variable by geography and end market and were impacted by unfavorable currency translation rate changes growth in north america and latin america was more than offset by softness in europe and asia mid single digit growth in our packaging and coil lines was offset by softness in other product lines most notably industrial wood adjusted segment margin increased to 14 1 from 12 9 in the prior year pricing synergies and good cost control drove the improvement turning to our 2020 outlook we currently see a similar environment to last year with north america architectural demand remaining solid and industrial demand remaining variable by geography and end market we have many opportunities to grow share in all of our businesses and i remain highly confident in our ability to provide customers with solutions based on innovation value added service and differentiated distribution we enter 2020 well positioned and focused on what we can control for the first quarter of 2020 we anticipate our consolidated net sales will increase by 2 to 5 compared to the first quarter of 2019 we expect the americas group to be at or above the high end of that range we expect consumer brands to be flat or slightly up excluding the impact of the ace business we exited in 2019 and we expect performance coatings to be up by low single digits for the full year 2020 we expect net sales to increase by 2 to 4 with segment performance similar to what i described for the first quarter on an earnings per share basis we believe the most meaningful way to provide guidance is to exclude valspar acquisition costs and onetime items on this basis and given our sales outlook we expect adjusted 2020 full year diluted net income per common share to be in the range of 22 70 to 23 50 per share an increase of approximately 9 4 at the midpoint compared to the 21 12 reported in 2019 on a comparable basis this adjusted 2020 guidance excludes approximately 2 79 per share for acquisition related expense the regulation g reconciliation table in our press release illustrates these moving parts we expect our 2020 effective tax rate to be in the low 20 range one key assumption embedded in our outlook is that the market rate of inflation for our raw materials basket in 2020 will be flat compared to 2019 assuming stable petrochemical feedstocks and no supply disruptions we expect the basket to be lower year over year in the first quarter and to a lesser extent in the second quarter with year over year costs flattening out or slightly increasing in the back half of the year a few additional data points may be helpful for modeling purposes we ll continue to make investments across the enterprise that will enhance our ability to provide differentiated solutions to our customers these investments include new stores and reps capacity and productivity improvements systems and product innovation in both our architectural and industrial businesses we also plan additional incremental investments in our digital platform and the home center channel these investments are embedded in our full year guidance we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 320 million which is about 1 7 of anticipated sales note that this estimate does not include any expenditure related to our previously announced headquarters and r d center project we expect to provide you with an update on this project in the near future depreciation should be 275 million and amortization will be about 310 million historically we have targeted dividends of about 30 of prior year gaap earnings next month at our board of directors meetings we ll recommend a quarterly dividend increase of 18 6 to 1 34 per share up from 1 13 last year we expect to continue making opportunistic share repurchases we ll also continue to evaluate acquisitions that fit our strategy before moving on to your questions let me wrap up today by asking you to save the date of wednesday june 3 on your calendars that will be the day we ll host our annual financial community presentation at the marriott marquis hotel in new york the program will include presentations by several members of our leadership team we ll host our customary q a session followed by a reception and lunch again that date is wednesday june 3 we ll be sending out invitations and related information and a link to our registration site in april with that i d like to thank you for joining us this morning and we ll be happy to take your questions questions answers operator our first question comes from christopher parkinson with credit suisse please proceed with your question christopher parkinson credit suisse analyst thank you can you just talk a little bit more about your expectations for u s housing and the consequence of architectural volumes outlook just given some more constructive data just in terms of what you re hearing from the americas group heads and their customers do you expect broader volume participation this year or just what are the key puts and takes jim jaye senior vice president investor relations sure chris good morning it s jim what we always talk about when we have this question is we look at our sentiment from our 4 500 store managers and our 3 000 sales reps and they continue to be very optimistic about what they re seeing as we end the year and as we head into 2020 as we ve talked about this in the past from a big picture perspective certainly we believe that the continuing household formations in that 1 3 million range annually will support what s going on as we go forward but as you point out chris the more recent data is encouraging we re seeing strengthening in single and multifamily permits starts and completions at the year end and really the three month trailing average for all of those was up double digits we were at the builder show that just happened and i would tell you optimism at that builder show among our customers was very positive and you have other things out there that are supportive as well the mortgage rate remains very reasonable and some of the recent reports by some of the national homebuilders are also talking about strong orders so i think we feel very good about where housing is headed from a macro perspective al mistysyn chief financial officer hey chris this is al i d just like to add on to that comment by saying as you look at how our north america paint stores group unfolded throughout the year our second half was stronger than our first half and even as you look at what tag performed we re at 4 8 you look at our same store sales up 4 6 to put that in perspective architectural gallons were high single digits in the quarter because as you as a reminder we did not go out with price in our fourth quarter and historically as we ve seen momentum in our second half and in our fourth quarter that translates to growth in our first half so that s what makes us feel pretty good about the paint stores in architectural in north america christopher parkinson credit suisse analyst great and just a quick follow up you previously discussed potentially getting your margins in consumer performance back up to toward let s say 20 was targeted but can you just simply update us on your conviction and your ability to do this and just also highlight to the investment community any key non raw material levers you can continue to pull to potentially make this happen in each segment al mistysyn chief financial officer yes chris we re not coming off our numbers i am confident in our ability to hit those financial targets we laid out for 2020 as i talked about on the june investor day i confirm that we ll hit those targets but on a lag and i think throughout 2019 we made significant progress and are on the right path to attaining those goals and we ve even attained some of those goals already if you look at our core gross margin at 45 1 for the year it s at the low end of the targeted range that i had laid out at 45 to 48 and you look at our strong net operating cash and if i looked at net operating cash at 13 less capex you get a little over 11 net operating cash less capex which is the target that we have laid out so i am very confident in our ability on performance coatings and consumer brands to expand their margins to that mid to high teens low 20s and they made good progress this year christopher parkinson credit suisse analyst thank you operator thank you our next question comes from stephen byrne with bank of america merrill lynch please proceed with your question stephen byrne bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey al you just mentioned that the same store sales metric in the fourth quarter was mostly volume in tag just because you lapped the year ago price and jim you mentioned the strongest region was the southeast where in october they were really underwater in that region so can you just comment on where you think backlog is in architectural paint contractors and where do you think this could drive same store sales in 2020 john morikis chairman and chief executive officer well steve i think we re feeling really good about the market and the feedback that we re getting from our customers as you ve just mentioned there is a backlog part of it i think has to do with labor we continue to believe that backlog if you will in labor supports our model and helps build loyalty to what it is that we re trying to do for our customers which is driving the technology and services that help them to be more successful and we ve got a lot of new products that we re launching going into this year a lot of services that we re introducing all directly pointed at trying to help those customers to attack those so to your question we think geographically it s pretty solid there s no pockets that i ve been in yet nor that we ve heard from our teams where people are feeling softness there s a general consensus that contractors are feeling very good could do more if they had more labor and we want to be there to help support them accomplish their goals stephen byrne bank of america merrill lynch analyst and john did you anticipate that changing some of the acquired brands to the sherwin brand would impact the outlook for sales for those products john morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes i d like al to talk to it from a financial perspective but absolutely in fact i would say we re feeling really good about the fact that we ve gotten here as fast as we have as we entered into the integration we re always listening to our customers and always listening to our employees and the fact that our customers the retention of both our customers and our employees is so high in allowing us to move aggressively in this brand consolidation gives us really a great sense of pride of the speed and execution that we re moving in al mistysyn chief financial officer yes and steve i would just add this is not indicative of the underlying businesses if you look at healthy businesses operating margins are expanding and we saw that in consumer brands and in our performance coatings groups this year and as john talked about in his opening remarks i mean we generated strong cash flow over the period end of 17 through 19 and we ll continue to do that we saw strong cash flow in 2019 so as a reminder we looked at this valspar acquisition over the long term it s hard when you re going into an acquisition to predict timing of when certain events happen but as john said improving our operating efficiencies by consolidating brands that s only going to help us going forward thanks steve operator thank you our next question comes from jeff zekauskas with jp morgan please proceed with your question jeff zekauskas j p morgan analyst thanks very much can you talk about business conditions in china and in europe and maybe your offshore operations generally in 2019 how much did they grow in revenue terms or how much did they shrink and whether business conditions in china in the first quarter of 2020 are very different than what they were in the fourth quarter of 2019 john morikis chairman and chief executive officer right well i think specifically to china i d say that the environment that we find ourselves in some of our business has been a challenge if you look at our industrial wood for example with the tariffs and generally a weaker economy it s had an impact on our business we ve had pockets of strengths in southeast asia particularly in the cabinets area wood so i d say from a wood perspective it s been the most challenging that said if you look at our packaging business as an example we had a terrific run there in asia actually across the globe in packaging our coil business in asia was positive we had some pressure in our general industrial business there our automotive business is pretty small jeff in asia but it was positive so i d say a mixed bag there clearly some pressure but our market share there is such that it gives us terrific opportunity for growth and that s where we re headed jeff zekauskas j p morgan analyst ok and then just a small question you talked about most of the growth in the stores business in the fourth quarter coming from volume but in previous quarters it seemed that price was a larger element did you simply annualize your price increases or was there some competitive activity that led to a lower price benefit or was there a mix effect why was price a smaller component in the fourth quarter john morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes there was virtually no price in the quarter and it was because last year 2018 the price increase went in the first of october jeff in this year we rolled it in january 1 so the fourth quarter was exposed from a pricings perspective and i d just point out as al mentioned so when we look at the architectural gallons in that fourth quarter up the high single digits it was a really good quarter for our team in our tag business jeff zekauskas j p morgan analyst thank you operator thank you our next question comes from ghansham panjabi with baird please proceed with your question ghansham panjabi baird analyst hey guys good morning can you help us with the margins on the americas group segment did that play out the way you thought it would during the fourth quarter during the third quarter you had a nice year over year acceleration in margins i think it was up 120 basis points 4q was closer to 70 basis points and that was also in a very healthy increase in sales what were the offsets there al mistysyn chief financial officer yes so ghansham the way i look at i start with the flow through when you look at flow through in tag in the fourth quarter and it was over 33 so we saw nice leverage on our gallon increased as john talked about in his opening remarks about investments and additional opportunities and we have taken a long term strategic view of the market and aside from just new stores and new reps that we talked about john talked about expanding our digital platform that i think and we believe will give us a competitive advantage in the marketplace and we re expanding and investing in that tool to get better aligned with our customer to offer better services to make them more efficient ultimately as we ve talked about we want to drive higher top line growth for them and profitability so we started that really coming in third quarter and fourth quarter and you ll see us continue investing at the next year john morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes ghansham i think when we were together actually we talked a little bit about some of the investments we were making on that digital and we re really proud to be announcing that we ll be rolling this out nationally at the end of the first quarter we think this is the start of a we have a number of products in the pipeline here but the start of a process that we ve been really investing in and to al s point we re cranking that up and the idea here is increasing that loyalty and the contractors leaning on us to be more efficient in what it is that they re trying to do we talked early about labor and the launch of this digital platform will help them run a more efficient business it s not just external though we re also investing internally we didn t talk about this last year we ve made it through one year now with our sales reps now having had ipads for one year we think that s improving the productivity of our sales organization to be more responsive to our customers this year we ve just announced to our team we re rolling out ipads into our stores to make them more productive and more efficient and more responsive to the needs of our customers so we are investing we re investing in this business we have great confidence of our position right now and quite frankly we see some competitive opportunities that we want to take advantage of so we re putting our foot on the gas here ghansham panjabi baird analyst ok and then just for my second question on the performance coatings segment even with the industrial markets having been weaker for everybody including you the margins were still up year over year was there any residual price catch up or any significant mix benefit from businesses like packaging that drove the margin expansion apart from just synergy flow through al mistysyn chief financial officer yes ghansham that s a very astute point as packaging and coil sales have expanded faster than the rest of the businesses we do see some lift in the margin on that yes as we ve talked about in the past our industrial business took the brunt of the run up in raw materials in 17 and 18 we ve been chasing that for the last few years it doesn t come in uniformly like our paint stores group so yes we saw some pricing flow through in our fourth quarter and then the other thing i would say is as we are investing in growth opportunities we are also laser focused on controlling and managing our costs where our businesses and or regions aren t performing to where you expect them to perform or seeing a path to a set target so we re controlling our costs and consolidating operations as well so you can expect that to continue as we go forward as we continue to invest in other areas ghansham panjabi baird analyst got it thanks so much al mistysyn chief financial officer thank you ghansham operator thank you our next question is from john mcnulty with bmo capital markets please proceed with your question john mcnulty bmo capital markets analyst yes thanks for taking my question with regard to in the release you had laid out some acquisition related costs still in 2020 kind of to the tune of what looks to be 300 million to 350 million or so i guess what is that still being spent on and i guess how much of it is how much should we be thinking about as actually a cash hit and then i guess tied to that how are you thinking about cash conversion as we look to 2020 because it obviously took a big step up in 19 but curious how or where we go from here al mistysyn chief financial officer yes john i m glad you brought that up because it s important that for an apples to apples comparison we wanted to call out acquisition related costs and the amortization depreciation year over year is very similar embedded in that number is about 30 million in additional integration costs and we wanted to include that in our guidance in the reg g table but we re not going to be laying that out going forward that breaks out just so for modeling purposes a little more back half versus front half loaded but this gets us in the next phase like john talked about synergies is part of our continuous improvement process we re going to get back to integration activities it s just part of our normal operating process as far as cash flow john you ve followed us for a very long time 13 that s always the new high watermark and as i talked about in our investor day and earlier net operating cash less capex we re targeting 11 and we expect to continue to hit that target as we go forward john mcnulty bmo capital markets analyst got it and then just a quick follow up with regard to the pipeline that you re seeing from your customers it sounds like the residential side is pretty solid can you speak to the non resi side and what you re seeing there john morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes it s very good if you look at the commercial side property management i d say john trying not to get ahead of myself here but we re feeling really good i just came back from our national sales meeting we had 8 500 of our closest friends together talking about just that and very bullish environment very positive and if you go from the commercial to property management into healthcare i mean there s a general feeling that our customers are really excited about what s ahead for 2020 so we re really looking forward to this year john mcnulty bmo capital markets analyst great thanks very much for the call operator thank you our next question is from the line of arun viswanathan with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst good morning just curious on the paint store side was there any change in the quarter i know that you put up an 8 comp in q3 and that would imply like a 6 volume and you did a 5 3 here so it doesn t appear that way i m just curious if you noticed an improvement in q4 or a deceleration and do you expect kind of similar kind of mid single digit volume growth in 2020 john morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes arun i d say the largest impact that we had was our protective and marine business that runs through our tag business the architectural business as we mentioned was up high single digits we talked about the fact that we ve had another double digit increase in residential repaint and just talked about some of the other segments and the confidence that we have there if you look at those indicators that we often cite spray equipment non paint items everything points in the right direction so high single digit architectural gallons going through impacted by the p m business and the p m business through our stores was largely impacted by oil and gas which was under pressure and we had some timing of some big projects likely not going to be starting out until the beginning of the second quarter so we saw a little bit of softness in p m in the fourth quarter probably going to see a little bit in the first quarter but again the pipeline that we re looking at here is really solid al mistysyn chief financial officer yes and arun i would just add to that the price increase that we went out with in our north america stores on january 1 was 3 to 4 we expect an effective rate of just below 2 and as john laid out in the opening remarks we expect paints our tag organization to be at the high end of our 2 to 4 so you think 4 to 6 if there s less than 2 in price the rest is volume arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst great that s very helpful and then just as a quick follow up on pcg obviously there s macro pressures and regional variability as you said do you think that is kind of tilted to the downside just given the coronavirus or maybe you can just offer your thoughts on where we are potentially destocking wise or especially in europe and asia is there any potential for stability there as we move through 2020 john morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes i think we look at the comparisons of 2019 to 2020 and we have higher expectations moving forward it might be helpful or maybe i could just talk about each of the segments just briefly if we look at our auto and maybe i ll just do it for a number of the regions rather than just the two because i m sure there s some more questions there on auto we d say north america we feel really good probably the best i felt in the time i ve been ceo or coo collision shop business here is very strong i think we re in a really strong position and we re going to take advantage of that going forward europe i d say we had a little bit of softness in our auto business in europe asia as i mentioned earlier it s a small business up mid single digits in latin america we have a leadership position it was impacted primarily by currency we had a good quarter in auto in latin america packaging clearly the non bpa is giving us a terrific opportunity we believe that s an ongoing transition with plenty of opportunity for us ahead and so we re investing in this business we re investing in technology and in capacity and really trying to stay aligned with our customers we ve got great partners that we re trying to support and if you look at this this was a double digit quarter for them north america was strong double digits to your question about europe and asia europe was up but asia was up really really strong double digits and there our business in packaging is growing both in beverage and in food in coil new business wins really across the region north america throughout everyone we did have a little bit of softness in comparison in europe but this is a team that s really hitting on all cylinders and we re working hard so those are the ones that are really performing quite well gi asia we felt some impact there in our general industrial largely in the heavy equipment and ag equipment but we have a good pipeline of projects and good really good people there we expect to really see some improvement in our performance in this business industrial wood i talked about earlier china a lot of pressure feeling good about southeast asia europe was another area of pressure as well so among all the businesses i would say the one we re feeling the most pressure in would be the industrial wood and then protective and marine i talked about largely running through our north american business through our tag but if i look at our smaller businesses albeit asia is a very small business it was up strong double digits for us europe down slightly as we had some pressure and some comparisons to some business there latin america was up slightly as well so that kind of captures all the regions all the businesses arun hopefully satisfied some other questions with that response arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst great great thanks john morikis chairman and chief executive officer thanks arun operator thank you our next question is from kevin mccarthy with vertical research partners please proceed with your question kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst yes good morning i was wondering if you could comment a little bit further on capital deployment you ve made some nice progress again on the balance sheet john just wondering if you would foresee any material change in the balance of acquisition activity versus repurchases as you look ahead into 2020 john morikis chairman and chief executive officer i think the m a activity is something that we re really focused on we think it s an important part of our future although we don t feel as though we have a gun to our head we ve got the challenge for us right now quite frankly internally is prioritization of the opportunities so we re very active and i would say to answer your question you should see us deploying more cash into m a i don t think you re going to see the transformational type of acquisition that valspar was but we re working business by business to understand region by region where it is there are opportunities i want to clearly point out that we are not trying to be everything to everyone everywhere we are absolutely determined to invest where we can return generate a return of share for our shareholders and each of our businesses have developed a really good strategy that they re executing and any of those m a opportunities include the right to win in those markets so we re not going to be there we re not deploying cash in commodity areas and we re not deploying cash for the sake of saying that we can be somewhere we re there to make money kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst understood that s helpful my second question relates to raw materials it sounds like you anticipate some relief to start the year just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color as to the individual categories like pigment and petrochemicals etc and then with regard to resins in particular just wondering if you could comment on your degree of internal integration versus external purchases of resins and how that s evolved in recent years if it has jim jaye senior vice president investor relations sure sure kevin glad to answer that as john said in his comments and you re right our outlook for this year is that the overall basket will be flat compared to 2019 and that s assuming stable petrochemical feedstocks no supply disruptions it will be lower year over year in the first quarter it will be a lesser extent in the second quarter and then sort of flatten out maybe increase in the back half if you remember we had our highest rate of inflation in 2019 it was in the first quarter which moderated through the year so our full year outlook that s our best estimate at this time the visibility once you get a couple of quarters out is a little bit murkier when you get to the specific categories kevin we expect the petrochemical basket to be in line with our overall raw material outlook probably a tailwind in the first quarter maybe into the second quarter before flattening and again increasing in the back half we re seeing right now key feedstocks propylene ethylene are down year over year as we enter 2020 and other key materials like epoxy for example more on our industrial side are also down year over year from a tio2 perspective right now what we re seeing is relatively stable moving into 2020 based on the current demand environment that we re in so that s kind of a big picture look at it from a resin internalization standpoint i ll let al take that one al mistysyn chief financial officer yes kevin i don t think our strategy has changed we ve picked up a nice business with eps as part of the valspar acquisition we ve got to even invest in more assets to internalize resins but it s a balance we look at where we can make the most from a not just not a cost necessarily but from a differentiation standpoint and we have as we ve talked about a number of projects in the pipeline across each of the segments to continue to drive what i d call continuous improvement opportunities you saw some of that benefit in our consumer brands group this year and helping their margin expansion and you should expect that going forward john morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes kevin if i could i d just like to add just one other component that was just slightly touched on by al on the proprietary development of technology we re looking at this opportunity to serve our customers particularly the painting contractor who s looking to maximize productivity and we re combining the asset that you re asking about in a way i think that s really unique for sherwin we re trying to position ourselves to provide solutions and technology to help those customers to be more productive i mentioned earlier the number of products that we are introducing and here i d just like to take the opportunity to talk about three of those because i think it highlights what al just talked about from a resin capability standpoint and i ll be very brief on this but this gives us the opportunity to develop products that really help our customers in a unique way we re introducing a product this year called flex temp that provides a contractor the ability to get out earlier colder temperatures and stay out longer in hotter temperatures it actually has a spreadability to be applied from 35 degrees fahrenheit up to 120 degrees fahrenheit with no change in viscosity terrific uniform application and so it extends the ability of these painting contractors to be out so when we talk about labor and the challenges of getting caught up we re looking at ways to make them more productive we re introducing a new product called emerald rain refresh that again same platform of technology proprietary we ll hold on to this no one else will have it but this is a product that not only optimizes applications so that you have more productivity from painters with less experience this is a product that when it rains or it is hosed down it looks like it was just painted so after every rain the home or commercial building looks as if it was just painted brand new clean so these painters that have applied this in the commercialization process have just been really raving about it and the last one just to be brief again we re introducing a new extension on our emerald line which is our top of the line product this will be the finest paint that we ve produced yet outstanding hiding great applications so again painters with limited experience we re making limited experienced painters better painters best application better touch up all with this idea that if we re developing resins and products for them the loyalty to sherwin increases kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst thank you so much john morikis chairman and chief executive officer thanks kevin operator thank you our next question comes from bob koort with goldman sachs please proceed with your question anthony walker goldman sachs analyst hi guys this is anthony walker on for bob maybe just two quick ones can you talk about the performance of the international businesses within the consumer segment which you acquired through the valspar transaction in the past you ve talked about potential strategic or rationalization opportunities there assuming the businesses continued to underperform how should we think about the timing and the opportunity there john morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes i think let me just walk through the three areas there just briefly first asia i d say the business is certainly going through a transition we ve talked about the fact that this huarun brand was predominantly focused on interior wood so we re shifting that strategy as much of that business internally and region is now shifting to a shop or factory applied application and so the teams are developing a strategy and executing pieces of it to pursue and reposition the brand there again a small piece of the business but we think this is an important one future opportunity here is terrific we re gaining we re making some progress in the quarter we started to see a positive trend in asia so i d say that one is trending the right way europe we made significant progress this past year sales were positive in mid single digits operating profit improved to a low double digit percentage so feeling that we are pointing in the right direction there australia is a bird of another color we ve got some challenges there and quite frankly we re not performing as needed we have plans and teams executing on this this is one that you should expect us to get closer to and see some improvement or making some tough changes anthony walker goldman sachs analyst great and then just one on the price increase that you announced for the paint stores group how should we think about that flowing through the results in the year will we start to see that show up in the first quarter in full and then how should we also think about the magnitude of what i assume are labor freight and distribution expenses as sort of tempting to offset al mistysyn chief financial officer yes the pricing will roll out on a similar cadence to past price increases you ll see some of that for sure in the first quarter and then as it takes hold over the next six months we ll get full effectiveness as it flows through all of our customers when you look at our cost basket that we ve talked about merit increases are higher than what they ve been in the past health care benefits continue to rise and as we ve absorbed those over the past number of years but this price increase is not unprecedented to cover costs other than raw materials and if you go back in the first quarter of 2014 we went out a price increase to cover those costs because as you can imagine it s compounding if you don t get it in the first year and it compounds over three or four years it gets to be pretty steep so that s kind of why this justification with this price increase john morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes we re not getting thank you notes from our customers obviously but many of them are facing similar situations so the fact that we waited until january 1 gave our customers an opportunity to kind of recalibrate as they re bidding going forward in the new year and secondly the fact that they re experiencing the same thing i think has helped in the execution as well operator thank you we ll move on to our next question which comes from the line of mike harrison with seaport global securities please proceed with your question mike harrison seaport global securities analyst good afternoon john morikis chairman and chief executive officer hey mike mike harrison seaport global securities analyst wondering if you could give us an update on the progress at lowe s and maybe just more broadly speaking your expectations for diy in the first half of 19 it seems like with refinancing activity having picked up and the easy weather comps and the store resets and the training that s been going on at lowe s that maybe that business could be stronger yet you guys provided guidance that suggests that consumer is more flattish for the full year john morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes so a piece of that just a reminder as we have the ace business that s coming out so that s a piece of the go forward forecast mike but i would describe our opportunity at lowe s quite simply as we think we re moving the ball in the right direction but we re never satisfied and we re investing i mentioned earlier in my remarks about that we re stepping up our investments in the home center channel obviously they would be a big part of that we see that there are opportunities in both the consumer side and the professional side those pros that paint we think it s a terrific opportunity for us to help our customer on the consumer side we have a lot of opportunities to help convert shoppers into customers and we made a big commitment to this relationship and we want to see this thing through and the opportunity here is to help execute and that s on all fronts so i don t think you should ever expect us to say that we re done this is a business that we re looking at just aggressively as we do our own stores business we think there s opportunities and we re committed to helping our customer win al mistysyn chief financial officer mike i would just add to that that we have talked about this in the past that embedded in our consumer brands segment is our retail channel that has been under pressure consistently and as lowe s has performed better they certainly are taking share from that segment and then we re trying to be realistic when we look outside the u s we re trying not to build although optimistic trying not to build a hockey stick to our sales guidance and but rest assured we expect more out of those teams outside the u s mike harrison seaport global securities analyst all right and then i wanted to also ask about the colorsnap consultation brand and how that s contributing to paint store sales growth how much of north america do you have covered with the colorsnap offering at this point i m just trying to get a sense of kind of what stage we re in with that rollout and how much more it could contribute john morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes we re pretty early in it there was an opportunity and again this goes back to helping our customers mike you really hit on something here because this has worked out quite well for us not so much just for the consumer but our residential repaint contractors are leaning on us to help accelerate the selling process for them and as we employ this as well as the digital colorsnap which is an ai application that s new and continuing we continue to enhance the previous platform it allows our customers to accelerate through their process of closing business this is the professional painting contractor to a homeowner so i would suspect that you re going to see that as a component one of many items that we are going to continue to leverage and add service and productivity that helps build loyalty to the painting contractor but it s still got a lot of opportunity across the country a lot thank you mike operator thank you we ll move on to our next question which comes from the line of david begleiter with deutsche bank please proceed with your question david begleiter deutsche bank analyst thank you good morning john can you discuss your plans for store openings and any closings in 2020 and any impact on the cadence of store openings from either your digital strategy or how you re trying to service some of your larger customers going forward john morikis chairman and chief executive officer well we expect to continue in that range of 80 to 100 stores i don t know that it s changed in any way from a store cadence we d like to see a smoother rollout of the stores rolling in i ve been trying to fix that since i ran that business 15 years ago but i d say that we feel really good about it i also want to thank our teams because i think we re getting continuing to get better at it the stores that we re opening and we re cranking up faster and the impact is better some of that has to do with the quality of people in the stores as well as the systems that we re adding to those so i d say you should expect us to continue to add in those stores at a similar rate to what we ve had al mistysyn chief financial officer yes david i d just add when you look at tag and we closed 32 stores in the year 26 of those stores were in latin america we have talked about the pressure we ve been under latin america as you know we take a rigorous and consistent view of our portfolio of businesses brands customer programs and other investments and as we ve not been able to see a line of sight to above average growth either in sales operating margins cash we ve had to take action we re not exiting those markets but pushing those sales through what i would call more of a dealer network which is a little less asset intensive and i think you ll see some of that continue here in our first half david begleiter deutsche bank analyst very good and john just lastly what s your sense on the pool of available painters in both the quantity as well as the quality in 2020 john morikis chairman and chief executive officer let s say it s under pressure our customers as i mentioned earlier would like to move faster and there are a number of wonderful painters and many people entering in the industry that are learning as they go and as i mentioned as i ran through those products briefly we re taking that into consideration as we re building products and helping our customers to improve their efficiency so i d say they re both under pressure people that typically enter into the trades we re working with those professionals to help train those employees but there s a pressure in finding them david begleiter deutsche bank analyst thank you john morikis chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from p j juvekar with citi please proceed with your question p j juvekar citi analyst yes hi good morning plastic single use plastics are coming under pressure so it s bags and bottles i was wondering if as bottles come under pressure would some of the food and beverage stuff move to cans and would that become an opportunity for you on interior or exterior coatings of the cans john morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes the answer is yes we would welcome that transition and we want to work to support our customers to do that as i mentioned earlier the progress that we re making in our packaging business in both food and beverage has been fantastic and more of that transitioning into our packaging and customers business is terrific and that s why we talk a lot about this in our stores business but even on the packaging side we re really determined to help our customers through technology to help speed up lines to help minimize not damaged but trying to buy imperfections in the coatings but the idea here is as we help them become more efficient in driving efficiencies into their plant the better supplier we are so we re really focused on making them better p j juvekar citi analyst ok and then my second question is now that your leverage is below your target of three times what is your willingness to look at m a what size and would 2020 be the year that you come back into the market for m a al mistysyn chief financial officer p j we consistently are looking for acquisitions of any size i mean i think you re right as you look at our debt to ebitda ratio under three in 2020 i don t expect to pay down debt and as our ebitda grows you ll see us drive that target down toward the two to 2 5 long term target that i have but yes we are actively looking for acquisitions but as john mentioned earlier we re taking a disciplined approach to that and i d say we raised the dividend 18 we ll keep capex below 2 but absent those m a absent any acquisitions we re going to buy back our stock this year john morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes but i think to your point though our coo david sewell got his teams really leaning forward in this area looking for those opportunities not only just simply from the opportunity but from the strategic value that can be gained from it p j juvekar citi analyst thank you john morikis chairman and chief executive officer thank you p j operator thank you our next question comes from vincent andrews with morgan stanley please proceed with your question vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst all i ve got left on my list is al can you just the tax rate stepping up this year is that just sort of your starting point and then you see how the year plays out and what things your team comes up with or do you how should we be thinking about the higher tax rate al mistysyn chief financial officer yes vincent i m always looking at the tax rate it s a function of how many options and how our legal entity consolidations flow through to help that tax rate so i started at the low 20 range and then i expect our tax guys to develop plans and continue with the programs that are going to continue to drive that down vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst thanks very much al mistysyn chief financial officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from duffy fischer with barclays please proceed with your question duffy fischer barclays analyst yes good morning just one for me volumetrically how fast did the north american architectural market grow last year do you guys think jim jaye senior vice president investor relations we haven t seen official data yet on that duffy if i go back to probably the most recent data we have is 2018 gallon growth was a little over 2 i want to say it s probably similar in 2019 and probably at a similar level in 2020 sort of that low single digit level if i would guess duffy fischer barclays analyst thanks guys jim jaye senior vice president investor relations you bet operator thank you the next question comes from justin speer with zelman associates please proceed with your question justin speer zelman and associates analyst thank you guys i just wanted to unpack that if you could help maybe further unpack the nature of those sg a investments and how you think they ll unfold from a percentage of revenue standpoint al mistysyn chief financial officer yes justin we re not going to go down the p l by line on the guidance i think what we ve consistently done is grow our store count grow our rep count and then these additional investments are going to come through pretty evenly throughout the year and we re not going to quantify them because it s like any other review that we do we want to see how the first half unfolds how volumes look and it may give us an opportunity to accelerate in the back half of the year like we did this year so i think it depends but they re in our guidance and we ll continue to manage those accordingly john morikis chairman and chief executive officer i would say justin we are planning on sharing a number of these with you during our financial community presentation on that june 3 date where we ll give you some idea from in some of these areas the digital i think you ll be really impressed with and to the extent that we re comfortable in sharing obviously we don t want to point specifically for competitive reasons to what we re doing but as much as we can as things roll out we ll share what we ve done but not what we re going to do justin speer zelman and associates analyst ok and i guess maybe because i m sure you pilot i know you piloted a number of these different programs but just curious how the there s like a response rate in terms of growth improvement to the model or is it just a stickiness in this widening of the moat bringing the customer closer the relationship is good but does it change the growth algorithm or the amount of gallons that flow through all else equal john morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes we re doing this for growth we absolutely believe it improves the stickiness the moat any metaphor we want to use but we are growing our business and we re going to do it profitably and we think that the more solutions that we bring to our customers to help make them more profitable the more likely we re going to continue to be their supplier and so we re really focused on not just one lever one silver bullet but a number of these that will enhance their ability to be successful and as a result we become a better supplier to them justin speer zelman and associates analyst and my last question is just on the consumer business just how much mix benefit from that transition in ace will you are you thinking or estimating for your 2020 targets there al mistysyn chief financial officer yes what we talked about is the ace business that private label business was about 100 million a year considerably below the average of our consumer operating margin we didn t lay that out and we re not going to but you should expect margin improvement because of that justin speer zelman and associates analyst thank you gentlemen al mistysyn chief financial officer justin thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of garik shmois with loop capital please proceed with your question we ll move on to our next question which comes from the line of truman patterson with wells fargo please proceed with your question truman patterson wells fargo analyst hi good afternoon guys thanks for taking my questions first just wanted to make sure i m understanding this clearly on your tag in paint stores demand outlook for 2020 the full year guide i think it implies that volumes grow pretty much in line with 2019 maybe at a bit of a slower pace even when i m listening to you all you re very optimistic on the architectural volume side seems like that market is even accelerating which would imply that protective and marine in that non res market might even be decelerating versus 2019 just trying to understand how you all are thinking about that and if you can walk me through the parts john morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes truman i d say you re right in sensing our confidence in the architectural side having just finished the quarter in the mid single or i m sorry high single digits gives us confidence moving forward on the protective and marine side that runs through there we ve got the fourth quarter and likely the first quarter right now that we re seeing is likely a little softer than we would have liked to see but feeling pretty good about it going forward so i think we re trying to be just in line with what our customers are telling us and we feel pretty good about the number that we put out here al mistysyn chief financial officer yes truman the other comment i would make is as i mentioned earlier if you look at the way the year unfolded for paint stores in north america we had a strong second half versus the first half even a 9 8 7 tag increase in the third quarter which is a large quarter and a very good result in a large quarter like that so i think when we get through our second quarter and see how the year is unfolding we can give you an update then truman patterson wells fargo analyst ok ok and then final question for me just on the raw materials basket can you just discuss what kind of tailwinds you actually saw in the fourth quarter from an overall basket perspective and then just remind us what you ended up seeing in 2019 as a whole jim jaye senior vice president investor relations yes truman costs for the broad basket that we buy i would say moderated slightly in the fourth quarter 19 from third quarter of 19 so it kind of played out as we thought fourth quarter 2019 was also lower year over year the year over year decrease in the fourth quarter was driven primarily by lower cost for resins solvents and we don t provide specific dollars on the savings of the raw materials but you can see the positive trend i think reflected in our year over year gross margin improvement truman patterson wells fargo analyst ok thank you jim jaye senior vice president investor relations sure operator thank you our next question comes from rosemarie morbelli with g research please proceed with your question rosemarie morbelli g research analyst thank you good afternoon everyone john i was wondering if you could give us a little more on the impairment charges i am assuming that the bulk of it is the woods coatings in china but you also mentioned one impairment taken in the consumer brands category is that ace or a little color on which product lines you are more or less eliminating as there is no growth and those for which you are going to change the brand name john morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes rosemarie i would not classify it as no growth i would characterize it in gi and in automotive as we ve put in implemented our systems our legacy systems we ve gotten customers to move to a new label and that has helped us optimize or streamline our operations that s the biggest impact another example would be in australia we re under pressure that we talked about earlier about driving operating margin and cash flow improvement and one way to do that is reduce the number of brands you re trying to support and so in that area we also move from remove focus if you will on one brand and driving it more through the wattyl brand and again that s going to help us in the midterm here to reduce our costs and keep investing in labels and merchandising and different things like that so the huarun brand in china has been under pressure john talked about that transition certainly from to factory applied coatings that is an impact and as that transition continues to move and expand we re not expecting or anticipating any other impairments going forward rosemarie morbelli g research analyst ok and then the goal was very optimistic your projections of 2 to 4 on the revenue line is stronger or higher than it was 2019 versus 2018 and yet if i look at your eps projections at the midpoint it is up 9 versus up 14 in 19 over 14 if i have those numbers right so i am wondering what are the offsets al mistysyn chief financial officer yes rosemarie i d say that we re if you re comparing last year to the go forward as i talked about the price increase that we went out with and being effective under 2 that s below what we really realized through the first three quarters of last year our raw material moderation isn t as strong as what we saw in 2019 and these investments that we talked about even though we re seeing slower in our second half of 19 on performance coatings we continue to invest back in this in our businesses that we think are going to provide growth opportunities in the future not only the new stores and the new reps that we even accelerated in the back half but this digital program that john laid out and then some other our home center channel that so yes we re continuing those investments in 2020 john morikis chairman and chief executive officer it may not have an immediate feedback or a payback but we re running this company longer term than just one quarter and we absolutely believe these are the right investments to make and so we re moving forward aggressively taking advantage as i said of not only the market but we really think there s some competitive opportunities out here that we want to take advantage of rosemarie morbelli g research analyst ok so nothing really special just going forward and investing where you need to john morikis chairman and chief executive officer investing where we need to skinnying back where we can but leaning forward we think that we ve described it internally rosemarie as a coil we feel we re cranking this coil down and we expect it to respond given the investments that we have in a very positive way al mistysyn chief financial officer and rosemarie we don t expect the market to be this way but if you go back to 2007 08 and 09 when we added 260 new stores when we came out of that you look at our market share growth not only on the three year but the five year and the 10 year compounded average growth rates we think we re well above market growth and that s the attitude we re taking we look at it long term and expect as john mentioned that coil to grow market share faster than what we ve done in the past rosemarie morbelli g research analyst all right looking forward to that clearly deploying thank you al mistysyn chief financial officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from christopher perrella with bloomberg intelligence please proceed with your question christopher perrella bloomberg intelligence analyst hi guys quick ones on lat am volume has that flattened out for you at this point and you re looking for inflection in 2020 and then just a little color on consumer pricing do you expect to get about half of what you get in the tag group for 2020 al mistysyn chief financial officer yes chris i would say for latin america our volumes have i would say improved as the year has gone on but where you re seeing it is as we continue to see the devaluation we re continually that team is continually having to go out with price 60 of our raw materials are dollar denominated so every deflation we see in brazil as an example we re constantly chasing with price so the biggest portion of our impact right now is price but some of the things that we re doing on streamlining sales organizations and focus on the right segments and customer segment will help drive growth in the future john morikis chairman and chief executive officer yes we re just not waiting for the market we re not waiting for currency we re trying to do we mentioned earlier control the things we can control and our mexico sales were up high single digits clearly offset by argentina and brazil and some of the other regions as al mentioned we re trying to be very aggressive in brazil the store reduction is an example of that but we re looking to drive more profitable sales to the most efficient channels down there al mistysyn chief financial officer yes and chris the second question on price yes in performance coatings we do still have opportunities for price in certain businesses and regions and as you remember 17 and 18 we saw the big run up in raw materials our industrial businesses were impacted the most although raws have moderated and our expectation is in 2020 they re not back to where they were at the beginning of 2017 so we re continuing to need price we ve expanded our margins but we expect and i feel confident that we ll get to the high teens and low 20s and recovering those raw material costs plus the incremental freight cost plus the merit increases and healthcare that i talked about on tag those are affecting our performance coatings group and we re having to offset those so yes we re going to continue with price john morikis chairman and chief executive officer thank you chris operator thank you our next question comes from the line of chris bottiglieri with wolfe research please proceed with your question chris bottiglieri wolfe research analyst hey guys thanks for taking the question first of all i want to kind of follow up on your comment earlier on the auto business looking the best that it s been in your tenure a little surprising to hear i mean are you starting to see like accident frequency inflect or total loss rates come down or is it more so just competitive dynamics where you feel like you re taking share from the channel john morikis chairman and chief executive officer competitive dynamics we re taking share i think the market there s been some compression we think and we ve talked about that openly with safer cars and safer attributes that are going into these vehicles which are absolutely critical so we re doing it by the technology that we re bringing and the services that we re bringing the combination of valspar and sherwin together we have a new improved system that we think has been very well received by the marketplace and we re really working hard to serve those customers in a way to help their throughput through those facilities chris bottiglieri wolfe research analyst got you that s helpful and then one other question on coronavirus i just want to think there are like potential impacts maybe like more of an indirect impact recognize you don t have high exposure to like chinese tio2 but are there any impacts to that market that could manifest in the global supply chain if the work stop continues or any other like feedstock or inputs that again if we continue to see more business shutdowns and extended holiday that could maybe have an impact on your business curious how you think about that jim jaye senior vice president investor relations yes chris let me start just by saying first when we look at this the health and safety of our employees is no 1 obviously and so we re monitoring that very carefully and the recommendations that are out there we ve suspended travel to and from china in the short term and we re limiting some travel inside the country to business critical so we re doing that but i think we re working closely with our teams there our customers our suppliers haven t seen to this point any negative impact and we ll continue to monitor that closely i think it s just too early to see john morikis chairman and chief executive officer now we ve got some very good leadership on the ground there jason wu and his team are keeping us fully abreast and i d say right now from a procurement standpoint we re staying close so there s a couple of dynamics there s a raw material piece of it and there s also the point that jim just mentioned about trying to make sure we re doing everything we can to protect our employees and work with our customers there s a whole lot of people trying to do everything possible to do that but there s a lot of uncertainty and we ll react as it unfolds chris bottiglieri wolfe research analyst thank you operator thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes our question and answer session so i d like to turn the floor back over to mr jaye for any

a newly released study by the economic policy institute reaches a devastating but not surprising conclusion globalization has screwed american workers however putting numbers on how much sustained trade deficits with china translate into lost american jobs and those numbers turning out to be large gives free trade cheerleaders a lot less wriggle room epi estimates that american sacrificed 3 7 million jobs as a result of us china trade deficits since china joined the wto in 2001 with 3 4 of the losses taking place in manufacturing positions they also point out that job losses to china have increased since trump took office the epi estimates are consistent with earlier studies from a 2017 wall street journal article how the china shock deep and swift spurred the rise of trump what happened with chinese imports is an example of how much of the conventional wisdom about economics that held sway in the late 1990s including the role of trade technology and central banking has since slowly unraveled both presidential candidates aimed much of their criticism at 1994 s north american free trade agreement which boosted imports from mexico even then though the real culprit was china economists now say many u s factories that moved to mexico did so to match prices from china some of the new mexican factories helped support u s jobs for example fabrics made in the u s are turned into clothing in mexico for sale globally by u s companies a group of economists that includes messrs hanson and autor estimates that chinese competition was responsible for 2 4 million jobs lost in the u s between 1999 and 2011 total u s employment rose 2 1 million to 132 9 million in the same period recall that the much touted nafta was supposed to deliver one million american jobs but instead resulted in job destruction with studies estimating anywhere from nearly 800 000 jobs to over a million now to the executive summary of the epi report u s jobs lost are spread throughout the country but are concentrated in manufacturing including in industries in which the united states has traditionally held a competitive advantage the growth of the u s trade deficit with china between 2001 and 2018 was responsible for the loss of 3 7 million u s jobs including 1 7 million jobs lost since 2008 the first full year of the great recession which technically began at the end of 2007 three fourths 75 4 of the jobs lost between 2001 and 2018 were in manufacturing 2 8 million manufacturing jobs lost due to the growth in the trade deficit with china including 1 7 million jobs lost since 2008 the first full year of the great recession which technically began at the end of 2007 three fourths 75 4 of the jobs lost between 2001 and 2018 were in manufacturing 2 8 million manufacturing jobs lost due to the growth in the trade deficit with china trade deficits with china and resulting jobs losses continued to grow during the first two years of the trump administration despite the administration s heated rhetoric and imposition of tariffs the u s trade deficit with china rose from 347 billion in 2016 to 420 billion in 2018 an increase of 21 0 u s jobs displaced by china trade deficits increased from nearly 3 0 million in 2016 to 3 7 million in 2018 a total of more than 700 000 jobs lost or displaced in the first two years of the trump administration despite the administration s heated rhetoric and imposition of tariffs the u s trade deficit with china rose from 347 billion in 2016 to 420 billion in 2018 an increase of 21 0 u s jobs displaced by china trade deficits increased from nearly 3 0 million in 2016 to 3 7 million in 2018 a total of more than 700 000 jobs lost or displaced in the first two years of the trump administration the growing trade deficit with china has cost jobs in all 50 states and in every congressional district in the united states the 10 hardest hit states when looking at job loss as a share of total state employment were new hampshire oregon california north carolina minnesota massachusetts wisconsin vermont and indiana and idaho job losses in these states ranged from 2 82 in idaho to 3 66 in new hampshire of total state employment the five hardest hit states based on total jobs lost were california 654 100 jobs lost texas 334 800 new york 185 100 illinois 162 400 and florida 150 700 the 10 hardest hit states

100 illinois 162 400 and florida 150 700 the trade deficit in the computer and electronic parts industry grew the most and that is reflected in job losses 1 340 600 jobs were lost in that industry accounting for 36 2 of the 2001 2018 total jobs lost not surprisingly the hardest hit congressional districts those ranking in the top 20 districts in terms of jobs lost as a share of all jobs in the district included districts in california massachusetts minnesota oregon and texas where jobs in that industry are concentrated one district in georgia and two others in north carolina were also especially hard hit by trade related job displacement in a variety of manufacturing industries including computer and electronic parts textiles and apparel and furniture 1 340 600 jobs were lost in

steel aluminum and other capital intensive products threaten hundreds of thousands of jobs in key industries such as primary metals machinery and fabricated metal products as well these three sectors alone have already lost 372 700 jobs due to growing trade deficits with china between 2001 and 2018 in key industries such as primary metals machinery and fabricated metal products as well these three sectors alone have already lost 372 700 jobs due to growing trade deficits with china between 2001 and 2018 global trade in advanced technology products often discussed as a source of comparative advantage for the united states is instead dominated by china this broad category of high end technology products includes the more advanced elements of the computer and electronic parts industry as well as other sectors such as biotechnology life sciences aerospace and nuclear technology in 2018 the united states had a 134 6 billion trade deficit in advanced technology products with china and this deficit was responsible for 32 1 of the total u s china goods trade deficit that year in contrast the united states had a 6 5 billion trade surplus in advanced technology products with the rest of the world in 2018 the u s balance of trade in advanced technology products declined by 132 7 billion between 2001 and 2018 this broad category of high end technology products includes the more

is exporting goods to the u s through other countries although the bilateral trade deficit with china has declined in 2019 through november the overall u s trade deficit in non oil goods which is dominated by trade in manufactured and farm products has continued to increase as has china s overall balance of trade with the rest of the world suggesting that trade diversion chinese goods and parts and materials being used in products that the u s imports from other countries has grown in importance this is an important topic for future research growing trade deficits are also associated with wage losses not just for manufacturing workers but for all workers economywide who don t have a college degree between 2001 and 2011 alone growing trade deficits with china reduced the incomes of directly impacted workers by 37 billion per year and in 2011 alone growing competition with imports from china and other low wage countries reduced the wages of all u s non college graduates by a total of 180 billion most of that income was redistributed to corporations in the form of higher profits and to workers with college degrees at the very top of the income distribution through higher wages mind you this outcome should have been and was likely expected from a 2018 post forgive the length of this section but it s important to understand that economists knew full well that blue collar workers would be likely to take a hit from globalization and in an institute of new economic thinking panel last october berkeley economics professor brad delong explained how the ricardian fairy tale that is drummed into those who have some contact with economics is unrealistic and a more accurate view of liberalized trade shows it favors the rich in that case we cannot escape the conclusion that comparative advantage is the ideology of a market system that works for the interest of the wealthy for comparative advantage is the market economy on the international scale and the market economy is via the negishi weights that it assigns to the social welfare function that it actually maximizes is a collective human device for satisfying the wants of the well off and the well off are those who control the scarce resources that are useful for producing things for which the rich of the world have a serious jones pia malaney is co founder and director of the center for innovation growth and society cigs and senior economist at the institute for new economic thinking pointed out that serious economists understood the costs of more open trade even though they pretended not to specifically as most of you probably know the samuelson stopler theorem would give you good reason to expect that less educated workers in the us would take a hit with more open trade as harvard economics professor dani rodrik wrote in 2008 the stolper samuelson theorem is a remarkable theorem it says that in a world with two goods and two factors of production where specialization remains incomplete plus a few more technical assumptions one of the two factors the one that is scarce must end up worse off as a result of opening up to international trade not in relative terms but in absolute terms but the theorem is also quite limited in its applicability it applies only to a case with two goods and two factors and so its real world relevance is always in question but there is a version of the theorem that is remarkably general and powerful it says that regardless of the number of goods and factors at least one factor of production must experience a decline in real income from trade as long as trade induces the relative price of some domestically produced good s to fall and as long as the productivity benefits from trade are restricted to the traditional inter sectoral allocative efficiency improvements about which more later all that this result requires is a very mild assumption namely that goods be produced with varying factor intensities i e use different combination of factors the stark implication is that someone will lose even if the nation as a whole becomes richer the theorem does not identify who exactly will lose out the loser in question could be the wealthiest group in the land but if the good in question is highly intensive in unskilled labor there is a strong presumption that it is unskilled workers who will be worse off and before you curse economic theory note that this is really accounting not economics at all rodrik goes on to argue that this might not be as absolute as it seems since if manufacturers could increase total factor productivity in response to import competition they could afford to preserve or even increase worker wages even if the prices for their products fell but rodrik pointed out that analysis of firm level efficiency was pretty dodgy and you could see the same results by the virtue of the least efficient firms going out of business which would still hurt overall employment moreover as we pointed out back then companies were crimping on worker pay even before the crisis the early 2000s recovery saw labor get a markedly lower share of total income growth than in any post wwii expansion and the proportion going to profits versus compensation got even worse after the crisis so the bigger point is economists had very good reason to anticipate that more open trade would hurt the us working classes but they either pointed chose to ignore that or rationalized it in various ways at worst they d take a short term hit and would get a new job and might have to acquire some skills as if that were all that easy if you are supporting a family and or older and employers won t give you credit for training in later life back to the current post in other words the remedy to less skilled workers getting shafted has been various let them eat training handwaves of which the latest flavor has been why don t they learn to code but there is a bona fide problem even though globalization was a losing proposition for american labor those eggs were broken quite a while ago it s not clear how we unscramble that omelet particularly since the us pretends to be allergic to industrial policy in reality we have it in spades via certain sectors getting lots of subsidies tax breaks and or federal spending such as defense real estate big pharma and health care and higher education with the natives becoming more restless as epitomized by sanders rise in the polls the officialdom might finally be cluing in to the need to make more concessions to workers particularly as the coronavirus is throwing sand in the gears of chinese supply chains we ve pointed out for years that outsourcing and offshoring often don t improve profits but instead represent a transfer from factory level labor to middle managers and top executives and on top of that increases the fragility of the business if some critical products like drugs come to be scarce the us may finally have its long overdue big think on the dangers of depending on the kindness of foreigners

last year we introduced our team members to the grainger edge our new strategic framework that defines who we are why we exist and how we ll work together to achieve our objectives at grainger our purpose is to keep the world working whether that means helping a hospital focus on patient care a manufacturing plant focus on building great product or a school focus on teaching the work we do in the background helps keep facilities running so our customers can focus on what they do best it s a purpose that we are all very proud of as an organization the framework also outlines a set of principles that define the behaviors we expect from our team members working with each other our customers and our supplier partners we are holding ourselves accountable to these principles and believe they will help us execute our strategy and create value for our shareholders these are not just words on a page we are committed to making these principles come to life in everything that we do the grainger edge provides a foundational framework for our strategies we work to consistently serve our customers and gain share we gain share through two distinct business models that allow us to leverage our scale and supply chain to support customers with different needs our high touch solution model serves customers that have complex needs and are looking for more tailored solutions through this model we develop powerful customer solutions deliver a great customer experience and develop deep customer relationships this all starts with what we call advantaged mro solutions that means being able to get a customer the exact product they need to solve a problem quickly and it means understanding more about our products and customers than anyone in order to help them solve problems and to create value for our customers this takes the form of intuitive digital solutions segment specific solutions and value added services we then leverage these solutions to our talented sales and services teams to build deep customer relationships based on an exceptional customer experience our grainger us canada and mexico operations as well as our cromwell and fabory businesses fit within this model in our endless assortment model we provide less complex customers with an expansive product assortment and easy to use website this business is based on acquiring customers leveraging our simple and efficient customer experience to develop and maintain strong customer relationships our monotaro and zoro businesses fit within this model when we execute against these two models we consistently gain share we grow profitably and we deliver strong shareholder value that s our commitment flipping to slide 5 and before i jump into 2019 highlights i wanted to touch briefly on what we have done over the last few years to strengthen the business and to position grainger for success this work has ensured that both our high touch solution model and our endless assortment model had the capabilities to win in the marketplace most of you are familiar with the pricing reset of our us business back in 2017 this change has allowed us to grow with customer groups we ve been losing share with for years most notably midsize customers but beyond the pricing actions we have made important moves we have verticalized our sales force our customers today demand more expertise from our interactions and this change enables our sales teams to develop domain knowledge and deepen customer relationships we have added an inside sales group focused on high value midsize customers we have centralized our call centers to improve service and scale and help manage cost we have restructured our keepstock inventory management program and we now have begun expanding capabilities for our customers we have added capacity to our us supply chain we have made significant improvements to grainger com to make search easier for our customers and we ve done all this while realizing significant leverage on our cost structure these changes let us set the stage for what we accomplished in 2019 and will accomplish moving forward outside of the u s business we have reset the foundation for our canadian operations for what we believe will become a consistently profitable and growing business we have shed non core international businesses over the last few years and are now focusing our efforts on places where we can create a meaningful profitable and competitively advantaged position our attention and focus moving forward will be on our high touch solutions model primarily in north america as well as our growing endless assortment model we continue to evaluate our portfolio to ensure our time energy and investment is spent where we can add the most value for the long term our execution on these efforts over the last few years have laid a strong foundation for profitable growth for the new decade moving to slide 6 as you ve heard from our competitors suppliers and customers our market was certainly challenging in 2019 with market growth declining as the year progressed in the phase of these challenges the grainger team delivered solid results for the year mainly in line with the expectations we outlined back in january 2019 to be clear we aren t thrilled with the absolute performance in the year but it was solid on a comparable basis for the total company we drove 3 daily sales growth across the company on a constant currency basis from a profitability perspective we expanded total company operating margin by 10 basis points in 2019 driven by continued success in leveraging our sg a the team did a nice job managing spend in 2019 and we achieved our goal to minimize sg a growth to less than half the rate of our sales growth we expect to continue driving leverage as we prudently managed costs while also growing the business we generated over 1 billion of cash in 2019 and returned roughly the same amount to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends while the absolute numbers were decent in many ways 2019 was a strong year on the execution front that we believe sets us up well going forward in the us we outgrew the mro market by 150 basis points to 200 basis points in 2019 and our outperformance to the market gained momentum throughout the year we exited the fourth quarter growing about 300 basis points faster than the market this performance is driven by our ongoing investments in growth initiatives which support our strategy we remerchandised 1 2 billion of products in 2019 more than double any time in our history and we are on track to complete another 1 6 billion in 2020 these category reviews along with marketing activities are driving incremental revenue we ve been testing new strategies and are happy with the results thus far return on ad spend steadily increased over the course of the year we saw nice improvements in the focus of our sales and services team particularly around embedding grainger at our customers through keepstock and value added services we reenergized our large corporate account efforts and won some significant contracts in the second half our high touch offer is unmatched in the market we believe we will continue to gain share with these important strategic customers in our endless assortment model we grew revenue 19 in 2019 driven by strong growth at both monotaro and zoro we invested to enhance our zoro offering in 2019 including the addition of roughly 1 5 million skus to the assortment pushing the total sku count to about 3 5 million products we made significant enhancements to zoro s technology capabilities including the launch of a new product information system and a customer analytics platform allowing zoro to be less reliant on grainger s infrastructure we also improved our marketing capabilities in zoro which should help us gain share profitably moving forward in our grainger canada business we saw revenue stabilize and customer feedback improve significantly throughout 2019 we expect to return to growth in the business in the back half of 2020 and are confident the platform we have in canada will prove to be sustainable and profitable in the future even when our results were poor we made progress specifically our cromwell business in the uk had a very challenging financial year for context adjusted total company operating margin in 2019 would have been 12 7 without cromwell or a 60 basis point improvement further we took a non cash impairment charge in the fourth quarter to write off substantially all of the intangible assets including trade names and customer list that said the business made great strides in service and our customers are now talking about growing with cromwell moving forward we also took action in the fourth quarter to take gbp10 million of administration costs out of the business this team has great clarity and understands the urgency required to improve the performance of the business going forward so while 2019 was certainly challenging we are proud of the work we completed to position us for success moving forward turning to 2020 we plan to continue investing to support our strategy our expectation is that we will consistently outgrow the market including a target of 300 basis points to 400 basis points of outperformance in our core high touch business in the us historically we ve grown approximately 150 basis points faster than the market our actions and investments over the last several years provide confidence that we can grow at a more accelerated rate in 2020 we are focused on several initiatives to support that growth we will continue to work the work we began in 2019 to remerchandise our assortment to ensure we have the right products to serve the needs of our customers for 2020 this includes remerchandising 1 6 billion of product including selective sku additions to enhance our assortment we expect to continue to learn and improve upon the way we execute our marketing activities we learned a lot over the last couple of years including analytics focused evaluations around our investments in search and display radio catalog and direct marketing we expect improved share gain from both incremental marketing investments and from more effective marketing in 2020 we remain focused on bolstering our expertise in digital and technology solutions in order to serve a more sophisticated and tech enabled customer base we recently went live with the first version of our new product information system and have made great improvements with our customer information both support our merchandising and marketing efforts we will invest to enhance our customer experience and strengthen our world class customer service backbone through network capacity and utilization investments with our louisville dc coming online soon we are at a point where focused investments in dc capacity will add significant service benefits without as much capital outlays we ve seen in the recent past we re also planning to selectively add sellers to be more relevant in certain segments and geographies and we will equip our sales organization with the right tool set to ensure they can serve our customers most effectively we have developed improved processes with large multi site customers and continue to be aggressive in helping these customers consolidate with grainger we will continue to embed our solutions with our more complex customers through our inventory management offerings finally we remain committed to the ongoing turnaround efforts in canada and with our cromwell business in the uk in canada the business was slightly profitable in 2019 and as tom will explain we expect to roughly break even again in 2020 this business is now structured to run as an extension of our core us operations this will help us make the needed strides to return the business to meaningful profitability over the course of the next couple of years by demonstrating a consistent uptick in revenue and margins for cromwell i mentioned our struggles in 2019 this is a business that is at a crossroads right now we need to start seeing progress over the next 12 to 18 months to assess whether the business can run profitably we ve made great improvements in service which are expected to translate into revenue and profitability our team will be evaluating this closely in 2020 successful execution of these initiatives will position us to consistently and profitably outperform the market in 2020 and beyond now let s talk about our endless assortment business first and foremost we are pleased to have announced earlier this morning that masaya suzuki the current ceo of monotaro will now lead the combined endless assortment business across grainger i am personally very excited about this masaya was part of the founding team at monotaro and has been instrumental in the tremendously profitable growth of this business since we first launched 20 years ago he has also played a critical role in the launch of zoro in 2011 under masaya s leadership we expect to continue the strong growth and profitability of our endless assortment businesses in the us we plan to accelerate zoro s adoption of the monotaro playbook in order to capture growth and implement best practices specifically we plan to continue to rapidly expand zoro s assortment beyond the 130 billion industrial mro market this will allow us to tap into markets and customers that aren t served through other grainger channels our goal is to have 10 million skus in the zoro portfolio in the next three to five years utilizing third party suppliers with direct fulfillment capabilities this has worked well for monotaro which has 20 million skus and we are confident it will work for zoro as well we re also continuing to develop and improve our marketing and customer segmentation tools at zoro we made most of these investments in 2019 and expect to start to see the results here in 2020 for zoro uk we will continue to leverage the cromwell supply chain and execute our strategy to grow the business and drive profitability these efforts include expanding assortments enhancing website functionality and launching effective marketing and customer acquisition campaigns to create a vibrant marketplace the zoro uk business continues to grow very quickly and the economics of this business look to be quite attractive we expect this business to be profitable in 2021 and for monotaro masaya and his team will continue to execute their successful growth strategy including additions to the assortment and network enhancements to improve reliability and speed this business has produced impressive and profitable growth year in and year out and we expect that to continue our endless assortment business has been a great asset for grainger and we see the opportunity for tremendous growth moving forward with that i ll turn it over to tom for detail on our 2019 performance and 2020 guidance thomas b okray senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks d g i ll start with a recap of our 2019 total company adjusted results then move forward to the fourth quarter results by segment overall we are pleased with our 2019 performance despite a challenging environment sales were up 3 on a constant currency basis driven by 2 5 from volume and price favorability of 0 5 fx had a negative 0 5 impact it should be noted that our core us and endless assortment business combined grew at 5 in the full year consistent with our guide our gross profit margin was down 50 basis points versus the prior year the decline was primarily driven by our lower margin endless assortment business which is growing at a faster rate than the rest of the company contributing to the decline both monotaro and zoro had lower gross margin monotaro faced freight headwinds in japan and zoro s lower gross margin was driven by unfavorable product mix and promotional activities elsewhere slightly lower gross profit margins in the us were offset by higher gross margins in canada driven by supply chain favorability despite meaningful investments in advertising technology and zoro we drove sg a leverage driven by continued cost management actions sg a as a percentage of sales improved 60 basis points year over year as our sg a spend remained flat to 2018 as a result total company operating margin for the year increased 10 basis points with a 20 basis point improvement in the us incremental margin for the total company was 17 aided by 22 us incremental margin we generated operating cash flow of over 1 billion which we used to invest in the business and return capital to shareholders returning north of 1 billion through dividends and share repurchases we did this while maintaining a debt to adjusted ebitda ratio of 1 4 times operating cash flow was 116 of net earnings our return on invested capital was 29 3 or 80 basis points favorable to the prior year all in considering the choppy market we are pleased with the results looking at the quarter daily sales increased 3 including 3 5 from volume partially offset by 0 5 unfavorable price gross profit margin for the quarter was down 50 basis points due to business unit mix as well as mix shift headwinds within our large customer group in the us these impacts were partially offset by favorable supply chain improvements in canada sg a cost increased 3 but slightly less than sales growth driven by marketing and technology spend in the us segment and investments to support zoro s growth we could have dialed back spend in the quarter to achieve a better short term profitability outcome but we are focused on driving sustainable value over the long term and continued investment in the business supports this effort operating margin declined 40 basis points in the quarter as sg a leverage was more than offset by the decline in gross profit margin versus the prior year earnings per share decreased 2 in the quarter due to a higher tax rate as we lap the prior year benefit from our clean energy investments looking at our performance in the us i ll start with sales for our large and midsize customers the us mro market in line with macroeconomic indicators declined throughout the year we estimate that the us mro market was flat to down 1 in the fourth quarter and was up 0 5 to 1 for the full year in the fourth quarter our us large customer business grew 3 or 350 basis points faster than the market outperformance to the market for our large customers accelerated sequentially as our growth initiatives began to take hold our us midsize customer business grew 5 or approximately 550 basis points faster than the market it s important to note that our growth with these two customer groups remained stable despite slower market conditions in the quarter overall us segment daily sales grew 2 5 in the quarter or about 300 basis points faster than the market sales growth in the quarter included 3 from volume partially offset by unfavorable price of 1 inter company sales provided a 0 5 positive impact in the quarter as noted in our last call balancing market based pricing with cost inflation and share gain led to a choppy result choppy price result throughout the year having said that we finished the full year with favorable price of 0 5 while gross profit margin was up 50 basis points sequentially we were down 100 basis points year over year driven by a few factors including the growth of inter company sales and lower margins the lapping of prior year supplier rebates and a mix shift within our large customer subgroup we ve gotten more aggressive in helping large multi site customers consolidate spend with grainger this includes pursuing new customers where we won a few significant contracts in the second half of 2019 as well as deepening and broadening relationships with our current customers this large customer growth can create a drag on gross margins in the short to medium term while we demonstrate our value proposition and expand share of wallet with these customers however this is absolutely the right strategy to drive long term profitable growth as we add and expand customer relationships we are gaining share and more deeply embedding grainger into what our customers do each and every day given the lumpiness of our pricing actions in 2019 we think looking at gross margin on the full year is more meaningful in this regard our full year margins were down 30 basis points reflecting the remaining impact of contract renegotiations and large customer mix headwinds ultimately we remain confident in our ability to pass along inflationary cost increases sg a costs were flat on 2 sales growth and was favorable 60 basis points to the prior year operating margin declined 40 basis points in the quarter as the decline in gross profit margin was only partially offset by strong sg a leverage looking at op margin for the full year the us segment operating margin was 15 8 which is in line with the guidance we set in january of last year and represents an expansion of 20 basis points moving on to other businesses daily sales increased 9 5 including 7 5 from volume and 2 from favorable fx growth was driven by continued expansion of our endless assortment business which is up a combined 18 between zoro and monotaro gross profit margin declined 10 basis points in the quarter driven by negative mix resulting from faster growth in endless assortment operating margin declined 140 basis points driven primarily by investments in zoro and performance at cromwell cromwell generated an operating loss of 35 million for the full year further while not reflected in our adjusted results we took an impairment charge in the quarter to write off substantially all of the remaining intangible assets in our cromwell business turning to slide 16 daily sales decreased 11 5 including 10 related to volume decline and 1 5 related to unfavorable price price was driven by discounts and mix as we began to win back large customer business as we finished the year daily sales stabilized and we are beginning to see volume growth from new and existing customers gross profit margin increased 595 basis points over the prior year primarily driven by supply chain efficiencies while a sizable portion of this benefit is non recurring we expect some benefit will continue moving forward sg a dollars were 10 lower than prior year but the rate was unfavorable 50 basis points due to volume operating margin increased 545 basis points over the prior year driven by the increase in gross margin now let s take a look at 2020 guidance consistent with last year we will provide guidance at the beginning of the year and only plan to make updates if we expect results to fall materially outside the guided range with that we expect to deliver another year of solid growth for the company in 2020 as we execute upon our growth priorities and continue to support our customers for the total company we expect top line growth of 3 5 to 6 5 driven by outperformance to the market in the us and continued expansion of our endless assortment business in the us we expect the mro market will remain consistent with where we exited 2019 hovering around flat to slightly negative even with this static market we remain confident that our industry know how deep customer relationships and scale coupled with our growth priorities position us to continue to capture share for 2020 we expect to outgrow the broader mro market by approximately 300 basis points this is a step toward our stated long term target to consistently achieve 300 basis points to 400 basis points of outgrowth each and every year we expect to continue growing our endless assortment business at around 20 in 2020 as the monotaro team delivers consistently strong results and as we rapidly add skus and leverage our 2019 investments at zoro from a profitability perspective total company gross profit margin is expected to be down roughly 110 basis points to 50 basis points in 2020 this is driven by business unit mix with the higher growth of our lower margin endless assortment business as well as mixed headwinds within our us large multi site customer subgroup as we focus on consolidating mro spend for large corporate customers as it relates to price our intention is to remain market competitive while growing share and offsetting cost inflation having said that price is difficult to predict given the muted and uncertain economic environment we will stay nimble as it relates to tariffs our guidance assumes a status quo environment any changes will be evaluated if and when they occur total company operating margins are expected to remain consistent at the midpoint as we anticipate significant sg a leverage as we grow the top line while remaining prudent on cost these top line and profitability targets as well as continued execution of our share repurchase program are expected to produce earnings per share of 17 75 to 19 25 or 3 to 11 growth from a quarterly timing perspective we do anticipate that both top and bottom line performance will improve in the back half of the year as our growth priorities take hold and we lap tougher comps at the gp level in the first half recall that we increased prices in q1 2019 which were subsequently dialed back in the second and third quarters in addition the full impact of tariff cost increases were not realized until later in 2019 continuing with guidance on slide 20 at a segment level we expect operating profit margins in each of our business units to remain relatively stable in the us operating margin is expected to be between 15 6 to 16 with the midpoint in line with 2019 performance as discussed gross profit margins in the us are facing headwinds primarily related to our pursuit of large customer contracts to help grow share and deepen relationships in this choppy market environment we expect these gp headwinds will be offset by continued sg a leverage for other businesses we expect 4 to 6 operating margin after a year of significant investments in our endless assortment model and lower than expected results at cromwell we expect our actions in 2019 to produce improved 2020 results as we have discussed throughout 2019 we expect operating margin at zoro will trend favorably in 2020 and return to mid single digit profitability by 2021 in canada we expect to roughly break even again in 2020 as revenue growth builds sequentially in response to our improved service level and profitability begins to reflect our cost base reset as noted earlier we will lap some non recurring supply chain efficiencies in the fourth quarter which will be a headwind to operating margins in the new year from a cash flow perspective we expect operating cash flow to be between 1 1 billion and 1 2 billion we plan capital expenditures of about 250 million the large majority of investment this year will center around our us segment and endless assortment business in order to continue our growth in these areas we expect the balance of our cash to be used to fund our quarterly dividend and continue executing against our share repurchase authorization for 2020 we are expecting between 600 million to 700 million of repurchases which continues to reflect our confidence to successfully execute our strategy and growth priorities with that i will turn it back to d g for closing remarks d g macpherson chairman and chief executive officer thanks tom as i look forward to 2020 and beyond i m excited about the opportunities that we have in front of us and i want to thank the grainger team for their hard work and dedication we are well positioned to continue to gain share in the us to continue to drive 20 growth profitably in the endless assortment model and to improve the rest of our portfolio i m confident in our ability to drive long term value for all stakeholders and i m confident that we re going to continue to extend our lead in the industry so with that i will open it up for questions questions and answers operator our first question comes from ryan merkel with william blair please state your question ryan merkel william blair company llc analyst hey thanks so first off i m a little surprised by the 2020 gross margin guide down about 80 basis points at the midpoint i have thought that after the price reset you were thinking that gross margins would start to stabilize so i m trying to figure out for 2020 is the big change the focus on the large account or what s really changing thomas b okray senior vice president and chief financial officer well ryan there s really two things happening one it s just the algebra of our endless assortment business unit getting much larger and growing at 20 and the gross profit profile that that business has so that s a very big portion of it which is getting bigger obviously and then one of our key growth initiatives is going after the large customers and maybe just to unpack that with a little example right now we ve been heavily focused on a location by location basis as we ve stated as part of our growth initiatives we re working more with the c suite to try to get a broader range of locations in terms of going after a bigger piece of the company s pie and with that initially you ll have to do some sort of writedown usually to gross margin as it relates to product mix as it relates to your offer but then over time there s plenty of levers to increase that gross margin whether it d be with product substitution standardization reducing overall buy so we re confident over time that we will improve the gross margin with those customers but for 2020 we re being prudent in putting that in the guide ryan merkel william blair company llc analyst okay it makes sense i guess for my follow up sort of related i m thinking about the long term growth algorithm and so maybe you can help us should we be assuming that gross margins are down sort of 50 basis points 60 basis points structurally because of this mix but then you offset that with sg a so should we think about ebit growth equaling sales growth and then if you do better than mid single digits you probably do ebit growth a little bit better is that about right d g macpherson chairman and chief executive officer so ryan i guess this is d g so in the us business let s start there our assumption is that we gain share 300 basis points to 400 basis points faster than the markets so if the market grows 2 through recycle we d be at 5 to 6 at that so what you see this coming year is a projection of market down 0 5 at that you see operating margins flat for the us business year over year so 2 5 growth flat operating margins at 5 through cycle we d expect to get a little more leverage than the slight pressure on gp over time and see some expanding margins in the us so i think it s a good this is a good sort of guide on the economics of the business at 2 2 5 3 you re probably flat on operating margin in the us if you get more growth then you re probably positive operator thank you our next question comes from david manthey with baird please state your question david manthey robert w baird analyst hi good morning everyone first question when i look at slide 5 you clearly made many meaningful upgrades here and i m trying to figure out how many of these were defensive versus offensive in nature and essentially how will we measure the success of all of these changes over the next three to five years it looks like maybe a little bit of sales outgrowth but are there other metrics you ll be tracking to see the success of these initiatives d g macpherson chairman and chief executive officer well i think these are to be clear these initiatives on the left hand side in the us are mostly rearview mirror initiatives in the sense that centralizing the call centers has gotten us improve service and lower costs and we expect to continue to get lower cost so that s one that you ll see in the sg a line if i looked at our order to cash process and customer feedback in the us right now it is at an all time high it got better this year significantly relative to the competition so some of these moves have been around continue to improve service and you see that in supply chain capacity verticalizing the sales force we think you re going to see in terms of part contributing to that 300 basis points to 400 basis point growth faster than the market and so it s a mix a lot of these are have been done already when we go forward we re going to start talking about some of the initiatives that are on page 7 remerchandising the assortment i mentioned we remerchandised 1 2 billion this last year that s far more than we ve ever done in a single year we ll do 1 6 billion this year we see that directly leading to sales growth and we measure that very tightly marketing both effectiveness of marketing and increased marketing budget we measure that very very tightly we know how much that contributes to growth the large customer initiatives that tom talked about we know how much that s leading to growth and what impact that has so we are tracking everything we wanted to put page 5 together to say there s been a lot of change in the business and we feel like we re in a good position to really drive the growth initiatives we re talking about david manthey robert w baird analyst okay yeah that makes sense as a follow up then and you partially answered this in your answer to the last question over the last couple of years you ve clearly grown sg a at a rate slower than sales growth or even gross profit dollar growth and your guidance seems to imply more of the same in line with your targets as a distributor there is obviously inherent inflation in some of the areas of your cost stack can you talk about the other major areas of expenses that you re keeping flat or reducing in order to keep sg a in check so well in this lackluster environment i m just looking for the big two or three buckets that you think are really the drivers of that performance d g macpherson chairman and chief executive officer yeah so if you look at the cost structure and i ll focus on the us gain there s there are some big buckets of cost where our expectation is that we will get productivity on a consistent basis so in our distribution centers we continue to automate we continue to get process improvements to drive dollars cost per line down in our contact centers we continue to get productivity we continue to productivity in sales force through revenue per seller increases our expectation is that the cost increases that you talk about will be covered by productivity in those areas and we basically have developed a process and an expectation and a philosophy that we will continue to drive productivity in each of those areas mostly through continuous improvement that basically offset those cost increases david manthey robert w baird analyst all right appreciate it thanks d g d g macpherson chairman and chief executive officer thanks dave operator thank you our next question comes from deane dray with rbc capital markets please state your question deane dray rbc capital markets analyst thank you good morning everyone d g macpherson chairman and chief executive officer good morning deane dray rbc capital markets analyst hey i just upfront want to say i appreciate your level of clarity and context in describing some of the changes here on gross margin that s really helpful and just to clarify in tom s answer when you talk about the mix shift to large customers that you ll sacrifice over the short and medium term the gross margin but once you build share with these customers longer term you re better positioned for profitable growth what s the time frame on this i know you say longer term but are we talking multiple years i don t think you mean it takes that long because if you re moving to standardization ok so just share with us more of the timing of this because it does make sense i just the short term long term seems a little vague thomas b okray senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah first of all you ve got to remember that we ve got a ton of customers so this initiative is in various stages of development by individual customers so it s not like you snap the chalk line and you start everything at one time so when we re talking about short to medium term we re certainly talking about lot of it will happen within 2021 time frame it s really building the trust embedding with the different large customers so we can rich in mix so we can have products to substitution so we can have standardization those types of things so i guess we would look at this as a transition year from 2020 for this initiative d g macpherson chairman and chief executive officer and deane i guess i would add that when we look at large customers we track what we call economic earnings which is a more sort of holistic view of the profitability of customers and our goal is to make sure that we drive growth and profitable growth through that metric as opposed to just gross profit so at times we will take gross profit hit in the short term if we re improving the cost structure elsewhere to provide the ability to consolidate customers and provide value for those customers thomas b okray senior vice president and chief financial officer i think another thing important part to note is these are really large multi site customers so this is really hitting home runs versus hitting singles and doubles so this is a very attractive business to get and just launching off of d g s comments we can lever our sg a at about 2 5 growth so we can afford to take the time to develop these very important customers deane dray rbc capital markets analyst great and then just on a follow up could you put this negative price in context because what we re hearing elsewhere in the industrial distributors is that not only are there some of it is delays in getting supplier price increases through but there is heightened competition within the distributors how much of that is at play in the negative price that we re seeing thomas b okray senior vice president and chief financial officer i think the important thing when you talk about price is to look at it on a full year basis as we said in our prepared remarks our pricing was very lumpy you ll recall from previous calls we were quite aggressive in q1 and then we dialed that back in q2 and q3 we made a conscious decision not to raise price in the back half of the year as to not be disruptive to our customers when you look at it on an entire basis of the full year our price cost was roughly neutral and we re happy with that operator thank you our next question comes from christopher glynn with oppenheimer please state your question christopher glynn oppenheimer company analyst thanks good morning and just kind of following up on deane s question is there any defensive component to how are pricing with the large customers or is that really all emanating from your tactical execution by customer just for share independent of market dynamics thomas b okray senior vice president and chief financial officer i guess there s always some tactical but i would say the majority is the latter some of it s product mix within a given customer some of it s customer specific mix d g macpherson chairman and chief executive officer i guess chris i think maybe your question underneath the question is has the competitive environment heightened with large customers i think it s always been competitive and we will always be in a situation where we have to be effective in navigating that competitive environment it doesn t feel like it s changed dramatically but certainly it s competitive christopher glynn oppenheimer company analyst okay and then also i think you talked about how it kind of phases in by customer did you suggest that this would be a 2021 process and then you might open up some gross margin headroom after 2021 thomas b okray senior vice president and chief financial officer it s difficult enough to predict 2020 to try to predict 2021 ideally 2021 we would get back to a more a lesser decline in gross margin on a year over year basis d g macpherson chairman and chief executive officer i would say chris that we have a lot of confidence in the value proposition that we have our service is exceptional our customers want to do business with us over time we think that we should be in a position to get price as much as anybody and to be able to continue to have very strong operating margins with our customers so we are confident in what we are doing in the short term with trade and with the environment it s been a little bit lumpy clearly but we re pretty confident in the long term ability to improve our margin christopher glynn oppenheimer company analyst yeah i appreciate the offense component of it thank you operator our next question comes from patrick baumann with j p morgan please state your question patrick baumann j p morgan analyst well thanks good morning d g good morning tom maybe just start off on the midsize versus large customers just wondering into next year i guess this year in 2020 if you d expect midsize customers to still outpace large or does that flip with some of the share gain initiatives you ve been talking about for large and then somewhat related to that you described us outgrowth in the quarter as 300 basis points and then you said large was 350 basis points and midsize was 550 basis points so i m just wondering what dragged down the total segment thomas b okray senior vice president and chief financial officer sure taking the first part of the question first yes definitely we would expect medium customers to grow faster than large i guess the way we look at it is large at about 300 bps faster than the market midsize about 500 bps faster than the market on the low end as it relates to the chart that shows large and midsize there is a service revenue component that is included in the those charts for large and medium not to get too technical on you but that is a very important part of our business that is really embedding with the customer on the us segment that is reflected on a net basis meaning we adjust cost out so that s the difference between the two numbers where you re always going to have large and medium be higher than the us segment patrick baumann j p morgan analyst okay i d like to follow up on that after just one more for me just if you could talk about the path forward at cromwell and what s embedded in your other businesses guidance there in terms of losses for 2020 and then on the same topic for other businesses the magnitude of zoro investments made in 2019 and whether you still expect most of that spending to fall off in 2020 d g macpherson chairman and chief executive officer yeah so let me focus on zoro and cromwell which i think other than zoro and cromwell we expect continued improvement in the businesses and we see a nice path cromwell we would expect this year to cut the losses roughly in half for this year that s our expectation and i would say there s a couple of things going at cromwell one is certainly the market has not been great and a portion of it has been related to that a lot of it has been some service issues we had that we have completely worked through we are hearing much better things from the marketplace our net promoter score has gone from not very good to quite good actually and the team is pretty excited about what we re doing we have a new team over there we re comfortable with the actions that they re taking cromwell is interesting if you remember why we bought cromwell it was as a platform for the online business and because we thought it was a good business zoro uk is actually doing quite well and we would expect it to be profitable in 2021 so really by the end of the year we should have a view as to whether or not both of those businesses can be successful and profitable and that s when we ll really sort of evaluate what we think we need to do as i mentioned in the prepared remarks we have taken a bunch of cost out of that business we have seen great service improvement we have won a few contracts with customers recently that gives us some confidence that things are coming back but it s still a steep climb to get better the investments in zoro most a lot of those investments start to come off this year we made significant investments in the fourth quarter some systems investments that had a few glitches but we are through them we expect improvement this year and then significant improvement again in 2021 with that business and as i mentioned we re excited to have masaya suzuki lead that business he has been through this at the same point with monotaro and really feel like he is going to help that business accelerate performance going forward patrick baumann j p morgan analyst thanks a lot thomas b okray senior vice president and chief financial officer there is no reason we can t see the margin profile longer term for zoro will be consistent with monotaro operator thank you our next question comes from adam uhlman with cleveland research company please state your question adam uhlman cleveland research company analyst hey guys good morning hey tom i guess could you expand a little bit more about your comments earlier about the cadence of earnings for the year i m just wondering the fourth quarter costs for zoro were higher than expected does that carry into the first quarter here as things were ironed out and then are there other moving pieces we should keep in mind like the customer show other investment spending for louisville i m just trying to get a sense of should we be bracing for larger earnings declines in the first quarter and into the second and then recover in the second half of the year thomas b okray senior vice president and chief financial officer well if you re talking specifically about sg a i ll go back to d g s answer on zoro 2019 was an investment year for zoro where we spent heavily in sg a related to adding people technology and advertising that will be reduced significantly beginning in q1 so that will be a material impact the way i would think about sg a is the way we ve talked about it we plan on growing sg a at half the rate of sales we ll continue with the productivity that d g talked about in a previous answer as it relates to gross profit we see no difference than our normal seasonality we expect q1 to be greater gross margin than q4 of this year and then we expect it to decline throughout the year with q4 being a relative uptick to q3 does that get at your question adam uhlman cleveland research company analyst yeah that helps and then secondly could you expand a little bit more about what you guys are seeing in the near term from a customer spending and general environment perspective it looked like most of the end markets or the sales growth by end market was relatively similar to last quarter i guess did anything stand out to you as notable and then as we think about the investments that are being made into the sales force and the verticalization efforts from this past year are there any vertical markets that we should look to see accelerating growth next year as evidence of a paying off on those investments d g macpherson chairman and chief executive officer yeah adam so what i would say is that we are privileged to see a very wide swath of the economy with our customers we have not seen much change over the last eight months really i would say we continue to see a market that is slow growth but not trailing off and anything worse at this point and the customer end market results that we ve seen in the last two quarters our expectation is that they won t be dissimilar to start the year and that they re likely to get a little better as the year goes along that would be our expectation at this point not much better a little bit better as the year goes along so i don t we don t see anything all that unusual in our end markets right now we haven t over the last couple of quarters adam uhlman cleveland research company analyst okay thanks operator our next question comes from chris dankert with longbow research please state your question chris dankert longbow research analyst one question from me thanks so much for the update on large customer approach kind of swinging for the fences on volume there i guess if you could give a brief update on kind of the medium customer strategy there is still some concern about this being more price competitive piece of the business just how are you balancing digital versus high touch and what does the go to market look like in medium customer in 2020 here d g macpherson chairman and chief executive officer yeah so midsize customers are actually less price sensitive and we continue to see much higher margins with midsize customers we re trying to build the growth so that can become a more meaningful portion of portfolio we continue to see the ability under the grainger brand to acquire new customers we continue to see growth with our existing customers through our inside sales team and through fairly simple pricing actions our service model really sings to midsize customers we continue to get very loyal customers in through the funnel we re digital first in the sense that most of our midsize customer acquisition comes through a digital first touch and then we do a lot of work to understand who the customer is what the profile is and move them through the cycle in some cases to get them to comforts that makes sense for them that has proven to be fairly successful and we as tom said we expect to continue to grow faster with midsize customers at higher gross profit than we will with large chris dankert longbow research analyst got it i guess just one sort of follow up on that the 400 basis points to 500 basis points of above market in medium customer anything that helps us get our arms around what informs that or why that s kind of sustainable longer term d g macpherson chairman and chief executive officer well i think the most obvious is we lost a lot of that business if you remember we were kind of 1 6 billion in that business went down to 800 something million something and now we re up over 1 billion again there is a lot of customers that we continue to reengage and a lot of our marketing efforts are proving to be very successful with these customers and once we get customers back and they realize that we are not that we re reasonably priced very high service solution they are coming back and working with grainger again chris dankert longbow research analyst yeah thanks so much for the color guys d g macpherson chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from john inch with gordon haskett please state your question karen lau gordon haskett analyst hi good morning this is karen lau dialing in for john thanks for taking the question so d g i think in the past two years you had mentioned that given after the price reset pricing pressure from large accounts has kind of diminished because your prices are more competitive it sounded like that is maybe changing a little bit into 2020 obviously there is the defense versus often components but the whole thing is now a little reminiscent of what happened before you did the pricing reset so my question is can you compare the customers behavior today versus and how they were three years ago and then compare your ability to respond to that versus three years ago before the pricing reset d g macpherson chairman and chief executive officer yeah so i don t think the situation is at all analogous back then we were losing share dramatically with higher margin customers we are not doing that now large customer business even back then was very competitive most of it was on custom pricing contracts that is still the same today the large customer pricing the advantage we got through the price change was that some of the tail spend was easier to get large customers to sign up for because if they weren t buying this frequently then our prices then made sense that is still the case we have simpler pricing discussions with our customers now they are still competitive they were competitive back then they are still competitive now karen lau gordon haskett analyst okay maybe looking at it at sort of a different angle so midsize obviously has been a focus in the past two years and has been very successful for you guys i guess the shift to large accounts and i guess de facto that s kind of de emphasizing midsize account a little bit is it just a function of you have been very successful and done what you could do with those accounts so it s hard to do more to further accelerate the outgrowth in that market how are you thinking about that d g macpherson chairman and chief executive officer i would say we are not de emphasizing midsize customers at all we still think they will grow faster than large we are making sure that we are competitive with our large customers and that s important obviously given the size of that customer group for us that is a bigger lever on growth at this point and so we need to make sure that we are growing with both but we are not emphasizing anything we still think there s a long runway ahead for midsize customer operator thank you our next question comes from robert barry with buckingham research please state your question robert barry buckingham research group analyst hey everyone good morning d g macpherson chairman and chief executive officer good morning robert robert barry buckingham research group analyst good morning good afternoon here from the east coast yeah just a few follow ups actually it looks like price is assumed neutral in the guide is that right thomas b okray senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah basically we re looking at price cost to be relatively neutral as we said in the prepared remarks we ve got the three variables that we re trying to balance share growth market competitiveness in terms of pricing as well as passing on inflationary cost similar to this year we re going to balance those three and we think we will end up somewhere flattish from a price cost perspective robert barry buckingham research group analyst got it and i think when you first did the price reset the goal was to narrow what had become a very large premium to market but to still maintained some modest premium to go to market as the premium provider and to price that way is that still true or it almost sounds like kind of alluding to the earlier question that maybe you are getting a little more aggressive more happy to err actually on the side of under versus over pricing the market d g macpherson chairman and chief executive officer we still have a premium with our list prices we will continue to do that it s a modest premium and we ll continue to have that and then i think the comment earlier was when you re going after large contracts on a portion of the volume you can get pretty aggressive and we ve always done that and we just have to continue to do that robert barry buckingham research group analyst got it thomas b okray senior vice president and chief financial officer i think you re making too much about price as it relates to large customers versus just a normal business dynamic where you re going from individual locations to a much bigger piece of the total company that s just there s going to be part of as d g says that you re going to have a certain part of the offer that s going to be priced aggressively to get your foot in the door robert barry buckingham research group analyst got it and just lastly tom on the gross margin cadence through the year i understand in absolute terms higher in 1q and then down through the year but had you alluded earlier to the year over year decline in gross margin being larger in 1q and then moderating as the year progressed or did i miss to hear that thomas b okray senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah no you heard it correctly the front half of the year is definitely going to be a larger year over year decline than the back half and that just is a lapping consideration where again we were heavy on price at the beginning of the year in 2019 the cost didn t kick in until the back half of the year so yeah that s the correct way to model operator thank you our next question comes from hamzah mazari with jefferies please state your question mario cortellacci jefferies analyst hi this is mario cortellacci filling in for hamzah i know you guys already touched on the zoro business and the roll off of the investments and just curious i guess as margins build in that business do you think that you ll break out zoro and monotaro as a separate segment some could argue that your multiple doesn t really represent that business at all given where other online marketplace assets trade at d g macpherson chairman and chief executive officer what i would say is that with masaya now running this we think we have a couple of years of real hard work to make sure that we are performing on a path like the monotaro business has been in the us and in the uk that s our entire attention on we are fully aware of the question but right now we re really focused on making sure we get the business to be as successful as possible thomas b okray senior vice president and chief financial officer and as it relates to reportable segments obviously will follow all sec regulations in terms of doing that mario cortellacci jefferies analyst got you okay and then just one quick follow up i think your working capital has been a cash flow drag in 2018 and 2019 i just want to know what your assumptions were for 2020 and maybe just a little color on the reason for the headwind is it mostly the endless assortment portion thomas b okray senior vice president and chief financial officer no you rightly point out that it has been a little bit of a drag in 18 and 19 i would be disappointed if it didn t become more of a tailwind in 2020 mario cortellacci jefferies analyst great thank you so much thomas b okray senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator our next question comes from michael mcginn with wells fargo please state your question michael mcginn wells fargo securities analyst thanks if i could lean in on the zoro and monotaro discussion as your model continues to shift more toward a reseller base what does the business look like today in terms of sourcing and along those lines what kind of ballpark service fee are you targeting relative to similar bdc e commerce peers is it something similar like alibaba in europe around mid single digits or higher something like amazon is charging d g macpherson chairman and chief executive officer sorry could you i m not sure i fully understand the question so let me just tell you what we re doing and maybe that will help you help me answer it we are not creating a marketplace a la alibaba or a la amazon we actually will have supplier relationships that we have some of them direct ship to customers for zoro that s what we ve done with monotaro and so the gps tend to be slightly less there but not dramatically less when you do that because we don t have big package ship but it s not like it s a fee that s all we re getting so i think it s a different model than you re describing thomas b okray senior vice president and chief financial officer and it s definitely a win win for the suppliers that are drop shipping and certainly for us michael mcginn wells fargo securities analyst okay asked a different way is monotaro currently getting a service fee from zoro and does that go up over time as the business expands thomas b okray senior vice president and chief financial officer okay that s a different question yes there is a variable service fee that zoro does pay to monotaro and it s based on their profitability michael mcginn wells fargo securities analyst sorry it s based on zoro s profitability thomas b okray senior vice president and chief financial officer yes michael mcginn wells fargo securities analyst okay and what is that currently and what do you expect that to trend to as you build to 10 million skus thomas b okray senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah i m not going to go into those types of details d g macpherson chairman and chief executive officer it will get bigger as they re successful it will get bigger because it s based on profitability michael mcginn wells fargo securities analyst all right d g macpherson chairman and chief executive officer it s a very small portion operator thank you our next question comes from justin bergner with gabelli company please state your question justin bergner gabelli company analyst good morning d g good morning tom d g macpherson chairman and chief executive officer good morning thomas b okray senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning justin bergner gabelli company analyst two quick ones here most have been answered with respect to the canadian gross margin improvement is that sustainable or was there anything sort of onetime that benefited the fourth quarter thomas b okray senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah as we said in our prepared remarks some of that was related to supply chain efficiencies i guess if i were to score it roughly i d say half of it will continue half of it will fall off justin bergner gabelli company analyst okay that s helpful and then the retail customer segment improved dramatically in the quarter i guess to mid teens growth just curious if that s sort of idiosyncratic or if there s initiatives there some underlying backdrop that s favorable d g macpherson chairman and chief executive officer just to be clear retail for us typically does not mean retail stores it means warehouses attached to retail and as you would guess that has continued to be a growing business in the us as more stuff shows up at your door so that s what s driving that growth that is a growing segment justin bergner gabelli company analyst okay thanks so much d g macpherson chairman and chief executive officer thank you thomas b okray senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you d g macpherson chairman and chief executive officer all right thanks i appreciate everybody being on the call i would just reiterate we are really confident in our path we feel good about share gain and profitability in the us we feel really good about the online model excited to have masaya lead that and drive strong growth and profitability there and we will get canada and cromwell right but generally i would say we re very excited about where we re going and i appreciate you listening to the call today thanks operator duration 68 minutes call participants irene holman vice president investor relations d g

in marsh mclennan and while we still have work to do we feel good about how the cultures are coming together nearly all our teams are now sitting together and more and more we are in the market working as one we finished the year with revenue of 16 7 billion up 11 this represents our highest annual top line growth in 20 years and is a step change for us on a run rate basis we now have over 17 billion of annual revenue we had an excellent year and are pleased that in the midst of the integration we generated underlying growth of 4 the tenth year in a row where our underlying growth was in the 3 to 5 range 14 adjusted noi growth 110 basis points of adjusted margin expansion and 7 adjusted eps growth consistent with our guidance of modest dilution in the first year of the deal we met our capital management objectives to reduce our share count and increase our dividend by double digits and we are running ahead of schedule on acquisition related cost savings we now expect run rate savings of at least 350 million and we will continue to drive for additional operating efficiencies overall i am pleased with our performance in 2019 we consistently challenge ourselves to balance

and analytics we see further opportunities to leverage technology to expand in small commercial as well as streamline and automate our business we also see increasing opportunity to leverage the collective strength expertise and relationships across our businesses to deliver enhanced value to clients and drive growth lastly 2019 saw the seamless transition of leadership at mercer with martine taking over as ceo martine moved quickly to install new leadership in key areas energize the workforce and implement changes that streamline the operating model create more efficiency and enable better execution as we conclude 2019 we emerge a stronger firm than we started out the year with record revenue record adjusted operating income and record adjusted earnings per share as we look to the future there is significant uncertainty in the world given current global issues like geopolitical risk negative interest rates trade friction extreme weather and climate change pandemic risk and cyber risk we come to the fore in these dynamic times by providing trusted support to our clients in the areas of risk strategy and people marsh mclennan provided thought leadership on key global issues at the world economic forum in davos this marks the 15th consecutive year we produced the annual global risk report together with the world economic forum the report ranks the top global risks and this year climate and weather related risk created the greatest concern climate change was the most prominent issue discussed at davos and there is growing recognition of the urgency of both mitigation and adaptation we are engaged with our clients across all of our businesses on helping them assess the impact of the change in climate mercer and oliver wyman led sessions on general quality longevity responsible investment and ai readiness despite all the uncertainty in the world i am optimistic business leaders continue to push for growth and investment despite near term risks and fears about the longer term implications of climate change the perspectives and insights we provide on these topics are a reminder of the uniqueness of mmc and the value we bring to our clients let me spend a moment on current p c insurance pricing trends pricing is firming across a wide range of geographies and lines the marsh global insurance market index saw an increase of nearly 11 in the fourth quarter compared with 8 in the third quarter 6 in the second quarter and 3 in the first global property insurance and financial and professional lines saw the highest average renewal rate increases at 13 and 18 respectively casualty rates are up 3 on average up slightly versus the third quarter commercial auto and excess casualty continue to see rates rising while workers comp continues to see rates decline note that the marsh index skews to larger risks which are seeing higher increases although middle market and small commercial insurance rates are up in certain geographies turning to reinsurance the guy carpenter global property catastrophe rate on line index rose by 5 at the january 1 renewals total dedicated reinsurance capital increased by approximately 2 at year end although renewal outcomes vary widely across individual programs capacity is tightened in some stressed classes by commercial auto d o medical professional and general liability the retrocessional market continues to see meaningful increases in rates at january 1 driven in part by trapped capital a lack of new alternative capital entrants and continued redemptions from third party investors the overall global p c insurance market is challenging and we continue to work hard to deliver the best solutions for our clients it is in times like these where our expertise and capabilities shine turning to the fourth quarter we are pleased with our results our overall revenue growth in the quarter was 15 underlying revenue grew 3 with growth in both segments marsh grew 3 in the quarter on an underlying basis which is solid but slower than the prior quarter as expected due to a peak headwind on new business and a tough comparison to the fourth quarter of 2018 guy carpenter finished the year strong with 10 underlying revenue growth in the quarter mercer delivered 4 underlying revenue growth in the quarter the strongest growth since the first quarter of 2018 and oliver wyman declined by 2 as we expected the overall fourth quarter saw a strong adjusted operating margin expansion of 100 basis points and adjusted operating income growth of 17 as we consistently say it is important not to overemphasize a single quarter and rather look at performance over longer periods of time looking at the full year we are pleased with our results we generated strong overall revenue growth of 11 for the full year with 4 underlying growth we demonstrated top line strength across our businesses while achieving the initial benefits of the integration on an underlying basis marsh delivered solid growth of 4 for the second consecutive year guy carpenter had strong year with 5 growth mercer had 2 growth and oliver wyman grew 6 for the year despite the pullback in the fourth quarter our adjusted noi grew 14 with overall margin expansion of 110 basis points for the year marking the 12th consecutive year we have reported margin expansion adjusted eps grew 7 or 8 on a constant currency basis consistent with our guidance of modest adjusted eps dilution in the first year of the jlt acquisition in sum 2019 was an example of strong overall execution on multiple levels as we look to 2020 and beyond our future is bright the addition of jlt enhances our competitive position we are increasingly bringing our collective strength to clients and we expect to see benefits from our investments in digital and technology in 2020 we expect underlying revenue growth in the 3 to 5 range margin expansion and strong adjusted eps growth with that let me turn it over to mark for a more detailed review of our results mark mcgivney chief financial officer thank you dan and good morning we are pleased with our fourth quarter results which capped a strong year in 2019 consolidated revenue increased 15 in the quarter to 4 3 billion reflecting underlying growth of 3 and the continued contribution from jlt operating income was 592 million while adjusted operating income rose 17 to 856 million our adjusted operating margin increased 100 basis points to 21 9 gaap eps rose to 0 76 and adjusted eps increased 9 to 1 19 looking at risk and insurance services fourth quarter revenue grew 24 to 2 4 billion and was up 3 on an underlying basis a good result considering the tough comparison marsh faced with strong fourth quarter in 2018 and the fact that q4 was jlt s seasonally largest quarter adjusted operating income increased 31 to 550 million and the adjusted margin expanded 200 basis points to 25 7 for the year revenue was 9 6 billion an increase of 17 with solid underlying growth of 4 adjusted operating income for the year was up an impressive 17 and our adjusted operating margin in ris increased 50 basis points to 26 3 at marsh revenue in the quarter rose 23 to 2 2 billion increasing 3 on an underlying basis the u s canada division underlying growth was 4 for the quarter and 5 for the full year this marks the seventh consecutive quarter of 4 or higher underlying growth for u s canada in the quarter the international division had underlying growth of 1 with asia pacific up 7 latin america up 2 and emea down 1 for the full year revenue at marsh was 8 billion an increase of 17 or 4 on an underlying basis guy carpenter s revenue was 152 million an increase of 10 on an underlying basis for the quarter representing an outstanding finish to a strong year the growth in the quarter benefited from strong results in north america as well as growth in retrocessional and an active quarter for gc security for the year revenue was 1 5 billion an increase of 15 or 5 on an underlying basis in the consulting segment fourth quarter revenue increased 4 to 1 9 billion with underlying growth of 2 consulting s adjusted operating income was flat year over year at 359 million and the adjusted operating margin of 19 7 declined 60 basis points versus a year ago but looking at the full year margin expansion was solid for the year revenue was 7 1 billion an increase of 5 with underlying growth of 3 adjusted operating income for the year was up 9 to 1 3 billion and our adjusted operating margin increased 90 basis points to 18 6 mercer s revenue increased 8 in the quarter to 1 3 billion with underlying growth of 4 wealth increased 2 on an underlying basis with investment management up high single digits and defined benefit down low single digits our overall assets under management continued to grow and at year end exceeded 305 billion up 5 sequentially and 26 year over year health revenue grew 6 on an underlying basis in the fourth quarter reflecting strong growth in both international and the u s career grew 4 on an underlying basis with strong growth in the surveying products and digital implementation for the year revenue at mercer was 5 billion an increase of 6 or 2 on an underlying basis oliver wyman s revenue in fourth quarter was 559 million a decline of 2 on an underlying basis as we said on our last call we expected a pullback in the fourth quarter for the full year oliver wyman produced strong underlying revenue growth 6 we made great progress in 2019 on the jlt integration and are on plan or ahead of schedule on key milestones we continue to expect the transaction will be modestly dilutive to adjusted eps in the first year neutral in year two and accretive in year three we are ahead of schedule on cost savings and restructuring actions we now estimate run rate savings of at least 350 million we expect to incur approximately 625 million of cash costs to generate those savings in addition there will be approximately 75 million of noncash charges mostly property related costs as we consolidate our real estate footprint we achieved approximately 125 million in savings through year end 2019 and expect to achieve the balance by the end of 2021 we also incurred 335 million of jlt integration and restructuring costs in 2019 to achieve these savings as our expectation is the bulk of the remaining costs will be incurred in 2020 with a more modest amount extending into 2021 this update reflects the plans we have today as we continue to get deeper into the integration there is a possibility for more savings opportunities to emerge as we look to the first quarter of 2020 keep in mind this is the last quarter where our year over year comparisons are impacted by jlt remember in ris the first quarter is seasonally small for jlt in addition jlt s employee benefits margins are relatively low in the first quarter and we expect this along with some quarterly volatility will result in a decline in first quarter consulting margins however for the full year as dan mentioned we expect strong earnings growth consolidated adjusted operating margin expansion turning back to the fourth quarter adjusted corporate expense was 53 million in the quarter in the fourth quarter we recorded 264 million of noteworthy items the majority of which are related to the jlt acquisition included in the total are 143 million of jlt integration costs the largest category of which is severance 17 million of jlt acquisition related costs 56 million of other restructuring costs and 42 million of earn out true ups relating to prior acquisitions as we typically do on our fourth quarter call i will give a brief update on our global retirement plan cash contributions to our global defined benefit plans were 122 million in 2019 up slightly from the 112 million in 2018 we expect cash contributions in 2020 will be roughly 160 million for 2020 we anticipate our other net benefit credit will be slightly lower than in 2019 based on current expectations we would assume roughly 264 million for this item in 2020 investment income was 2 million in the fourth quarter for both gaap and adjusted results for the full year 2019 our gaap investment income was 22 million and adjusted investment income was approximately 12 million for 2020 we expect only modest investment income on an adjusted basis foreign exchange was a slight headwind to adjusted eps in the quarter and it had 0 05 per share negative impact for the full year 2019 assuming exchange rates remain at current levels we expect fx to be a slight headwind to adjusted eps for 2020 our effective adjusted tax rate in the fourth quarter was 23 4 compared with 23 6 in the fourth quarter last year for the full year 2019 our adjusted tax rate was 24 1 excluding discrete items our adjusted tax rate for the full year was approximately 26 when we give forward guidance around our tax rate we do not project discrete items which can be positive or negative based on the current environment it is reasonable to assume a tax rate between 25 and 26 for 2020 in the fourth quarter we repurchased 1 8 million shares of our stock for 185 million for the full year 2019 we repurchased 4 8 million shares for 485 million total debt at the end of 2019 was 12 billion compared with 12 6 billion at the end of the third quarter next debt maturity is in march 2020 when 500 million of senior notes will mature during the fourth quarter we incurred 130 million of interest expense we expect approximately the same amount in the first quarter of 2020 as we look to 2020 the framework for capital management we discussed in the early stages of jlt is still on track this year we currently expect to deploy approximately 2 6 billion to 2 9 billion of capital across three broad categories debt reduction dividend in line with our objective of double digit increases annually and a combination of acquisitions and share repurchases directionally we currently expect the amount of capital deployed to be roughly equivalent across these three categories this plan allows us to maintain our dividend growth objectives and meet the commitments for deleveraging we laid out when we announced jlt it also provides flexibility for m a we ve consistently stated that we favor attractive acquisitions over share repurchases as we view high quality acquisitions as the better value creator for shareholders and the company over the long term our track record is good as evidenced by our return on invested capital of nearly 20 over the last three years given our deleveraging plan and our acquisition pipeline we currently do not expect any share repurchases in the first half of 2020 ultimately share repurchases later in the year will depend on how the m a pipeline develops our deleveraging should be largely complete by the end of this year and we expect to have substantial flexibility in terms of capital deployment in 2021 and beyond our cash position at the end of the fourth quarter was 1 2 billion uses of cash in the fourth quarter totaled 444 million and included 24 million for acquisitions 235 million for dividends and 185 million for share repurchases for the full year 2019 uses of cash totaled 7 5 billion and included 6 1 billion for acquisitions 890 million for dividends and 485 million for share repurchase in summary we are proud of what we accomplished in 2019 we are very much on track with the objectives we set when we announced the jlt acquisition and as we look forward to 2020 our outlook is for another year of strong performance with that i m happy to hand it back to dan dan glaser president and chief executive officer thanks mark operator we are ready to begin q a questions answers operator we will take our first question today from elyse greenspan of wells fargo please go ahead elyse greenspan wells fargo securities analyst hi thanks good morning so my first question you guys updated the savings program for jlt today it also seems like intangibles are coming in a good amount lower than when you guys had announced this deal so i m just trying to i guess get from that that you have these two tailwinds to your numbers and you still are reaffirming i guess that the deal will be breakeven in 2020 and accretive in 2021 so what s the offset relative to your initial expectations that this deal might not be accretive sooner than you had expected dan glaser president and chief executive officer no actually it s going to be elyse accretive consistent with our original expectations and so the deal of this size there s always a number of puts and takes and as you mentioned we think the cost savings are higher we think the amortization is lower but we also needed to divest some businesses principally aerospace but also some minority interest in other businesses like crp here in the u s which we did not anticipate going into the transaction and so and we also have some revenue headwinds that we had described before whether that was from new business pipeline issues or some staff inspections those are things that we re grappling with so you put it all together and the deal is tracking in line with our original expectations and our original expectations i ll just remind everybody were really good that was going to be a good solid financial transaction which was also very strategic in nature for marsh mclennan as a company and when we talk about things like accretion and dilution it s always a level of how we re growing so we expect 2020 to be a strong year in adjusted eps growth and that s what breakeven means to us elyse greenspan wells fargo securities analyst ok that s helpful and then my second question on last quarter s call you guys had alluded to the overall margin for the company expanding more than the year to date level it seems like the fourth quarter came in a little bit below your expectations was that just maybe a little bit weaker consulting margin just trying to understand what happened in the fourth quarter as we kind of think about the level of margin improvement going forward dan glaser president and chief executive officer we focus very much on earnings growth and top line growth much more than we do on margin and we certainly don t really pay much attention to any one single quarter we were satisfied for the year with 110 bps and the fourth quarter was pretty consistent to the year there s always a lot going on in all of our businesses and so it s not that we look at one versus the other as in any way coming up short of what our expectations were i mean when i look at margins in general for the company 2019 is going to be our 12th consecutive year of margin expansion and really significant levels of margin expansion you go back a decade and we re up by 1 300 bps you go back five years we re up 450 bps plus in both segments and as a company and so but just to go back i wouldn t look at any one quarter as being indicative you need to look at longer periods of time and margin expansion for us is an outcome of how we run the business which is revenue growth almost always exceed expense growth and that will give us margin expansion over time and the only areas that we were really driving for some margin this year was in ris in parts of the portfolio particularly in guy carpenter that we felt we needed to adjust jlt to just more similar margin levels than what we had normally been operating within as marsh mclennan next question please operator our next question comes from mike zaremski of credit suisse please go ahead your line is open mike zaremski credit suisse analyst good morning first question regarding the risk and insurance segment looking at the emea segment growth there has been let s call it very very low single digits for the past couple of years is that a pace that we should kind of any color is that a patient maybe we should expect thinking about into this year and then i guess also latam growth also just a little bit weaker in the second half of the year anything going on there and just thinking out till 2020 dan glaser president and chief executive officer so i ll take it a little bit and then i ll hand over to john overall we believe we re set up well in both emea and latin america for future growth not even in not only in 2020 but beyond obviously emea includes the u k which has been our biggest area of overlap with jlt and where we knew we re going to be a bit choppy for a while and so that s essentially when we look at the business we unpack the different component parts of emea but john do you want to add more to that john doyle chief executive officer marsh sure dan thanks big picture 23 gaap growth in the quarter it is very very big growth 17 for the full year 4 underlying growth for the full year so i was pleased with the results as dan noted as we expected in the u k the underlying growth was impacted by integration related headwinds and some first quarter challenges remain but i will say i m encouraged by improvements in the underlying performance in the u k we made some leadership changes now about 18 months ago in the u k and they re setting the foundation for stronger growth going forward and in latin america as i noted in the last call again integration related challenges they ll persist through the first quarter but latin america remains a high growth region for us so for the second quarter on expect improved results there and again i wanted to say i m pleased overall with the growth i m quite proud of the team we managed through a lot of change throughout all of 2019 and we maintained our focus on serving our clients in what s an increasingly challenging market as well as dan noted we re a stronger team entering 2020 jlt is obviously a big part of that but we also added wortham in the year 18 and did a lot of work on integration of wortham last year and we added two top 100 firms in the united states to mma as well so i m quite excited about the team and how we re positioned as we enter 2020 dan glaser president and chief executive officer you got another one mike mike zaremski credit suisse analyst that s helpful yes lastly sticking on the brokerage space dan in your prepared remarks i think you said it was a challenging marketplace i assume you re referring to what s maybe become a hard market and you can correct me if i m wrong just curious does this challenging market also put a little bit pressure on marsh s expense base given your employees are working potentially even harder to represent their clients in this marketplace dan glaser president and chief executive officer we re built to operate well across cycles and i mean the i wouldn t necessarily classify the entire market is a hard market it s certainly hard in pockets and it s certainly true as you noted that marsh and guy carpenter brokers have to run a lot harder to get things done and have to work really hard and creatively in order to serve clients in these challenging market conditions and so we recognize that we don t believe that that puts any overpressure on our expense levels more than the fact that we recognize that our people are working harder than ever before and we appreciate that and we reward them for it but our teams are driven by serving clients and so that s what their focus is so they re out there hustling not in the belief that somehow their compensation or anything else is going to change it s actually that they re focused on delivering for their clients next question please operator our next question today comes from ryan tunis of autonomous research please go ahead ryan tunis autonomous research analyst yes thanks good morning dan i guess i was hoping maybe you might be able to quantify perhaps the type of drags you think right now the organic revenue growth rate is feeling because of i want to say disruption because of the jlt integration process and was that worse this quarter than the third quarter is it still getting worse or is the magnitude of that lessening going forward dan glaser president and chief executive officer well let me talk about that broadly because i think it s a good question first of all i d start with the basis when i look at our underlying growth i m pleased with 3 in the quarter and i m really pleased with 4 for the year if you look at the quarter guy carpenter had a terrific quarter and a strong year top and bottom line oliver wyman as expected they had a tough quarter but 6 for the year mercer 4 solid for the fourth quarter and sequentially improving throughout the year and again marsh i m pleased with the 3 given as we told you there were some tough comps both from marsh s performance last year in the fourth quarter but also jlt s performance in the fourth quarter and the new business hurdle which was a very big new business quarter for jlt last year we had talked to you about the pipeline issues throughout the year and so in the context of the largest acquisition in our history i m quite happy with the underlying growth level although i just want to take another minute to talk about growth a little bit more because i understand the way you re looking at it it s not the way i look at it from my perspective we ve had a tremendous growth year on multiple levels and we have significantly outgrown our competitors we ve outgrown our competitors in capabilities in talent our headcount of 10 000 people from this time last year we ve outgrown our competitors in revenue and the number of clients and it all starts with gaap there are certain times where gaap is more important than underlying and i think this year was one of those times i mean our total revenue is up 11 in 2019 and 15 in the fourth quarter we look at ris ris grew 24 in the fourth quarter we ve been at it for 148 years if it grows 24 in the quarter at a firm like ours it s something and as john was alluding to before you need to look specifically in marsh latin america was up 15 in the year asia pacific 39 emea 16 all in 2019 and our base and our trajectory will be better for years and years to come as a result of the remarkable year we had in 2019 on a growth basis if you have something else ryan ryan tunis autonomous research analyst yes yes just i guess just on u s canada organic a little bit of deceleration there and kind of just curious for your perspective into 2020 thinking about the market conditions like does it doesn t seem to be a tailwind how are you thinking about how all that comes together dan glaser president and chief executive officer i mean u s canada performance has been terrific the last couple of years but john do you want to talk about that a little bit more john doyle chief executive officer marsh yes i m quite pleased with our team ryan in the u s and canada we had a terrific year this year i would also remind you that we had 7 organic growth last year in the underlying growth in the fourth quarter both mma and marsh had terrific years we also had a very good finish to the year in canada and quite a strong year there as well our mga operations in the u s are performing quite well as well our private client business did quite well from a growth perspective on the specialty front we had good growth in our credit specialties our private equity business aviation did well and the transaction risk and cyber are a couple of products that are growing nicely at the moment ryan tunis autonomous research analyst thank you dan glaser president and chief executive officer next question please operator the next question comes from michael phillips of morgan stanley please go ahead michael phillips morgan stanley analyst yes thank you good morning everybody i was just curious dan on your thoughts on how much i guess at a very high level how much do you think there s more room to go on the legs of the p c overall pricing environment i mean is that going to peak do you say i guess a peak time for maybe by the end of this year or how much more room do you think there is to grow on the overall environment for pricing dan glaser president and chief executive officer that s a 64 question i mean at the end you ve got different things at work i think you ve got many insurance companies who are dissatisfied with the results they have achieved financially over the last several years and so there was a factor impacting many companies at the same time and they ve got a little blood in the eye and they are looking to get back to a better position you also have the thoughts around social inflation and how real that is and how it s impacting their book as it rolls forward you have pressures on the reinsurance side and i ll go to john and peter in a minute to give a little bit more but there is pressure on the reinsurance side which may build throughout the year which will put some pressure on primary carriers and so ultimately it s a matter of what s the loss activity and the premium levels will over time reflect whether it s in a benign environment or whether it s a harsh one i mean certainly when i think about this year i look at the level of catastrophe potential and if it s a tough cat year really we re in for quite a ride if it s a benign year in the southeast particularly well maybe some of the window is out of the cell but i also think a lot has to do with how casualty develops but why don t we start with the primary and john and then we ll go to reinsurance just to talk more broadly about market conditions and maybe if we have any prognosis but john john doyle chief executive officer marsh for me it s an earnings driven market change for sure dan talked about some of the trends continuing into the first quarter there continues to be a very wide range of outcomes in markets around the world i don t consider it a hard market although it s certainly become more challenging for our clients on a geography basis australia the u s and u k wholesale are seeing the largest increases in the u s it s about 10 and going for the high teens average rate increase in australia in asia continental europe middle east latin america u k retail more mid single digit price increases you look at it from a product perspective dan there property is up 13 globally financial lines up 17 meaningful increases there family up 3 where we see a real mix where comp continues to be down excess liability though particularly in certain classes of business are quite stressed at the moment and public p l particularly in the united states and australia are a couple of classes that are most challenging i would note dan talked about this again but our index skews the large accounts the middle market is flat to low single digits in many markets in most markets around the world but we re continuing to hear from underwriters they re concerned about rising loss cost as dan noted social inflation or the impact of litigation funding on the claim environment we re also observing and working with our clients through some challenging verdicts and large settlements in pharma in chemicals and commercial auto and in p l so there is no question there s some stress in the loss environment and it s difficult to predict where markets will head but there are some storm on underwriting dan glaser president and chief executive officer peter peter hearn chief executive officer guy carpenter i think from a reinsurance standpoint the market is responding very responsibly and it s really been a function at one one the pricing and the renewals were largely shaped by a couple of factors deteriorating loss experience a lack of new alternative capital and increasing challenges in the environment with regard to primary insurance and retrocessional markets there s a wide span of pricing some was flat to down in certain geographies in others it was up significantly the retrocessional market we saw increases of between 15 and 20 but i don t believe the market the reinsurance business is hard i think it s more expensive but it certainly isn t a hard market which we define as at any price you can t generate traction michael phillips morgan stanley analyst thanks dan glaser president and chief executive officer mike do you have a follow up michael phillips morgan stanley analyst no thank you all for your thoughts appreciate it dan glaser president and chief executive officer ok thank you next question please operator our next question comes from meyer shields of kbw please go ahead meyer shields kbw analyst great thanks dan you ve been very upfront about the fact that when you worked on the merger you anticipated some level of producer and client outflow and i m wondering if we look forward to 2020 is there any margin pressure because in 2019 overly simplistically you had revenues associated with people that had left the firm dan glaser president and chief executive officer it s a good question but our anticipation as i was mentioning before there s always a lot of puts and takes in the transaction of this size and geographic breadth and as we look to 2020 we expect to expand margins as marsh mclennan and so we think that it will be our 13th consecutive year of margin expansion and we think we ll have a strong year in the adjusted eps i would say when we went into the transaction big people business combination we expected some level of defection and so when we sit here today and we look at where we are even though there are some people who left the firm who we would have preferred not leave the firm we re in good shape where we had the most significant levels of leavers would be let s say in london in the u k market in london well we are strong in london we were strong and we are stronger today and more people by a very very wide majority stayed rather than left and so we re in great shape from that perspective and so when i mentioned 10 000 additional headcount and they are smart hardworking talented people which will deliver a lot of value for us into the future and our ability in a place like london to regenerate ourselves using our existing capability the jlt addition and then going into the market to replace some people who had left our ability to regenerate half talent in london is among the highest places in the world and so it s not something that s anything more than short term john doyle chief executive officer marsh and i would also note that the voluntary turnover rate at legacy marsh was the best it s been since collected the data so from that perspective it s quite a stable year from talent perspective meyer shields kbw analyst yes just a quick one so in the breakdown by segment there was an 8 i guess hit to guy carpenter s revenue from a divestiture is that going to persist for the next few quarters dan glaser president and chief executive officer mark why don t you take that mark mcgivney chief financial officer meyer on that schedule you ll see that column heading it s acquisitions and positions in others so from time to time we ll have just changes in mapping of businesses or other things that we use that column to just to make sure that year over year comparisons are apples to apples there was no divestiture in guy carpenter really was just comparability adjustments and the fact that guy carpenter s revenue base was so small in the quarter it just magnified that there should be no ongoing impact from that dan glaser president and chief executive officer next question please operator our next question comes from jimmy bhullar of jp morgan please go ahead jimmy bhullar j p morgan analyst hi good morning so just a question first on oliver wyman and the weakness there i think organic growth slowed the last couple of quarters how much of that is just normal volatility in the business versus maybe shifts in spending on the part of your clients dan glaser president and chief executive officer yes so a couple of things i ve mentioned in the past that oliver wyman has more volatility on the top line than our other businesses because they have less recurring revenue but they actually had a strong year through nine months and we had anticipated some slowdown in the fourth quarter but scott do you want to give more detail scott mcdonald chief executive officer oliver wyman sure we definitely had a weak q4 but there was really nothing significant that happened and the result was driven by three things the first was some project movement from quarter to quarter which regularly happens with us and drives some volatility you can see that coming in q4 and we signaled a little bit of a pullback on our last call the second thing was we did have a solid q4 last year where we grew 7 and the third thing was we did see a modest but what feels very much like a temporary slowdown in a couple of markets in q4 so broadly the business was strong across sectors but both europe and asia showed some weakness primarily in the financial services business but that feels like it was temporary and the q4 result it hasn t changed our medium term expectations we continue to plan for mid to high single digit revenue build over time and for the time being at least demand for consulting services feels solid across sectors and across regions jimmy bhullar j p morgan analyst thanks and dan glaser president and chief executive officer do you have a follow up jimmy jimmy bhullar j p morgan analyst secondly on guy carpenter in the second each of the past couple of quarters you ve had double digit growth and those are obviously the lowest quarters of the year in terms of the base how much of this is driven just by the small base versus maybe better momentum in the business that could potentially carry into this year dan glaser president and chief executive officer thanks peter do you want to peter hearn chief executive officer guy carpenter jimmy its really a combination of both they are smaller quarters for us but they re also being driven by good new growth our third year of record new business wins in the united states in our retrocession business and our asia pacific business our facultative business which we very rarely talk about has grown significantly all of those can impact a small quarter as you ve seen in q3 and 4 but it s more a function of phasing than it is anything else and a very disciplined approach to sales and growth dan glaser president and chief executive officer we were very pleased with the 5 growth for the year so next question please operator our next question comes from yaron kinar of goldman sachs please go ahead yaron kinar goldman sachs analyst hi good morning my first question is just around the cost saves from the integration programs do you have any sense how much of that 350 million or greater will actually fall to the bottom line versus get reinvested back in the platform dan glaser president and chief executive officer i mean general sense is that the majority of it will fall right to the bottom line and that s how we projected when we originally put things together that obviously earnings will go up so some of it will go into bonus pools and that sort of thing but a lot of the efficiency gains that we have developed is because of the investments that marsh mclennan made over a number of years when you think about things like financial systems we re oracle 12 everywhere in the world hr systems we re workday everywhere in the world we use salesforce extensively throughout the world and so we re able to take an organization like jlt and integrate our systems and controls and functions reasonably seamlessly without adding to a lot of our existing cost base in order to do that and that gives us a lot of benefit and really should not impact the frontline client facing people all that much and that s one of the reasons why most of it will drop yaron kinar goldman sachs analyst ok understood and then going back to some of the questions around growth the 3 to 5 organic growth target that i think you ve talked about in the past just looking one of your peers have been kind of talking about just kind of mid single digit or better over the long term and i m just trying to square the 3 to 5 to that other guidance are there structural differences between the two organizations was it just more conservative guidance on your part are there just near term headwinds just with the integration now that maybe once you get through those you do that higher step up in that organic growth number dan glaser president and chief executive officer yes i m one of those people who are like you are what your results say you are and for the last 10 years we ve been in the 3 to 5 organic growth range i do not believe that we have many competitors we re a pretty unique company across the breadth of the things we do clearly we have certain formidable competitors in parts of our business but across all of the things that we do including oliver wyman and some of the strong businesses we have within mercer we don t have many direct competitors but when i look at the competitive landscape i absolutely believe i wouldn t change our strategic positioning with anybody i wouldn t exchange our capabilities with anybody or our culture and there s no reason under the sun to where our revenue growth performance would not be as good or better than any of our competitors over time next question please operator our next question comes from larry greenberg of janney please go ahead larry greenberg janney montgomery scott analyst thank you not much left to ask but i guess this is for mark just wondering if maybe the trajectory of expenses has accelerated a bit from earlier from when you initially gave your guidance on that i mean it looked like you what you saved in 2019 as a percentage of what you now think is the total is a little bit higher than how you initially walked into this period and i m so i m just wondering if that s correct mark mcgivney chief financial officer i guess larry just a little bit further on phasing as i said we expect to take most of the actions to generate the full 350 million by the end of this year just by what i said with the charges it would be a little bit spilling into 2021 and the savings the remainder of savings will come in over the two years probably more in 2020 than 2021 but as i said earlier we expect to realize the full impact of the savings by the end of 2021 larry greenberg janney montgomery scott analyst thanks that s it dan glaser president and chief executive officer ok thank you operator our next questions comes from dave styblo of jefferies please go ahead dave styblo jefferies analyst hi there thanks for the questions just want to ask a little bit about capital deployment after 2020 i think you guys are pretty much done with your debt paydown plans curious how that affects your thinking for m a after this year does that open up in that the possibly of doing something a little bit larger or are you guys inclined just to keep things on a more modest basis as you continue to integrate jlt dan glaser president and chief executive officer we have acquisitions that are a core part of our long term strategy we ve done something like 175 plus acquisitions since january 1 2009 we tend to be a balanced company when we look about we put our dividend first it s sacrosanct we want to grow it double digit every year and that s going to be for the sake of argument look at a number of circa 1 billion for that which should mean in most years 2021 and beyond roughly a couple of billion dollars to deploy between acquisitions and share repurchase and as we ve said in the past we favor acquisitions over share repurchase the very reason we re building a great company and our focus and as we ve shown over time we ve been able to do that you look at marsh mclennan agency in 2009 0 revenue and no position and now we ve got a terrific platform 1 7 billion growing well good ebitda margins etc we re in a business that we otherwise would not have been in that s what s called building a company and we re committed to continuing to do that and we have all kinds of opportunities across the enterprise not just in marsh but across the firm in order to acquire our way to be a better stronger more formidable company in the future and so when we look at that 2 billion and our debt to ebitda at that level will probably be in the low 2s and so we would have the ability to flex if we needed to but there s certainly nothing that we re pining for in terms of a larger or mega acquisition we ll see how the strategy develops over time but certainly having circa 3 billion to deploy year after year after year is going to make us one of the great companies of the world dave styblo jefferies analyst right got it ok and then just a quick housekeeping i think i heard for the first quarter given the business mix and so forth that consulting margins were expected to be down year over year i don t know if i heard a comment about ris dan glaser president and chief executive officer yes no we didn t make a comment specifically about ris we wanted to point out consulting because of our visibility to it and we recognize that consulting has its own attributes ris is a different kind of business and so as you know the consulting margin declined in the fourth quarter even though we had a 90 bps improvement for consulting for the year and so we just wanted to give a heads up that our expectation was for a decline in the first quarter for a variety of different reasons which our view is temporary and when we look at the full year of 2020 we expect it to be our 13th year of consolidated margin expansion for the entire firm operator our next question comes from brian meredith of ubs please go ahead brian meredith ubs analyst hey thanks just two quick ones here first just curious on the emea organic revenue growth the slowdown we had in the fourth quarter i know you explained should we expect it to kind of continue into the first half of 2020 as some of this leadership changes go on dan glaser president and chief executive officer john you want to take that john doyle chief executive officer marsh yes i think the brian there are still some headwinds in the first quarter for sure but as i noted earlier i think the underlying performance as we work our way through cut through some of the integration related headwinds i think we ll see improved performance throughout the rest of the year and by the way in the middle east a terrific growth year last year good solid results in continental europe as well so obviously somewhat hopeful that the u k economy will continue to pick up now there s more uncertainty around brexit so a number of different factors that will ultimately determine where we are but i m quite encouraged by how our team is leading through all this change dan glaser president and chief executive officer and also just to bear in mind the new leader in the u k is a marsh veteran he s worked for the firm for more than 30 years and ran canada for us had other big jobs so it s not like somebody coming in and having to learn the role he knows the business very well and as we mentioned in previous calls when we think about the short and midterm we are optimistic about britain britain has sort of been through the wringer over the last couple of years but there s now clarity around brexit we ve got new leadership in the u k where we re in many different businesses from large account through to small commercial and we believe it s going to be a great business for us over a stretch of time brian meredith ubs analyst great and then my second question just hopefully just a quick one here could the coronavirus have any impact on your growth in the fourth quarter in your asia pacific business do you think at all dan glaser president and chief executive officer yes i mean we re monitoring the situation closely like i m sure everybody is and our primary concern is definitely to help our colleagues and their families and we re doing everything we can to assist clients as they think through possible scenarios that can impact their business but it s just too early to see that as to whether there s going to be any impact on our business asia or otherwise we ll just have to see how this plays out in the coming weeks operator thank you i would now like to turn the call back to dan glaser president and ceo of marsh mclennan companies for any closing remarks dan glaser president and chief executive officer i d like to thank everybody for joining us on the call this morning and certainly thank our colleagues for their hard work and dedication as well as our clients for their support hope everybody has a good day thank you very much operator duration 62 minutes call participants dan glaser

efforts by both the reagan and trump administrations to level the playing field have met with insufficient success the powers of china and emerging markets are rising by professor michael r czinkota after signing the united states mexico canada agreement and phase 1 of the china trade deal president trump has now moved his international trade focus onto some of the closest u s allies the european union during the world economic forum in davos switzerland he proposed tariffs on auto imports from the eu on wines cheese yogurt and handbags from france and on whiskies from ireland theinternational trade policy efforts by trump are remindful of president ronald reagan both presidents are stars of the republican party and very frowned upon by democrats trump and reaganwere focused on reducing the u s trade deficit and increasing the global competitiveness of u s industry a look onto the past will provide a better understanding on whether trump s bold approach to trade policy wins over reagan s more sedate procedures the 1980s the u s trade deficit was significant and growing precipitously in the early reagan years it averaged 30 billion and reached 123 billion by late 1984 reagan s preference for free trade contributed to the administration s initial lassitude on this deficit gradually however calls for protectionism emerged examples were the u s automotive and footwear industries even clothespins were considered by some worthy of protection against foreign imports in response reagan signed the trade and tariff act of 1984 to reduce unfair global trade practices there werealso additional efforts to increase exports reagan announced bilateral trade agreements with israel and later with canada new rules were implemented to ease u s trade with china yet the trade deficit continued to rise and reached 148 billion in 1985 the final major trade legislation of the reagan administration was the omnibus and competitiveness act of 1988 which authorized negotiations in the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt and required the u s trade representative to take aggressive corrective action against countries that had large trade surpluses with the u s the end of the reagan years coincided with a sharp rise in globalization forces the emergence of new technologies in transportation communications and information dramatically lowered the costs of international business and marked a rise of worldwide competition trade policy after 2016 similar to reagan trump has focused on fair trade some considerhis approach more aggressive and populist trump ignited a new fervor in international trade policy his tariffs have been imposed rapidly and often with little debate his style has managed to concentrate the focus of trade partners the constantly hammered message says trade is now important to the u s trump has argued consistently that the u s has been ignored or treated unfairly for decades in trade related matters he has pushed an america first policy with no more ongoing global support from the u s he renegotiated the north american free trade agreement nafta eliminated the trans pacific partnership tpp as well as criticized major companies such as carrier ford and mondelez for selecting their production location without patriotic consideration trump tariffs of 2018 covered about 304 billion of imports into the u s together with other forms of protection they have had limited effects on the u s trade deficit some countriesfiled formal complaints against the u s with the world trade organization wto trump responded by threatening corrective measures against the wto if u s interests were not considered comparing reagan and trump reagan s policy endeavors were initially quite modest but became more assertive over time efforts sought to reduce the growing u s trade deficit with japan and bolster american industrial exports trump s trade deficit is significantly larger both in real and relative terms trump s policyuses more harsh aggressive and clear approaches stating his expectations and demands as well as reflecting the consequences of nonconformity efforts by both the reagan and trump administrations to level the playing field have met with insufficient success the powers of china and emerging markets are rising american influence around the world should not become precarious the time is right for further enlightened action on international trade countries need to understandthe drivers of u s policy which requires embracement of new approaches new linkages and new leadership directions for an entirely new era professor michael czinkota teaches international marketing and business at georgetown university his most recent book is in search for the soul of international business 2019 he served as deputy assistant secretary in the u s department of commerce in the reagan and bush administrations
source reflecting on adopted zanu pf indaba resolutions the herald january 31 2020 zanu pf supporters sloganeer at the party s national people s conference in goromonzi tafadzwa mugwadi senior writer zanu pf as the ruling party has had several national people s conferences most of which took place during the reign of former president the late robert mugabe two have been held under president mnangagwa in the second republic as such resolutions have characterised 18 conferences so far by way of disabusing the public resolutions are key decisions and programmes of action adopted at the gathering which means they are the major reason why the party meets annually such key decisions and programmes of action are supposed to become the verses and chapters guiding the party and its government until the next conference in terms of priorities and conduct this entails that all government and party efforts should focus on implementing such resolutions to ensure that people s aspirations are met if the party s resolutions are not implemented it means people just come all the way to gather for some few days and disperse afterwards or probably that certain elements or departments in government are using the wrong verses and chapters which are contrary to what the people would have resolved while it could be understood that various resolutions did not see the light of day between 2013 and 2017 owing to elite dis cohesion ahead of the resolution of the succession question which became the dominant political discourse in that period it is clear that there was need for change in the implementation of resolutions this piece seeks to take stock of the recent two conferences with a specific focus on the disbanding of the multi currency system as well as dealing with the illegal parallel money market what have been the hindrances to the full implementation of resolutions that are as clear as daylight the government following a resolution to stabilise the pricing system and disbanding of the three tier system adopted at the esigodini conference of 2018 outlawed the multi currency regime which was by and large anchored on the us dollar this was spelt out through statutory instrument si 142 of 2019 which outlawed the use of multiple currencies under the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz legal tender regulations the government abolished the use of the british pound the united states dollar the south african rand the botswana pula and any other foreign currencies as legal tender that means the use of us dollars by consumers to buy goods or services is an offence again the same law outlaws the pricing of goods and services by providers both retailers and manufacturers in foreign currency literally the issuance of foreign currency is now supposed to be an exclusive right and privilege of banks under the rbz oversight there is no ambiguity on this one however what is obtaining on the ground is completely the opposite of what was agreed upon pointing to the conclusion that the implementation of programmes and resolutions has become a serious challenge which zanu pf has to handle decisively the resolutions are the aspirations on the ground and people expect the leadership to follow through such resolutions to their fullest conclusion the decision was reaffirmed at the recent conference in goromonzi where measuring by the quantity of ululations and ovations there was no resolution that was greeted by such celebrations as the resolution to ban the use of foreign currency to price goods and services as well as trading in foreign currency on black and parallel markets sadly the 2019 festive season was one of the toughest as retailers and other service providers were defiant and priced commodities in us dollars while some have been rating cash and rtgs dollars as well as coins despite such a noble resolution 25 cents and 50 cents bond coins have been rejected in shops while in most of the cases a commodity is charged 10 percent higher if one is paying in coins and 40 percent higher than the actual price if one is paying by swipe or mobile money transfer this has become the sad reality confronting zimbabweans daily the situation has been compounded by vendors some of whom have been selling basic goods in us dollars furthermore after the goromonzi resolution to disband the trading of forex on the parallel market there has been a sad proliferation of cash barons the million dollar question is where is the missing link in the implementation matrix who is supposed to implement and operationalise such resolutions and why has he or she not done so where are the barons getting cash and why are they still roaming the streets why do some service providers continue to receive forex while it is unlawful to do so if all these economic malpractices happen in broad daylight then why did we put in place laws and regulations which the government cannot enforce or is not willing to enforce this is a call for leadership to take action to show the public that rules are put in place to be observed and not violated with impunity more so it is equally advisable that the party through its government reviews the decision of giving some companies preferential treatment over others some companies like dstv were allowed to trade in us dollars and this has created a catch 22 situation in the resolution of the currency issue because it is easy for a cash baron to simply say he is trading cash to raise money for dstv payment such loopholes are becoming an albatross to the economy a company that has no respect of nor desire to trade in local currency has no need to access the local market itself there cannot be justification for a zimbabwean company to go and invest in south africa but refuse to trade in the rand equally there should be no justification for a south african company or any company from any party of the world to enjoy investment opportunities in zimbabwe but refusing to trade in the legal tender which is the zimbabwe dollar this is the recipe for speculation and fuelling of discord in the court of public opinion there has been a pervasive perception that the party and government is fearful of tackling the cash barons parallel money changers and pricing of goods because high ranking officials are accomplices this is what has become corridor talk in both public and private and worse so in the villages where the party is strong in electoral terms now what does that mean it simply means that if the party is serious to maintain its dominance it must clear these allegations which have become pervasive even in its traditional strongholds indeed it would be difficult to diffuse and subordinate public theories emanating from ordinary folks because officially there is no justification or legitimate excuses for the failure or lackadaisical approach in arresting these vices if the criminal investigations department is expected to investigate a case of robbery that has taken place without any trace and still manage to catch the culprits how easy is it for the zimbabwe anti corruption commission zacc and the state to arrest a money changer if this question is difficult to answer then it is with such difficulties that leaders will dispel rumours of high profile involvement in such vices the economy can never thrive sustainably in the auspices of another country s currency it is a fact that during the dollarisation period the country was robbed of a huge opportunity for growth due to a gold rush by companies that came to invest the zeal to invest in zimbabwe then was never inspired by the potential that the country has per se but by the desire to access and rob the hard currency which had become the medium of exchange it is in this period that high profile externalisation and smuggling of money happened the recoveries made by president mnangagwa during his first three months in office after that moratorium given to culprits is clear testimony of how much had been lost during that period while it is clear that the majority of zimbabweans are struggling and suffering because of these parallel market exchange pricing systems which have been continuously hinged on the us dollar it cannot be satisfactorily deniable that very few individuals who are supposed to end these vices cannot do so because they are benefiting if they are not benefiting from these daylight economic crimes why have they allowed the criminals to continue unabated if the government can decisively deal with violent demonstrators armed with catapults stones and various weapons as we saw in january 2019 how can the same government pleads failure to arrest and punish a few cash barons and money changers who are only armed by bond notes and us dollars if the government can declare war on machete gangsters and arrest thousands of them armed with dangerous weapons to the teeth honestly how much effort do the same law enforcement agents need to apprehend money changers who have become a nuisance in every corner of our cities this clearly means someone somewhere in the implementation chain is holding progress for completely selfish reasons and certainly not in the public interest such officials must be shown the exit door the president who is the appointing authority of most of these officials may need to reflect on their performance so that those found to be deliberately sleeping on duty for selfish reasons must be fished out if there is no follow up on implementation then i am afraid that conferences in the future may never be taken seriously the future of zimbabwe and its people as well as its trajectory of economic development is invested in zanu pf the only party which they know is not afraid of making and taking drastic and bold actions to empower and uplift the people however even so the cardinal principles of political and behavioural sciences attest to the fact that human nature is not static and attitudes subsequently change the people s trust in zanu pf is historically documented and cemented by electoral victories but certainly it is not permanent a word for the wise is a novel

means potential portfolio companies and partners prefer to do business with us and they get more tangible benefits than just capital including access to our world class operational capabilities our knowledge base and our global network and as blackstone continues to grow we benefit from making more introductions from one area of the firm to another and we further increase our shared intellectual capital that moves around the firm all of this adds to our moat and our competitive differentiation blackstone is today more than ever the partner of choice and reference institution in the fast growing alternatives industry and there is a long runway for growth ahead one final note for me as you ve likely seen dave calhoun a former member of the firm s management committee has recently accepted the position as ceo of boeing dave was originally the ceo of one of our portfolio companies before joining blackstone as head of our portfolio operations group he was instrumental in building this team into the world class organization it is today whose capabilities are mission critical in driving change and creating value in our investments his appointment to such a key role of boeing speaks to the unique strength of blackstone s people and culture and while we will greatly miss dave having him at the helm of boeing it s both tremendously important to them and for our country and i have great confidence he will be successful we wish dave the very best and thank him for his significant contributions to our firm and with that i ll turn things over to jon gray jonathan gray president and chief operating officer thank you steve and good morning everybody we have consistently outlined a simple vision for blackstone over the last couple of years characterized by several key principles if we continue to deliver strong investment performance we will attract more capital both in existing and new areas secondly a shift toward more perpetual capital will grow and improve the quality of our earnings third we will emphasize deployment in faster growing parts of the global economy where we see more opportunity for capital appreciation fourth we will continue to expand our sources of capital to the retail and insurance channels fifth we will maintain a capital light business relying on our people track record and brand to grow and sixth we will simplify our story for shareholders making the stock easier to understand and own as we move into the new year i wanted to update you on how we re tracking against these priorities first starting with investment performance and fundraising our performance remains highly differentiated as it has for 30 plus years with 15 net returns from inception in opportunistic real estate and corporate private equity 14 in secondaries and 11 in tactical opportunities in credit these returns have generated a deep reservoir of investor trust and powered the blackstone innovation machine allowing us to meaningfully exceed our fundraising objectives for three years in a row we ve achieved over a 100 billion of inflows and while the fundraising for our largest flagship funds is behind us we should be approaching a 100 billion again this year investors want access to blackstone products more than ever secondly we re seeing faster growth in perpetual capital which is transforming our asset base and earnings into something much steadier than what we generated historically in the past our business primarily consisted of episodic drawdown funds and our capital deployment equated to planting the seeds of annuals that continues to be a terrific business but as our perpetual aum grows we are increasingly planning perennials which have a recurring and compounding contribution to the firm s financials in total perpetual aum increased 43 year over year to a 104 billion these vehicles were generally characterized by lower return targets as well as management fees and performance revenues calculated on nav and no mandatory return of capital this has helped drive our fee related earnings to record levels for both the quarter and the year to give you a sense of the power of the blackstone brand coupled with the shift to perpetual capital look no further than breit this vehicle which just had its third birthday saw 2 8 billion of inflows in the fourth quarter with aum nearly tripling year over year to 13 billion demand continues to accelerate as we add new distribution partners resulting in an additional 1 4 billion of inflows on january 1st we re deploying the capital well into unique investments including most recently sale leasebacks on the mgm grand and mandalay bay in las vegas when you take our leading real estate franchise and offer an institutional quality product to retail investors the results are powerful including breit our real estate core business has grown to 46 billion up 31 year over year other perpetual vehicles include our 14 billion infrastructure fund and our credit bdc when we sold our interest in our prior 20 billion bdc platform in 2018 we told you that we would quickly rebuild one of the leading direct lending businesses in the world with full ownership of the economics including separate accounts our u s direct lending platform in total has grown to over 12 billion of aum a testament to the strength of our credit team and our brand third in terms of our shift toward faster growing parts of the economy you can see it in multiple places a little over a year ago we acquired a small but highly talented life sciences team with tremendous domain expertise and plugged them into the blackstone platform and fundraising engine we raised 3 2 billion in the first close for our new fund in december and fully expect to hit the 4 5 billion hard cap representing a five fold increase compared to the prior fund and we are incredibly proud of the lifesaving advances blackstone life sciences is accelerating most recently in the bladder cancer area in addition to life sciences we ve just started raising our first dedicated fund in growth equity and in asia we ll be in the market this year with our second regional private equity fund which along with our asia opportunistic and core real estate funds will further augment our capital in this fast growing region we also continue to invest in rapidly growing businesses in the fourth quarter we announced a 3 billion acquisition of magiclab the parent of bumble an emerging leader in the online dating market other promising investment themes include company s focus on cloud migration content creation and last mile logistics in total across the firm we deployed over 17 billion in the quarter and a record 63 billion for the full year setting the foundation for future realizations fourth we ve talked about increasing our presence in the underserved retail and insurance markets in 2019 we raised a record 26 billion from retail investors most of which came from customized products and we hope to exceed that amount this year in insurance we now manage over 60 billion of aum with significant runway ahead a few weeks ago we announced hiring gilles dellaert to lead this initiative gilles is a deep industry and investment expert with lots of experience and is a perfect choice to drive this business forward fifth even as the firm continues to grow rapidly we ve told you we do not need to utilize capital to produce that growth in fact over the past two years while aum has grown approximately 140 billion to 571 billion our balance sheet investments declined to just 1 9 billion we have no net debt and basically no need for capital as a result we ve been able to return a 100 of earnings to shareholders over the past two years we continue to pay out enormous dividends and our repurchase program has resulted in a share count that is lower today than two years ago sixth we told you we wanted to make our stock easier to understand and own we simplified our reporting to focus on distributable earnings which reflect the cash earnings of the company we implemented a share buyback program with the commitment to keeping the share count flat and of course we converted the firm to a corporation these changes have been met with a positive response by the market we re gratified that shareholders are starting to recognize the power of this franchise in closing blackstone is in terrific shape by any measure and we are holding firm to the path we outlined our clients are quite pleased with our performance and are entrusting us with more of their capital our people are energized and proud to work at the firm and the opportunities for continued growth even in a challenging investment environment are significant with that i will turn things over to michael michael chae senior managing director and chief financial officer thanks jon and good morning everyone our fourth quarter results represent a very strong conclusion to an outstanding year total aum rose 21 year over year or approximately 100 billion to new record levels the result of 134 billion of gross inflows and 33 billion of market appreciation despite 40 billion of realizations inflows continue to be broad based across the firm including 57 billion in private equity and 34 billion in real estate both record years for those segments along with 31 billion in credit and 12 billion in baam as jon alluded to despite the successful completion of our flagship so called super cycle we expect another very strong year of inflows in 2020 indeed two thirds of 2019 s inflows or 86 billion were from products outside of the four flagship funds the majority of which were from strategies that continuously raise capital i ll discuss the fundraising pipeline in a moment fee earning aum grew 19 to 408 billion of which nearly a quarter is now perpetual fee related earnings continued on the strong positive trajectory outlined previously up 23 to a record 1 8 billion for the full year or 1 49 per share despite the firm s numerous growth initiatives fre margin expanded over 200 basis points to 48 4 in 2019 the highest level ever distributable earnings for the year rose 7 to 2 9 billion for the fourth quarter de rose 27 to 914 million or 0 72 per share underpinned by 27 growth in fre and a 33 increase in net realizations in terms of key drivers the fourth quarter included the benefit of performance revenues crystallizing for both breit and baam as a result in real estate fee related performance revenues more than tripled year over year to 150 million and in baam performance revenues increased five fold to 109 million while de more than doubled to 185 million the result of a healthy 8 2 gross composite return for the year across a growing aum base fourth quarter also marked the best quarter for realizations in two years and included the final exit of our position in invitation homes and the sale of our swedish residential platform hembla among other sales these deals exemplify the firm s high conviction approach in this case the significant need for investment capital in high quality residential housing stock in total realizations in our opportunistic brep and corporate pe funds were completed at an aggregate multiple of 2 2 times invested capital consistent with the strong long term historical performance of these platforms turning to investment performance in real estate the brep funds had another excellent quarter appreciating 4 7 in private equity the tac opps and secondaries funds reported similarly strong results appreciating 7 7 and 5 4 respectively the corporate pe funds appreciated 1 5 with stable underlying performance partly offset by declines in two public positions excluding these corporate pe appreciation was 4 7 in credit the performing credit cluster rose a healthy 3 8 growth while the distressed cluster declined 0 8 in a continued challenged distressed market and lastly in baam the composite gross return was 2 2 for the quarter overall fund appreciation drove the net performance revenue receivable up 22 year over year to 4 3 billion its highest level in nearly five years despite strong realizations at the same time performance revenue eligible aum in the ground rose 18 year over year to a record 249 billion while our dry powder balance increased to a record 151 billion this sustained momentum in terms of both fundraising and deployment puts the firm in an excellent position to continue building long term value for shareholders moving to the outlook first in terms of fundraising the pipeline for 2020 remains extensive as i mentioned we are in the market with and expect to complete fundraising this year for life sciences the fourth real estate debt fund the second gp stakes fund the second european direct lending fund and the third infrastructure secondaries fund we ve launched fundraising for our second core private equity vehicle and expect a significant first close in the next few months we ve also started raising our new growth equity and impact funds and later this year we ll start raising our second pe asia and fourth credit mezzanine funds in addition to the significant number of drawdown funds we expect continued strong growth in real estate core including breit along with ongoing inflows in u s direct lending long only credit and insurance among other areas in total 2020 should be another robust year moving to the fre outlook and our previously outlined roadmap in terms of key drivers three of the four flagship funds are now raised and activated we expect to activate the fourth global private equity in the coming quarters following the execution of one or two more deals in the predecessor fund bcp vii bcp viii is then subject to a four month fee holiday we previously discussed a path to 2 per share of fre including achieving greater than 1 70 in 2020 while we will not be giving specific guidance our confidence in exceeding these original targets is very high and thinking about the shape of 2020 overall i d share the following thoughts we entered the year with a promising pipeline for 2020 realizations which we expect to build and materialize as we move through the course of the year in addition given the meaningful growth in scale and financial contribution of the firm s perpetual vehicles which generally earn performance revenues at year end there is a seasonal benefit that was evident in our 2019 results and we expect the seasonality to continue going forward as such we believe more than ever it is most informative to look at the firm s earnings over a full calendar year in closing at our investor day in september of 2018 we shared a roadmap with respect to the near and longer term financial outlook for the firm we described then a path for record fundraising and we subsequently delivered nearly 200 billion of total inflows we outlined a powerful step up in fre and annual fre has already increased 30 in the six quarters since that time and continues on a sharp upward trajectory and we made the case that our stock was substantially undervalued ahead of the rerating which is now under way we entered 2020 in a position of tremendous strength and remain fully committed to continue to deliver for our investors with that we thank you for joining the call and would like to open it up now for questions questions and answers operator thank you and thank you everyone your question and answer session will now begin thank you okay so your first question comes from the line of glenn schorr he is from evercore please go ahead glenn you re live in the call glenn schorr evercore analyst hi thank you i appreciate it i guess just looking for an update on two of the business platforms different questions but just an update on insurance you ve made some key hires there there s talk of a lot of risk transfer deals going on in the marketplace so an update there and then in the secondary business where your performance is awesome there s been a ton of money being raised in the market including now goldman sachs in the market like just your thoughts for the secondaries business going forward and do you see that same supply of money coming in thanks jonathan gray president and chief operating officer thanks glenn i ll start with the secondary business yes there has been a big fundraising in that space including our fundraising but i think you have to put it in context overall alternatives are now i think a 6 trillion business and last year about 100 billion transacted so less than 2 of the market so it s a market where as investors keep allocating and by the way as you know alternatives are growing 8 to 10 a year there is still not enough liquidity so if you re a fund manager and you want to sell interest in a certain sector or older vintage funds it s hard to do and so what we re seeing is a market response where new capital is coming in i think the good news is that the discounts that exist in terms of buying these interests have persisted and so we still see it as a very favorable place to deploy capital and in fact sp has already committed 50 of its latest private equity funds so even though the business is growing we still think there s a lot of room here in terms of insurance this is a market that has obviously a lot of capital that is under pressure as a result of extremely low global interest rates there is a need to move out of investment grade corporate and sovereign debt and to look at things like direct private credit structured credit and alternatives we think we re pretty uniquely positioned to do that we announced as i mentioned the hiring of gill and we re looking at a number of situations so i think this could be a little bit lumpier but we re spending a lot of time tony in particular has been spending a lot of time on this and we re hopeful over time we re going to announce some meaningful things here stephen a schwarzman chairman chief executive officer and co founder i might just jump in considering we re still putting the building blocks in place we think getting having 60 billion over 60 billion of aum is a pretty good start from here the growth will be a lot like infrastructure or private equity in the sense that we ll have spurts of growth as we close funds and we close on deals but we remain as enthusiastic as ever i think glenn schorr evercore analyst okay thanks appreciate it thanks operator thank you and your next question comes from the line of michael cyprys from morgan stanley please go ahead michael you re live in the call michael cyprys morgan stanley analyst great thank you good morning stephen a schwarzman chairman chief executive officer and co founder good morning mike michael cyprys morgan stanley analyst hey so just curious how you re thinking about maybe a little bit bigger picture about the industry some might describe the last decade the 2010s as the golden age for private market just given the supportive market backdrop and significant growth in the asset class but i guess as we re sitting here today the industry has 2 trillion in dry powder you have purchased multiples leveraged multiple levels that are elevated debt terms that are looser with covenants so i m just curious how you would characterize the last decade for private markets and looking forward how will you describe what the 2020s what the 20s will be like as a decade for the private markets and how different might this be jonathan gray president and chief operating officer well mike i think we re in the early stages of the maturity of the alternative space i think big picture as you know in asset management we re seeing on the liquid side a lot of movement into etfs and passives because they ve outperformed over time active managers and on the other end of the barbell big movement into alternatives again because the performance has been really strong which is the blackstone story that is what underpins our success if the the question is are we sort of at the end of the runway just to put numbers on this i talked about 6 trillion in alternatives i think the investable universe if you look at institutional retail and insurance is something like i don t know 170 trillion so although it s grown a lot as a percentage of assets out there it s pretty small and if we are in an environment where interest rates will persist at a low level i think investors will increasingly be looking for trading some liquidity for higher returns which is what underpins so much of what we do so we think this is as i said still in the early stages of a maturity that this these businesses can continue to grow and i think what s also important to point out is people still think of this narrowly as private equity or real estate private equity very high returning strategies which obviously we continue to be market leaders in but what it s really about also is the spreading out here of all these different activities we re engaged in many of which are longer duration and have lower return targets and it s obviously easier to deploy capital if you re buying more stable assets that you hold for a long period of time without those same high targets so think about that in our credit bdc or in infrastructure or in core real estate and we still think we re in early days there so we have a fair degree of optimism it doesn t mean there won t be economic cycles along the way it doesn t mean markets won t go down of course that will happen but if you look out 10 years from now we envision the alternative space being much larger than what you see today michael cyprys morgan stanley analyst great thank you operator thank you your next question comes from the line of craig siegenthaler from credit suisse you re live in the call craig please go ahead craig siegenthaler credit suisse analyst thanks good morning everyone michael chae senior managing director and chief financial officer good morning jonathan gray president and chief operating officer good morning craig siegenthaler credit suisse analyst as we look toward the next annual russell 1000 out in june i was just hoping that you could provide us an update on your thoughts behind making small changes to your corporate governance which could include moving a small amount in voter rights in the float which would help bx qualify for the index and i know tracking for this index isn t huge from etfs in the mix funds it s around 4 but the shadow tracking from active managers that are benchmarked to the russell is much higher jonathan gray president and chief operating officer so on structure our structure and long term approach has really worked for us it s worked for our limited partners it s worked for our employees it s worked for our shareholders we like what it does in terms of the way we look at the world how we deploy capital and so the short answer is we don t have any plans to change our structure craig siegenthaler credit suisse analyst thank you jon operator okay thank you your next question comes from the line of chris harris from wells fargo you re live in the call chris please go ahead chris harris wells fargo analyst great thanks guys a question on direct lending lot of bdcs if you look at the public markets have not worked out very well i think quite a few of them are trading below nav and experiencing credit losses any thoughts on why the industry is having so many challenges in what s a pretty benign credit environment and how blackstone as you build this business out can really buck this trend jonathan gray president and chief operating officer well what i would point to is we have a mortgage reit blackstone mortgage trust that has performed extraordinarily well now for quite some time i want to say something like 15 compounded returns close to that maybe it s 13 now for six or seven years and there we ve been incredibly disciplined in being a first mortgage lender and being really thoughtful around credit as we build this direct lending platform we re very focused on making this a senior oriented lending platform if you look at a lot of the challenges that are out there a lot of it s focused on people stretching for yield doing things that take on undue credit risk and we think by staying very focused sort of in our lane very disciplined in how we finance the business much like blackstone mortgage trust we can deliver for our direct lending customers and for investors michael chae senior managing director and chief financial officer and i would just add on to that that in addition to our superior risk management in this area our origination capabilities creating deals our relationships with issuers sponsors corporates in this space we think is second to none and that s both in the u s and europe we have very large scale direct lending businesses as you know in both regions operator okay jonathan gray president and chief operating officer thanks chris operator thank you so your next question comes from the line of alex blostein from goldman sachs you re live in the call alex please go ahead alex blostein goldman sachs analyst great thanks good morning guys so i was hoping to dig a little bit more into the perpetual capital and the performance fees that it s that it generates for you guys and understanding the seasonality in the fourth quarter but it s obviously been important and will continue to be an important growth driver so maybe spend a couple of minutes there and what i m trying to get though i guess is maybe help us frame how much of the aum within the perpetual capital segment kind of locked in 2019 what that could look like into 2020 because i think there s like a three year kind of seasoning effect to it so just kind of help us frame the asset base and how meaningful that could be for you guys going forward jonathan gray president and chief operating officer i ll just one comment i d make is there s a range of sort of realizations that occur so breit is an annual realization actually our credit bdc i think is quarterly some the core bpp vehicles are every three years infrastructure is every three years we have a couple of co investments that are five years so there s a range and breit is the fastest growing piece of this but i don t know michael you want to add michael chae senior managing director and chief financial officer i think that s a great setup because it is a mix of those strategies across breit bpp or bdc business bxmt infrastructure with different characteristics but what s happening here and you really saw it reveal itself in this quarter and this year the fourth quarter and 19 is in particular the breit driver of our business tripling our performance our fee related performance revenues in the real estate segment year over year and that sort of trajectory is going to continue between the fundraising the deployment and the performance and again it is scheduled it s recurring we know it will happen on a date certain at the end of every year and so that alongside the other products which will in the case of bpp and in infrastructure layer in fees according to those sort of multi year anniversaries and then the bdc business which as jon said has that quarterly cadence to it and is also in ramp mode over time all those things together are very powerful and as i pointed out in my remarks perpetual capital is now basically a quarter of our fee earning aum so and growing rapidly as jon said so those things together are a very important narrative jonathan gray president and chief operating officer and i would just add one additional point which is in bpp it s every three years from when the investor comes in so it s not the same three year period so as bpp grows you ll every quarter there should be different investors different times of the year as they come along so there s a maturity that s going on here that business continues to grow we announced a large deal in the last week in japan which will be another i think important piece as we grow our core real estate business in asia as well and so having more and more of these vehicles that are open on a quarterly basis to raise capital deploy capital and then take incentive fees based on nav as opposed to sales that really is what we re talking about in terms of perennials operator okay thank you so your next question comes from the line of bill katz from citi you re live in the call bill please go ahead william katz citi analyst okay thank you very much for taking the questions this morning maybe a two part question if i can slip it in just maybe both for mike perhaps first question is just thank you for sort of firming the sort of the med pathway on fre just sort of wondering if you could update us on your thinking around the related margins to that and then a bigger picture question for either one of you guys just given the significant multiple expansion that blackstone has enjoyed over the last year post the c corp conversion your thoughts on capital return in any way jonathan gray president and chief operating officer you go first go on i ll do the second michael chae senior managing director and chief financial officer sure i ll take the more narrow one hey bill on margins you heard us say that over long periods of time we sort of average 100 basis points 200 basis points a year but not always every year and we continue to see that sort of structural aspect of our business obviously in a year like 2019 and in a year like 2020 where we re in a more rapid acceleration mode on fre growth the operating leverage benefit among other things is even more powerful so we re not going to make a call around margins this year but we feel good about certainly staying on that sort of trajectory jonathan gray president and chief operating officer so as it relates to capital return we like our model as i said on the call we re paying out 100 of our earnings today it s roughly 85 in the context in dividends and 15 in share buybacks we think giving this capital back to shareholders is the right thing to do and we like the mix at this point bill of how we re doing it william katz citi analyst thank you operator thank you very much and your next question comes from the line of gerry o hara from jefferies you re live in the call gerry please go ahead gerald o hara jefferies analyst great thanks maybe just a little bit on the 100 billion of fundraising that you kind of pointed to for this upcoming year clearly one of the flagship funds is in the mix there but perhaps you could sort of point to the components of where you see some of the outsized fundraising coming from a product or a strategy standpoint as we look forward the next 12 months thank you jonathan gray president and chief operating officer so i would say it s a mix we talked about what oh yeah i would say it s a mix in our core real estate area which includes obviously as we ve mentioned breit bpp it s continued growth in direct lending we talked about raising our next vintage of both corporate and real estate mezz those are both should be sizable funds it s some of these new initiatives like growth equity impact michael touched on all of these things but it s just the breadth and depth of the platform continues to expand and that s why as opposed to in the past where you could point to one or two things very large flagships today there are just multiple areas we re raising capital for many of which are now open full year round michael chae senior managing director and chief financial officer okay thanks gerry operator okay thank you so your next question comes from ken worthington from jpmorgan you re live in the call ken please go ahead kenneth worthington jpmorgan analyst hi good morning you ve given us a bunch of outlook it was very helpful and i was hoping you could complete the picture with maybe some colors on the realization outlook for this year for private equity and real estate so if market conditions remained similar to where they are today maybe how does the seasoning of investments what does that suggest for this year for your pipeline versus maybe what you ve experienced in 2019 michael chae senior managing director and chief financial officer yes ken i d sort of refer back to my comments in my remarks that as always it s early in the year by definition we don t give much by way granular sort of guidance certainly but we entered the year with as i said a promising pipeline across both those businesses and particularly some pretty chunky projects we re working on and we ll see how they play out in the course of the year so our teams are working hard on all those fronts and we do have assets in companies in position in conducive markets for potential events and then obviously in terms of the big picture you re asking about 2020 but longer term as we talked about the sort of the net accrued performance revenue receivable position the highest in over four years where we are on invested performance eligible aum in the ground 250 billion all those are basically mathematical indicators of the kind of the long term trajectory for monetization potential kenneth worthington jpmorgan analyst okay thanks worth a try i appreciate it michael chae senior managing director and chief financial officer thanks ken operator thank you your next question comes from the line of mike carrier from bank of america you re live in the call mike please go ahead michael carrier bank of america analyst hi good morning and thanks for taking the question you ve had great success in the retail channel i think you said 26 billion in 19 can you just give us an update on that opportunity maybe in terms of platforms in the u s and even outside the u s that you have relationships with maybe the types of products that are gaining traction in addition to breit and then any new initiatives in the pipeline joan solotar senior managing director sure so as we ve mentioned in the past there are three ways that we re building that out one is to deepen and broaden the relationships in the channels that we re in and that s a very real opportunity second is grow the distributors and that s both domestically and also regionally and third is new product and i would say all of those are happening in earnest the penetration remains incredibly low and just as jon alluded to on the institutional side if you think about individuals in a low interest rate environment where stock markets are pretty high there s a real desire to reallocate to alternatives so i would say the current product set as we talked about the perpetuals that are out there those continue to gain traction with advisors we re already working with as well as new advisors there s been a lot of growth on that internationally very attractive and then without going into detail there is what we believe will be a category killing product that we plan to launch by the end of this year and that will be a global launch and then we have a few other things that are in the lab as well so i still think it s quite early days jonathan gray president and chief operating officer so i would just add to joan s comments by saying the retail channel is where you really see the power of our brand that our ability to sell these products across not just the united states but the world is very very powerful and so as we create things that work for these markets and we spend a lot of time trying to develop them we think we have a receptive audience and we re going to be disciplined joan is talking about something that s a potential these things always take time to get done but when we deliver something as we ve done in breit and we think we can do it with other products we think the market is very large for the kind of things we do michael carrier bank of america analyst all right thanks a lot operator thank you your next question comes from the line of devin ryan from jmp securities you re live in the call devin please go ahead devin ryan jmp securities analyst thanks good morning and it s jmp securities appreciate the question and most have been asked and answered but just a question on the infrastructure opportunity 8 billion of inflows last year 2 5 billion deployed almost 14 billion committed it feels like its maybe a little bit quieter there given all the other irons in the fire but i m just curious if we can get an update on the trajectory of the strategy and just kind of momentum and the opportunities there jonathan gray president and chief operating officer sure as i said earlier this is a space we have a lot of enthusiasm for we ve deployed about 20 at this point of the fund it s a little bit lumpier just because of the nature of the assets you re buying more concentrated we feel good about the pace i would tell you our pipeline actually looks robust today and i wouldn t be surprised in the first half of the year if we announce a number of transaction it s obviously competitive in a low interest rate environment lots of institutions are looking at infrastructure but we think our ability to source big opportunities to deal with public market situations as we did with tallgrass our ability to intervene in assets and i think that s really important for us as a firm to really add value that will enable us to deploy the capital and this is a business i would expect over time that would be much much larger than 14 billion devin ryan jmp securities analyst thank you operator okay thank you and your next question comes from the line of brian bedell from deutsche bank you re live in the call brian please go ahead brian bedell deutsche bank analyst great thanks good morning folks maybe just switching gears a little bit to deployment jon maybe if you want to just characterize i mean a couple of thoughts there obviously the dry powder continues to build up up over a third year on year deployment level is definitely healthy but maybe if you can just talk about what the plan the longer term plan is for deployment given your very robust fundraising are you concerned that is you re going to have too much dry powder hanging around and as you look at the valuations where do you find challenges and where you find more opportunities that you think can keep those deployment levels healthy and returning high returning over the long term jonathan gray president and chief operating officer that is obviously a very timely question i was at a pension fund yesterday i was asked about this and i talked about it being a challenging time i would just reiterate a few of the things i said earlier first is because of the expansion of the platform we just have many more places to deploy capital and not all of them are super high return strategies so the ability to do infrastructure and direct lending and core real estate deals and do them around the world is very helpful i talked about the sale leasebacks in las vegas those are very innovative transactions done by the real estate team that we would not have done previously without these vehicles we talked about a bladder cancer drug that is very promising that our life sciences team deployed 400 million into again the expansion of the platform there allows you to invest in a sector that has i think pretty favorable dynamics given limited competition i d also say that for us scale is still our calling card steve talked about glp which was a 20 billion transaction we did the merlin transaction in the theme park area a 9 billion transaction again in a newer vehicle core private equity so big deals there s still not as much competition our ability to intervene i would point out that we bought hilton in 2007 obviously not ideal timing and yet because we brought in a terrific management team worked closely with them the company succeeded and thrived we ended up making 14 billion for our investors and so there are opportunities even in a challenging market and i would not compare this to the excesses of 06 07 and then specifically what i d say is there are places in the world where we think value looks better i ve talked in the past about the u k brexit does make it grow more slowly but the market has traded off considerably in dollar terms we re still big fans of india which is a market that has a bit of financial turmoil but has really great long term fundamentals particularly in the it space and we ve done a lot in real estate and private equity secondaries i mentioned an area we think there s a need for more capital the leverage loan market which gets a lot of bad press i think the fact that spreads there are wider than high yield even though these loans are senior in the capital structure doesn t make a lot of sense to us particularly given the low default rates and very strong coverage ratios and then as i mentioned a lot of focus on some of these thematic areas like last mile logistics cloud migration or live entertainment a bunch of things aging populations global travel trying to get behind those because in a world of high valuations and low growth being a high conviction investor really makes a difference so i can see it s a tough time to deploy capital on the other hand our platform are set up and the themes we believe in are still giving us the opportunity to put out money brian bedell deutsche bank analyst it s great perspective thank you operator thank you and your final question comes from chris shutler from william blair you re live in the call chris please go ahead chris shutler william blair analyst hi guys thanks big picture question just given the firm s tremendous growth in recent years i m wondering if you can talk about the process for approving transactions and how that s evolved just given the significant jump in deployment i guess ultimately i m trying to understand how from a management standpoint you re monitoring quality versus a few years ago just given the increase in the throughput thanks jonathan gray president and chief operating officer i love that question that is what our business is all about fundraising is obviously important but it s all about investment performance and we talk about it we had our partners meeting this week we talked about it at length we talk about it all the time which is maintaining our discipline the most important thing is that we run a centralized investment process what we ve done is made mondays a lot busier at blackstone in terms of the number of global investment committees we do not we have folks on the ground doing different activities all around the world but we still allocate capital centrally and so it means the number of memos some of us are reading on a weekend are quite substantial but we think that is very important and we can never let go of that and so we are spending more time we re also populating more of our people from different areas across the investment committees we re trying to make sure we have as much connective tissue as possible and so it doesn t matter if its life sciences or growth equity whatever new part of the firm we create it all gets back sort of connected back into the mother ship and then we have the same process of heads up committee memos pre ic committee memos review committee investment committee memos all going through multiple layers in each group so that we try to reduce the number of defects it doesn t mean they ll never be mistakes but it greatly reduces the number it s the reason why the firm has been so successful for so long it s something that steve has preached since the beginning and we re sticking with this formula so as we grow we will continue to have a very very disciplined and focused investment committee process and the final thing i d say is the one thing today that worries us the most and obviously there are political issues interest rates all sorts of things the big thing is the disruption that s happening in almost every industry how it s impacting these businesses as technology changes and that i can tell you it doesn t matter if it s an infrastructure deal or a credit deal real estate private equity doesn t matter that is the number one focus when we look at the risk and the downside of new investments chris shutler william blair analyst okay thanks jon operator okay thank you and now i d like to hand you back to weston tucker for final remarks weston tucker head of investor relations great thanks everyone for joining us this morning and look forward

since 2015 there has been an annual negotiation at the united nations palais des nations in geneva that touches the very nerve centre of corporate capitalism this event stems from the june 2014 united nations human rights council unhrc resolution 29 6 that set up an intergovernmental working group to elaborate a legally binding instrument to regulate transnational corporations it was a historic initiative as it demonstrated that corporate rule which many still see as unquestionable can be challenged and confronted it is unsurprisingly a negotiation that has been contested every step of the way revealing the often conflicting but sometimes coinciding interests among the three major actors states corporations and the affected communities social movements and civil society organisations csos this trajectory sees the convergence of diverse paths for states assuming a new historic responsibility to put a binding treaty in place that addresses the acknowledged gap in human rights law the architecture of corporate power and impunity and access to justice for corporations the repeated defence of the status quo legitimising corporate violations of human rights and profits before peoples rights and for affected communities and social movements persistent resistance building law from below and sustaining pressure on governments addressing systemic corporate impunity ever since transnational corporations tncs became major global actors affected communities factory workers and social movements have resisted this corporate economic model by 2000 communities and workers worldwide had protested against tnc crimes including such iconic cases as the union carbide pesticide plant s poisonous gas leak in bhopal in 1984 shell s ruptured pipeline in bodo nigeria 2008 2009 chevron s dumping of crude oil in ecuador 1964 1992 european corporations fossil fuels energy agriculture manufacturing blocking of significant reductions in co 2 emissions and british petroleum s bp deep water horizon explosion april 2010 in the gulf of mexico ____________________ ____________________ while the resistance of affected communities has been a constant challenge to the operations of tncs and their human rights violations it was the joint convening of the permanent people s tribunal ppt sessions by the hemispheric social alliance hsa and the enlazando alternativas on european corporations in latin america 2004 2010 that kick started a new process of bringing the different movements together and developing a shared analysis of the corporate violations of human rights in the process of sharing experiences of 46 cases in three sessions they not only pointed to the specific corporate violations of human rights but also identified their systemic character the verdicts identified an architecture of impunity generated by different trade and investment agreements and the global institutions of the world trade organization wto the international monetary fund imf and the world bank that legitimised and prioritised protections and privileges to corporations over the human rights of communities and workers this notably includes the investor to state dispute system isds whereby tncs can unilaterally sue states for actions that affect their profits the ppt judgement in madrid in may 2010 concluded that the human rights of people in latin america and europe faced an impenetrable wall of impunity and denial of justice in relation to tncs operations it noted that global corporate rule had become entrenched privileging profits above peoples rights and the protection of the planet isds cases since the 1990s source unctad 2019 the ppt judgement was a watershed in the movement towards an international binding regulatory framework for tncs operations calling for the united nations human rights council to draw up a compulsory code of conduct for tncs and for affected communities and social movements to develop a mandatory legal framework in the context of international law envisaged as one of the first steps on the path to creating a different world order the global campaign to reclaim peoples sovereignty dismantle corporate power and stop impunity global campaign was established in 2012 following extensive consultation on how to develop a strategy addressing corporate impunity it also initiated the development of a peoples treaty on transnational corporations the campaign had two main pillars a judicial pillar preparing detailed proposals for a binding international regulatory framework for tncs and an alternatives pillar

adopts resolution 2005 69 asking the un secretary general kofi annan to appoint a special representative to address tncs impacts on human rights annan appoints professor john ruggie who develops the united nations guiding principles ungps a voluntary reference framework with no legal obligations 2011 united nations guiding principles on business and human rights adopted ungps adopted by the unhrc along with mandates for implementation also set up a new working group of experts on business and human rights and a forum on business and human rights overcoming the voluntary approach by 2012 decades of attempts to regulate tncs at the international level had been defeated the main initial challenge was to overcome the international consensus in favour of a voluntary led approach to corporate violations of human rights which were embodied in the ungps developed by professor john ruggie and promoted as the mechanism for advancing human rights in relation to corporate violations and abuse these were formally adopted at the un in 2011 and claimed as the upper limit of human rights protection however the track record of tncs operations on the ground and the denial of justice to those affected by them gave little reason to expect anything different as a result of the ungps communities dealing with the devastating operations of tncs insisted that self regulation was not enough and demanded that only binding regulation could address the glaring gap in international human rights law in relation to tncs while ruggie and particularly governments in the north continued to insist that the ungps were the only deal in town some governments in the south continued to call for binding regulation kept alive by resistance by affected communities and social movements this demand resurged in september 2013 when ecuador and south africa supported by at least 85 governments submitted a joint statement to the 24th regular session of the unhrc indicating the intention to re open the agenda of a legally binding regulatory framework for tncs the ungps have failed to stop corporate impunity since 2011 affected communities and movements have repeatedly noted the inability of voluntary codes to address corporate violations of human rights and damage to ecosystems analysis of the 101 world s largest corporations in sectors known to pose a threat to human rights confirms this failure to implement the ungps 40 of tncs could not certify the application of due diligence measures on human rights virtually none could prove that they met the commitment to pay living wages in their own operations or in their supply chains in 70 of the cases studied tncs in the textile and agribusiness sectors had no measures in place to ensure respect for women s rights in their own operations or in those of their suppliers less than 10 of companies had some policy of protecting human rights defenders 50 of companies in the textile and agribusiness sectors failed to meet their commitments to prevent child labour in supply chains source corporate human rights benchmark 2018 key findings apparel agricultural products and extractives companies converging forces at the un in june 2014 ecuador and south africa s move was immediately backed by organisations of the global campaign which voiced strong support soon afterwards the treaty alliance was launched when members of the global campaign joined with several other human rights networks and organisations in geneva to set up a broad coalition to work for a binding treaty the result was the historic vote in support of resolution 26 9 which established an open ended inter governmental working group oeigwg on transnational corporations and other business enterprises with respect to human rights whose mandate shall be to elaborate an international legally binding instrument to regulate in international human rights law the activities of transnational corporations and other business enterprises the resolution was carried by a small majority at the unhrc supported by governments of the global south and opposed by each eu member state in the unhrc as well as by states in which major tncs are based such as japan the republic of south korea and the united states the vote thus made clear the geopolitical struggle that would mark every step of the way in the binding treaty process feminists for a binding treaty in 2015 civil society engagement in support of the binding treaty was further expanded with the setting up of the feminists for a binding treaty this network mobilises women and highlights gender perspectives in the advocacy for the binding treaty they focus on three key proposals 1 mandatory gender impact assessments of business activities 2 gender sensitive justice and remedy mechanisms and 3 ensuring respect protection and an enabling environment for women human rights defenders source awid et al 2017 integrating a gender perspective into the legally binding instrument on transnational corporations and other business enterprises statement binding treaty process a site of constant contestation since its launch in 2014 the unhrc process has revealed the conflicts of interest and contradictions by the three main protagonists states tncs and civil society this has seen tncs ally with governments predominantly from countries that host the largest transnational corporations on one side while social movements ally with some supportive governments from the global south at the same time as urging governments of the global north to participate actively and constructively in the process tncs assert their interests and influence through their associations and as civil society organisations with ecosoc status at the unhrc where they are represented through the icc and the ioe which is also represented in the tripartite international labour organization ilo both organisations present their perspectives in the panels and conferences of the oeigwg meetings and also take the floor during the sessions and submit written positions in the formal process they have consistently claimed that the proposed treaty will have a negative impact on investment in developing countries a position also reflected by pro corporate lawyers and academics at the unhrc there has been a longstanding debate on why the icc and ioe are classified as csos with ecosoc status especially given their conflict of interest with an agenda focused on human rights and corporate accountability by comparison the world health organization who framework convention on tobacco control fctc excludes tobacco corporations in the bodies implementing the fctc as a result of campaigns exposing corporate funding of so called independent research in tandem with their direct interventions tncs present themselves as models of good practice in relation to human rights at the annual forum on business and human rights at the unhrc in geneva the aim of this event is to show that voluntary self regulation works and that binding treaty obligations are an unnecessary burden which is belied by its members practices the brazilian mining company vale for instance attended several annual forums despite its disregard for safety standards resulting in two dam collapses releasing millions of tonnes of toxic waste and mud from mining operations at mariana november 2015 and brumadinho january 2019 in the state of minas gerais it is estimated that hundreds of people died as a result of the devastation and the poisoning of rivers and land is among brazil s worst environmental disasters communities in mariana demanding justice and reparations photo credit yuri barichivich greenpeace the influence and success of corporate lobby is evident in the way the discourse is echoed by the us eu member states and other northern states with the backing of states from other regions particularly the current right wing governments in chile colombia and guatemala their shared discourse approach and tactics towards the binding treaty process is to do everything possible either to block it or render it meaningless even if the full implications of corporate capture at the un remain obscure many concerns have been raised on how this plays out in relation to the un mechanisms on human rights for instance the agreement between microsoft and the high commissioner for human rights in 2015 was seen as a classic case of a non transparent corporate donation coming as it did in the first year of the oeigwg process a highly sensitive time in relations between tncs and affected communities the absence of full disclosure on its purpose was questioned the obstructive tactics of the corporations states nexus range from rhetorical to procedural and political the rhetorical approach has been most evident in the introduction of the global compact and the ungps the adoption of the ungps in 2011 has been treated as a basis for rejecting other approaches until these have been properly implemented they are also claimed to be more legitimate since they were adopted by consensus whereas a binding treaty will require a voting process it is also asserted that they are more legitimate than a process led by states that have their own shortcomings in respecting human rights one key discursive battle concerns the scope of a potential treaty with the eu pushing from the beginning to include all business enterprises at first sight this looks reasonable many states and csos believe that the treaty provisions should also be applied to small and medium enterprises smes that said smes are covered under national legislation whereas there is a major legal gap in international law that legitimates and protects the impunity of tncs because of strong legal protection of their rights and privileges through trade and investment agreements their mobility vast economic power and increasing political influence tncs continue to operate with impunity the major asymmetry of power and structure between tncs and smes requires a different approach this concern has been frequently raised by southern states that have no national flagship tncs and whose economies are mainly led by smes that are subject to domestic laws and which unlike mobile tncs cannot escape accountability for this reason many interpret the eu s position as a tactic to derail the process at the procedural level the most serious challenge has been to the position of the oeigwg chair and the body s function as a state led process the eu in particular has also strongly argued for the chair to be occupied by an expert similar to the ungp process the eu delegation has also tried other diversionary tactics such as delaying sessions by threatening not to adopt the plan of work or complaining about the lack of adequate consultation in drafting the texts at the political level there has been explicit pressure applied on developing countries calls to embassies and meetings have been reported informally including threats of cuts in investments or aid similarly in 2015 at the 5th committee of the unga which approves the un budget each december eu member states threatened to block the approval of the budget for the functioning of the oeigwg the rapid mobilisation and response of the g77 countries and the pressure of csos helped protect this essential budget allocation for 2016 in the oeigwg sessions the european external action service eeas which represents the eu at the unhrc has repeatedly asserted a common eu position ignoring several european parliament ep resolutions that have been far more supportive of a binding treaty for example the 2018 ep resolution warmly welcomes in this context the work initiated in the united nations through the oeigwg to create a binding un instrument on transnational corporations and other business enterprises with respect to human rights and considers this to be a necessary step forward in the promotion and protection of human rights members of the ep meps together with some mps from the south set up the global interparliamentarian network gin now comprising over 300 members its representatives have participated in all sessions of the oeigw process and have co organised side events against the efforts of the corporations and their allied states social movements and some southern governments have mobilised actively to maintain momentum csos submitted dozens of written proposals and opinions during all four sessions and made many interventions from the floor linking specific situations with the need for a binding treaty and proposing specific changes to the official texts they have also consistently engaged representatives of all government missions at the unchr and to the oeigwg chair in advocacy meetings and side events recently a group of interested countries and organisations from the global campaign have begun a series of informal policy dialogues to explore common positions and strategies towards achieving a meaningful treaty the process has been continuously energised by resistance struggles on the ground whether against oil and gas extraction and contamination land and ocean grabs mega dam collapses poisoning of water and land forest fires or the fall out from the textile and pharma industries each experience showed the urgent need for an international instrument to protect the rights of affected peoples and direct victims meanwhile the denial of justice in longstanding cases such as union carbide chevron and also in the more recent cases of rana plaza lonmin and vale demonstrate that the existing system is not working gaining traction at every session the result of this mobilisation has been that the process has moved forward despite countless attempts to derail it not simply holding its ground but gaining traction with 90 100 states participating in the 2018 and 2019 sessions by the third session 2017 the initial elements of a treaty began to be discussed a zero draft led the talks at the fourth session 2018 and a revised first draft was thoroughly discussed during the fifth session 14 18 october 2019 the programme of work covered all 22 articles in a constructive dynamic that heard many substantive contributions from more than 30 states as well as parliamentarians experts affected communities and civil society the 22 articles of the revised first draft include a basic set of framework provisions several with potential to facilitate access to justice the text proposes more effective mechanisms for mutual legal assistance among states as well as international cooperation and a proposal that could open up new possibilities of extra territorial obligations that is states obligations in relation to crimes committed by their tncs in another state s jurisdiction there is also reference to the legal liability of enterprises although the proposal is unclear about whether this refers to administrative or civil liability in terms of prevention the text mainly relies on the idea of due diligence in vogue since the adoption of the ungps france has recently passed a duty of vigilance law although its impact has yet to be seen in october 2019 an important test case was launched against total the formerly french oil company for violating the rights of communities in its operations in uganda likewise the revised first draft s provisions on the rights of victims could be the basis for further development especially if it is extended to include a broader definition of affected communities or people as the movement of people affected by dams mab in brazil proposed from the outset a conference of state parties and a treaty body have been proposed to follow the adoption implementation and improvement of the treaty these are standard un procedures and are often useful but to date have been used mainly to denounce states and not to enforce treaty provisions in relation to tncs nevertheless the conclusion of the 5th session means that the debate is no longer about whether there is a need for such a treaty and legally binding instrument that addresses tncs evident impunity and decisively opens the door to justice for affected communities for the first time states and all other actors have to position themselves study and explain the basis of their proposals based on content and address some hard questions how do we define the obligations of states and of tncs what mechanisms and instruments are needed to enforce the treaty how do we define tncs and the implications for all other businesses what role should the state play in implementing the treaty and what are the rights of victims and affected communities to obtain justice the achilles heel in the draft treaty from the perspective of affected communities and social movements the main controversial articles appear in the first three sections of the revised draft the first relates to the definition of tncs and their supply chains and related contractual relationships the second is the extension of the scope of the treaty to all business enterprises and the third is the reiteration of the state centred approach to responding to human rights violations each of which could be an achilles heel in this 2019 draft the state centred approach implicitly negates the idea that tncs have direct obligations and responsibilities related to human rights at international level this has been a central demand of the global campaign as it would mean that an affected community or person could have recourse to international jurisdiction regarding violations derived from the operation of tncs in this scenario a dedicated international court could for instance make a judgement against chevron in the case of the ecuadorian indigenous people udapt and the contamination of their region by the oil company s operations this proposal is still strongly contested by tncs and some states and even if many see it as a necessary evolution of human rights in a globalised world others feel it threatens well established human rights doctrine the latter defines the state as the only entity with obligations in the current international human rights framework which is why many argue that only states the duty bearers violate human rights the international human rights regime may not yet be ready for the major changes demanded by a meaningful binding treaty on tncs and so may explore other alternatives for instance stronger extra territorial obligations or inter jurisdictional cooperation although these are important measures that would shift the status quo they would not respond to the positions advanced by affected communities the current text does not include other substantive elements that have also been advocated by the global campaign and in official submissions among them the clear supremacy of human rights over trade and investment agreements the centrality of the rights of affected communities including clear mechanisms for consultation risk assessments and impacts as well as for research and investigation of situations that could potentially involve violations before they happen a stronger gender perspective and extended penal liability of the company along its supply and value chains and its subsidiaries including those responsible for decision making and overall corporate management and policy navigating the challenges ahead in almost 50 years of international attempts to end tnc violations of human rights and environmental standards this is the first time that affected peoples and civil society constituencies from six continents are actively engaged and in significant numbers this participation has been constant and growing since 2013 when the first joint statement by the global campaign was released this marks a significant step forward from earlier important processes in the area of binding regulations on tncs not even the unhrc peasants rights declaration process and debates generated the same traction and participation as the oeigwg has achieved in the past five years committed states are still too few while powerful forces are working to derail and block the process but five years on as the negotiations have resisted being undermined ever more states parliamentarians experts scholars and of course leaders and activists of affected communities social movements and civil society are engaging in the process recently even professor ruggie recognised this at a finnish government conference where he criticised the eu for not taking a supportive position on the binding treaty which he said is inevitable and desirable the process to establish a binding treaty on tncs has gained momentum against all the odds and already changed minds busting the myth that tncs are untouchable and helping to dismantle corporate power in the current phase of capitalism this is already a significant victory moving into terrain beyond the self regulation and ungps previously proposed by ruggie it moves us towards the central demand of affected communities one that rejects corporate rule whatever the eventual outcome this joint effort of states and affected communities has articulated a key issue the answer to which will define the coming decades for humanity and the planet we are at the edge of a new epoch where new and radical transformation will be necessary to address the intensifying contradictions within the economy politics and our relations with nature this binding treaty initiative is integral to a needed transformation and part of those ongoing struggles the question is whether it will finally generate the

expenses gains and losses and other specified items that management believes are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance these adjusted measures exclude the impact of i amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property ii acquisition and integration costs and iii ibm private cloud charges amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property represents non cash amortization expenses associated with the company s acquisition activities acquisition and integration costs represent certain transaction and integration costs associated with the company s acquisition activities ibm private cloud charges represent a charge on the hardware assets to be transferred to ibm and other charges related to the ibm private cloud agreement we exclude ibm private cloud charges from our adjusted operating income and other earnings measures because excluding such information provides us with an understanding of the results from the primary operations of our business and this item does not reflect ordinary operations or earnings we also exclude the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property as these non cash amounts are significantly impacted by the timing and size of individual acquisitions and do not factor into the company s capital allocation decisions management compensation metrics or multi year objectives furthermore management believes that this adjustment enables better comparison of our results as amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property will not recur in future periods once such intangible assets have been fully amortized although we exclude amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property from our adjusted earnings measures our management believes that it is important for investors to understand that these intangible assets contribute to revenue generation amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized any future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangible assets free cash flow in addition to the non gaap financial measures discussed above we provide free cash flow information because we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated that could be used for dividends share repurchases strategic acquisitions other investments as well as debt servicing free cash flow is a non gaap financial measure and is defined by the company as net cash flows provided by operating activities less capital expenditures as well as software purchases and capitalized internal use

brussels the eurozone economy which is made up of the 19 countries that use the euro currency ended 2019 with a whimper and recorded its worst year of growth since it was mired in a debt crisis in 2013 in its first estimate for the quarter statistics agency eurostat said the eurozone grew by only 0 1 from the previous three month period that is its lowest rate since the first quarter of 2013 when the single currency bloc was fighting a debt crisis that nearly spelled ruin for the euro itself recommended videos for 2019 as a whole the eurozone grew by only 1 2 again its lowest rate since 2013 when it shrank by 0 2 though eurostat did not provide explanations to its figures published friday the report confirms how the eurozone lost steam as a result of worries over a trade war between the u s and china that is having knock on effects around the world following the conclusion of a first round of trade talks with china president donald trump is turning his gaze towards europe and is threatening tariffs over what he considers to be the unfair treatment of american businesses by the european union uncertainty related to britain s departure from the eu which is officially taking place later friday has also hobbled business and trade the quarterly growth recorded was lower than the 0 2 anticipated in the markets and was largely due to the fact that two of the eurozone s biggest economies france and italy both contracted according to their respective statistics agencies their economies shrank by 0 1 and 0 3 france has endured a series of strikes over the winter that had a modest impact on household spending the main reason why france unexpectedly shrank during the quarter was related to a draw down of stocks by firms that has the potential to be reversed in the first quarter of 2020 which could see france bounce back italy s quarterly performance was its worst since 2013 and though a breakdown was not provided most economists think it was due to weak domestic demand spain provided some counterweight as it grew by a solid quarterly rate of 0 5 largely on the back of a strong export performance many countries including germany have still to report quarterly numbers so the overall eurozone number could be revised next month there are hopes that europe could enjoy a spring back this year largely because the trade tensions between the u s and china have eased following their so called phase 1 agreement and amid the greater brexit certainty with an encouraging recent rise in sentiment indicators we still think that the eurozone economy should see growth pick up gradually in 2020 said rosie colthorpe european economist at oxford economics in a separate report eurostat found that the annual rate of inflation across the eurozone rose to 1 4 in january from 1 3 the previous month largely as a result of higher energy prices the core inflation rate which strips out volatile items such as food and energy fell to 1 1 in january from 1 3 the fall in the core rate is likely be a cause for concern for policymakers at the european central bank including its new president christine lagarde by whatever measure inflation remains below the european central bank s goal of just below 2 and could fall further next month if the recent drop in oil prices following the virus outbreak in china persists the ecb is running a stimulus program to nudge up inflation and growth but is also undergoing a thorough review of how it tries to do that including whether it should change its inflation target

fourth quarter 2019 compared with 2 3 billion a year ago the decrease in earnings was partially due to write offs and impairment charges of 2 2 billion associated with kitimat lng and other gas projects partly offset by a gain of 1 2 billion on the sale of the u k central north sea assets and the absence of a fourth quarter 2018 asset write off also contributing to the decrease were lower

the reserve bank of australia rba is the sole major central bank that will meet next week but that doesn t mean the calendar is light as there s a cascade of crucial economic data to keep things exciting the us employment report will reveal whether the recent cracks in the labor market were just outliers in an otherwise healthy trend or early signs of weakness the answer could determine whether king dollar will continue to reign over the fx market more broadly risk sentiment will remain sensitive to any virus related news rba on hold but dovish guidance likely in store the rba has a tough balancing act on its hands when it concludes its policy meeting on tuesday on the one hand recent data have been solid enough to dispel market expectations for an immediate rate cut to support the economy with the implied probability for such an action currently resting at a lowly 15 the unemployment rate fell back down to 5 1 in december retail sales accelerated sharply in november and inflation picked up in q4 even if it remains stubbornly below the rba s target range however these are backward looking data and new risks have emerged for example several weeks of raging bushfires across australia threaten to dampen economic growth likewise the coronavirus epidemic amplifies downside risks for australia s economy not only due to spillover effects from a slowdown in china and falling commodity prices but also due to the sinister impact this might have on australia s tourism industry which relies heavily on chinese travelers and while the data pulse has improved lately by no means is it great australian households are among the most indebted in the world and wages aren t rising fast enough to ease the debt burden which is ultimately limiting consumption meanwhile underlying inflation remains stuck in low gear with little sign of an imminent pick up the bottom line is that although recent data is good enough to keep the rba s hand off the rate cut button for now the overall situation suggests the bank will keep a future rate cut very much on the table as for the aussie even if the rba doesn t cut rates this time the risks around the currency still seem tilted to the downside the bank will surely maintain a dovish bias global risk sentiment remains in the doldrums and australia s close trading ties with china expose its currency to any virus related weakness in the chinese economy going forward admittedly though the aussie has already fallen dramatically so whether or not sellers can break below the 10 year low of 0 6670 in aussie dollar may be crucial the nation s retail sales for december are also due on thursday nonfarm payrolls and ism pmis might steal the show in the united states the upcoming data releases might shape market expectations about whether and how soon the fed will cut rates again the week kicks off with the ism manufacturing pmi for january being released on monday ahead of the non manufacturing index on wednesday forecasts point to an uptick in both figures though that would still leave the manufacturing print stuck below 50 signaling continued contraction in the sector then on friday all eyes will turn to the employment numbers for january nonfarm payrolls are expected to clock in at 156k mildly higher than the 145k in december and a number consistent with further tightening in the jobs market the unemployment rate is forecast to hold steady at 3 5 while average hourly earnings are anticipated to accelerate slightly to 3 0 on a yearly basis from 2 9 previously the us labor market has displayed some signs of stress lately with real wage growth cooling substantially and job openings as measured by the jolts survey declining which may be an early indication that overall employment growth may be set to slow down this puts extra emphasis on the upcoming data to either confirm this weakening narrative or dispel such concerns especially considering markets are already pricing in an 85 probability for a fed cut by july turning to the dollar the big picture still seems positive to put it bluntly there s no alternative to the greenback right now which offers a special combination of safety and high er interest rates relative to other major currencies like the euro and yen for this narrative to change either the fed needs to start cutting rates aggressively or the eurozone has to announce a big spending package to boost growth and lift the euro neither of which seems likely anytime soon in the political sphere the democratic primary nomination process kicks off with the iowa caucuses on monday this will be the first state to vote on who should represent the democratic party against donald trump at the november presidential election while markets typically don t react much to primaries this time may be different as the frontrunner in iowa is senator bernie sanders who advocates for higher taxes so if he wins the state that might spook stock markets canadian jobs data eyed as boc weighs rate cut across the border in canada jobs data for january will hit the markets on friday as well following the dovish shift by the bank of canada boc lately the market derived chance for a rate cut by april now stands at 60 so incoming data will be crucial in shaping expectations the loonie has taken a beating so far this year amid a triple whammy of rising boc rate cut odds collapsing oil prices and coronavirus concerns dampening the prospects for global growth and thus for canada s export heavy economy looking ahead the loonie s fortunes may be tied to how the virus theme evolves especially since that will also drive oil prices in that sense virus fears could continue to plague markets for a while longer as there have been no signs yet that the situation is under control and there s a real risk that the chinese and therefore global economy will take a more severe hit from this than many expect hence the situation might get even uglier from here before it gets better chinese data unlikely to reveal any virus damage in the world s second largest economy the caixin manufacturing pmi monday and the services pmi wednesday for january will be in focus ahead of the nation s export and import data for the same month on friday alas these data are unlikely to reflect any real damage from the recent virus outbreak as concerns about the disease took center stage only during the final week of january hence these figures will probably be viewed as outdated by traders eliciting little market reaction the lock down of several chinese cities and the fact that numerous companies will remain closed in the coming weeks due to contagion fears suggest that china s economic data will take a severe hit from february onwards for global stocks and commodity currencies to see relief investors may first need to see concrete signs that the spread of the disease in china is slowing down drastically that would be an early indication that things may be about to get back to normal prompting a violent risk on rally however we are not there yet finally new zealand s labor market data for q4 will also be released late on tuesday
dream of 3 economic growth remained a dream despite surge in government borrowing and spending the dreams of 3 plus economic growth in the us remained dreams in 2019 despite tax cuts and ballooning federal government spending which are a stimulus but the resulting budget deficit caused the gross national debt to balloon far faster than gdp grew in the fourth quarter the economy as measured by inflation adjusted real gdp grew at an annual rate of 2 1 from the third quarter this brought the total growth of real gdp for all of 2019 to 2 3 which is the average annual gdp growth since 2012 this is according to the first estimate by the bureau of economic analysis released today based on incomplete data as more data accumulates the bea revises the estimates the next revision will be released on february 27 these revisions are often minor but sometimes they re whoppers completely changing the economic picture as they did for q4 2018 when the initial estimate of gdp growth was a hot 3 1 which was subsequently crushed down to a frigid 1 1 in q4 2019 the real gdp growth rate of 2 1 was essentially the same as over the prior two quarters and below the average growth rate since 2012 of 2 3 on the positive side in q4 imports of goods and services fell 8 7 with goods imports alone dropping 11 6 a decline in imports adds to gdp but exports ticked up only 1 4 an increase in exports adds to gdp also pushing up gdp in a big way federal government expenditures in q4 rose at an annual rate of 3 6 this brought the increase in federal government spending for the entire year 2019 to 3 5 defense spending surged 4 9 in 2019 nondefense spending inched up only 1 6 we ll get to the debt that this federal government spending produced in a moment growth was dragged down in q4 by the sharp decline in gross private domestic investment of 6 1 including a 10 1 drop in investment in structures and a 2 9 drop in investments in equipment consumer spending personal consumption expenditures adjusted for inflation which accounts for 68 of gdp grew at an annual rate of 1 8 in q4 while this growth rate was down from q3 3 1 and q2 4 6 it was higher than in q1 1 1 and in q4 2018 1 4 for the year 2019 consumer spending on this inflation adjusted basis grew 2 6 at the low end of the range of the past six years gdp measures the economy in terms of the dollars that are spent or invested by consumers businesses and governments in a given time period illegal spending and investing prostitution retail sales of controlled substances etc are not included in the us though there are discussions under way about including it nominal gdp which is measured in current dollars and is not adjusted for inflation increased by 4 1 in 2019 or by 849 billion from a year earlier to 21 4 trillion we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us where do these dollars in gdp growth come from gdp measures the flow of dollars at a certain point it does not include where the dollars came from that were invested or spent in other words gdp ignores the increase in debt most of what the federal state and local governments spend in the us and invest in the us enters into gdp either directly or indirectly much of what the federal government spent came from tax revenues fees and other receipts the remainder was funded by new debt in the calendar year 2019 the federal government s spending that made it directly into gdp calculations released today grew by 3 5 with defense spending surging 4 9 and nondefense spending ticking up 1 6 federal government deficit spending ballooned the us gross national debt by 1 23 trillion in the calendar year 2019 to 23 2 trillion but despite the surge in federal government spending causing additional federal borrowing of 1 23 trillion in 2019 growth in nominal gdp totaled only 849 billion let that stew for a moment what would the economy have done with a more moderate increase or no increase in federal borrowing and spending the chart below shows annual increases in nominal gdp in billion dollars blue and the annual increases in the gross national debt in billion dollars red neither are adjusted for inflation note the special effects just before during and right after the great recession nominal gdp growth plunged in 2008 and went negative in 2009 during that time unemployment skyrocketed companies collapsed federal tax receipts plunged federal expenditures surged unemployment insurance etc and the deficit and the gross national debt exploded but instead of going back to the prior arrangements where in good times nominal gdp grew faster than the national debt the national debt continued to outgrow nominal gdp the only exception was 2017 when the debt ceiling fight dragged a portion of the debt increase into 2018 average out 2017 and 2018 for a more accurate picture the year 2019 was also another milestone the ratio of the us gross national debt to gdp jumped to 108 up from 63 in 2006 on the eve of the financial crisis as all heck was already breaking loose and i will leave you with a chart of this issue that no one in washington pays attention to anymore other than the fed which pays lip service to it by occasionally calling the federal debt growth unsustainable when challenged in a press conference in terms of our elected officials in washington the rule is

operations for the periods indicated this information should be read together with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this press release the operating results in any period are not necessarily of the results that may be expected for any future period revenue on january 1 2018 the company adopted accounting standards update asu 2014 09 revenue from contracts with customers asc 606 using the modified retrospective method for contracts that were not completed as of january 1 2018 this did not result in an adjustment to retained earnings upon adoption of this new guidance as the company s revenue was recognized based on the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for satisfying the performance obligations the core principle underlying the revenue recognition asu is that the company will recognize revenue to represent the transfer of goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in such exchange this will require the company to identify contractual performance obligations and determine whether revenue should be recognized at a point in time or over time based on when control of goods and services transfers to a customer the company s revenue streams are primarily recognized at a point in time the asu requires the use of a new five step model to recognize revenue from customer contracts the five step model requires that the company i identify the contract with the customer ii identify the performance obligations in the contract iii determine the transaction price including variable consideration to the extent that it is probable that a significant future reversal will not occur iv allocate the transaction price to the respective performance obligations in the contract and v recognize revenue when or as the company satisfies the performance obligation the application of the five step model to the revenue streams compared to the prior guidance did not result in significant changes in the way the company records its revenue upon adoption the company evaluated its revenue recognition policy for all revenue streams within the scope of the asu under previous standards and using the five step model under the new guidance and confirmed that there were no differences in the pattern of revenue recognition all of our income from inception to 2019 is generated in china we facilitate loans by connecting borrowers and lenders preparing all necessary paperwork related to borrowers applications and assisting with securing

p2p lending industry after full payment of outstanding balance of loans furthermore in may 2019 the financial regulatory authority of shanghai required the company to gradually scale down the outstanding balance of loans it facilitated to reduce the number of lenders and borrowers as a result of these regulatory requirements the company s operation performance was far below expectations

negative evidence after the filing of form 20 f on april 30 2019 the company believes it is a result of regulatory requirements which did not exist on december 31 2018 and march 31 2019 the company witnessed an increase in the number of borrowers and revenues the company even made net income for the quarter ended march 31 2019 according to the definition of subsequent events in asc 855 10 20 the

250 10 45 17 a change in accounting estimate shall not be accounted for by restating or retrospectively adjusting amounts reported in financial statements of prior periods or by reporting pro forma amounts for prior periods as the change in estimates of deferred tax assets was a result of non recognized subsequent events the company believes it is not necessary to restate the form 20 f by recognition of a full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets instead the company would present the valuation allowance in our future filings including form 20 f for the fiscal year ending december

operations for the periods indicated this information should be read together with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this press release the operating results in any period are not necessarily of the results that may be expected for any future period revenue on january 1 2018 the company adopted accounting standards update asu 2014 09 revenue from contracts with customers asc 606 using the modified retrospective method for contracts that were not completed as of january 1 2018 this did not result in an adjustment to retained earnings upon adoption of this new guidance as the company s revenue was recognized based on the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for satisfying the performance obligations the core principle underlying the revenue recognition asu is that the company will recognize revenue to represent the transfer of goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in such exchange this will require the company to identify contractual performance obligations and determine whether revenue should be recognized at a point in time or over time based on when control of goods and services transfers to a customer the company s revenue streams are primarily recognized at a point in time the asu requires the use of a new five step model to recognize revenue from customer contracts the five step model requires that the company i identify the contract with the customer ii identify the performance obligations in the contract iii determine the transaction price including variable consideration to the extent that it is probable that a significant future reversal will not occur iv allocate the transaction price to the respective performance obligations in the contract and v recognize revenue when or as the company satisfies the performance obligation the application of the five step model to the revenue streams compared to the prior guidance did not result in significant changes in the way the company records its revenue upon adoption the company evaluated its revenue recognition policy for all revenue streams within the scope of the asu under previous standards and using the five step model under the new guidance and confirmed that there were no differences in the pattern of revenue recognition all of our income from inception to 2019 is generated in china we facilitate loans by connecting borrowers and lenders preparing all necessary paperwork related to borrowers applications and assisting with securing

vol 44 no 5 friday january 31 2020 eurozone economy records worst year since 2013 print front page email this story you have entered an invalid email address to required from required message you have entered an invalid email address from email required message required london ap the eurozone economy which is made up of the 19 countries that use the euro currency ended 2019 with a whimper and recorded its worst year of growth since it was mired in a debt crisis in 2013 in its first estimate for the quarter statistics agency eurostat said the eurozone grew by only 0 1 from the previous three month period that is its lowest rate since the first quarter of 2013 when the single currency bloc was fighting a debt crisis that nearly spelled ruin for the euro itself for 2019 as a whole the eurozone grew by only 1 2 again its lowest rate since 2013 when it shrank by 0 2 though eurostat did not provide explanations to its figures published friday the report confirms how the eurozone lost steam as a result of worries over a trade war between the u s and china that is having knock on effects around the world following the conclusion of a first round of trade talks with china president donald trump is turning his gaze towards europe and is threatening tariffs over what he considers to be the unfair treatment of american businesses by the european union uncertainty related to britain s departure from the eu which is officially taking place later friday has also hobbled business and trade the quarterly growth recorded was lower than the 0 2 anticipated in the markets and was largely due to the fact that two of the eurozone s biggest economies france and italy both contracted according to their respective statistics agencies their economies shrank by 0 1 and 0 3 france has endured a series of strikes over the winter that had a modest impact on household spending the main reason why france unexpectedly shrank during the quarter was related to a draw down of stocks by firms that has the potential to be reversed in the first quarter of 2020 which could see france bounce back italy s quarterly performance was its worst since 2013 and though a breakdown was not provided most economists think it was due to weak domestic demand spain provided some counterweight as it grew by a solid quarterly rate of 0 5 largely on the back of a strong export performance many countries including germany have still to report quarterly numbers so the overall eurozone number could be revised next month there are hopes that europe could enjoy a spring back this year largely because the trade tensions between the u s and china have eased following their so called phase 1 agreement and amid the greater brexit certainty with an encouraging recent rise in sentiment indicators we still think that the eurozone economy should see growth pick up gradually in 2020 said rosie colthorpe european economist at oxford economics in a separate report eurostat found that the annual rate of inflation across the eurozone rose to 1 4 in january from 1 3 the previous month largely as a result of higher energy prices the core inflation rate which strips out volatile items such as food and energy fell to 1 1 in january from 1 3 the fall in the core rate is likely be a cause for concern for policymakers at the european central bank including its new president christine lagarde by whatever measure inflation remains below the european central bank s goal of just below 2 and could fall further next month if the recent drop in oil prices following the virus outbreak in china persists the ecb is running a stimulus program to nudge up inflation and growth but is also undergoing a thorough review of how it tries to do that including whether it should change its inflation target
