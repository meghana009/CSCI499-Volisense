expand mary parsons this article appears in the summer 2019 issue of the american prospect magazine subscribe here since the late 1970s we ve had a grand experiment to test the claim that free markets really do work best this resurrection occurred despite the practical failure of laissez faire in the 1930s the resulting humiliation of free market theory and the contrasting success of managed capitalism during the three decade postwar boom yet when growth faltered in the 1970s libertarian economic theory got another turn at bat this revival proved extremely convenient for the conservatives who came to power in the 1980s the neoliberal counterrevolution in theory and policy has reversed or undermined nearly every aspect of managed capitalism from progressive taxation welfare transfers and antitrust to the empowerment of workers and the regulation of banks and other major industries neoliberalism s premise is that free markets can regulate themselves that government is inherently incompetent captive to special interests and an intrusion on the efficiency of the market that in distributive terms market outcomes are basically deserved and that redistribution creates perverse incentives by punishing the economy s winners and rewarding its losers so government should get out of the market s way by the 1990s even moderate liberals had been converted to the belief that social objectives can be achieved by harnessing the power of markets intermittent periods of governance by democratic presidents slowed but did not reverse the slide to neoliberal policy and doctrine the corporate wing of the democratic party approved now after nearly half a century the verdict is in virtually every one of these policies has failed even on their own terms enterprise has been richly rewarded taxes have been cut and regulation reduced or privatized the economy is vastly more unequal yet economic growth is slower and more chaotic than during the era of managed capitalism deregulation has produced not salutary competition but market concentration economic power has resulted in feedback loops of political power in which elites make rules that bolster further concentration the culprit isn t just markets some impersonal force that somehow got loose again this is a story of power using theory the mixed economy was undone by economic elites who revised rules for their own benefit they invested heavily in friendly theorists to bless this shift as sound and necessary economics and friendly politicians to put those theories into practice recent years have seen two spectacular cases of market mispricing with devastating consequences the near depression of 2008 and irreversible climate change the economic collapse of 2008 was the result of the deregulation of finance it cost the real u s economy upwards of 15 trillion and vastly more globally depending on how you count far more than any conceivable efficiency gain that might be credited to financial innovation free market theory presumes that innovation is necessarily benign but much of the financial engineering of the deregulatory era was self serving opaque and corrupt the opposite of an efficient and transparent market the existential threat of global climate change reflects the incompetence of markets to accurately price carbon and the escalating costs of pollution the british economist nicholas stern has aptly termed the worsening climate catastrophe history s greatest case of market failure here again this is not just the result of failed theory the entrenched political power of extractive industries and their political allies influences the rules and the market price of carbon this is less an invisible hand than a thumb on the scale the premise of efficient markets provides useful cover the grand neoliberal experiment of the past 40 years has demonstrated that markets in fact do not regulate themselves managed markets turn out to be more equitable and more efficient yet the theory and practical influence of neoliberalism marches splendidly on because it is so useful to society s most powerful people as a scholarly veneer to what would otherwise be a raw power grab the british political economist colin crouch captured this anomaly in a book nicely titled the strange non death of neoliberalism why did neoliberalism not die as crouch observed neoliberalism failed both as theory and as policy but succeeded superbly as power politics for economic elites the neoliberal ascendance has had another calamitous cost to democratic legitimacy as government ceased to buffer market forces daily life has become more of a struggle for ordinary people the elements of a decent middle class life are elusive reliable jobs and careers adequate pensions secure medical care affordable housing and college that doesn t require a lifetime of debt meanwhile life has become ever sweeter for economic elites whose income and wealth have pulled away and whose loyalty to place neighbor and nation has become more contingent and less reliable large numbers of people in turn have given up on the promise of affirmative government and on democracy itself after the berlin wall came down in 1989 ours was widely billed as an era when triumphant liberal capitalism would march hand in hand with liberal democracy but in a few brief decades the ostensibly secure regime of liberal democracy has collapsed in nation after nation with echoes of the 1930s as the great political historian karl polanyi warned when markets overwhelm society ordinary people often turn to tyrants in regimes that border on neofascist klepto capitalists get along just fine with dictators undermining the neoliberal premise of capitalism and democracy as complements several authoritarian thugs playing on tribal nationalism as the antidote to capitalist cosmopolitanism are surprisingly popular it s also important to appreciate that neoliberalism is not laissez faire classically the premise of a free market is that government simply gets out of the way this is nonsensical since all markets are creatures of rules most fundamentally rules defining property but also rules defining credit debt and bankruptcy rules defining patents trademarks and copyrights rules defining terms of labor and so on even deregulation requires rules in polanyi s words laissez faire was planned the political question is who gets to make the rules and for whose benefit the neoliberalism of friedrich hayek and milton friedman invoked free markets but in practice the neoliberal regime has promoted rules created by and for private owners of capital to keep democratic government from asserting rules of fair competition or countervailing social interests the regime has rules protecting pharmaceutical giants from the right of consumers to import prescription drugs or to benefit from generics the rules of competition and intellectual property generally have been tilted to protect incumbents rules of bankruptcy have been tilted in favor of creditors deceptive mortgages require elaborate rules written by the financial sector and then enforced by government patent rules have allowed agribusiness and giant chemical companies like monsanto to take over much of agriculture the opposite of open markets industry has invented rules requiring employees and consumers to submit to binding arbitration and to relinquish a range of statutory and common law rights neoliberalism as theory policy and power it s worth taking a moment to unpack the term neoliberalism the coinage can be confusing to american ears because the liberal part refers not to the word s ordinary american usage meaning moderately left of center but to classical economic liberalism otherwise known as free market economics the neo part refers to the reassertion of the claim that the laissez faire model of the economy was basically correct after all few proponents of these views embraced the term neoliberal mostly they called themselves free market conservatives neoliberal was a coinage used mainly by their critics sometimes as a neutral descriptive term sometimes as an epithet the use became widespread in the era of margaret thatcher and ronald reagan to add to the confusion a different and partly overlapping usage was advanced in the 1970s by the group around the washington monthly magazine they used neoliberal to mean a new less statist form of american liberalism around the same time the term neoconservative was used as a self description by former liberals who embraced conservatism on cultural racial economic and foreign policy grounds neoconservatives were neoliberals in economics beginning in the 1970s resurrected free market theory was interwoven with both conservative politics and significant investments in the production of theorists and policy intellectuals this occurred not just in well known conservative think tanks such as the american enterprise institute heritage cato and the manhattan institute but through more insidious investments in academia lavishly funded centers and tenured chairs were underwritten by the olin scaife bradley and other far right foundations to promote such variants of free market theory as law and economics public choice rational choice cost benefit analysis maximize shareholder value and kindred schools of thought these theories colonized several academic disciplines all were variations on the claim that markets worked and that government should get out of the way each of these bodies of sub theory relied upon its own variant of neoliberal ideology an intensified version of the theory of comparative advantage was used not just to cut tariffs but to use globalization as all purpose deregulation the theory of maximizing shareholder value was deployed to undermine the entire range of financial regulation and workers rights cost benefit analysis emphasizing costs and discounting benefits was used to discredit a good deal of health safety and environmental regulation public choice theory associated with the economist james buchanan and an entire ensuing school of economics and political science was used to impeach democracy itself on the premise that policies were hopelessly afflicted by rent seekers and free riders click here to read how robert kuttner has been unmasking the fallacies of neoliberalism for decades market failure was dismissed as a rare special case government failure was said to be ubiquitous theorists worked hand in glove with lobbyists and with public officials but in every major case where neoliberal theory generated policy the result was political success and economic failure for example supply side economics became the justification for tax cuts on the premise that taxes punished enterprise supposedly if taxes were cut especially taxes on capital and on income from capital the resulting spur to economic activity would be so potent that deficits would be far less than predicted by static economic projections and perhaps even pay for themselves there have been six rounds of this experiment from the tax cuts sponsored by jimmy carter in 1978 to the immense 2017 tax cuts and jobs act signed by donald trump in every case some economic stimulus did result mainly from the keynesian jolt to demand but in every case deficits increased significantly conservatives simply stopped caring about deficits the tax cuts were often inefficient as well as inequitable since the loopholes steered investment to tax favored uses rather than the most economically logical ones dozens of america s most profitable corporations paid no taxes robert bork s antitrust paradox holding that antitrust enforcement actually weakened competition was used as the doctrine to sideline the sherman and clayton acts supposedly if government just got out of the way market forces would remain more competitive because monopoly pricing would invite innovation and new entrants to the market in practice industry after industry became more heavily concentrated incumbents got in the habit of buying out innovators or using their market power to crush them this pattern is especially insidious in the tech economy of platform monopolies where giants that provide platforms such as google and amazon use their market power and superior access to customer data to out compete rivals who use their platforms markets once again require rules beyond the benign competence of the market actors themselves only democratic government can set equitable rules and when democracy falters undemocratic governments in cahoots with corrupt private plutocrats will make the rules human capital theory another variant of neoliberal application of markets to partly social questions justified deregulating labor markets and crushing labor unions unions supposedly used their power to get workers paid more than their market worth likewise minimum wage laws but the era of depressed wages has actually seen a decline in rates of productivity growth conversely does any serious person think that the inflated pay of the financial moguls who crashed the economy accurately reflects their contribution to economic activity in the case of hedge funds and private equity the high incomes of fund sponsors are the result of transfers of wealth and income from employees other stakeholders and operating companies to the fund managers not the fruits of more efficient management there is a broad literature discrediting this body of pseudo scholarly work in great detail much of neoliberalism represents the ever reliable victory of assumption over evidence yet neoliberal theory lived on because it was so convenient for elites and because of the inertial power of the intellectual capital that had been created the well funded neoliberal habitat has provided comfortable careers for two generations of scholars and pseudo scholars who migrate between academia think tanks k street op ed pages government wall street and back again so even if the theory has been demolished both by scholarly rebuttal and by events it thrives in powerful institutions and among their political allies the practical failure of neoliberal policies financial deregulation is neoliberalism s most palpable deregulatory failure but far from the only one electricity deregulation on balance has increased monopoly power and raised costs to consumers but has failed to offer meaningful shopping around opportunities to bring down prices we have gone from regulated monopolies with predictable earnings costs wages and consumer protections to deregulated monopolies or oligopolies with substantial pricing power since the bell breakup the telephone system tells a similar story of re concentration dwindling competition price gouging and union bashing air travel has been a poster child for advocates of deregulation but the actual record is mixed at best airline deregulation produced serial bankruptcies of every major u s airline often at the cost of worker pay and pension funds ticket prices have declined on average over the past two decades but the traveling public suffers from a crazy quilt of fares declining service shrinking seats and legroom and exorbitant penalties for the perfectly normal sin of having to change plans studies have shown that fares actually declined at a faster rate in the 20 years before deregulation in 1978 than in the 20 years afterward because the prime source of greater efficiency in airline travel is the introduction of more fuel efficient planes the roller coaster experience of airline profits and losses has reduced the capacity of airlines to purchase more fuel efficient aircraft and the average age of the fleet keeps increasing the use of fortress hubs to defend market pricing power has reduced the percentage of nonstop flights the most efficient way to fly from one point to another expand charles tasnadi ap photo robert bork s spurious arguments that antitrust enforcement hurt competition became the basis for dismantling antitrust massive concentration resulted in addition to deregulation three prime areas of practical neoliberal policies are the use of vouchers as market like means to social goals the privatization of public services and the use of tax subsides rather than direct outlays in every case government revenues are involved so this is far from a free market to begin with but the premise is that market disciplines can achieve public purposes more efficiently than direct public provision the evidence provides small comfort for these claims one core problem is that the programs invariably give too much to the for profit middlemen at the expense of the intended beneficiaries a related problem is that the process of using vouchers and contracts invites corruption it is a different form of rent seeking pursuit of monopoly profits than that attributed to government by public choice theorists but corruption nonetheless often direct public provision is far more transparent and accountable than a web of contractors a further problem is that in practice there is often far less competition than imagined because of oligopoly power vendor lock in and vendor political influence these experiments in marketization to serve social goals do not operate in some platonic policy laboratory where the only objective is true market efficiency yoked to the public good they operate in the grubby world of practical politics where the vendors are closely allied with conservative politicians whose purposes may be to discredit social transfers entirely or to reward corporate allies or to benefit from kickbacks either directly or as campaign contributions privatized prisons are a case in point a few large scandal ridden companies have gotten most of the contracts often through political influence far from bringing better quality and management efficiency they have profited by diverting operating funds and worsening conditions that were already deplorable and finding new ways to charge inmates higher fees for necessary services such as phone calls to the extent that money was actually saved most of the savings came from reducing the pay and professionalism of guards increasing overcrowding and decreasing already inadequate budgets for food and medical care a similar example is the privatization of transportation services such as highways and even parking meters in several midwestern states toll roads have been sold to private vendors the governor who makes the deal gains a temporary fiscal windfall while drivers end up paying higher tolls often for decades investment bankers who broker the deal also take their cut some of the money does go into highway improvements but that could have been done more efficiently in the traditional way via direct public ownership and competitive bidding housing vouchers substantially reward landlords who use the vouchers to fill empty houses with poor people until the neighborhood gentrifies at which point the owner is free to quit the program and charge market rentals thus public funds are used to underwrite a privately owned quasi social housing sector whose social character is only temporary no permanent social housing is produced despite the extensive public outlay the companion use of tax incentives to attract passive investment in affordable housing promotes economically inefficient tax shelters and shunts public funds into the pockets of the investors money that might otherwise have gone directly to the housing the affordable care act is a form of voucher but the regulated private insurance markets in the aca have not fully lived up to their promise in part because of the extensive market power retained by private insurers and in part because the right has relentlessly sought to sabotage the program another political feedback loop the sponsors assumed that competition would lower costs and increase consumer choice but in too many counties there are three or fewer competing plans and in some cases just one as more insurance plans and hospital systems become for profit massive investment goes into such wasteful activities as manipulation of billing risk selection and other gaming of the rules our mixed market system of health care requires massive regulation to work with tolerable efficiency in practice this degenerates into an infinite regress of regulator versus commercial profit maximizer reminiscent of mad magazine s spy versus spy with the industry doing end runs to congress to further rig the rules straight ahead public insurance such as medicare is generally far more efficient an extensive literature has demonstrated that for profit voucher schools do no better and often do worse than comparable public schools and are vulnerable to multiple forms of gaming and corruption proprietors of voucher schools are superb at finding ways of excluding costly special needs students so that those costs are imposed on what remains of public schools they excel at gaming test results while some voucher and charter schools especially nonprofit ones sometimes improve on average school performance so do many public schools the record is also muddied by the fact that many ostensibly nonprofit schools contract out management to for profit companies tax preferences have long been used ostensibly to serve social goals the earned income tax credit is considered one of the more successful cases of using market like measures in this case a refundable tax credit to achieve the social goal of increasing worker take home pay it has also been touted as the rare case of bipartisan collaboration liberals get more money for workers conservatives get to reward the deserving poor since the eitc is conditioned on employment conservatives get a further ideological win since the eitc is effectively a wage subsidy from the government but is experienced as a tax refund rather than a benefit of government recent research however shows that the eitc is primarily a subsidy of low wage employers who are able to pay their workers a lot less than a market clearing wage in industries such as nursing homes or warehouses where many workers qualified for the eitc work side by side with ones not eligible the non eitc workers get substandard wages the existence of the eitc depresses the level of the wages that have to come out of the employer s pocket neoliberalism s influence on liberals as free market theory resurged many moderate liberals embraced these policies in the inflationary 1970s regulation became a scapegoat that supposedly deterred salutary price competition some such as economist alfred kahn president carter s adviser on deregulation supported deregulation on what he saw as the merits other moderates supported neoliberal policies opportunistically to curry favor with powerful industries and donors market like policies were also embraced by liberals as a tactical way to find common ground with conservatives several forms of deregulation of airlines trucking and electric power began not under reagan but under carter financial deregulation took off under bill clinton democratic presidents as much as republicans promoted trade deals that undermined social standards cost benefit analysis by the office of information and regulatory affairs oira was more of a choke point under barack obama than under george w bush command and control became an all purpose pejorative for disparaging perfectly sensible and efficient regulation market like became a fashionable concept not just on the free market right but on the moderate left cass sunstein who served as obama s anti regulation czar uses the example of nudges as a more market like and hence superior alternative to direct regulation though with rare exceptions their impact is trivial moreover nudges only work in tandem with regulation there are indeed some interventionist policies that use market incentives to serve social goals but contrary to free market theory the market like incentives first require substantial regulation and are not a substitute for it a good example is the clean air act amendments of 1990 which used tradable emission rights to cut the output of sulfur dioxide the cause of acid rain this was supported by both the george h w bush administration and by leading democrats but before the trading regime could work congress first had to establish permissible ceilings on sulfur dioxide output pure command and control there are many other instances such as nutrition labeling truth in lending and disclosure of epa gas mileage results where the market like premise of a better informed consumer complements command regulation but is no substitute for it nearly all of the increase in fuel efficiency for example is the result of command regulations that require auto fleets to hit a gas mileage target the fact that epa gas mileage figures are prominently disclosed on new car stickers may have modest influence but motor fuels are so underpriced that car companies have success selling gas guzzlers despite the consumer labeling expand j scott applewhite ap images bill clinton and his treasury secretary robert rubin were big promoters of financial deregulation politically whatever rationale there was for liberals to make common ground with libertarians is now largely gone the authors of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act made no attempt to meet democrats partway they excluded the opposition from the legislative process entirely this was opportunistic tax cutting for elites pure and simple the right today also abandoned the quest for a middle ground on environmental policy on anti poverty policy on health policy on virtually everything neoliberal ideology did its historic job of weakening intellectual and popular support for the proposition that affirmative government can better the lives of citizens and that the democratic party is a reliable steward of that social compact since reagan the right s embrace of the free market has evolved from partly principled idealism into pure opportunism and obstruction neoliberalism and hyper globalism the post 1990 rules of globalization supported by conservatives and moderate liberals alike are the quintessence of neoliberalism at bretton woods in 1944 the use of fixed exchange rates and controls on speculative private capital plus the creation of the imfand world bank were intended to allow member countries to practice national forms of managed capitalism insulated from the destructive and deflationary influences of short term speculative private capital flows as doctrine and power shifted in the 1970s the imf the world bank and later the wto which replaced the old gatt mutated into their ideological opposite rather than instruments of support for mixed national economies they became enforcers of neoliberal policies the standard package of the washington consensus of approved policies for developing nations included demands that they open their capital markets to speculative private finance as well as cutting taxes on capital weakening social transfers and gutting labor regulation and public ownership but private capital investment in poor countries proved to be fickle the result was often excessive inflows during the boom part of the cycle and punitive withdrawals during the bust the opposite of the patient long term development capital that these countries needed and that was provided by the world bank of an earlier era during the bust phase the imftypically imposes even more stringent neoliberal demands as the price of financial bailouts including perverse budgetary austerity supposedly to restore the confidence of the very speculative capital markets responsible for the boom bust cycle dozens of nations from latin america to east asia went through this cycle of boom bust and then imf pile on greece is still suffering the impact after 1990 hyper globalism also included trade treaties whose terms favored multinational corporations traditionally trade agreements had been mainly about reciprocal reductions of tariffs nations were free to have whatever brand of regulation public investment or social policies they chose with the advent of the wto many policies other than tariffs were branded as trade distorting even as takings without compensation trade deals were used to give foreign capital free access and to dismantle national regulation and public ownership special courts were created in which foreign corporations and investors could do end runs around national authorities to challenge regulation for impeding commerce at first the sponsors of the new trade regime tried to claim the successful economies of east asia as evidence of the success of the neoliberal recipe supposedly these nations had succeeded by pursuing export led growth exposing their domestic economies to salutary competition but these claims were soon exposed as the opposite of what had actually occurred in fact japan south korea smaller asian nations and above all china had thrived by rejecting every major tenet of neoliberalism their capital markets were tightly regulated and insulated from foreign speculative capital they developed world class industries as state led cartels that favored domestic production and supply east asia got into trouble only when it followed imfdictates to throw open capital markets and in the aftermath they recovered by closing those markets and assembling war chests of hard currency so that they d never again have to go begging to the imf enthusiasts of hyper globalization also claimed that it benefited poor countries by increasing export opportunities but as the success of east asia shows there is more than one way to boost exports and many poorer countries suffered under the terms of the global neoliberal regime nor was the damage confined to the developing world as the work of harvard economist dani rodrik has demonstrated democracy requires a polity for better or for worse the polity and democratic citizenship are national by enhancing the global market at the expense of the democratic state the current brand of hyper globalization deliberately weakens the capacity of states to regulate markets and weakens democracy itself when do markets work the failure of neoliberalism as economic and social policy does not mean that markets never work a command economy is even more utopian and perverse than a neoliberal one the practical quest is for an efficient and equitable middle ground the neoliberal story of how the economy operates assumes a largely frictionless marketplace where prices are set by supply and demand and the price mechanism allocates resources to their optimal use in the economy as a whole for this discipline to work as advertised however there can be no market power competition must be plentiful sellers and buyers must have roughly equal information and there can be no significant externalities much of the 20th century was practical proof that these conditions did not describe a good part of the actual economy and if markets priced things wrong the market system did not aggregate to an efficient equilibrium and depressions could become self deepening as keynes demonstrated only a massive jolt of government spending could restart the engines even if market pricing was partly violated in the process nonetheless in many sectors of the economy the process of buying and selling is close enough to the textbook conditions of perfect competition that the price system works tolerably well supermarkets for instance deliver roughly accurate prices because of the consumer s freedom and knowledge to shop around likewise much of retailing however when we get into major realms of the economy with positive or negative externalities such as education and health markets are not sufficient and in other major realms such as pharmaceuticals where corporations use their political power to rig the terms of patents the market doesn t produce a cure the basic argument of neoliberalism can fit on a bumper sticker markets work governments don t if you want to embellish that story there are two corollaries markets embody human freedom and with markets people basically get what they deserve to alter market outcomes is to spoil the poor and punish the productive that conclusion logically flows from the premise that markets are efficient milton friedman became rich famous and influential by teasing out the several implications of these simple premises it is much harder to articulate the case for a mixed economy than the case for free markets precisely because the mixed economy is mixed the rebuttal takes several paragraphs the more complex story holds that markets are substantially efficient in some realms but far from efficient in others because of positive and negative externalities the tendency of financial markets to create cycles of boom and bust the intersection of self interest and corruption the asymmetry of information between company and consumer the asymmetry of power between corporation and employee the power of the powerful to rig the rules and the fact that there are realms of human life the right to vote human liberty security of one s person that should not be marketized and if markets are not perfectly efficient then distributive questions are partly political choices some societies pay pre k teachers the minimum wage as glorified babysitters others educate and compensate them as professionals there is no correct market derived wage because pre kindergarten is a social good and the issue of how to train and compensate teachers is a social choice not a market choice the same is true of the other human services including medicine nor is there a theoretically correct set of rules for patents trademarks and copyrights these are politically derived either balancing the interests of innovation with those of diffusion or being politically captured by incumbent industries governments can in principle improve on market outcomes via regulation but that fact is complicated by the risk of regulatory capture so another issue that arises is market failure versus polity failure which brings us back to the urgency of strong democracy and effective government after neoliberalism the political reversal of neoliberalism can only come through practical politics and policies that demonstrate how government often can serve citizens more equitably and efficiently than markets revision of theory will take care of itself there is no shortage of dissenting theorists and empirical policy researchers whose scholarly work has been vindicated by events what they need is not more theory but more influence both in the academy and in the corridors of power they are available to advise a new progressive administration ifthat administration can get elected and if it refrains from hiring neoliberal advisers there are also some relatively new areas that invite policy innovation these include regulation of privacy rights versus entrepreneurial liberties in the digital realm how to think of the internet as a common carrier how to update competition and antitrust policy as platform monopolies exert new forms of market power how to modernize labor market policy in the era of the gig economy and the role of deeper income supplements as machines replace human workers the failed neoliberal experiment also makes the case not just for better regulated capitalism but for direct public alternatives as well banking done properly especially the provision of mortgage finance is close to a public utility much of it could be public a great deal of research is done more honestly and more cost effectively in public peer reviewed institutions such as the nihthan by a substantially corrupt private pharmaceutical industry social housing often is more cost effective than so called public private partnerships public power is more efficient to generate less prone to monopolistic price gouging and friendlier to the needed green transition than private power the public option in health care is far more efficient than the current crazy quilt in which each layer of complexity adds opacity and cost public provision does require public oversight but that is more straightforward and transparent than the byzantine dance of regulation and counter regulation the two other benefits of direct public provision are that the public gets direct evidence of government delivering something of value and that the countervailing power of democracy to harness markets is enhanced a mixed economy depends above all on a strong democracy one even stronger than the democracy that succumbed to the corrupting influence of economic elites and their neoliberal intellectual allies beginning half a century ago the antidote to the resurrected neoliberal fable is the resurrection of democracy strong enough to tame the market in a way that tames it for keeps

to strengthen public confidence on persistent easing stance the minutes of april 24 25 boj meeting showed that some members suggested clarifications on the forward guidance with the aim of

government s decision to remove the multi currency regime and restrict domestic transactions to a local currency renamed the zimbabwe dollar will boost economic activity eliminate speculative tendencies and bring relief to the majority of zimbabweans who were finding it difficult to survive in an economy that was rapidly dollarising it also lays the groundwork for the eventual introduction of the zimbabwe dollar later this year which will become the sole legal tender in the country introduced in 2009 the use of a basket of currencies which included the united states dollar the sa rand the botswana pula and the british pound was meant to tame inflation which had reached unprecedented levels between 2009 and 2013 inflation was contained and there was a modicum of economic stability but no real growth in the manufacturing sector this was because of a plethora of reasons among them the high cost of production resulting in zimbabwean goods being uncompetitively priced in the region due to the strength of the us dollar the reserve bank of zimbabwe also had no control over the country s monetary policy and was unable to use an array of tools at its disposal such as interest rates use of a monetary policy committee to defend the value of the domestic currency and target inflation among others government s latest intervention should therefore be understood in the context of a rapidly deteriorating situation on the market where businesses were pricing their goods based on the prevailing parallel market rates for the us dollar due to its volatility and unpredictability prices of goods and services were changing on a daily basis and getting beyond the reach of many people particularly those in formal employment necessitating decisive action government has a duty to protect the majority of the people of zimbabwe and the erosion of the buying power of the rtgs was impoverishing the country s workforce while benefiting a few speculators dabbling in parallel market activities this had to stop in arriving at the decision to do away with the multi currency regime government took into account the availability of key economic fundamentals needed to underpin a currency these include among others controlled government expenditure and a budget surplus the rbz has also moved quickly to support the move by putting in place measures to buttress the removal of the multi currency system these include letters of credit amounting to us 330 million for importation of critical commodities such as fuel cooking oil and wheat the rbz also plans to increase the supply of forex on the interbank market through ensuring that at least 50 percent of the surrender portion of forex is channelled towards the interbank to ensure manufacturers and importers have easy access to funds other measures include directing banks to transfer to the rbz the rtgs zwl that they are holding as counterpart funds for the foreign currency historical or legacy debt that government through the reserve bank is assuming at the rate of 1 1 between the rtgs and the us this is expected to mop around zlw 1 2 billion from the market by the end of this week the monetary authorities also adjusted the interest rate on the rbz overnight window upwards from the current 15 percent per annum to 50 percent per annum in line with inflation trends they removed administrative limits on the operation of bureaux de change and on the cap on margins for banks for interbank foreign exchange transactions the rbz also put a vesting period of 90 days on disposal of dual listed securities or shares purchased by investors on the zimbabwe stock exchange these measures are meant to ensure stability on the market while the zim dollar finds its true value we welcome the bold and decisive government interventions and urge zimbabweans to embrace them for the good of the nation no country in the world has prospered on the back of dollarisation as the us unit is too strong for many economies particularly those in the developing world zimbabwe is also under us sanctions and in some transactions it was unable to maneouvre due to the restrictive measures the country has therefore taken back control of its monetary policy and this should be applauded as the minister of finance and economic development professor mthuli ncube said on monday using the zimbabwe dollar will make it easier to transact on the domestic market with forex reserved for external payments we also know that in some quarters we were not even allowed to transact in us dollars because of things like sanctions and other restrictions so it s necessary to move on and use a currency that you can control and also what we are trying to do is restore full monetary policy where the central bank can conduct monetary policy using the array of tools that are necessary for managing monetary policy such as interest rates use of a monetary policy committee to govern things like targeting money balances or even targeting inflation he said
overview it is far from clear that the us sanctions against nine iranian officials with the foreign minister to be added later brings negotiations any closer at the same time us officials trying to keep expectations low for the weekend meeting between trump and xi the heightened political anxiety will have to make room for fed chairman powell s talk in ny the market is confident of at least a 25 bp cut at the next fomc meeting at the end of july stocks are pulling back today most of the major markets in asia pacific fell with india a notable exception europe s dow jones stoxx 600 is off for a third session its longest losing streak in three months and is approaching this month s uptrend line us shares are also trading with a downside bias after last week s run up some backing and filling ought not surprise most benchmark 10 year yields are a little softer with the us flirting with 2 and germany at minus 30 bp italian and greek bonds are underperforming and yields are slightly firmer the dollar is narrowly mixed despite the heightened tensions it is ironic that the yen is up about 0 2 jpy107 15 while the swiss franc is the weakest of the majors off around a third of a percent chf0 9755 emerging market currencies are also mixed oil trading heavier while gold is extending its run into a sixth session over which time it has rallied about 7 asia pacific the us is pressing iran hard the economy is crippled through the embargo and now adding insult to injury the us has sanctioned the supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei and eight senior military officers the foreign minister is expected to be added shortly at the same time the us says it is open to negotiations but at least at first iran seems to be moving in the other direction one risk is that is it solidifies iran s relationship with russia which could help it economically and militarily the us also says it wants to negotiate with china but its actions seem to make it more difficult the latest us blacklisting of a handful of chinese companies involved with developing china s supercomputer is not for violating an embargo or spying but appears to be primarily commercial competition separately and with some impact in trading today the press reports that a us judge found three chinese banks in contempt for refusing to comply with subpoenas regarding activity that may have violated the sanctions against north korea the dollar fell through jpy107 for the first time since the flash crash on january 3 it found some bids in late asia near jpy106 80 and resurfaced above jpy107 by early european turnover there is an option for a little more than 900 mln at jpy107 25 that expires today note that a 1 4 bln option at jpy107 is on the bubble tomorrow there are also 2 2 bln in options between jpy107 30 and jpy107 50 that will expire tomorrow and will likely offer resistance today the australian dollar is edging higher and is looking to extend its advance for the sixth consecutive session over this run it has appreciated by a cent it is testing trendline resistance from mid april peak 0 7200 and the high from earlier this month 0 7025 rate cut expectations for a move next week continue to run high 80 chance europe from the outside it appears to be a disconnect between what the ec is saying and what the candidates for tory leader are advocating the ec states that it will not re negotiate the withdrawal agreement yet both candidates seem to think this is a bluff johnson claims that a majority of parliament now support a no deal exit but that also does not seem likely in fact several high profile tory mps have threatened to vote against the government were it to seek such a course with four months left until the end of october deadline the next month will not feature talks with the eu but the selection the next tory leader our bias is toward a national election that will again postpone the exit date italy has now another week to persuade the ec not to proceed with excessive debt procedures eu finance ministers meet on july 8 9 and will take up the recommendation of the ec while the prime minister and finance minister pledge adherence to the eu budget rules the squabbling coalition appears pushing in the other direction it is not so much about the mini bots the uses of a new t bill offering in some denominations which as the ecb has noted is either a parallel currency which is illegal or a debt instrument that would have to be added to the country s obligations and is also problematic rather league leader salvini is pressing ahead with his pledge of a flat tax and he is seeking inclusion next year s budget there are suspicions that salvini is trying to antagonize the ec to precipitate a political crisis that could lead to new elections and replace the unwieldy coalition with the five star movement with a center right coalition that he would ostensibly lead the euro initially extended its gains for the fifth consecutive session but is reversing lower after briefly poking above 1 1410 initial support is pegged near 1 1380 but if this goes a move back into the 1 1325 1 1350 area is likely sterling is outperforming the euro with today s gains its advancing streak is in its sixth session during which time sterling has gained a little more than two cents to test the 1 2780 area today the momentum appears to be stalling and a lower close today at the end of the north american session cannot be ruled out support is seen in the 1 2720 1 2740 area america five fed officials speak today but the focus is on chairman powell s remarks at 1 00 pm et the issue that is on the top of everyone s mind is the outlook for policy the market has increased the odds of a 50 bp move at the end of next month to nearly 40 from practically no chance at the end of may some argue that there have been cycles in which the fed initiated with a 50 bp move two differences strike us first rates were considerably higher so that proportionately the 25 bp now is roughly the same as 50 bp then second the ostensible purpose of the cut is not to arrest economic deterioration in fact the fed s dot plot reaffirmed its growth and unemployment forecasts the issue the way the fed framed it was the uncertainty around forecasts have increased the dallas fed s kaplan took the opposite tack from what the fed funds futures are showing he suggested adding more stimulus now could contribute to building up excesses and imbalances in the economy kaplan noted that financial conditions and the availability of credit are robust some observers are stressing the importance of next week s us jobs report but kaplan suggested that what appears to be a low estimate of job creation 60k 120k that would be acceptable mexico s two week inflation report showed price pressures eased to 4 in the first half of june this is the top of the central bank s 2 4 target however the core rate ticked up the central bank meets thursday and no rate cut is expected many expect a decrease in q3 while others have it at the end of the year pressure is building for lower rates the igea economic activity index a proxy for gdp reported yesterday fell 1 41 year over year in april after averaging 1

overview it is far from clear that the us sanctions against nine iranian officials with the foreign minister to be added later brings negotiations any closer at the same time us officials trying to keep expectations low for the weekend meeting between trump and xi the heightened political anxiety will have to make room for fed chairman powell s talk in ny the market is confident of at least a 25 bp cut at the next fomc meeting at the end of july stocks are pulling back today most of the major markets in asia pacific fell with india a notable exception europe s dow jones stoxx 600 is off for a third session its longest losing streak in three months and is approaching this month s uptrend line us shares are also trading with a downside bias after last week s run up some backing and filling ought not surprise most benchmark 10 year yields are a little softer with the us flirting with 2 and germany at minus 30 bp italian and greek bonds are underperforming and yields are slightly firmer the dollar is narrowly mixed despite the heightened tensions it is ironic that the yen is up about 0 2 jpy107 15 while the swiss franc is the weakest of the majors off around a third of a percent chf0 9755 emerging market currencies are also mixed oil trading heavier while gold is extending its run into a sixth session over which time it has rallied about 7 asia pacific the us is pressing iran hard the economy is crippled through the embargo and now adding insult to injury the us has sanctioned the supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei and eight senior military officers the foreign minister is expected to be added shortly at the same time the us says it is open to negotiations but at least at first iran seems to be moving in the other direction one risk is that is it solidifies iran s relationship with russia which could help it economically and militarily the us also says it wants to negotiate with china but its actions seem to make it more difficult the latest us blacklisting of a handful of chinese companies involved with developing china s supercomputer is not for violating an embargo or spying but appears to be primarily commercial competition separately and with some impact in trading today the press reports that a us judge found three chinese banks in contempt for refusing to comply with subpoenas regarding activity that may have violated the sanctions against north korea the dollar fell through jpy107 for the first time since the flash crash on january 3 it found some bids in late asia near jpy106 80 and resurfaced above jpy107 by early european turnover there is an option for a little more than 900 mln at jpy107 25 that expires today note that a 1 4 bln option at jpy107 is on the bubble tomorrow there are also 2 2 bln in options between jpy107 30 and jpy107 50 that will expire tomorrow and will likely offer resistance today the australian dollar is edging higher and is looking to extend its advance for the sixth consecutive session over this run it has appreciated by a cent it is testing trendline resistance from mid april peak 0 7200 and the high from earlier this month 0 7025 rate cut expectations for a move next week continue to run high 80 chance europe from the outside it appears to be a disconnect between what the ec is saying and what the candidates for tory leader are advocating the ec states that it will not re negotiate the withdrawal agreement yet both candidates seem to think this is a bluff johnson claims that a majority of parliament now support a no deal exit but that also does not seem likely in fact several high profile tory mps have threatened to vote against the government were it to seek such a course with four months left until the end of october deadline the next month will not feature talks with the eu but the selection the next tory leader our bias is toward a national election that will again postpone the exit date italy has now another week to persuade the ec not to proceed with excessive debt procedures eu finance ministers meet on july 8 9 and will take up the recommendation of the ec while the prime minister and finance minister pledge adherence to the eu budget rules the squabbling coalition appears pushing in the other direction it is not so much about the mini bots the uses of a new t bill offering in some denominations which as the ecb has noted is either a parallel currency which is illegal or a debt instrument that would have to be added to the country s obligations and is also problematic rather league leader salvini is pressing ahead with his pledge of a flat tax and he is seeking inclusion next year s budget there are suspicions that salvini is trying to antagonize the ec to precipitate a political crisis that could lead to new elections and replace the unwieldy coalition with the five star movement with a center right coalition that he would ostensibly lead the euro initially extended its gains for the fifth consecutive session but is reversing lower after briefly poking above 1 1410 initial support is pegged near 1 1380 but if this goes a move back into the 1 1325 1 1350 area is likely sterling is outperforming the euro with today s gains its advancing streak is in its sixth session during which time sterling has gained a little more than two cents to test the 1 2780 area today the momentum appears to be stalling and a lower close today at the end of the north american session cannot be ruled out support is seen in the 1 2720 1 2740 area america five fed officials speak today but the focus is on chairman powell s remarks at 1 00 pm et the issue that is on the top of everyone s mind is the outlook for policy the market has increased the odds of a 50 bp move at the end of next month to nearly 40 from practically no chance at the end of may some argue that there have been cycles in which the fed initiated with a 50 bp move two differences strike us first rates were considerably higher so that proportionately the 25 bp now is roughly the same as 50 bp then second the ostensible purpose of the cut is not to arrest economic deterioration in fact the fed s dot plot reaffirmed its growth and unemployment forecasts the issue the way the fed framed it was the uncertainty around forecasts have increased the dallas fed s kaplan took the opposite tack from what the fed funds futures are showing he suggested adding more stimulus now could contribute to building up excesses and imbalances in the economy kaplan noted that financial conditions and the availability of credit are robust some observers are stressing the importance of next week s us jobs report but kaplan suggested that what appears to be a low estimate of job creation 60k 120k that would be acceptable mexico s two week inflation report showed price pressures eased to 4 in the first half of june this is the top of the central bank s 2 4 target however the core rate ticked up the central bank meets thursday and no rate cut is expected many expect a decrease in q3 while others have it at the end of the year pressure is building for lower rates the igea economic activity index a proxy for gdp reported yesterday fell 1 41 year over year in april after averaging 1

central bank of kenya cbk governor patrick njoroge has revelled in this feat as it has helped the shilling to remain steady against the dollar but beneath this glitter is untold gloom a good chunk of

boasting the largest reserve of dollars in history with the sh201 billion 2 1 billion that treasury had received through its issuance of a third eurobond kenya s foreign currency reserves jumped to sh1 trillion enough to cater for imports for six and a half months the country repaid its maiden eurobond this week starting off a series of principal repayments that will come thick and fast every two years between 2024 and 2031 there is some merit to this if kenya relied on exports over the last five years it would have earned a total of 25 387 billion sh2 538 trillion but the country was lucky to bring in an additional 22 55 billion sh2 2 trillion since 2014 through debt and diaspora cash however analysts are now questioning the viability of debt funded forex reserves with so many

to churchill ogutu a researcher with genghis capital mr ogutu reckons that although this has uplifted the forex reserves it is quite transitory thus the baseline outlook is that the reserves will

kenyans in the diaspora treasury has continued to desperately borrow in foreign currency to meet its external debt obligations as they fall due unfortunately the country s external debt position has worsened as interest payments on foreign loans rise this has been the case ever since treasury mandarins led by cabinet secretary henry rotich made their first stab at borrowing internationally in 2014 snapping up expensive commercial debt such as sovereign bonds and syndicated loans without adequate dollars of its own kenya s export earnings have remained dismal forcing the country to borrow more dollars to repay maturing debts a situation that has seen it stuck in a rut although kenya continues to meet its external debt obligations paying all its debts as they fall due things have got a little precarious in the last 12 months treasury s position on the country s ability to repay its external debt has swung from bullish to cautious as manifested in the exchequer s medium term debt management strategy for years 2018 and 2019 in february last year treasury said kenya s risk of defaulting on its debts was low and that its public debt was sustainable and would remain so in the near future a year later in february this year the country s risk of debt distress had fluctuated from low to moderate in other words debt burden indicators are not blinking red they could easily be breached in case of external shocks such as a sudden increase in the global prices of crude oil or if civil servants suddenly demanded high wages and the state ceded to their demands leaving treasury with little to pay its debts cs rotich insists that kenya continues to meet its debt obligations promptly with no accumulation of arrears while this may be true institutions such as the international monetary fund imf have done tests that have indicated that if nothing is done kenya will struggle to service its debts accepted threshold imf downgraded kenya s risk of defaulting from low to moderate forcing treasury to eat humble pie by saying as much in its latest debt sustainability report the february 2019 mtds shows that at a threshold of 26 2 as of october 2018 public and publicly guaranteed ppg debt service the total exports ratio has already breached the accepted threshold of 21 this means that kenya is not generating enough exports to earn more dollars to service its debts as they fall due this ratio has been deteriorating rising from 16 5 in 2017 even with treasury s liberal projection it will still be above the threshold by 2021 the imf said in a damning report that treasury had tried to vote against its release the global lender noted that by last year kenya had breached three external indicators external debt service to export ratio external debt service to revenue ratio and the present value of external debt to export ratio both revenue and export earnings are insufficient to help kenya comfortably pay external debts but how did kenya find itself here according to the imf it all boils down to higher levels of debt together with rising reliance on non concessional borrowing which have raised fiscal vulnerabilities and increased interest payments on public debt to nearly a fifth of revenue thus if treasury does not tame its appetite for debt especially expensive external loans the country will sink further into debt distress like other african nations such as ethiopia chad and zambia that have nearly defaulted on their debt repayments experts reckon that the country needs to urgently restructure its loans swap expensive short term debts with concessional long term debts such as those from multilateral bodies like the world bank worryingly the share of concessional loans in kenya s debt mix has been declining there have also been calls for treasury to address the twin fiscal evils of wastage and corruption which have contributed to revenue loss in his budget speech rotich announced austerity measures aimed at freeing up some funds that could be deployed to debt repayment these include the slashing of hefty travel allowances and per diems to civil servants the state will also continue freezing new development projects treasury has also come up with stringent regulations aimed at auditing externally financed projects mr speaker we shall continue to remain on this planned path of reducing the fiscal deficit in the medium term in order to create more fiscal space and to reduce the public debt said rotich official development assistance on high concessional terms will be preferred for some of the external financing while medium to long term treasury bonds will remain the primary source for domestic financing he added treasury s silver bullet to the debt problem is to boost productivity so far state policy to prop up exports has been less compelling according to ogutu who notes that the country has over relied on traditional export streams last year the state unveiled export strategies meant to increase exports by re examining the existing markets this even as it looks farther for new markets such as india and china kenya has traditionally exported horticulture tea coffee and titanium to a few countries mostly

european capital markets priorities and challenges dinner remarks by benoît cœuré member of the executive board of the ecb at the international swaps and derivatives association frankfurt am main 25 june 2019 the past decade has seen remarkable achievements in strengthening global financial regulation and in making our economies safer and more resilient thanks in large part to the work of the international community under the auspices of the financial stability board fsb but now more than ten years after the crisis priorities have shifted and there are concerns that the cooperative multilateral order that has underpinned past international achievements is increasingly being questioned in my remarks this evening i will argue that dismantling regulatory standards would be a mistake and would add to market fragmentation i will also argue that the current low levels of financial integration in the euro area are inefficient and that as a response we need to intensify our efforts if we want to achieve tangible progress in completing banking union and creating a true capital markets union cmu in the last part of my remarks i will briefly touch on the ongoing reform of interest rate benchmarks which is essential to safeguard the smooth transmission of monetary policy and the resilience of the financial system market fragmentation as a source of concern the achievements of the fsb and the global standard setting bodies since the financial crisis are remarkable by rolling out international standards and new principles for regulatory cooperation they have made global financial markets more integrated and our financial system safer and more resilient protecting taxpayers from costly bailouts we have also made significant progress at a regional level in the euro area we now have a single banking supervisor that harmonises supervisory actions across participating countries at the level of the european union eu the commission and the co legislators have also strengthened the single rulebook and launched an ambitious agenda for creating a cmu but with the financial crisis gradually disappearing in the rear view mirror ambition for further reforms is weakening and reluctance to implement already agreed standards is rising hidden forms of financial protectionism or a relaxation of regulation would turn back the clock on internationally agreed rules revive distrust and risk regulatory arbitrage and a race to the bottom as a result market fragmentation has become one of the more pressing issues for global standard setting bodies and the financial community in recent months the japanese g20 presidency has identified market fragmentation as a key priority and the fsb published its report on the matter just ahead of the g20 finance ministers and central bank governors meeting in fukuoka on 8 and 9 june isda itself prominently discussed the topic at its 34th annual general meeting in hong kong earlier this year market fragmentation can arise for a number of reasons such as technological differences divergent tax regimes or differences in local financial structures diverging regulation and supervisory practices can also play a role here not all types of market fragmentation are harmful stricter financial regulation in some parts of the world for example may help promote financial stability more widely by mitigating perilous cross border spillovers insofar as it does not increase risk taking in foreign markets other types of fragmentation may come with real economic costs however in europe for example financial integration has gone into reverse since the crisis broke and is only very gradually coming back today intra euro area cross border risk sharing is at uncomfortably low levels and without private risk sharing country specific shocks will continue to cause persistent dispersion in economic outcomes across euro area countries undermining real convergence and hampering the conduct of the single monetary policy priorities for cmu after brexit it is this type of fragmentation that i would like to focus on in the remainder of my remarks financial disintegration is particularly harmful in a currency union where deeper and more liquid financial markets should be able to compensate for the absence of other intra regional shock absorbers such as flexible exchange rates financial markets that can absorb shocks efficiently and contribute to macroeconomic stabilisation and resilience do not waste costly political capital and they create more policy space in downturns for both fiscal and monetary policy i am not arguing here that public risk sharing is irrelevant but progress towards a euro area fiscal capacity with stabilising features however desirable will be a long journey better private risk sharing mechanisms can only make it more acceptable as the us monetary union shows both private and public risk sharing are in fact complements not substitutes a true cmu could contribute to filling a substantial part of this void and help diversify and reduce risk in the euro area significant progress has already been made under the outgoing european commission 11 of the 13 legislative initiatives tabled under the current cmu action plan were finalised together with most of the non legislative actions but the pace with which co legislators and member states in particular have progressed on individual initiatives has been much slower ring fencing and considerable differences in national legislation mean that cmu remains incomplete in many respects while new challenges for financial integration have emerged the united kingdom s departure from the eu s single market in particular will by its very nature affect the shape of europe s future financial market architecture a large number of banks and investment firms are in the process of establishing or expanding their euro area presence with a view to ensuring that they can continue to serve the single market after brexit plans submitted to the ecb indicate that this can be expected to result in a substantial relocation of activity to the euro area in the order of over 1 trillion in bank assets and that at least in the short term activity will move to a number of euro area countries possibly resulting in the development of a multi centric european financial system while the landscape may evolve further in the future in a financial system with a number of increasingly important hubs as opposed to one dominant hub in london it will be more important than ever for these hubs to be able to efficiently interact with one another and to avoid differences across member states providing opportunities for regulatory arbitrage so brexit reinforces the urgency with which we should pursue policies that address barriers to capital market integration in the eu this discussion is also closely connected to the parallel discussion on the global role of the euro which fundamentally depends on our ability to build deeper and more efficient financial markets advancing cmu should therefore be a top priority for the new european commission and parliament the ecb is a key stakeholder in this discussion as the transmission of our single monetary policy crucially depends on the degree of financial integration in the euro area but we should recognise that not all of the numerous initiatives adopted under the cmu action plan will have the same impact and some initiatives with greater potential such as the creation of a common safe asset will face considerable political resistance in the short term we should therefore choose our battles wisely when discussing policy priorities that could improve europe s financial market architecture in the short term so what areas should we focus on when shaping cmu in the future in the view of the ecb there are three high priority areas harmonising insolvency frameworks the first relates to harmonising insolvency frameworks an area in which synergies between the banking union and the capital markets union are particularly strong high non performing loan ratios and their effects on growth and bank lending are a case in point transparent and efficient insolvency frameworks are the backbone of cross border capital markets transactions they safeguard trust and legal certainty for issuers and investors and by fostering effective and efficient resolution actions they increase the expected return on investment and thereby stimulate investment in both credit and capital markets the end result is higher rates of economic growth more dynamic local economies and higher levels of private risk sharing some progress has already been made most notably through the proposal on preventive restructuring frameworks second chance and measures to increase the efficiency of restructuring insolvency and discharge procedures but the commission proposal fell short of harmonising core aspects of insolvency such as rules on conditions for opening insolvency proceedings a common definition of insolvency ranking of claims and avoidance actions in general and for various aspects that were included in the proposal it has become clear that at the current stage we face significant challenges in overcoming prevailing divergences in views among member states it thus makes sense for eu legislators to tackle this issue in stages and focus first on harmonising specific elements of insolvency frameworks full harmonisation of creditor hierarchy in bank insolvency for example is one area where achieving tangible results would have a high impact a harmonised depositor preference rule would help create a level playing field for debt issuance by banks and enhance the robustness of their resolution framework which benefits the overall stability of the financial system and in turn strengthens banks capacity to support the wider economy more generally a clear credit hierarchy for all companies not just banks would provide cross border investors with greater comparability and transparency on the ranking of their claims in insolvency supervisory convergence and the oversight and supervision of central counterparties the second area that we should prioritise on the cmu agenda relates to supervisory convergence the final outcome of the review of the three european supervisory authorities esas fell short of its initial ambitions in particular on governance aspects where national authorities retain a leading role despite a strengthened profile for the esas chairpersons ever more sophisticated technologies and products climate change and the rise of cybercrime increasingly require a highly coordinated european approach and a governance and accountability structure for the european securities and markets authority esma that is more consistent with its status as a fully fledged supervisory body consider facebook s plan to launch a new global digital currency the implications of which are now being scrutinised by a g7 working group which i chair such initiatives naturally require a global response including a harmonised pan european position to put it simply truly integrated european capital markets will ultimately require a single capital markets supervisor much in the same spirit as we have a single bank supervisor today take the role of esma in the supervision of central counterparties ccps given that the brunt of default risk in eu ccps is borne by their clearing members most of whom are directly supervised and resolved at the european level the principle of aligning liability and responsibility clearly implies european supervision of eu ccps but despite significant legislative efforts the recent revision of the european market infrastructure regulation emir 2 is a lost opportunity to advance capital market union as the competence for ccp supervision will remain almost exclusively national what emir 2 does do however is strengthen the eu regulatory framework with respect to clearing activities which are systemically important for the eu but take place in non eu countries including those provided from london after brexit this debate is arguably at the heart of the current discussion on fragmentation instead of being based only on equivalence at jurisdiction level the new framework will also subject systemically important non eu ccps to emir standards and supervision by esma this will ensure a level playing field with eu ccps limiting regulatory arbitrage and enhance ccp resilience one open issue is whether regulators should force swaps clearing to be relocated even if it risks increasing spatial fragmentation emir 2 clearly states that recognition can only be denied as a last resort and the ecb supports this approach cooperation has in fact always been the ecb s preferred approach to the oversight of financial market infrastructures as per responsibility e of the cpmi iosco principles for financial market infrastructures in this respect the existence of common regulatory standards for ccps has been playing a fundamental role for underpinning co operation arrangements including mutual recognition we therefore also note with interest that the us commodity futures trading commission now intends to move to a proportional approach similar to emir 2 and we look forward to learning more about this new framework in the future i would only note that given the importance of clearing for the stability of the global financial system our reliance on deference depends on the depth of cooperation and information sharing between authorities there is still much progress to be made on that front and the implementation of international commitments is of the essence diversifying external funding for the real economy the third area of priority for cmu should focus on broadening and deepening the funding mix of euro area firms and households this is particularly important for the transmission of monetary policy today firms in the euro area predominately rely on bank lending for their debt financing although the importance of non bank financing has increased over the past ten years the latest data indicate that bank lending accounts on average for around 55 of debt financing of euro area firms in the united states by contrast firms source around 70 of their debt financing directly from non banks and only 30 from banks in principle bank and market based finance tend to support economic development and living standards in similar ways but the euro area sovereign debt crisis and the subsequent impairment of the bank lending channel underlined that what matters for resilience and growth is that funding is diverse and avoids concentration risks clearly market financing is still too rare in the euro area and too restricted to large companies according to the most recent survey on the access to finance of enterprises safe for the period from october 2018 to march 2019 only 11 of small and medium sized companies smes have considered taking on equity financing and only 3 issued debt securities smes have therefore increasingly sought to raise capital outside of public capital markets private equity investors in particular have partly filled the void left by financial markets their investment has increased considerably in recent years and has also benefited many young and small companies in 2018 total equity invested in european companies increased by 7 to 80 6 billion the highest level recorded to date the number of companies receiving equity investment also reached its highest level also increasing by 7 to over 7 800 companies 86 of these were smes venture capital investment which is particularly important for young innovative firms stood at a historical high of 8 2 billion funding a record 4 400 companies but because the united kingdom is home to around one fifth of the eu s private equity funds brexit may disrupt private equity investment as non eu private equity funds can only be marketed in the eu under strict conditions in order to fill the gap left by the possible loss of uk private equity funds we need to harmonise the myriad of existing national requirements and ensure that eu based funds and managers are allowed to reap the full benefits of the single passport and market their products to all suitable eu investors all this suggests that more needs to be done to further diversify external funding of euro area firms in particular for smes which are typically the first to suffer from tightening credit conditions when the tide turns and risk aversion rises this relates to both market integration and market development the role of market development market development entails both seizing new opportunities and making sure that existing frameworks are fit for purpose fintech for example opens up new sources of funding and new opportunities for investors such as crowdfunding and the work by the eu technical expert group on sustainable finance published last week will help deepen the market for green investments by laying out a common taxonomy for sustainable financial instruments the ecb is supporting market development efforts by establishing state of the art market infrastructures in november last year for example the ecb launched target instant payment settlement tips which allows payment service providers to offer funds transfers to customers in real time and around the clock across europe we have also launched a market consultation on a european mechanism for the issuance and initial distribution of debt securities eddi to which we expect comments before 9 july cutting red tape also supports market development i welcome the current work by the european commission to consider ways to encourage smes to tap capital markets for their financing needs more often but incentives must be aligned too in particular preferential tax treatment contributes to pushing firms towards debt funding this unequal treatment might incentivise excessive leverage and hinder effective private risk sharing the role of market integration market integration in turn leverages the potential of market development initiatives and enhances market depth research suggests that deeper equity markets are more effective in bringing economies closer to the technological frontier as well as in greening the local economy on the retail side the creation of a pan european personal pension product would go a long way towards integrating local capital markets and overcoming prevailing home biases unfortunately the initial proposal was watered down and the tax treatment has been fully left to the national authorities discretion renewed impetus here is vital pension reforms that strengthen private retirement savings and also contribute to the diversification of such savings into equity would support the process in 2017 eu households held just 21 of their financial assets in shares and equity compared with 41 in the united states a second important lever for integration and diversification is to build on the newly adopted european covered bonds directive and to increase efforts to revive the european securitisation market in particular sme securitisation sme deals only accounted for around 8 of overall securitisation in 2016 early on the ecb and the bank of england have called for a revitalisation of the european securitisation market addressing the flaws evidenced by the crisis the new european securitisation regulation entered into force at the start of this year we have already seen it bearing fruit as simple transparent and standardised securitisations have started to pick up with 16 such transactions published on esma s central register between late march and early june the development of covered bond like structures backed by sme loans such as the european secured notes could complement efforts to open up new financing sources for smes benchmark rates and the need for fallback options before concluding let me say a word on a matter that is very much related to the resilience of european financial markets namely the ongoing interest rate benchmark reform where a lot of progress has been made this year given isda s work to implement more robust fallbacks for derivatives that reference key interbank offered rates i will focus on the role of fallbacks for euribor euribor plays an important role in the transmission of the ecb s monetary policy it is closely linked to the interest rates that affect many businesses and households in the euro area more than 80 of new loans to non financial corporations in the euro area are based on floating rates and more than 20 of new loans to households including mortgages are variable rate loans in many euro area countries this share is significantly higher it is therefore encouraging to see that the euribor reform has entered its final stages last month euribor s administrator the european money markets institute emmi started to phase in the new hybrid methodology the relevant supervisory authority the financial services and markets authority is currently assessing its compliance with the eu benchmarks regulation bmr the outcome of this assessment is expected to be positive allowing users to continue to reference euribor beyond the deadline given by the bmr which is expected to be extended by political agreement to the end of 2021 yet euribor also in its amended form will ultimately rely on voluntary contributions by its panel banks the bmr includes the possibility of making these contributions mandatory for a period of time but eventually it will be up to the market including users and panel banks to see whether euribor can be sustained in the long run this means that we need to prepare for various eventualities for this reason it is important that the working group on euro risk free rates continues its ongoing work on identifying fallbacks for euribor based on the ecb s euro short term rate str that will be published as of 2 october this year as a first step earlier this year the working group recommended a methodology for calculating forward looking term rates based on the str however at the current stage it is not certain whether and when forward looking term rates based on str will become available and for which use cases they would be suitable for this fallback solution to ultimately gain ground we need the market to start preparing for the use of str as soon as possible and to build up liquid derivatives markets conclusion in any event and with this i would like to conclude further analysis of the appropriate fallbacks for euribor and the ways to implement them is required this includes the need to make decisions on trade offs between international comparability consistency across products and availability for use i am sure isda will continue to play a vital role in finding such solutions for the euro area the reform of interest rate benchmarks comes at a time when more far reaching and encompassing reforms to european capital markets are needed to promote integration strengthen investment and boost private risk sharing the united kingdom s departure from the eu reinforces the urgency with which we should pursue policies that address barriers to capital market integration in europe and eliminate opportunities for regulatory arbitrage more integrated capital markets will support the transmission of the single monetary policy and increase its resilience in periods of stress advancing cmu should therefore be a top priority for the new european commission and parliament thank you

source multi currency system scrapped the herald june 25 2019 golden sibanda senior business reporter government has removed the multi currency regime and restricted domestic transactions to local currency renamed zimbabwe dollar in an effort to enhance the affordability of goods and services by the majority finance and economic development minister professor mthuli ncube yesterday told the herald that government had taken the decision abandon the multi currency system after noting that the market was choosing to price a number of goods and services in us dollars when the majority of citizens earned the local unit he said apart from enabling everyone to transact those with and without access to foreign currency the new measures would give the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz full monetary policy control to defend the value of the domestic currency prof ncube said key fundamentals to support a local currency including controlled government expenditure and budget surpluses were now in place basically we have made another step forward by moving away from a multi currency regime to a mono currency regime where the domestic currency zimbabwe dollar is now the sole legal tender for transactions within zimbabwe said prof ncube what was happening out there in the market was that the market was choosing a mono currency being the us dollar and that is untenable because we do not control the sourcing of it and the supply of it we cannot even conduct monetary policy on the back of it the departure from the multi currency regime dovetails with president mnangagwa s remarks in an interview with bloomberg in mozambique last week that it was necessary to have currency reforms in the country talk of a reverting to local currency has also been insistent over the past year as government has taken pragmatic steps to finally move to a new local currency essentially the latest move is arguably a penultimate stop before the adoption of the fully monetised local unit yesterday prof ncube said using the zimdollar would make it easier to transact on the domestic market with forex reserved for external payments we also know that in some quarters we were not even allowed to transact in us dollars because of things like sanctions and other restrictions so it s necessary to move on and use a currency that you can control and also what we are trying to do is restore full monetary policy where the central bank can conduct monetary policy using the array of tools that are necessary for managing monetary policy such as interest rates use of a monetary policy committee to govern things like targeting money balances or even targeting inflation he said prof ncube said people will use the existing rtgs dollar bond notes and bond coins which means nothing changes really what changes is the name of the currency to zimbabwe dollar plus the fact that it is now the only legal tender in zimbabwe he said prof ncube said the use the zimbabwe dollar is expected to result in an increase in us dollars flows into bureaux de change and banks as people convert their money to transact he added the new measures speak to discussions government recently had with its workers basically the multicurrency regime which had by the way become a mono currency in favour of the us dollar was favouring those with access to us dollars those with access to us dollars were facing no change in inflation at all for the last three years so we were now creating a society of haves and have nots those who have access to us dollars and those who don t those who don t are faced with rtgs inflation while those who have us dollars are faced with zero inflation through statutory instrument si 142 of 2019 known as reserve bank of zimbabwe legal tender regulations government abolished the use of multiple currencies such as british pound united states dollar south african rand and botswana pula among others zimbabwe had used a basket of currencies since 2009 the zimbabwe dollar became the sole legal tender with effect from yesterday it will have same boundaries extent in space time or meaning as the rtgs dollars which entails all bond notes and approved forms of electronic money in zimbabwe however nothing changes regards operation of foreign currency nostro accounts which will continue to be designated in the currency they are held

for almost half a century something vital has been missing from leftwing politics in western countries since the 70s the left has changed how many people think about prejudice personal identity and freedom it has exposed capitalism s cruelties it has sometimes won elections and sometimes governed effectively afterwards but it has not been able to change fundamentally how wealth and work function in society or even provide a compelling vision of how that might be done the left in short has not had an economic policy instead the right has had one privatisation deregulation lower taxes for business and the rich more power for employers and shareholders less power for workers these interlocking policies have intensified capitalism and made it ever more ubiquitous there have been immense efforts to make capitalism appear inevitable to depict any alternative as impossible in this increasingly hostile environment the left s economic approach has been reactive resisting these huge changes often in vain and often backward looking even nostalgic for many decades the same two critical analysts of capitalism karl marx and john maynard keynes have continued to dominate the left s economic imagination marx died in 1883 keynes in 1946 the last time their ideas had a significant influence on western governments or voters was 40 years ago during the turbulent final days of postwar social democracy ever since rightwingers and centrists have caricatured anyone arguing that capitalism should be reined in let alone reshaped or replaced as wanting to take the world back to the 70s altering our economic system has been presented as a fantasy no more practical than time travel and yet in recent years that system has started to fail rather than sustainable and widely shared prosperity it has produced wage stagnation ever more workers in poverty ever more inequality banking crises the convulsions of populism and the impending climate catastrophe even senior rightwing politicians sometimes concede the seriousness of the crisis at last year s conservative conference the chancellor philip hammond admitted that a gap has opened up in the west between the theory of how a market economy delivers and the reality he went on too many people feel that the system is not working for them there is a dawning recognition that a new kind of economy is needed fairer more inclusive less exploitative less destructive of society and the planet we re in a time when people are much more open to radical economic ideas says michael jacobs a former prime ministerial adviser to gordon brown the voters have revolted against neoliberalism the international economic institutions the world bank the international monetary fund are recognising its downsides meanwhile the 2008 financial crisis and the previously unthinkable government interventions that halted it have discredited two central neoliberal orthodoxies that capitalism cannot fail and that governments cannot step in to change how the economy works a huge political space has opened up in britain and the us in many ways the most capitalist western countries and the ones where its problems are starkest an emerging network of thinkers activists and politicians has begun to seize this opportunity they are trying to construct a new kind of leftwing economics one that addresses the flaws of the 21st century economy but which also explains in practical ways how future leftwing governments could create a better one christine berry a young british freelance academic is one of the network s central figures we re stripping economics back to basics she says we want economics to ask who owns these resources who has power in this company conventional economic discourse obfuscates these questions to the benefit of those with power the new leftwing economics wants to see the redistribution of economic power so that it is held by everyone just as political power is held by everyone in a healthy democracy this redistribution of power could involve employees taking ownership of part of every company or local politicians reshaping their city s economy to favour local ethical businesses over large corporations or national politicians making co operatives a capitalist norm this democratic economy is not some idealistic fantasy bits of it are already being constructed in britain and the us and without this transformation the new economists argue the increasing inequality of economic power will soon make democracy itself unworkable if we want to live in democratic societies then we need to allow communities to shape their local economies write joe guinan and martin o neill both prolific advocates of the new economics in a recent article for the institute for public policy research ippr a thinktank previously associated with new labour it is no longer good enough to see the economy as some kind of separate technocratic domain in which the central values of a democratic society somehow do not apply moreover guinan and o neill argue making the economy more democratic will actually help to revitalise democracy voters are less likely to feel angry or apathetic if they are included in economic decisions that fundamentally affect their lives the new economists enormously ambitious project means transforming the relationship between capitalism and the state between workers and employers between the local and global economy and between those with economic assets and those without economic power and control must rest more equally declared a report last year by the new economics foundation nef a radical london thinktank that has acted as an incubator for many of the new movement s members and ideas in the past left of centre british governments have attempted to reshape the economy by taxation usually focused on income rather than other forms of economic power and by nationalisation which usually meant replacing a private sector management elite with a state appointed one instead of such limited patchily successful interventions the new economists want to see much more systemic and permanent change they want at the least to change how capitalism works but crucially they want this change to be only partially initiated and overseen by the state not controlled by it they envisage a transformation that happens almost organically driven by employees and consumers a sort of non violent revolution in slow motion the result the new economists claim will be an economy that suits society rather than as we have at present a society subordinated to the economy the new economics suggests berry isn t really economics at all it s a new view of the world view image in fullscreen illustration nathalie lees the guardian in the excitable but often intellectually becalmed world of british politics the arrival of a significant new set of ideas tends to generate certain responses events about it are packed out ambitious young researchers gravitate towards it adventurous older thinkers are intrigued by it new intellectual institutions are created around it mainstream journalists initially dismiss it over the past year the left s new economics has acquired this status jacobs who is nearing 60 spent the new labour era trying and largely failing to persuade centrist politicians that the economy needed drastically reshaping but nowadays he told me i m thinking oh god we finally might be able to do it like all the new economists i met he talks very fast cutting short sentences as if there is too much to explain in the time available a longstanding environmentalist he describes the emerging network of new economists as an ecosystem like the one that produced thatcherism in the 70s this network may involve only a few dozen people whose polemics and talks and policy papers are being followed by an audience in the hundreds but there is an intoxicating sense of political and economic taboos being broken and of a potential new consensus being born there are british and american websites that publish a lot of our stuff like opendemocracy jacobin and novara there are people producing stuff while freelancing for thinktanks or setting up new thinktanks and social media means the ideas spread and collaborations happen much faster than when leftwing economics was just about meetings and pamphlets jacobs says it s slightly incestuous but it s rather thrilling this ferment is beginning to solidify into a movement the new economy organisers network neon a nef spin off based in london runs workshops for leftwing activists to learn how to build support for a new economy for example by telling effective stories about it in the mainstream media stir to action an activist organisation based in bridport in dorset publishes a quarterly magazine for the new economy and organises advice sessions in left leaning cities such as bristol and oxford worker co ops how to get started community ownership what if we ran it ourselves there s a totally new impulse to activism about the economy now says the magazine s editor jonny gordon farleigh who was previously involved in anticapitalist and environmental protests the movement has gone from oppose to propose looming over this activity is the possibility for the first time in decades of a labour government receptive to new leftwing economic ideas john mcdonnell seems to get it says gordon farleigh guardedly he has some shared history with some of our movements he has made interesting comments about introducing co operative ownership of the railways for example others in the movement are more bullish last autumn a widely circulated article by guinan and o neill in the leftwing journal renewal claimed that mcdonnell could be planning nothing less than a transformation of the british economy a radical programme for dismantling and displacing corporate and financial power in britain in favour of the less privileged guinan told me john mcdonnell is extremely intellectually curious i haven t seen another political figure at that level of seniority whose doors are so open to new thinking james meadway until recently one of mcdonnell s key advisers is now writing a book about an economy for the many between 2010 and 2015 meadway worked at nef where his reports and articles sketched out many of the new economists arguments several nef staffers told me that since mcdonnell became shadow chancellor the usual relationship between leftwing thinktanks and labour had been reversed instead of desperately trying to draw the party s attention to their proposals they were struggling to keep up with labour s appetite for them they re virtually asking have you got anything else at the back of your cupboard says one delighted but slightly perplexed nef veteran we scrabble around and give them anything we can come up with as quickly as we can last july nef published a report advocating a sharp increase in the number of british co operatives on one of its later pages with almost no fanfare the report also proposed that conventional companies be required to give their employees shares to create what nef called an inclusive ownership fund in september with a few modifications the proposal became labour party policy i ve never seen anything like it from thinktank idea to adoption as policy says mathew lawrence one of the report s authors this month a version of the policy was also adopted by the us presidential candidate bernie sanders and yet outside mcdonnell s circle and the transatlantic radical left the new economics has gone largely unnoticed or been casually derided the black holes of brexit and the tory leadership contest are partly responsible sucking attention away from everything else but so is the radical nature of the new economics itself transforming or ending capitalism as we know it the new economists differ as to which is the goal is a difficult idea for most british politicians and journalists to take on board after half a century accepting the economic status quo they associate any leftwing alternatives to it either with out of date postwar social democracy aka the 70s or with leftwing authoritarianism with present day venezuela or the soviet union however often mcdonnell says in interviews that he wants to see a democratic economy the adjective most frequently applied to him is still marxist the new economic thinking is almost like a frequency that can t be heard says guinan but with neoliberalism ailing and the right bereft of other economic ideas as the conservative leadership contest is currently demonstrating the left s new economics may have a long future whether or not mcdonnell and jeremy corbyn s labour party wins power to borrow a line from thatcher there is now an alternative the dream of a democratic economy has flickered on the margins of leftwing politics for at least a century during the early 1920s the british socialist theorists gdh cole and rh tawney both wrote fresh provocative books arguing that workers should manage themselves rather than submit to employers or shareholders or to the state as more orthodox labour thinkers envisaged in economic life as in politics tawney argued in 1921 men should not be ruled by an authority which they cannot control this empowerment of the workers was intended to be the first step in a larger transformation the real aim wrote cole in 1920 should be wresting bit by bit from the hands of the possessing classes the economic power which they now exercise in order to ultimately make possible an equitable distribution of the national income and a reasonable reorganisation of society as a whole yet cole was vague about how this overturning of the traditional order would happen he ruled out a revolution and a general strike on the grounds that workers did not have the necessary access to weapons or the economic resources to beat their employers in a protracted industrial struggle a bold labour government could in theory pass the necessary legislation but the labour administrations of the 1920s and 30s were cautious and did not last long when labour did acquire the confidence and time to reconfigure the economy during the premierships of clement attlee in the 40s and harold wilson in the 60s the party chose to do so through whitehall plans and bureaucracies such as wilson s department of economic affairs dea rather than by democratising the economy the results were mixed the dea lasted only five years it was not until the 70s that a powerful labour politician became interested in democratising the economy unusually for a westminster grandee tony benn paid close attention to the decline of deference and growth of individualism during the decade more people want to do more for themselves he wrote in 1970 technology releases forces that permit and encourage decentralisation it must be a prime objective of socialists to work for the redistribution of power view image in fullscreen tony benn at the labour party conference in 1979 photograph evening standard getty images in 1974 wilson made benn secretary of state for industry the economy was struggling benn oversaw and subsidised worker run cooperatives at three ailing large businesses the scottish daily news a glasgow newspaper kirkby manufacturing and engineering a liverpool maker of radiators and meriden a producer of motorcycles in the west midlands the challenges these co operatives faced a lack of previous investment and strong foreign or domestic competitors were made worse by unsympathetic economically conservative civil servants in benn s department an even handed 1981 report on the cooperatives by the leftwing magazine new internationalist described them as doomed from the start they were crippled giants the scottish daily news cooperative lasted five months the kirkby cooperative did better eric heffer a minister working for benn found trade union shop stewards there transformed by their experiences of helping run the business they became real worker managers the cooperative made it through the mid 70s recession but soon after the 1979 election margaret thatcher s incoming government terminated the experiment by cancelling kirkby s subsidies meriden survived the change of government and another recession in the early 80s but it went bankrupt in 1983 benn himself lasted only a year in the industry department before he was removed by wilson who had never completely accepted his radicalism benn never held such a pivotal economic post again just as significantly the saga undermined the co operative option in labour party policymaking circles for decades to come says gordon farleigh from benn s demotion in 1975 until jeremy corbyn s election as leader 40 years later the labour hierarchy broadly accepted that the economy should be based on profit competition and top down management the attempts by benn and others on the british left during the 70s to establish what they sometimes provocatively called workers control were largely forgotten or remembered as just another of a derided decade s failed utopias the chance for a democratic economy seemed to have gone yet during the lean years that followed for the british left another experiment in democratising the economy began across the atlantic in a country less associated with revolts against capitalism it was more local but also more thorough than benn s backing of a scattering of vulnerable co operatives and it sought to mobilise the power of consumers rather than producers gar alperovitz is an 83 year old american economist and activist since the 60s he has doggedly promoted economic innovations that put social before commercial goals often he has been a fringe figure but intermittently he has attracted wide attention in 1983 he featured heavily in a time magazine cover story about the future of the economy in 2000 at the university of maryland he co founded the democracy collaborative a centre for research about how to revive the political and economic life of declining parts of the us which gradually expanded into an activist body as well troubled american cities are in a more advanced state of decay than their british equivalents says guinan who has worked for the democracy collaborative for a decade but american local government also has greater powers so you have the ability to create radical new models from the ground up in 2008 the democracy collaborative began working in cleveland one of america s poorest big cities which had been losing jobs and residents for decades the activists followed an alperovitz strategy called community wealth building it aims to end struggling local economies reliance on unequal relationships with distant wealth extracting corporations such as chain retailers and to base these economies around local more socially conscious businesses instead in cleveland the democracy collaborative helped set up a solar power company an industrial laundry and a city centre hydroponic farm growing lettuces and basil all three enterprises were owned by their employees and some of their profits went to a holding company tasked with establishing more cooperatives in the city all three enterprises have succeeded so far the goal of the project was summed up in blunt almost populist terms by one of the democracy collaborative s co founders ted howard in 2017 stop the leakage of money out of our community yet community wealth building also has a more subtle purpose it is a concrete demonstration that economic decisions can be based on more than neoliberalism s narrow criteria howard was speaking at a new economics conference in england which had been organised by mcdonnell the two men are on first name terms last year mcdonnell introduced howard at another labour event in preston we bring him across on a regular basis now to explain the work that he s done view image in fullscreen the renovated market in preston lancashire 2018 photograph christopher thomond the guardian mcdonnell has long been interested in decentralising and democratising the economy he frequently cites tawney cole and benn in speeches during the 80s mcdonnell was deputy leader and effectively the chancellor of the greater london council glc which pursued benn style experiments with state backed co operatives with similarly mixed results until it was abolished by thatcher in 1986 contrary to his usual portrayal as a statist ogre mcdonnell believes there are limits to how far the left can increase taxes and government spending in his view many voters are unwilling or simply unable to pay much more tax especially when living standards are squeezed as now he also believes that central government has lost authority it is seen as simultaneously too weak short of money thanks to austerity and too strong too intrusive and domineering towards citizens instead of relying on the state to create a better society one of mcdonnell s close allies argues leftwing governments at both the municipal and national level have to get into changing how capitalism works in recent years with mcdonnell and corbyn s encouragement and guidance from the democracy collaborative many of the principles of the cleveland model as it is reverently known in transatlantic leftwing circles have been adopted by the labour run council in the small ex industrial city of preston in lancashire the regeneration has been promoted as a foretaste of britain under a corbyn government preston s hilltop city centre which had been fading for decades now has a refurbished and busy covered market new artists studios in former council offices and coffee and craft beer being sold from converted shipping containers right behind the town hall all these enterprises have been facilitated by the council less visibly but probably more importantly the city s large concentration of other public sector bodies a hospital a university a police headquarters have been persuaded by the council to procure goods and services locally whenever possible becoming what the democracy collaborative calls anchor institutions they now spend almost four times as much of their budgets in preston as they did in 2013 the council leader is matthew brown an intense angular 46 year old who was partly inspired to enter politics by seeing benn on television as a teenager what we re doing in preston is common sense but it s also ideological brown told me when we met in his sparse office we re living through a systemic crisis of capitalism and we ve got to create alternatives by doing so especially at a time when local councils are supposed to have been hugely weakened by government cuts preston is in small but visible ways undermining the authority of neoliberalism dependent as it is on the insistence that no other economic options are possible the council brown continued proudly was supporting local small businesses rather than big capitalists it was using its leverage as a procurer to make businesses behave more ethically pay the living wage recruit more diverse staff and it was aiming to make the city a place where cooperatives were mainstream rather than niche my intention is to get them to 30 40 of our economy i asked whether he had any doubts about a city with a population of less than 150 000 acting as a model for reshaping the whole british economy and by implication economies beyond no he said i m quite strong minded there is a confidence about the new economists which comes as a surprise after all the left s defeats during the 80s and 90s but with capitalism less effective and popular than it was then the new economists believe they are now engaged in what the political theorist antonio gramsci a big influence on them and mcdonnell called a war of position a steady accumulation of alliances ideas and public credibility berry describes this process as a transition that can lead to a different economy mcdonnell told me in 2017 that he wanted a staged transformation of our economic system if enough other labour councils copy preston and quite a few are interested then even without a corbyn government let alone any kind of socialist revolution the british economy will have moved leftwards both in the priorities it chooses and the interests it favours a few hours after meeting brown in preston i spoke to mcdonnell again about the left s new intellectual vibrancy we re beginning to reconstruct what we had with tony benn in the 70s he said a range of thinking groups nef and class have been revitalised michael jacobs is buzzing with ideas we re arguing effectively for a more democratic economy doubling the number of cooperatives in the uk as nef advocated last year that s relatively timid we want to go further he offered no more details but the inclusive ownership fund policy adopted by labour shows the potential of the new economic ideas the funds are intended to be trojan horses inserting into a company s ownership structure a group of shareholders its employees who are more likely to favour higher wages and long term investment the funds are meant to tip the balance says lawrence towards a different kind of corporate culture or as the writer and activist hilary wainwright one of the labour left s shrewdest thinkers since the 70s puts it radical change when it destabilises the status quo in the right way creates further opportunities for change but turning the new economics into national policies will be hard even if labour wins power last summer the head of nef miatta fahnbulleh was invited to an awayday for treasury civil servants to talk about the new economy when i got there she told me i quickly realised that to the treasury the new economy just means tech when i started talking instead about how the economy could operate differently they bought my premise that the status quo has problems they re the treasury they ve got the data they thought that the new economics was interesting but only in a debating society sort of way before nef fahnbulleh worked for the cabinet office and the 10 downing street strategy unit she predicts there will be whitehall resistance to the new economics whitehall hates big change every time jacobs who has longer experience of government is slightly more optimistic some of the younger treasury people will probably be quite excited by a new economic approach some of the older ones will think it s all wrong and others will just implement whatever the government asks he has helped run seminars for mcdonnell and his team about what to expect from whitehall and how to respond my advice is if you want to do something new set up a new unit and recruit you ll get people joining who want to do new things but benn s experience at the department of industry suggest that outflanking whitehall s conservatives may not be that simple and then there is the business establishment since thatcher it has become accustomed to deferential governments to getting its own way over other interest groups and to profits and share prices trumping other measures of a company s economic or social value the intention of the new economists to end these imbalances has not gone down well the confederation of british industry cbi really hates inclusive ownership says one mcdonnell ally you can feel the chill whenever we bring it up when i asked the cbi for their thoughts on the new economics there was a week long silence and then after i chased them a terse statement labour seems determined to impose rules that display a wilful misunderstanding of business the new economists say they are not intimidated we in the movement need to be absolutely frank about this says guinan a democratic and an exploitative economy are fundamentally incompatible we should mount a straightforward left populist attack on these business interests we should say to them off you go to singapore the left shouldn t be afraid of a little creative destruction he says cheekily borrowing a phrase usually used by free marketeers jacobs agrees exploitative companies can go to the wall that might sound like a reckless leftwing fantasy but the new economists argue convincingly that hugely disruptive change is coming to the british economy anyway thanks to brexit automation and the climate emergency brexit alone will require a very interventionist state to help the economy adapt says lawrence it will make it much harder for a civil servant to say you simply can t do that but what do the new economists want to come after neoliberal capitalism in preston after brown had spoken evangelically to me about the virtues of local businesses and local jobs i asked whether his council was actually saving capitalism in the city by making it more socially sensitive rather than supplanting it for once he paused we ve got to be pragmatic he said we are still in a free market environment and i don t see local businesses as big capitalists anyway the vast majority only have one or two people working for them there s almost no one to exploit shareholders are not involved not everyone on the left would see small businesses often keen supporters of rightwing parties and austere social and economic policies in such benign terms but brown went on the labour party nationally is getting away from the old pro business anti business argument creating social value is what matters later i asked mcdonnell too whether his approach risked saving rather than replacing capitalism he smiled and went into the gnomic mode he adopts when talking about tricky issues who incorporates who he said that s the debate then his smile turned more mischievous a corbyn government he said would welcome business into our warm embrace the mcdonnell ally i spoke to said that whenever the question of the economy s long term trajectory came up in labour discussions we avoid that conversation there is no consensus in the party then he added personally i d be quite happy if britain ended up as denmark mcdonnell often cites germany as another country where capitalism is more benign wainwright who has known mcdonnell for decades has a usefully flexible prediction about what might happen to britain s economic culture if he becomes chancellor en route to a socialist society she says there might be moments when a different capitalism emerges ie a more benign one yet the problem for the left with settling for a different capitalism however temporarily is that it may simply enable capitalism to regroup and then resume its darwinian progress arguably this is exactly what happened in britain during the last century after the politically explosive economic slump of the 1930s the precursor to today s crisis of capitalism during the postwar years many business leaders seemed to accept the need for a more egalitarian economy and developed close relationships with labour politicians but once the economy and society had been stabilised and rightwingers such as thatcher started making a seductive case for a return to raw capitalism the businessmen switched sides another difficulty for the new economists and their political allies is to persuade voters brought up with the idea that profit and growth are the only economic outcomes that matter that other values should matter more from now on even saving the environment is still a hard sell the effect of economic growth on the planet is not an issue that s talked about nearly enough on the left admits berry as for de growth the current green term for dropping growth as an economic objective the labour party won t touch it with a bargepole mcdonnell s ally agreed de growth he said is just appalling labelling guinan says the problem is not just presentational a politics of de growth has not yet been invented that will carry the public view image in fullscreen alexandria ocasio cortez at a green new deal event in washington dc may 2019 photograph cliff owen ap instead labour have recently begun promoting a version of the green new deal an enticing but still largely theoretical scheme advocated by steadily more leftists and environmentalists in britain and the us over the past decade it aims to address the climate emergency and some of capitalism s problems simultaneously by a huge increase in government support for green technologies and the highly skilled hopefully well paid jobs needed to create them in a speech this week mcdonnell said that this project needed to be britain s biggest peacetime undertaking since the attlee government s conversion of the economy from war to peace during the 40s in april the shadow business secretary rebecca long bailey a mcdonnell protege wrote a guardian article advocating a green industrial revolution including deep water turbines in the north sea which could provide four times europe s entire electricity demand and could be built and delivered from the uk it was quite a thrilling vision but the turbines were the only potential new technology the article mentioned another enormous issue that the new economists often skirt is whether many of today s workers really want more of a voice in their workplaces when industrial democracy was last a popular idea on the left in the 70s work was arguably more fulfilling and central to people s lives than it had ever been before office jobs were replacing factory jobs work was a strong engine of social mobility and membership of powerful trade unions had accustomed the majority of british employees to being consulted of having some agency in their working lives but in 2019 empowering experiences at work are less common for more and more people however well qualified employment is short term low status unrewarding barely part of their identity at all gordon farleigh has spent years trying to interest people in forming co operatives and not always succeeding contemporary capitalism has produced a pacified passive workforce he says a lot of people even like to feel a bit alienated by capitalism to not really understand how it works they need to be reskilled politically then we have to look at what economic powers they actually want in april after waiting for a pause in the seemingly endless winter of brexit arguments mathew lawrence launched a new economics thinktank common wealth which aims to draw all the strands of the movement together with an evening event in london after an uplifting but slightly too slick film about common wealth s mission had been shown on a big screen which was similar in tone and content to a recent labour party political broadcast called our town lawrence was introduced to the audience by guinan in the speech that followed lawrence covered so much ground that his voice became a mutter too fast for anyone unfamiliar with the new economics to follow during this formal bit of the evening common wealth risked feeling like a project for insiders just another london thinktank with the former labour leader ed miliband on its board yet the rest of the launch felt different the hired room was in the east end far from the usual thinktank belt around westminster and it was packed and loud with earnest talk almost everyone was in their 20s or 30s many of them with scuffed dr martens shoes and austere modern haircuts the now familiar sight of british millennials gathering to discuss changing the world two hours after the start of the event people were still arriving and hardly anyone had left when i did just before 11 the lights were still on in the nearby office towers of the city of london which overshadows the east end and the economy of the whole country beyond but walking away from the buzzing room especially after a bottle of the common wealth craft ale that had been made for the occasion it was possible to believe that the bankers best days might be numbered and that the new economics would tell us how
we no longer had control of the us dollar mthuli ncube spread the love prof ncube said key fundamentals to support a local currency including controlled government expenditure and budget surpluses were now in place mthuli ncube government has removed the multi currency regime and restricted domestic transactions to local currency renamed zimbabwe dollar in an effort to enhance the affordability of goods and services by the majority finance and economic development minister professor mthuli ncube yesterday told state media that government had taken the decision abandon the multi currency system after noting that the market was choosing to price a number of goods and services in us dollars when the majority of citizens earned the local unit he said apart from enabling everyone to transact those with and without access to foreign currency the new measures would give the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz full monetary policy control to defend the value of the domestic currency prof ncube said key fundamentals to support a local currency including controlled government expenditure and budget surpluses were now in place basically we have made another step forward by moving away from a multi currency regime to a mono currency regime where the domestic currency zimbabwe dollar is now the sole legal tender for transactions within zimbabwe said prof ncube what was happening out there in the market was that the market was choosing a mono currency being the us dollar and that is untenable because we do not control the sourcing of it and the supply of it we cannot even conduct monetary policy on the back of it the departure from the multi currency regime dovetails with president mnangagwa s remarks in an interview with bloomberg in mozambique last week that it was necessary to have currency reforms in the country talk of a reverting to local currency has also been insistent over the past year as government has taken pragmatic steps to finally move to a new local currency essentially the latest move is arguably a penultimate stop before the adoption of the fully monetised local unit yesterday prof ncube said using the zimdollar would make it easier to transact on the domestic market with forex reserved for external payments we also know that in some quarters we were not even allowed to transact in us dollars because of things like sanctions and other restrictions so it s necessary to move on and use a currency that you can control and also what we are trying to do is restore full monetary policy where the central bank can conduct monetary policy using the array of tools that are necessary for managing monetary policy such as interest rates use of a monetary policy committee to govern things like targeting money balances or even targeting inflation he said prof ncube said people will use the existing rtgs dollar bond notes and bond coins which means nothing changes really what changes is the name of the currency to zimbabwe dollar plus the fact that it is now the only legal tender in zimbabwe he said prof ncube said the use the zimbabwe dollar is expected to result in an increase in us dollars flows into bureaux de change and banks as people convert their money to transact he added the new measures speak to discussions government recently had with its workers basically the multicurrency regime which had by the way become a mono currency in favour of the us dollar was favouring those with access to us dollars those with access to us dollars were facing no change in inflation at all for the last three years so we were now creating a society of haves and have nots those who have access to us dollars and those who don t those who don t are faced with rtgs inflation while those who have us dollars are faced with zero inflation through statutory instrument si 142 of 2019 known as reserve bank of zimbabwe legal tender regulations government abolished the use of multiple currencies such as british pound united states dollar south african rand and botswana pula among others zimbabwe had used a basket of currencies since 2009 the zimbabwe dollar became the sole legal tender with effect from yesterday it will have same boundaries extent in space time or meaning as the rtgs dollars which entails all bond notes and approved forms of electronic money in zimbabwe however nothing changes regards operation of foreign currency nostro accounts which will continue to be designated in the currency they are held share this post like this like loading
source new currency regime averts re dollarisation the herald june 25 2019 government has announced that the united states dollar south african rand botswana pula and other foreign currency were no longer legal tender in zimbabwe pressure had continued to mount on employers including the government to pay salaries in us dollars as most goods and services are being priced in foreign currency martin kadzere and enacy mapakame the abolishment of the multi currency system by government will avert the country from plunging into full re dollarisation at a time the economy do not have enough united states dollars to support it some economic analysts have said with effect from yesterday the government declared the rtgs now zimbabwean dollar as the sole legal tender effectively abandoning multi currency regime which zimbabwe adopted in 2009 when hyperinflation rendered the zimbabwean dollar worthless the rtgs dollar was introduced in february this year as the first step towards ongoing currency reforms government announced that the united states dollar south african rand botswana pula and other foreign currency were no longer legal tender in zimbabwe it means that anyone who wants to buy goods from the shop or pay for services within zimbabwe ought to go to a bank bureau de change or some other institutions to change their foreign currency into domestic currency and spend that whichever way they wish to spend that s what countries normally do that s what all countries do finance and economic development minister prof mthuli ncube said the continued depreciation of the local currency against the us dollar has seen most business preferring to quote prices in forex in an economy where the majority of the citizens are getting incomes in rtgs dollars analysts said it was going to be unsustainable not to stop re dollarisation given that the country did not have enough us on the back of limited lines of credit resulting from sanctions the policy makers saw that re dollarisation is coming back and this was going to create a lot of problems since the economy does not have adequate resource to back dollarisation economist dr gift mugano told the herald business in an interview yesterday pressure continues mounting on employers including the government to pay salaries in us dollars as most goods and services are being priced in foreign currency zimbabwe is under sanctions and has been struggling to attract reasonable lines of credit and foreign direct investment which are major sources of liquidity under dollarisation by not stopping re dollarisation it was going to be disastrous said an analyst with a local research firm the move will go a long way in restoring most critical functions of the central bank which will empower it to defend the value of local currency national business council of zimbabwe president mr langton mabhanga said zimbabwe needed own currency for local transactions and limit the usage of foreign currency for importing everywhere in the world people do not use foreign currency to transact locally said mr mabhanga in an interview yesterday we had developed a culture where we would criss cross currencies and this does not build competitiveness because all that foreign currency gets siphoned out of the country having our own currency is the way to go what this means is we will have to run a tight foreign currency exchange platform that is free of leakages to ensure companies access foreign currency for their imports and other foreign obligations he said mr mabhanga however said enforcement of the new law would be crucial to ensure success of the reforms as well as tight control of the interbank market economist mr persistence gwanyanya said this had come on the back of a depreciating rtgs dollar and government had to step in to restore confidence in local currency the rtgs was fast depreciating against high preference for the greenback which is a store of value and people wanted it as opposed to local currency even after instances where we had increased flow of foreign currency into the country it was traded on the illegal parallel market as opposed to the official interbank market in any normal economy foreign currency is sold on the official interbank market for imports not local transactions what we need is to build a strong foreign currency market said mr gwanyanya some critics however said while the latest move was expected to see more foreign currency being off loaded on the interbank market it was unlikely given that the largest chunk of forex might be in the informal sector the question is who is holding the largest chunk of foreign currency another analyst said if they are formal corporates companies which i doubt then we are likely going to have improved inflows on the interbank market but we will have problems if the biggest chunk of the foreign currency is held by the informal sector mr gwanyanya said while the move was welcome there must be confidence for it to work the framework is good but there must be confidence for it to work lack of confidence has been a huge challenge and if government is serious about this currency regime there is need to ensure confidence is restored said mr gwanyanya
the zimbabwe government has banned the use of foreign currency as legal tender alongside the local rtgs dollar in an apparent bid to arrest galloping increases of prices of basic commodities and other goods and services however payment for international airline services in foreign currency will still be allowed finance and economic development minister mthuli ncube announced the ban on monday with effect from the 24th of june 2019 the use of the british pound united states dollar south african rand botswana pula and any other foreign currency whatsoever shall no longer be legal tender alongside the zimbabwe dollar in any transactions in zimbabwe the minister said in a statutory instrument si ncube said this means that the zimbabwe dollar which is at par with the rtgs dollar and the bond notes and coins would be the sole legal tender with immediate effect zimbabwe which abandoned its local currency the zimbabwe dollar in 2009 following years of hyperinflation has been using a basket of nine multi currencies dominated by the u s dollar the others are the british pound the euro the chinese yuan the australian dollar the indian rupee the south african rand the botswana pula and the japanese yen the si said the new regulations do not affect the opening or operation of foreign currency designated accounts which shall continue to be designated in the foreign currencies with which they are opened and in which they are operated or the making of foreign payments from such accounts also not affected is the requirement to pay customs duties and value added tax in any of the foreign currencies for goods specified under the law to be luxury goods a serious shortage of foreign currency has spurred a black market where the u s dollar was on monday trading at 1 11 rtgs dollars at the minimum while the official interbank rate was at around 1 6 president emmerson mnangagwa said last week that zimbabweans should expect to start using a new local currency by the end of 2019 or the first quarter of 2020 as the government has made strides putting in place macroeconomic fundamentals needed before its re introduction he said the current scenario where zimbabwe has no control over the supply and availability of the currencies in use is unacceptable
the state and socialist strategy 4 transforming capitalist power from the streets to the state theory june 25 2019 paul christopher gray the communist playwright bertolt brecht once wrote the individual can be annihilated but the party cannot be annihilated 1977 29 and yet in the neoliberal era the party has been annihilated only the individual remains or so it seemed until a few years ago communist parties have become insignificant political forces or as in china are establishing capitalism meanwhile social democratic parties everywhere have abandoned any attempt to achieve socialism through gradual reforms at the most they are resigned to preserving a more humane capitalism the permanence of which they do not doubt furthermore for significant parts of the radical left these experiences of state socialism have not discredited the need for an alternative to capitalism only the idea that it can be achieved through taking state power for them the annihilation of the party is not an obstacle but an opportunity this strategy persuaded many within the new left and the new social movements since the late 1960s the anti globalization alter globalization or global justice movements from the 1990s the world social forums since the early 2000s and the occupy and squares movements from the late 2000s and early 2010s the spirit of this diverse political tendency is best captured by the radical left theorist john holloway and his slogan change the world without taking power 2010 since 2015 however much of the radical left has given renewed prominence to participation within and debates about political parties electoral politics and taking state power this shift has occurred for various reasons the 2015 election of syriza in greece so far the only radical left party to be elected to national government since the financial crisis of 2007 8 inspired much optimism and then provoked much consternation as it sacrificed much of its programme and party vitality with its increasing co optation into the institutions of the greek state and the european union a similar dynamic has occurred with the election of jeremy corbyn to the leadership of the labour party who has put democratic socialism on the agenda in the u k but has become mired in immense difficulties navigating potential exit from the eurozone the new radical left parties in spain portugal and germany confront these issues while also debating whether to join coalitional governments in order to temper the austerity with which their parties might then become associated lafrance and príncipe 2018 the new radical left party in turkey the halkların demokratik partisi people s democratic party has despite the erdoğan government s repression achieved considerable electoral victories but its increasing influence relative to the local neighbourhood assemblies from which the party emerged creates tensions throughout these allied institutions yörük 2018 the left governments in latin america and in particular the 21st century socialism of chavismo in venezuela face familiarly 20th century challenges with the ebbing of the pink tide through complex combinations of internal shortcomings defeats and outright coups chiasson lebel 2018 in the u s the candidacy of bernie sanders fostered dramatic increases in the membership of the democratic socialists of america but in the midst of its modest electoral successes there are fraught discussions about how they should relate both to those self described democratic socialists elected in the democratic party and to that party as a whole these developments have revitalized debates about political parties and the capitalist state widespread rejections of the political party as a form of organization are often based on the optimistic assertion that in the age of globalization nation states and national struggles are of diminishing importance those who espouse think globally act locally correctly expose the constraints on democratic spaces imposed by international institutions trade agreements currency zones and new forms of imperialism nevertheless nation states are not superseded by globalization rather they facilitate it panitch 1994 63 the prevalent depictions of globalizing capitalism as post industrial or post materialist attempt to transcend in thought the social relations we have been unable to transcend in practice the recent waves of technological and social innovations are staggering but they remain developments within capitalism albo 2007 12 an eroding collective memory and the obsession with academic novelty tend to neglect the extent of historical continuity in our era indeed the only things new under the sun are the carbon emissions that disastrously trap its rays an aspect of this continuity is that contemporary debates about parties and the state often feature tensions between two broad tendencies that have divided the radical left throughout the history of its resistance to capitalism we can describe these two long standing tendencies as parliamentarism and extra parliamentarism on the one hand for the parliamentarist tendency to the extent that the state is democratic it embodies universal liberties not the power of the capitalist class and elite groups this tendency argues that the radical left can use this state to fully realize these liberties in ways that preserve the continuity between the partial democracy permitted under capitalism and the full democracy allowed by socialism for the parliamentarist tendency the most important factor is a sufficiently strong and long lasting governing majority that can fundamentally transform the hindrances to full democracy in civil society nevertheless the parliamentarist tendency historically exemplified by the social democrats has been completely absorbed by the state it can reform capitalism but not transform it on the other hand the extra parliamentarist tendency believes that even the most democratic of states is essentially controlled by the capitalist class and ruling groups therefore instead of attempting to win the already existing state power this tendency builds alternative institutions in its shadows rather than being co opted into the inferior forms of merely representative democracy it attempts to create qualitatively different forms of participatory deliberative and direct democracy ultimately this tendency envisions long preparations for what will be a sudden and total break with capitalist institutions whether their goal is violently smashing the state mass withdrawals from the state through actions like prolonged general strikes or some combination of both those in the former sub tendency exemplified by the leninist and maoist communist parties have typically remained dependent on and lacked real control over the state they have conquered thus they resort to recruiting the former state officials and administrators of the ruling classes this among other causes has meant that they tend to replace the capitalist state with a command economy that is just as undemocratic if not more so those in the latter sub tendency are exemplified by some anarchist currents and more recently by the anti power politics that seeks to change the world without taking power they altogether refuse to operate on the terrain of the state which when it can no longer ignore them easily crushes them despite all of their differences these two sub tendencies meet a similar fate they can oppose capitalism but not transcend it a purely extra parliamentary politics has proven as unable to challenge capitalism from outside of the state as is any predominantly parliamentary politics from the inside indeed it has been the case historically that both of these tendencies have not sufficiently heeded each other s critiques bending the stick so far in their own directions that they turn it into a dull boomerang capable only of glancing the arguments of the other side before returning to their own surely this is the most narcissistic of weapons in what follows i will first discuss the shortcomings of purely extra parliamentary politics then i will explore the flaws of the narrowly parliamentarist approach finally i will introduce some of the general issues of how to begin reconciling the best aspects of both of these equally one sided tendencies the limits of extra parliamentarism and dual power in general the extra parliamentarist tendency on the radical left argues that founding an egalitarian society requires creating and expanding institutions that are autonomous from the states that they will eventually replace these parallel institutions include popular assemblies cooperatives free zones social centres councils in workplaces schools barracks and neighbourhoods and in the leninist and maoist traditions political parties that are skeptical of taking elected office in any circumstances that do not provide a reasonable prospect for a total rupture from capitalism in this essay i will refer to these currents as the dual power strategy lenin 1970 although they have also been described as counter power diarchy or autonomism there are several likely insurmountable practical problems for dual power strategies these problems will arise for extra parliamentarists whether they seek to smash the state or to exodus from it those who espouse the dual power strategy often treat it as a general model that is applicable to every capitalist country but when genuinely autonomous institutions have actually competed with their national states for political legitimacy and sovereignty it has been under the most exceptional and temporary circumstances it occurs amid defeat in war as was the case for the paris commune russian soviets and the councils in post wwi germany and austro hungary or defeat in colonial war as was the case for portugal in the 1970s it also arises in response to direct attacks by fascist forces as with spain in the 1930s in all of these cases parliamentary institutions were non existent or much weaker and more corrupt than is typical sirianni 1983 91 8 bensaid 2007 in every other case autonomous institutions have been tolerated by the central state because they exist in single neighborhoods or in rurally isolated areas that do not directly encroach upon its power as is true of the significant achievements of the zapatistas to paraphrase wainwright there is a lot of autonomy on the margins 2006 52 beyond these rare cases dual power organizations are confined to local levels and limited scales the bulk of their activities have been focused on supervising governmental agencies and providing basic necessities such as food fuel and housing where they have grown beyond local levels and when they are established in more urban populous and politically central locations they are short lived therefore these parallel institutions do not last long enough to show the majority of people that they are a legitimate alternative to the claim to sovereignty by the national state while the case of the russian soviets before the bolsheviks took power is an important inspiration for projects to develop dual power it is even more exceptional it was aided by the collapse of russia s outdated state its relative isolation from the rest of europe and the length of time that its dual power organizations lasted which was comparatively lengthy but still less than a year sirianni 1983 109 10 117 although there has been a widespread erosion of parliamentary institutions and practices since the 1970s mair 2013 even if similar conditions emerge again there are other profound obstacles to dual power strategies the most frequent criticism of attempts to build parallel institutions is that wherever they gain much significance they will face constant state repression bensaid 2006 10 callinicos 2006 63 4 this not only includes outright coercion it also has more subtle forms agencies comprised of volunteers who deliver important services like health and education are harassed by the state over things like licensing to be clear this problem is not unique to the extra parliamentarist tendency as is shown by the 1973 coup against salvador allende s parliamentary socialism in chile the point is that the proposed alternatives to political parties such as unions workers councils and neighbourhood councils have often benefitted from the election of sympathetic political parties which have a better chance of holding back the coercive state apparatuses and creating supportive legislation sirianni 1983 111 3 nevertheless even if state repression is somehow overcome there are a number of other significant shortcomings to dual power strategies if parallel institutions grow beyond the local scale they could not mobilize the resources necessary to meet society wide needs consequently these institutions would face permanent fiscal crisis governments will not grant taxation powers to organizations that are not connected to existing state institutions furthermore it would be impossible to organize a disciplined withdrawal from tax collection not only because this would be difficult to coordinate but also due to widespread fears of interrupting the public services upon which workers the poor and the marginalized especially depend furthermore it would be quite difficult for dual power institutions to coordinate and fund their activities beyond local scales for an extended period of time among other things they would have to contend with elected municipal governments that control services above the local level and are backed by fiscal reserves from provincial state and national governments sirianni 1983 112 4 albo 2007 this proved difficult even in red vienna in the 1920 30s and red bologna in the 1970s where a variety of councils were supported by radical left municipal governments for example when bologna dramatically expanded schooling and established parent teacher councils the central government in rome interfered by allocating a mere 25 teachers for its afternoon schools in 1972 3 compared to the 2 000 it sent to milan in 1974 jäggi müller and schmid 1977 124 furthermore some radical left governments have provided conditional institutional and financial support to civic initiatives like councils and services while also prioritizing their autonomy even from these left governments themselves take for example the ways in which the australian femocrats in the 1970s and the greater london council in the 1980s supported and greatly expanded women led childcare cooperatives and rape crisis centres findlay 2018 wainwright 2018 any attempt to fundamentally transform capitalist society also needs to form alliances with state workers especially the front line providers of public services therborn 1978 279 30 but attempts to create dual power institutions on large scales will not win support from otherwise sympathetic state workers since their jobs depend on the public sector they would support the democratization of administrative apparatuses but hardly their decomposition sirianni 1983 114 it is not merely that disaffected state workers are capable of wide ranging sabotage of revolutionary efforts more importantly public sector unions can also be positive active participants in democratizing state structures and empowering egalitarian social movement and labour movement organizations this is possible even in some of the more coercive institutions of the state for example toronto immigration officers in the late 1980s who were fed up with the lousy services they were forced to provide formed coalitions with immigrant rights groups and in coordination with them engaged in a work to rule campaign for more resources boycotted overtime and excessive caseloads and dealt only with those clients who could be reasonably seen during the working day the joint picket lines of these producers and users of public services garnered such significant community support that the government was forced to respond by hiring 280 new immigration officers mcelligott 2018 indeed establishing councils between the producers and users of public goods would go beyond specific reforms and begin to transform the state another reason why alliances must be formed with state workers is that dual power institutions have never managed highly integrated and complex administrative systems above local scales the knowledge necessary to plan and run industry on national scales cannot be cultivated merely through improvisation sirianni 1983 118 furthermore a sum of autonomous institutions linked by a system of mandates likely cannot develop a collective will a spirit of compromise within the bounds of a generally recognized solidarity for example during popular participation in urban planning if a town opposes having a waste collection centre that they would rather pass off to their neighbours this will require some form of centralized arbitration to distribute benefits and burdens between legitimate interests bensaid 2007 indeed this would be crucial for among other things ending the environmental racism that locates undesirable facilities in racialized communities during the crucial early period of any revolutionary transition it is likely that there would need to be in place an already existing nation wide infrastructure this long term and widespread cultivation of democratic capacities of both the skill and the will is crucial not only to prevent major societal disorganization and disintegration it is also necessary to account for the fact that when dual power institutions reach a certain scale they have often prioritized their own survival and become quite competitive with each other take for example the russian case the soviet system was continually plagued by problems with credentials forged mandates co optation of outsiders into executive organs violation of formal divisions of authority highly uneven representation due to the lack of consistent formal regulations and the disproportionate influence of the more powerful strategically located or politically favored factories unions garrisons and local soviet bodies sirianni 1983 104 5 in other similar cases of dual power such as the spartacists in germany the confederación nacional del trabajo in spain and the hungarian council government these problems occurred to the extent that they attempted to displace the existing state institutions during revolutionary transitions this often provoked attempts to counter the widespread disorganization and competition through authoritarian centralization sirianni 1983 106 7 117 8 thus autonomous institutions are susceptible to becoming precisely that which they intend to avoid these are some of the major problems that will confront any attempt to change the world without taking power or by smashing power although the state cannot be thought of as an instrument that lays ready to hand there is some truth in louis blanc s refrain not to use it as an instrument is to encounter it as an obstacle 1964 232 the risks of potential co optation inherent to the struggle for public office are profound but they entail fewer difficulties than altogether refusing to operate on the terrain of the state this attempt to cut the gordian knot forgets that the state holds the sword it substitutes an impossible strategy for one that is merely excruciatingly difficult even if dual power strategies face insurmountable challenges however we must also admit that socialist political parties have often become thoroughly absorbed by the state before we can attempt to reconcile the salvageable aspects of both the parliamentarist and extra parliamentarist tendencies we must first detail the shortcomings of previous strategies for changing the world by taking state power the limits of parliamentarism and the social democratic trap many on the radical left reject parliamentary politics because they believe that it will inevitably lead to what is called the social democratic trap in general this is the idea that when socialist parties achieve political power during periods of social crisis their attempts to transform capitalist society through the state often do little more than improve living conditions under capitalism when leftist governments fail to transition from reform to revolution they fall into the social democratic trap by carrying out better than the right the same policies as the right gorz 1968 114 ultimately these socialist governments save capitalism from itself the misgivings of many radical leftists are certainly warranted the parliamentarist tendency throughout its history has been regularly co opted into the standard practices of state institutions amid the onset of wwi the socialist parties of the second international did not call for proletarian solidarity and revolution across nations but rather voted to support their respective countries in the hostilities in the post wwii era social democratic parties suppressed their members militant struggles and demands for greater popular control of workplaces and banking institutions most recently the syriza government in greece accepted the austerity memorandum of the european troika the european commission the european central bank and the international monetary fund despite the unprecedented opposition in the national referendum of july 2015 indeed the parliamentarist tendency has fallen into this social democratic trap so often that we cannot explain it merely as the betrayal of socialism by individual socialists neither can we explain it simply in terms of an abstract institutional logic of the state we should critique functionalist theories that argue that state actors pursue specific policies and strategies because the state s function is to reproduce society as a whole this is circular reasoning these explanations argue that the capitalist state promotes certain policies because they functionally reproduce capitalist society and that these policies functionally reproduce capitalism because they are supported by what is obviously a capitalist state this is not particularly illuminating every state action that does not lead to the total collapse of capitalism is deemed functional to capitalism albo and jenson 1989 209 n 55 instead our explanations must strike the right balance between on the one hand the systemic obstacles to transforming capitalist society and on the other hand the failure of socialist strategies to sufficiently account and prepare for these obstacles amid circumstances over which we have had some control in the standard liberal theories modern society is comprised of a plurality of interests between which the state is a more or less neutral arbiter if the government tends to favour certain interests more than others it is because they have organized into interest groups capable of mobilizing the citizens resources and practices necessary to influence government conversely the best critical theories of society and the state contend that capitalism is the scene of systemic inequalities between different classes and groups clarke 1991 aronowitz and bratsis 2002 ours is a capitalist society because a minority of people the capitalist class has private ownership and control over capital the property necessary for production including the land worksites instruments materials financial assets and labour power the capitalist class also attempts to maintain its rule through mutually reinforcing alliances with those privileged groups whose power is based on co constituting forms of oppression including patriarchy homophobia transphobia ableism racialization ethnic persecution colonialism and imperialism bannerji 1995 ferguson 2016 furthermore this ruling bloc absorbs and cultivates representatives and leaders from the upper strata of oppressed groups for these reasons the government is not simply a state in capitalism but rather is a capitalist state it is systemically biased toward the capitalist class and allied elites the capitalist state has three levels of bias wright 1994 93 each successive level is an ever deeper trench by which the ruling class defends its control over the state it is only when democratic socialist governments and movements begin to traverse the final trench that we will have any chance of fundamentally transforming capitalist society until that point no matter how profound our achievements we remain within a capitalist state the first level of bias is interpersonal most state officials come from the capitalist class or have been recruited and educated by its organizations the private schools the exclusive clubs the corporate boards and the galas therefore state officials tend to share social networks and worldviews whereas the children of the working class are raised in the ruling class they are groomed the second level of bias in the capitalist state is institutional getting elected and influencing those who have been elected typically require significant resources institutional connections and the insider s knowledge of state structures and governmental practices given that the capitalist class has private control of productive property they and their allies tend to have more of these than other groups this includes the think tanks the expert advisors the electoral machines the elite lawyers the seasoned lobbyists the senior bureaucrats and the opulent fundraisers as levins and lewontin note hundred dollar a plate dinners sustain the body politic not the body physical 1985 262 indeed that figure laughable by today s standards would have to be adjusted not only for inflation but also for the ever higher concentration of wealth the interpersonal and institutional levels of bias within the capitalist state are significant but they cannot sufficiently explain the social democratic trap for this we must turn to the final trench the third level of bias in the capitalist state is systemic in order to continually reproduce itself the state requires tax revenues these are derived from incomes which depend on continuing investment and economic growth since the capitalist class controls most economic production as their own private property they are free to refrain from investing when they deem the circumstances unprofitable unpredictable or politically unpalatable when a government attempts reforms that encroach upon the power of the capitalist classes they often respond with capital strikes the refusal to reinvest profits in continuing and expanding production they also engage in capital flight by pulling their financial resources out of the country and reinvesting them elsewhere this lack of private investment by the capitalist class reduces economic growth incomes and tax revenues which thereby hinders the ongoing activities of government that is why systemically the state is a capitalist state this is the paradox of socialist governments in capitalist states socialist parties are typically brought to power by alliances within and beyond the working classes between the exploited and the oppressed these socialist governments initiate their promised reforms such as expanding redistributive measures and the welfare state affirmative action and other equity policies environmental regulations nationalization of strategic economic sectors extending public control of financial institutions and so on then the capitalist class reacts with among other counter measures investment strikes and capital flight this reduces the funds by which socialist governments can implement their programmes and provokes society wide economic downturns and crises that hurt those with the least resources when these burdens become too much to bear the diverse constituencies of workers and their allies vote their own parties out of office bowles edwards and roosevelt 2005 521 3 socialist parties have often stumbled upon the first two trenches of the capitalist state but for socialist governments the third trench which is by far the deepest is the classic source of the social democratic trap any democratic socialist government must recognize from the outset that because productive property is privately owned substantive reforms will necessarily provoke confrontations with the capitalist class and economic crises governments can pressure capitalist enterprises but cannot force them to invest against their interests it is impossible to transform capitalism while cooperating fully with it panitch 1986 79 if radical left governments are unable or unwilling to follow through with the conflicts that their initial successes will inevitably ignite they will create their own obstacles gorz 1968 118 therefore democratic socialist parties and movements must campaign for government office by explicitly promoting their intentions to use these crises to extend and deepen democratic institutions and practices in the economy and broader society when corporations engage in investment strikes and capital flight they annul their responsibilities over the economic production upon which the whole society depends to meet our needs among other things this justifies bringing that otherwise unused productive property under the public control and more importantly the democratic control of workers and their communities the only way to traverse the third trench is through simultaneous challenges to the multiple sources of power of the capitalist classes and ruling groups this not only requires democratic transformations of the state through which they wield political coercion we must also confront their systemic sources of power in other significant social spheres including our families communities and economies in particular it requires challenging their private ownership of productive property through which they wield economic coercion against a state even when they do not directly control it as the ruling political parties we cannot defer a strategy for appropriating and democratizing privately owned productive property it must inform our practice from the very beginning because transforming the systemic biases of the state will require not merely parallel but interconnected transformations in the state and in the broader society despite the disagreements between the extra parliamentarist critics and the parliamentarist supporters of taking power both tend to conflate it with taking office for example when holloway 2010 asserts that we should change the world without taking power he does not explain what is entailed by taking power as distinct from merely taking office therefore he does not establish the strongest possible argument for his opponents theory before trying to refute it what then is the distinction between taking office and taking power whereas taking office only surmounts the interpersonal and institutional biases of the state taking power begins to transform its systemic bias this requires a series of interconnected democratizations in both the state and in the broader society otherwise the lack of it in one realm will leave a bastion of strength from which ruling classes can ultimately stifle it in the others it is not that we must move from the streets to the state but that our movements must extend from the streets to the state this is why we must try to reconcile the best aspects of both the parliamentarist and extra parliamentarist tendencies in against and beyond the capitalist state since we must challenge the ruling classes and groups on various fronts both in the state and in their manifold sources of power in the realms of social reproduction production and culture the radical left cannot simply bring together the extra parliamentary and parliamentary tendencies we must genuinely reconcile them if parties and movements remain satisfied with tenuous balances between these two tendencies there will be a lack of mutual transformations and their extra parliamentary and parliamentary wings will persist in their equally one sided tendencies on the one hand the extra parliamentary wing will likely fail to develop the influence and the democratic mechanisms within the political party that are necessary to check those party leaders and members who would attempt to take government office in premature opportunistic or strategically problematic ways furthermore they will likely remain detached from political activities within state institutions which can perpetuate a moralizing purity that condemns as co optation any of the party s maneuvers and compromises even those that genuinely pave the way for further democratizations finally there will not be enough actively engaged party members who remain outside of the state offices and ensure that the party and the affiliated organizations have a life independent of the government akuno 2018 therefore the extra parliamentary wing will not become as lafrance and príncipe 2018 put it a loyal opposition to the party in the state they will be unable to push those party members who are the elected officials advisors administrators and state workers toward ever greater democratizations of the state on the other hand the parliamentary wing will likely become distant from their allies in the party and the movements as well as from their broader constituencies their positions within the party will strengthen making it unbalanced because they hold the promise of getting elected and thus access to state resources and influence this can only intensify the myopia of those within the state who are constantly attempting to navigate the institutional balance of forces make principled compromises engage in necessary horse trading and win the crucial votes since the parliamentary wing will be those who most frequently and directly interact with state officials unless there are counterweights within their own party and affiliated organizations they are likely to be increasingly influenced by this governing elite indeed they will begin to listen to the state administrators and advisors who say wonderful minister you re putting all this party thing behind you and really working for the department that s so fine of you crossman 1972 63 as they narrow their horizons they could begin orienting the party toward a national interest above the struggles between classes and social groups consequently they will tend to prioritize moderation and social harmony rather than the agonistic social conflicts that are necessary for egalitarian change furthermore they will tend to accept the existing structures of the state overemphasize parliamentary debates and timetables and focus mobilizations around the next election panitch 1986 92 all of this will perpetuate the divisions of labour between on the one hand the parliamentary organizations of the party and on the other hand their allied organizations in the egalitarian labour movements and social movements struggles in workplaces communities and families will not be politicized in ways that can transcend their fragmentation and indeed their sectionalism meanwhile government reforms will be achieved through elite power brokerage in bureaucratic legal or parliamentary back channels this stifles attempts to bridge these divides by opening the conceptualization deliberation and implementation of radical reforms to a more active popular control in ways that develop our democratic capacities magri 1970 116 127 8 hammond 1988 259 60 panitch 1986 64 indeed we must go beyond a more equal balancing between the extra parliamentarist and parliamentarist tendencies which in practice might boil down to a compromise between below and above in other words crude lobbying by the former of the latter which is left intact bensaid 2007 mutual transformations toward a more collective will and common strategy require the interpenetration of these elements we are in the wake of two successive eras from which emerged two different forms of political organization neither of which have proven adequate the industrial age which gave us lenin s party of iron was pervaded by these metallic metaphors including goethe s great eternal iron laws marx s iron laws of history lassalle s iron law of wages bismarck s through blood and iron weber s iron cage and of course michels iron law of oligarchy conversely the fluidity of our so called post industrial age is saturated with a more liquid language including berman s perilous flow of modernity which floods into foucault s post modern preference for flows over unities barthes power flows deleuze and guattari s economy of flows castells spaces of flows leitch s local effects and global flows and hardt and negri s global informational flows this culminates in holloway s praise for anti power politics as the social flow of doing 2010 28 with a mere diversity of strategies devoid of genuine reconciliation however the hierarchy of the party and the horizontalism of the movement of movements sit uneasily beside each other instead of a genuine synthesis between the best aspects of both this only builds the solid structures of the party of iron in the dynamic current of the flow of doing but then the structure corrodes and collapses into water that has become too toxic to nourish this combines the worst of both worlds for the kind of politics that can reconcile the best aspects of the extra parliamentary and parliamentary tendencies we can look to campaigns for free and accessible mass transit these campaigns can unite diverse groups in common struggle especially those who are most dependent on public transit including women people of colour youth and the elderly people with disabilities and workers furthermore since mass public transit is much more energy efficient and ecologically sustainable than many other forms of travel it is crucial for the collective issue of our time climate change indeed because these campaigns require a broad range of knowledge skills and actions they will result not in a diversity of tactics as it is sometimes called but in a disparity of tactics unless they are connected to a broader political strategy otherwise establishing mass transit could have unintended consequences such as gentrification therefore these campaigns need to go beyond attempts to address the overlapping interests of a broad and diverse patchwork of groups rather the strategy must be even more co constituting than the many oppressions against which we struggle identifying and combatting not only each and every oppression but also their dynamic enmeshing and blending is the condition of overcoming all oppression free and accessible mass transit will also strengthen and expand the public sector eliminating transit fares removes the policing function of transit workers and shifts public services from disciplining users toward providing for social needs furthermore these campaigns could foster councils between the providers and users of public services between the unions of transit operators and transit riders thereby bridging the struggles of social movements labour movements and state workers in fact these kinds of political strategies not only offer a tangible and relatively immediate campaign but if the dramatic expansion of public goods is combined with the democratization of their production distribution and consumption they also point toward longer term goals and strategies for example when lisbon transit workers went on strike instead of withholding their labour they refused to accept fares this good work strike not only put financial pressure on their government employer but also won the support of the public who relied on the service indeed these transit workers offered a glimpse of a totally de commodified future a vision of transcending capitalism and the state furthermore developing mass public transit will not only require progressive taxes but also industrial strategies based on the green transition of our economies the scale of these transformations demands political parties in government with mandates to nationalize and democratize key industries and financial institutions this could expand public participation in the economy through long term planning mechanisms that are based on collaborations between public banks and enterprise boards for example certain regions could convert their declining automobile industries toward producing mass transit infrastructures and vehicles this will bring sustainable and socially useful jobs to areas devastated by de industrialization and high unemployment including those places that have become the focus of far right xenophobic movements and parties finally egalitarian attempts to win and fundamentally transform state power are likely premature unless there have also been massive campaigns for workers control in order to develop the capacities strategic relationships and confidence necessary to democratize production on a mass scale we should be equally wary of the conviction that the party cannot be annihilated only the individual can be annihilated and the aspiration for more than a movement but less than a party network politics coalition building and a movement of movements are as one sided as is any party that would attempt to become the only significant base of struggle nevertheless if the fundamental transformation and transcendence of capitalist society must occur not wholly but substantively in against and beyond the state how can we develop a democratic socialist politics that has a strategy for preventing co optation into government institutions and ruling classes the mutually transformative collaborations between the new radical left parties and the egalitarian social movements demonstrate what our principle could be more than a movement more than a party bibliography this essay is a shorter updated version of my introduction to the recent

leonard ncube in victoria falls president mnangagwa yesterday said the removal of the multi currency regime marks the country s return to normalcy while assuring zimbabweans that the bond note will not be decommissioned finance and economic development minister professor mthuli ncube on monday removed the multi currency basket of currencies and restricted domestic transactions to the local currency now renamed zimbabwe dollar to enhance affordability of goods this came in the wake of an outcry by ordinary zimbabweans as the market was choosing to price goods and services in united states dollars when the majority of citizens earn local currency briefing local and foreign journalists on the sidelines of the african union united nations wildlife economy summit here yesterday president mnangagwa said the country had properly planned for the decision it took the recent events were indicative of what was coming and what has come is that zimbabwe has gone back to normalcy which is having our own currency we were living in an abnormal situation and we said we will only move when fundamentals are correct and we have moved because fundamentals to support the local currency are in place he said asked about the rate at which the local currency will start against other currencies president mnangagwa said people will ask questions because there is confusion but there is no change all that has changed is that we have removed the basket of currencies he would not be drawn into commenting on how much reserves the country has mobilised to support the new currency president mnangagwa said those who want foreign currency would have to buy it from the formal market our currency denominations are in coins bond notes and rtgs and all that is domestic but we have not banned possession of any other currency except that you can t buy with it we have removed the basket of currencies and if you want to transact in any shop if you want to buy your tea in us dollar then you must go and change at the bureau de change that s what is done and that is normal he said posting on his twitter account yesterday president mnangagwa conceded economic growth remained a mirage hence the need to introduce a local currency it has always been clear that for our economy to truly take off we need our own currency while the multi currency regime helped to stabilise the economy it did not give us control of monetary policy and left us at the mercy of us dollar pricing which has been a root cause of inflation when the majority earn in the local unit but goods are priced in us dollars the outcome will only ever be a two tiered economy stable and affordable prices for those with access to us dollars while the majority face an unrealistically high cost of living this is unfair and unsustainable said president mnangagwa he explained that before the introduction of a local currency it was important that key fundamentals were first put in place central to this was regaining control of our budget through decreased spending increased revenues and for the first time in recent memory budget surpluses under the careful guidance of finance minister professor mthuli ncube this has been achieved as a result yesterday monday we passed a statutory instrument to abolish the use of multiple currencies and make the zimbabwe dollar the sole legal tender with immediate effect this is a key component of our transitional stabilisation programme and an important step in restoring normalcy to our economy government and the rbz are taking the necessary steps to ensure this move is a success through increasing the flow of forex into the interbank market while also making forex available to individuals and small businesses through bureau de changes said president mnangagwa the country s prime resort town of victoria falls had almost dollarised itself as shops property owners transport operators and some dealers were now refusing to accept payment in local currency yesterday shops had stopped accepting payment in us dollars meanwhile zimbabweans have embraced the return of the zimbabwe dollar and by yesterday a majority of businesses in bulawayo including those who were previously trading in forex had indexed their prices in local currency the country officially ditched the multi currency regime on monday after government gazetted statutory instrument 142 of 2019 which restricts all domestic transactions to local currency terms a snap survey conducted yesterday revealed that several retail shops in bulawayo had already complied with the new policy and were selling their products in local currency although others had adjusted prices upwards they were no longer accepting foreign currency payments from their customers the chronicle visited established shops like pick n pay greens ok and innscor outlets who had complied several basic consumer goods outlets pharmaceutical and clothing shops had also complied business was low especially at clothing retail shops due to exorbitant pricing however some selected traders were defiant especially flea market traders stock feed and veterinary product dealers hair products and cosmetics some service stations like flo stuck to forex while busuman service station in the cbd was closed in most of the shops visited customers had to ask for prices on the tills as they were not displayed and would be shocked to be told of ridiculously high prices meanwhile several illegal forex dealers osiphatheleni had temporarily stopped their operations citing uncertainty over rates in some instances rates were said to have tumbled to as low as zw 5 5 per us 1 and zw 25 for r100 members of the public also expressed relief saying the multi currency regime had become a haven for currency distortions and profiteering by unscrupulous businesses and cartels i think this is good considering that people were economically abusing us in the name of the united states dollar and rand everything is rated in forex and i think the new intervention will correct the market said mr effort tarwirei a taxi driver recently some landlords had started demanding foreign currency payments despite the fact that most zimbabweans were earning their salaries in local currency confederation of zimbabwe retailers president mr denford mutashu said his organisation fully embraces the local currency and supports measures to stabilise the interbank foreign currency market he said pricing distortions arising from the inflated parallel market had left most zimbabweans reeling and on the brink of total poverty mr mutashu said the country was right to move on and embrace its own currency for the economy to fully take off he urged manufacturers millers bakers and all suppliers to comply forthwith mr mutashu warned the business sector against removing goods from shelves saying such malpractice was retrogressive zimbabwe teachers association zimta president mr richard gundane said the new policy should leave workers earning enough money to take care of their families we re yet to learn and understand the full implications of this policy change for the teachers the urgent need is a living wage at the bottom line and salaries that are commensurate with one s rank and qualifications any changes that are progressive should achieve this benchmark he said however great zimbabwe university gzu lecturer professor munashe shoko said government should have consulted widely before introducing the zim dollar the market may stabilise but there is danger that it can react negatively again if there are no checks and balances on corruption as well as money laundering said prof shoko ncubeleon
a bad free trade agreement is worse than nothing kuala lumpur malaysia jun 25 2019 ips with growing economic conflicts triggered by us president donald trump s novel neo mercantilist approach to overcoming his nation s economic malaises many voices now argue that bad free trade agreements are better than nothing after us withdrawal following trump s inauguration in early 2017 there is considerable pressure on signatory governments to quickly ratify the comprehensive and progressive trans pacific partnership cptpp the successor to the tpp undoubtedly freer trade is attractive especially to consumers desiring lower import prices yet it is now generally acknowledged that no country has ever developed without policy interventions typically involving trade to develop new economic capacities and capabilities thus far the cptpp has been ratified by 7 of the original 11 signatory countries with brunei chile malaysia and peru holding out so far ratification advocates claim that the cptpp would boost economic growth by greatly increasing exports they cite disputed peterson institute of international economics piie and world bank studies both by the same authors using a dubious methodology even rejected by the us government s international trade council in mid 2016 i e under obama the reports highlight increased export prospects but are conveniently silent about the far greater increase in imports dubious gains from trade united nations conference on trade and development unctad economist rashmi banga s study of its likely economic impact on malaysia suggests much need for caution the original tpp promised malaysia more exports mainly to the usa with such claims grossly exaggerated by the piie without the usa export prospects have diminished greatly while exports to cptpp countries will rise by 0 2 imports will grow by 6 0 setting malaysia s annual merchandise trade balance back by us 2 4 billion worsening its balance of payments as its services trade balance has always been in deficit as malaysia already has free trade agreements ftas with other major trading partners in the cptpp participation has little to offer malaysian ftas with singapore japan and australia affect 82 of its cptpp exports and 84 of imports hence malaysia will not lose much to trade diversion by not ratifying i e about 0 09 of current exports to other cptpp countries on the other hand it will retain revenue from its relatively higher import tariffs the two largest imported items are automobiles and plastic materials banga estimates that imports of vehicles mainly from japan will rise by 36 if customs duties come down to zero this is likely to wreak havoc on malaysia s already fragile automotive industry over a quarter century ago then world bank vice president larry summers infamously suggested that toxic waste might be dumped in poor countries in africa owing to the lower opportunity costs involved on the cusp of becoming a high income nation the last malaysian administration belatedly took his advice by licensing ostensible plastic waste recycling plants the cptpp will enable much more imports of plastic materials including waste and scrap by around 35 21st century gold standard advocates also claim that the cptpp represents a cutting edge state of the art gold standard 21st century fta in fact it will mainly benefit transnational firms at the expense of consumers workers and the public in participating economies with the investor state dispute settlement isds provisions for example foreign investors will be able to sue the government for loss of revenue and profits if government policies are changed or if contracts are renegotiated even if in the public interest e g by banning toxic or carcinogenic chemicals isds involves binding private arbitration bypassing national judicial systems significantly strengthening foreign investors at the expense of governments with typically more modest means to litigate cases thus exercising a chilling effect on governments to comply with foreign corporate demands government ability to improve public policy will thus be restricted ironically the trump administration is now opposed to isds transcanada sued the us government under north american free trade area nafta isds provisions for us 15 billion after the obama administration cancelled its keystone xl pipeline project the case was dropped after trump revived the project cptpp proponents insist that strengthening intellectual property ip laws will benefit everyone as it will incentivize research and innovation a claim for which there is no evidence the tpp agreement would have lengthened monopolies on patented medicines kept cheaper generics off the market and allowed natural biological materials and processes to be patented the third world network has long highlighted many such cptpp dangers for instance citing the malaysian government s procurement of an egyptian generic treatment of hepatitis c for rm1300 instead of the patented us treatment costing almost rm300 000 encircling china the tpp was originally a minor plurilateral regional trade agreement involving four countries the obama administration decided to use it to check china s growing economic influence with the recent escalation of tensions between china and the usa many in east asia are understandably concerned about how the growing economic conflict will affect economic prospects ratifying the cptpp is likely to be seen as taking sides even without the usa in it to secure broad public support in the face of growing scepticism about the benefits of trade liberalization associated with globalization the obama administration involved over 700 advisers mainly representing corporate interests to be involved in drafting the 6350 page tpp ironically the usa is no longer party to an agreement largely drafted by us corporate interests a few of the most onerous clauses of the tpp have been suspended in the cptpp but if japan australia and singapore succeed in bringing the usa back in the white house will insist on their re inclusion withdrawing from the cptpp would send a clear message that a government is determined to put the needs of its people over the interests of powerful transnational corporations or geopolitical considerations in any case there is no requirement obligation or deadline for any signatory government to ratify other governments will need to carefully consider their navigation options in the difficult times ahead as countries seek to recover and sustain economic progress bad ftas are not better than no ftas and as the map of the world economy has changed options are different jomo kwame sundaram is senior adviser at khazanah research institute kri in malaysia nazran

shame tarumbiswa correspondent on monday june 24 finance and economic development minister mthuli ncube made a big announcement that government had removed the multi currency regime and restricted domestic transactions to local currency renamed the zimbabwe dollar in an effort to enhance the affordability of goods and services by the majority the multi currency regime started in 2009 to stem runaway inflation and shortages of basic goods and services the latest extraordinary economic measures to buttress statutory instrument 142 of 2019 which by and large outlawed the multi currency trading regime in zimbabwe need to be adopted by the state if the serious economic challenges affecting the citizenry are to be further addressed the practice by the business community of continuing to hike the prices of consumer goods is making basic commodities unaffordable to the majority of people both in cosmopolitan areas and sadly the rural communities that traditionally support and supported the ruling party zanu pf in the past elections ironically owners of businesses who previously pegged their prices in united states dollars usd have not paid their workers by similar margins the manufacturing and retail sectors alike are impervious to the government s progressive repeated calls for them to reduce the prices of consumer goods with utter impunity as a consequence of their evil actions access to medicine and disease treatment was no longer possible for the majority of people because of the high prices which the majority could not afford most pharmacies were charging medicines and supplies in united states dollars some private doctors and health care service providers were also charging in us dollars leaving many patients stranded those who did not have access to the united states dollars were the most affected as they had no choice but dig deeper into their pockets to buy medicines and access healthcare this this is a serious threat to the wellbeing of the citizenry regarding agriculture the mainstay of the economy the majority of farmers cannot afford inputs and veterinary services previously pegged in usd which is a huge threat to the agrarian reforms livestock may die of diseases and the average farmer may resort to subsistence farming due to the current high prices of inputs the bold step taken by the state to outlaw the multi currency basket and the designation of the local currency as a medium of local transactions is commendable this is the way to go as all the countries that are forging ahead with development are using their domestic currencies for all local transactions a few examples of countries trading with own currencies and their exchange rates suffices rwanda 1 usd 885 franc the rwandese central bank office at kigali airport is full of usd changed by visitors an ordinary rwandese do not recognise the usd if given to them zambia 1usd 11 52 kwacha kenya 1usd 100 shilling namibia 1usd 14 5 dollar india 1usd 72 rupee nigeria 1usd 361 naira etc further the state could stabilise the economy by continuing to mobilise foreign currency reserves and to provide measurable assistance to the productive sector for it to be able to export there is also a need for the state to strengthen assistance to farmers so that they grow crops such as wheat and oil seeds to achieve import substitution as well as offering competitive prices for crops that enhance food security furthermore the state may need to educate the citizenry and traders on the value of transacting in local currency as a unit and outlaw the three tier pricing structure some asian traders always have network challenges with the swipe machines a deliberate way of fighting the local currency agenda in addition the citizenry top to bottom need to be cleansed through education of this worrisome insatiable appetite for the us dollar and conversely unbelievable disbelief in our own currency as a medium of trading there is no need to fear past experience with the zimbabwe dollar which was punctuated by a hostile regime change agenda we now have international goodwill which should cushion the local currency against manipulation for political gain provided adequate foreign currency reserves are mobilised while the measures being taken by the state including the interfaces between president mnangagwa and the captains of industry media fraternity chiefs religious leaders professional bodies youths among many other initiatives to address the economic challenges facing zimbabwe are applauded extraordinary measures need to be implemented to deal with this serious threat to national security being caused by the erosion of the citizens purchasing power due to the unrealistic price increases industry and retail sectors must listen to the directives of government to reduce prices of commodities otherwise it can be inferred that their behaviour is tantamount to them being little governments unto themselves the prime

legal tender president emmerson mnangagwa claimed the country was returning to normal trade unions threatened mass protests begging to reverse this ruinous policy many fear country will fall into the same hyperinflation it suffered a decade ago zimbabwe has banned the use of foreign currencies in a step to reintroduced its own dollar causing widespread fears the country will slide again into hyperinflation president emmerson mnangagwa said today that the crisis hit country was returning to normal as it moved to end its foreign currency system that has been in operation for a decade the country has a multi currency system including us dollars and south african rand since 2009 when the old zimbabwe dollar was rendered worthless by hyperinflation as the economy collapsed but yesterday the central bank announced the british pound united states dollar south african rand botswana pula as well as any other foreign currency would no longer be legal tender in a step towards the introduction of a new currency the bank said that us dollars and the rand would be replaced by two local parallel currencies bond notes and electronic rtgs dollars which will be known as zimbabwe dollars vehicles waiting in a queue at a service station in harare earlier this month zimbabwe energy regulatory authority zera marginally increased the price of petrol and diesel as the local currency continues to plunge against the us dollar a foreign currency trader holds the zimbabwe dollar notes and the united states dollars on a street in harare yesterday bond notes were introduced in

announcement zimbabwe s largest labour body today threatened mass protests over the government s decision mnangagwa s government claimed the move was an important step towards removing economic imbalances but many zimbabweans are distrustful after a long succession of failed economic interventions zimbabwe congress of trade unions zctu president peter mutasa told a press conference if the government does not reverse this ruinous policy immediately and announce us dollar salary payments we will immediately mobilise workers for mass action the zctu has not moved from its position that the short term solution is to dollarise and as such we are going into the tripartite negotiating forum with government and business to demand us dollar salary payments mutasa added a list of new

government banned the sale of goods in a foreign currency in january the zctu led nationwide protests against a 150 per cent fuel price increase triggering a violent crackdown by the army and police which left at least 12 people dead according to rights groups most zimbabwean businesses and residents do not yet fully grasp the change as they had been mainly using u s dollars to avoid the rapidly devaluing local bond note most traders pegged their prices on the dollar resulting in prices in local currency changing as much as several times a day in response to rising black market dollar rates

economic policies mnangagwa replaced former leader robert mugabe after an army coup in november 2017 but a hoped for economic turnaround has not materialised in february mnangagwa s government introduced the rtgs dollar as a transitional unit before relaunching the zimbabwean dollar monday s announcement created widespread confusion and criticism as the new zimbabwe dollar has not yet been launched and zimbabweans have little faith in the economic record of the zanu pf government what we have done is going back to normalcy mnangagwa told reporters normalcy is that a country must have its own currency we were living in an abnormal situation we should actually be congratulating ourselves for taking this step advertisement the country have recently endured another bout of sharply rising prices with official inflation now at nearly 100 per cent the highest since the hyperinflation era when it hit 500 billion per cent
kuala lumpur malaysia jun 25 ips with growing economic conflicts triggered by us president donald trump s novel neo mercantilist approach to overcoming his nation s economic malaises many voices now argue that bad free trade agreements are better than nothing after us withdrawal following trump s inauguration in early 2017 there is considerable pressure on signatory governments to quickly ratify the comprehensive and progressive trans pacific partnership cptpp the successor to the tpp to ratify or not to ratify jomo kwame sundaram undoubtedly freer trade is attractive especially to consumers desiring lower import prices yet it is now generally acknowledged that no country has ever developed without policy interventions typically involving trade to develop new economic capacities and capabilities thus far the cptpp has been ratified by 7 of the original 11 signatory countries with brunei chile malaysia and peru holding out so far ratification advocates claim that the cptpp would boost economic growth by greatly increasing exports they cite disputed peterson institute of international economics piie and world bank studies both by the same authors using a dubious methodology even rejected by the us government s international trade council in mid 2016 i e under obama the reports highlight increased export prospects but are conveniently silent about the far greater increase in imports dubious gains from trade united nations conference on trade and development unctad economist rashmi banga s study of its likely economic impact on malaysia suggests much need for caution the original tpp promised malaysia more exports mainly to the usa with such claims grossly exaggerated by the piie without the usa export prospects have diminished greatly nazran zhafri ahmad johari while exports to cptpp countries will rise by 0 2 imports will grow by 6 0 setting malaysia s annual merchandise trade balance back by us 2 4 billion worsening its balance of payments as its services trade balance has always been in deficit as malaysia already has free trade agreements ftas with other major trading partners in the cptpp participation has little to offer malaysian ftas with singapore japan and australia affect 82 of its cptpp exports and 84 of imports hence malaysia will not lose much to trade diversion by not ratifying i e about 0 09 of current exports to other cptpp countries on the other hand it will retain revenue from its relatively higher import tariffs the two largest imported items are automobiles and plastic materials banga estimates that imports of vehicles mainly from japan will rise by 36 if customs duties come down to zero this is likely to wreak havoc on malaysia s already fragile automotive industry over a quarter century ago then world bank vice president larry summers infamously suggested that toxic waste might be dumped in poor countries in africa owing to the lower opportunity costs involved on the cusp of becoming a high income nation the last malaysian administration belatedly took his advice by licensing ostensible plastic waste recycling plants the cptpp will enable much more imports of plastic materials including waste and scrap by around 35 21st century gold standard advocates also claim that the cptpp represents a cutting edge state of the art gold standard 21st century fta in fact it will mainly benefit transnational firms at the expense of consumers workers and the public in participating economies with the investor state dispute settlement isds provisions for example foreign investors will be able to sue the government for loss of revenue and profits if government policies are changed or if contracts are renegotiated even if in the public interest e g by banning toxic or carcinogenic chemicals isds involves binding private arbitration bypassing national judicial systems significantly strengthening foreign investors at the expense of governments with typically more modest means to litigate cases thus exercising a chilling effect on governments to comply with foreign corporate demands government ability to improve public policy will thus be restricted ironically the trump administration is now opposed to isds transcanada sued the us government under north american free trade area nafta isds provisions for us 15 billion after the obama administration cancelled its keystone xl pipeline project the case was dropped after trump revived the project cptpp proponents insist that strengthening intellectual property ip laws will benefit everyone as it will incentivize research and innovation a claim for which there is no evidence the tpp agreement would have lengthened monopolies on patented medicines kept cheaper generics off the market and allowed natural biological materials and processes to be patented the third world network has long highlighted many such cptpp dangers for instance citing the malaysian government s procurement of an egyptian generic treatment of hepatitis c for rm1300 instead of the patented us treatment costing almost rm300 000 encircling china the tpp was originally a minor plurilateral regional trade agreement involving four countries the obama administration decided to use it to check china s growing economic influence with the recent escalation of tensions between china and the usa many in east asia are understandably concerned about how the growing economic conflict will affect economic prospects ratifying the cptpp is likely to be seen as taking sides even without the usa in it to secure broad public support in the face of growing scepticism about the benefits of trade liberalization associated with globalization the obama administration involved over 700 advisers mainly representing corporate interests to be involved in drafting the 6350 page tpp ironically the usa is no longer party to an agreement largely drafted by us corporate interests a few of the most onerous clauses of the tpp have been suspended in the cptpp but if japan australia and singapore succeed in bringing the usa back in the white house will insist on their re inclusion withdrawing from the cptpp would send a clear message that a government is determined to put the needs of its people over the interests of powerful transnational corporations or geopolitical considerations in any case there is no requirement obligation or deadline for any signatory government to ratify other governments will need to carefully consider their navigation options in the difficult times ahead as countries seek to recover and sustain economic progress bad ftas are not better than no ftas and as the map of the world economy has changed options are different jomo kwame sundaram is senior adviser at khazanah research institute kri in malaysia nazran

by peter s goodman the shocking rebuke of turkey s governing party in sunday s mayoral election in istanbul resonated as more than a yearning for new leadership in the nation s largest city it signaled mounting despair over the economic disaster that has befallen the nation under the strongman rule of president recep tayyip erdogan advertisement through the course of a 16 year run as turkey s supreme leader erdogan has time and again delivered on his promises of potent economic growth yet not unlike an athlete who puts up record shattering numbers through performance enhancing drugs he has produced expansion by resorting aggressively to debt he has unleashed credit to his cronies in the real estate and construction industries who have filled the horizons with monumental infrastructure projects the bill has come due over the last two years financiers have taken note of the staggering debt burdens confronting turkey s major companies and grown fearful of the increasingly dubious prospects for full repayment investors have yanked their money out of the country sending the value of turkey s currency the lira plunging by more than 40 against the american dollar advertisement the result is inflation running at an annual rate of about 19 besieging ordinary people and companies alike farmers are stuck paying sharply higher prices for imported fertilizer and fuel for their tractors families are paying more for vegetables and eggs factories are paying extra for imported components like electronics and parts the official unemployment rate exceeds 14 of gravest concern the companies that enabled erdogan s construction bonanza have watched their balance sheets deteriorate with the fall in the lira much of their debt is priced in dollars meaning their burden expands as the turkish currency loses value most of their revenues are in lira a potentially lethal mismatch that threatens insolvency advertisement turkey was staring at some 328 billion worth of medium and long term debt in foreign currencies most of that in dollars as of the end of 2018 according to official data private companies were responsible for about two thirds private companies owed another 138 billion in foreign currency debt payable in the next year given that turkey s overall economic production was about 766 billion last year these debts are enormous they have given turkey claim on an unwanted distinction only argentina looks to be at greater risk of descending into a full blown crisis more than economic factors explain the deepening dismay over erdogan s tenure having cultivated power by diminishing the role of the military in national life enabling muslims to practice their faith free of a state enforced mode of secularism he has in recent years attacked democratic institutions by crushing dissent seizing the property of his enemies and muzzling the press advertisement in opting to entrust the main opposition party the people s republican party with control of istanbul the city where erdogan s political career began a quarter century ago voters appeared to be expressing general unhappiness with this means of governance but the common denominator in turkish life the factor that cuts across traditional political divides is the uncomfortably decisive force of economic decline inflation is so high and real wages are falling and people are thinking they have to save their money instead of spending said nafez zouk lead emerging markets economist at oxford economics in london they have lost faith in their currency and their spending power advertisement turkey is endowed with formidable economic strengths a relatively young population of about 80 million a growing middle class a location at the crossroads of europe and asia and glorious scenery underpinning a major tourism industry but turkey has long been dependent on imported goods and cash borrowed in foreign currency making the drop in the lira especially painful the economy descended into recession over the last half of 2018 modest growth resumed during the first three months of 2019 as the economy expanded by 1 3 compared to the previous quarter but most economists viewed that as a temporary phenomenon the result of public spending that erdogan delivered to boost fortunes before local elections in late march advertisement the fundamental situation appears grim with no clear path toward better days the central bank has maintained short term interest rates at 24 to prevent more money from heading for the exits high interest rates entice investors with enhanced rewards for accepting the risk of keeping their cash in turkey but high rates also make borrowing more expensive for turkish businesses and consumers depressing sales of cars discouraging new ventures and constraining economic activity in general advertisement erdogan has famously railed against high interest rates as the supposed cause of inflation which is something like blaming sobriety for the smashed furniture left in the wake of the last boozy bender and has called for them to fall to get growth back on track his installation of his son in law as paramount economic overseer last year damaged what meager confidence remained in the independence of turkey s central bank erdogan could use his powers to engineer a reduction in interest rates sending another surge of credit through the economy and at least for a time making businesses feel better about their prospects he could add to the festivities with government spending taking advantage of turkey s still officially low levels of public debt but that would invite another drop in the lira while further denting faith in turkey s economic stewardship the result would be more inflation exacerbating the pressures on consumers and businesses advertisement or erdogan can accept what he has long rejected as intolerable much lower growth rates than the 6 and 7 a year to which he has become accustomed perhaps muddling through as the corporate sector finds its way to solvency the verdict in istanbul s mayoral election suggests that the people of turkey s largest city are not crazy about their choices and not reassured by the man in charge of the country international markets appeared pleased by the likelihood of a weakened erdogan with the lira climbing modestly as trading began monday those in control of money have apparently lost trust in the turkish president and relish the prospect that another party is seizing some of the economic levers

this article is more than 4 years old 2019 bloomberg finance lp president trump has finally got his wish the almighty u s dollar is finally moving lower against other currencies even the chinese renminbi but the change is more likely the result of the weaker u s economic outlook than foreign governments caving to washington s pressure while these are tiny adjustments hopes that the dollar will stop being world s reserve currency are probably misplaced for the foreseeable future with the u s dollar as reserve currency the united states must as a matter of accounting run up huge trade deficits which trump has repeatedly argued against we think the u s dollar peaked on june 18 and expect a 5 6 move lower in the dollar index through year end said hans redeker a currency strategist at morgan stanley in london in a note to clients what s the reason the fed changed matters last wednesday by turning more dovish earlier the pressure point of growth negative news has switched from pressuring equity prices lower to lowering u s rate expectations in foreign exchange markets it is axiomatic that as a country s interest rate moves lower so does the value of its currency in terms of other currencies that keep their interest rates stable now that the federal reserve is talking about a possible rate cut that is putting downward pressure on the dollar which is great for american exporters but not so cool for american tourists headed to europe unlike many of his predecessors who argued for a strong dollar trump had raised the prospect of a currency war last when he lashed out at mario draghi head of the european central bank for talking about possible stimulus measures for the european economy it was the same sort of thing the fed is also considering draghi s statements caused the euro currency to drop against the dollar trump said in a tweet that draghi was making it unfairly easier for them to compete against the usa they have been getting away with this for years along with china and others the fact is that the world currency markets trade more than 1 trillion a day and currencies move up and down according to policy initiatives that are announced such as draghi s comments about stimulating the european economy but another fact is that in 1958 the world s then major trading nations agreed to use the dollar in international settlements but a belgian economist named robert triffin correctly foresaw that with all those u s dollars flowing out to other countries the us would always run a current account deficit which includes the trade deficit the only alternative would be to drive up interest rates to attract the dollars back to the u s but that might cause a recession paradoxically because of the u s withdrawal from the iran nuclear accord a number of countries including russia china and iran are exploring the creation of an international reserve currency other than the dollar it s felt that the u s has weaponized the dollar by blocking other countries from making payments to third parties such as iran and syria the problem is that no other country wants its currency to be the world s reserve currency because then its exports would collapse and it would run up a huge trade deficit just as the u s has done that leaves creating an international currency such as the international monetary fund s special drawing rights but doing run of the mill business in sdrs would a huge pain

the canadian dollar rose 0 28 percent on monday against the us dollar the greenback is still on the backfoot after the fed took out the patient language from its fomc and today president trump criticized the missed opportunity of not cutting rates in june the market is pricing in a july rate cut by the fed the rate divergence between canadian and american rates could be narrower as the probability of a 50 basis points in the fed funds benchmark is over 40 percent economic indicators would validate the bank of canada boc staying in the sidelines at the current 1 75 percent interest rate specially if the g20 meeting between trump and xi at least manages not to escalate their tariff dispute the usmca was a headache for the loonie last year but the trade deal that replaces nafta is on its way to ratification after mexican senate voted in an overwhelming majority for the deal canada and the us have begun their own ratification process where some obstacles remain but are expected to be surmounted if it can be implemented before the 2020 elections the us dollar is lower across the board against major pairs trade optimism ahead of the meeting between presidents trump and xi as they both take part in the g20 in japan later this week has put the dollar in the back foot the greenback has lacked traction since the fed dropped heavy hints that it s ready to start a monetary policy easing cycle as soon as july us president trump went on twitter to criticize the fed for not cutting in june putting further downward pressure on the dollar donald trump has been very vocal on the fed standing on the way of economic growth and higher stock returns but the central bank will continue e to react to indicators and if there is an improvement it could keep the benchmark rate unchanged trump had a busy day as his comments also caused healthcare stocks to fall as he signed an executive order to improve and increase transparency in pricing after saying unfair pricing has made companies richer oil oil lower as opec and g20 uncertainty hit demand expectations oil dropped on monday despite the us announcing new sanctions against iran the meeting between the leaders of china and the us as a sidebar of the g20 will be key for oil prices with lots of questions likely to remain unanswered there is a small probability of a deal being announced after the two sides were close to deal only to escalate tariffs the two sides remain far apart and there needs to be more details in where they stand for the market to truly grasp how big the gap is supply disruptions have added stability in particular the production cut agreement by the opec but as doubts rise on what the fate of the g20 meetings will have on global growth and energy demand the deal could not get an extension it makes sense for major producers russia being the most vocal to delay their decision until they get a sense which way the us china trade war will unfold dollar weakness and more reports about supply disruptions due to geopolitics should bring crude prices higher with the main obstacle being an unfruitful meeting by trump and xi gold yellow metal retakes safe haven crown gold rose 1 64 percent on monday the yellow metal is trading at 1 419 as investors reacted to the us announcing new sanctions against iran according to treasury secretary mnuchin the sanctions were in the works even before the attack on the two tankers in the gulf of oman gold touched a six year high as the appeal of the metal as a safe haven rose even though the us has played down an armed response and will stick to financial sanctions trade optimism had taken some of the momentum off gold prices ahead of the g20 but the tension in the middle east has boosted prices the dollar continues to trade weaker after the fed has signalled that an interest rate cut is coming benefiting gold the main event this week will be the sidebar meeting between trump and xi which could stop the current gold rally with a productive sit down that ends up in a trade agreement the flip side could boost gold prices even further as the trump administration has shown that it could turn from friendly to aggressive in a heartbeat further fuelling investor s demand for a safe haven stocks equities mixed as trump target healthcare ahead of trump xi meeting equities were mixed at the start of the week as new iran sanctions were announced and the white house put pressure on healthcare stocks by issuing an executive order to look into pricing in the sector the g20 will not get going until mid week but the anticipation of a meeting between the leaders of china and the us is keeping markets guessing the prolonged trade war between the two largest economies has downgraded global growth as more barriers to trade means higher prices optimism remains high but more details need to emerge before the market can fully price in how far apart the two sides really are from a deal the fed has signalled it will stay out of the way of the market by going the full 180 degree turn and after hiking four times in 2018 it now appears ready to issue a rate cut as per the latest fomc meeting july has become a prime candidate with the fed futures market pricing almost a 100 percent probability of a cut and the debate is now entered on how deep it could be with 57 percent probability of a 25 basis points and a 42 6 percent of a 50 basis points to leave the target rate in a 175 200 basis points range content is for general information purposes only it is not investment advice or a solution to buy or sell

close to deal only to escalate tariffs the two sides remain far apart and there needs to be more details in where they stand for the market to truly grasp how big the gap is supply disruptions have added stability in particular the production cut agreement by the opec but as doubts rise on what the fate of the g20 meetings will have on global growth and energy demand the deal could not get an extension it makes sense for major producers russia being the most vocal to delay their decision until they get a sense which way the us china trade war will unfold dollar weakness and more reports about supply disruptions due to geopolitics should bring crude prices higher with the main obstacle being an unfruitful meeting by trump and xi gold yellow metal retakes safe haven crown gold rose 1 64 percent on monday the yellow metal is trading at 1 419 as investors reacted to the us announcing new sanctions against iran according to treasury secretary mnuchin the sanctions were in the works even before the attack on the two tankers in the gulf of oman gold touched a six year high as the appeal of the metal as a safe haven rose even though the us has played down an armed response and will stick to financial sanctions trade optimism had taken some of the momentum off gold prices ahead of the g20 but the tension in the middle east has boosted prices the dollar continues to trade weaker after the fed has signalled that an interest rate cut is coming benefiting gold the main event this week will be the sidebar meeting between trump and xi which could stop the current gold rally with a productive sit down that ends up in a trade agreement the flip side could boost gold prices even further as the trump administration has shown that it could turn from friendly to aggressive in a heartbeat further fuelling investor s demand for a safe haven stocks equities mixed as trump target healthcare ahead of trump xi meeting equities were mixed at the start of the week as new iran sanctions were announced and the white house put pressure on healthcare stocks by issuing an executive order to look into pricing in the sector the g20 will not get going until mid week but the anticipation of a meeting between the leaders of china and the us is keeping markets guessing the prolonged trade war between the two largest economies has downgraded global growth as more barriers to trade means higher prices optimism remains high but more details need to emerge before the market can fully price in how far apart the two sides really are from a deal the fed has signalled it will stay out of the way of the market by going the full 180 degree turn and after hiking four times in 2018 it now appears ready to issue a rate cut as per the latest fomc meeting july has become a prime candidate with the fed futures market pricing almost a 100 percent probability of a cut and the debate is now entered on how deep it could be with 57 percent probability of a 25 basis points and a 42 6 percent of a 50 basis points to leave the target rate in a 175 200 basis points range

by nik milanovich from techcrunch with the release of the facebook consortium s project librawhitepaper the internet tech world financial services industry and policy circles are all burning with conversation on the project s potential we are still very early into libra s life it is after all still a proposal and there is an endless set of questions left to answer the project could redefine how we view money or it could be a complete failure we won t know which for years to come while there isn t much to add to the likely thousands of pundit takes on the project until more details come out this moment does provide us with an opportunity to step back and take a look at money itself we should be asking ourselves how does money work today and how should it work money is an anachronistically analog part of everyday life the last 25 years saw the digitization of most services businesses from communications email to bookstores amazon to taxis uber yet even with the rise of fintech and significant innovation in consumer finance money itself has remained curiously unchanged the future of money is just beginning there are good reasons for money to have remained unchanged currencies are controlled and issued by states and for many reasons they need to be controlled and issued by states but the reasons are a reflection of the facts on the ground today money is too sensitive and too critical to allow for the same level of disruptive innovation we ve seen in other assets but if we were to design money de novo today from a rawlsian original position it would probably look pretty different libra gives us an opportunity to talk more openly not just about what money is but about what money should be and regardless of what happens with libra which faces regulatory and competitive headwinds the moment won t be wasted if we take this time to contemplate the future of money below are some not collectively exhaustive starting ideas for that conversation from the most basic to the more exotic money should be free let s start with the most obvious put simply it shouldn t cost anyone money to use money financial institutions and fintechs are slowly moving toward this consensus but in many cases people still have to pay just to access their money atms charge fees for withdrawals checks cost money to print and for those who feel the u s is moving past them 90 of checks are still written in the u s foreign remittances incur transfer fees bank to bank wires incur fees check cashing incursfees paying vendors with paypal incurs fees etc etc the early promise of apps like venmo square cash and wechat pay and earlier clinkle is to let people transfer and use their money at no cost apple pay and google pay take that promise a step further by making the phone not the dollar the primary instrument for in person purchases all at no cost to debit directly from a bank or credit card account but these apps have no equivalent in many countries while mobile money services like m pesa have been ubiquitously successful in kenya and neighboring countries countries like nigeria africa s largest economy still have significant cost of cash problems and expensive policy restrictions on the use of cash i ran into many unable to dispense cash error messages in my time in east africa where just having a bank account could incur non trivial costs incurring a fee just to use money is an outdated standard money should transfer instantly to most people reading this the difference between instant payments and those that take a couple of days is not significant a paycheck could come on friday or monday a venmo cashout can take a day or two to hit a bank account but as aaron klein at brookings notes slow paymentsdisproportionately affect poor people the time it takes for a check to clear for remittance funds to settle or for payroll to be deposited can mean the difference between paying a bill and incurring an overdraft fee it can mean not having enough money for weekend grocery shopping these realities drive consumers to turn to payday lenders 7 billion in annual fees check cashers 2 billion or overdraft fees 24 billion identity should be programmed into money as npr noted when they waited for a kickstarter payment we just need amazon s bank to send money electronically to a checking account at chase bank it s just information traveling over wires how long could it take a minute an hour it took five days that is because the rails on which money is moved in the u s are more than 40 years old as klein notes you can now send money more quickly from slovakia to france than dc to philly and fixing this delay could be the single fastest way to combat wealth inequality in the united states this is another obvious easy win for the future of money and signs of that future are emerging apps like earnin and employers like walmart are paying workers in real time to allow people to use their money as soon as they earn it libra s own website opines that getting and using money should be as easy and cheap as sending a text message money should move at the speed of communications money should take one click to use amazon is notorious for pursuing one click purchase technology removing the last small obstacles between consumers and their buying decisions money should be no different moving money to savings sending it to a friend making a loan or investment paying a bill these activities could all use a more frictionless ui upgrade unfortunately today accessing your money frequently requires a string of passwords pins ids or 2fa all absolutely critical for security but friction inducing fortunately digital identity systems have been a ripe area for innovation in the past few years smartphone os s now allow people to use biometric identifiers like fingerprints or face id to authorize the use of their money with mixed success decentralized identity systems like 3box sell the promise of one universal self owned id profile that can be used to permission any service built on top of it including financial ones identity should be programmed into money if units of currency can have an ownership field that field can be unlocked using more frictionless identifiers tied to the user and then re coded when ownership is changed making one click use possible this could operate similarly to everledger s diamond registration program this could also prevent theft if the ownership identity field is secure enough only to be altered in legitimate transfers money could also be programmed to be unusable if that field is transferred improperly i e stolen this brings up a related point money should be secure one of the cities with the fastest rate of mobile payments adoption is mogadishu somalia why because mobile money is safe in mogadishu where muggings are frequently deadly carrying cash can be a matter of life or death the future of money is one in which physical theft is no longer possible because money is securely digitized money should be stable while theft drives mobile money adoption in somalia a bbc report titled the surprising place where cash is going extinct found a different driver of cashless payments in neighboring somaliland hyperinflation the rapidly devaluing somaliland shilling has made goods that were previously affordable two times as expensive in as many years leading shoppers to opt for mobile dollars over bundles of cash this is one of the expressed promises of libra and other stablecoins like the gemini dollar or the ill fated basis no wild fluctuations as caitlin long points out central banks in developing countries are notorious for their lack of discipline in maintaining the value of their fiat currencies which too often lose purchasing power a global consortium moderated currency could tame that irresponsibility how does money work today and how should it work hyperinflation isn t as rare as it sounds it was the status quo two years ago when i visited zimbabwe and goods were quoted in three prices over the last year in europe turkey s liradropped 25 in value in its own crisis and today in venezuela inflation stands at over 1 000 000 making goods un buyable the most common explanation for these events is that they happen when people lose faith in governments to protect the value of their currency the drop in value led to massive capital flight ironically to bitcoin as a source of stability including a bitcoin atm in harare zimbabwe s capital interestingly the libra is not the first supranational currency to be proposed see economist john maynard keynes bancor plan it isn t even the first international reserve currency based on a basket the imf maintains the xdr a currency pegged to a weighted mix of dollars euros yuan yen and pounds the libra will be fiat pegged to all those less the yuan but the libra would be the first non sovereign global reserve currency competitor and the first one that individual people could actually use it remains to be seen whether the libra itself one day gains enough intrinsic value what matt levine refers to as a collective fiction to separate from its underlying basket of currencies the same way the u s dollar left the gold standard the money of the future should not be intrinsically tied to faith in local government it should retain its value and stability independently so that it doesn t risk rapid devaluation money should be interoperable the internet could have developed very differently if we look back to the early days of the internet there was always a chance that multiple competitive walled garden internets grew side by side competing for users and refusing to talk with each other fortunately thanks to the work of nonprofit governing bodies likeicann the world mostly runs on one internet even in countries like china that wall off certain websites internet pages still talk to each other using the same set of protocols that they do everywhere else in the world money should be no different it should be as easy to buy lunch with a currency in one country as with that same currency in another the same payment protocol should underlie any type of purchase physical or digital transferring between currencies should be instantaneous and free not require visiting an online or digital exchange the explosion in cryptocurrencies built around narrowly vertical use cases has been interesting to watch but true adoption will only come with a universal resolver that allows people to frictionlessly move between use cases without manually switching their unit of currency different types of money should be use based not geography based branching out from the prior point what if money had built in rules that determined what it was useful for dan jeffries provides someinstructive examples of what this could look like deflationary coins could automatically adjust their value to track inflation inflationary tokens could be built to lose value quickly to incentivize spending governments could reward spending on environmentally friendly goods by creating currencies that automatically discounted the prices of those goods currencies could have rewards and loyalty programs e g starbucks automatically built in currencies could expire if not used in a given window or only activate upon a certain date or trigger action this is the promise of cryptocurrencies as programmable money rather than just digital gold the ethereum bitcoin debate money should be an open development platform if money becomes programmable the possibilities for what can be built on top of money are endless and unexplored some of the most obvious examples are financial applications like calibra the project libra wallet it shouldn t cost anyone money to use money the existence and ubiquity of a single digital currency is just the first step following that step are applications like lending institutional or peer to peer investing savings gift giving etc imagine as a use case being able to ping your bank via text and ask for a one week microloan to cover a big purchase and the loan being approved and sent back to you by text or imagine your kids allowance automatically accruing to them weekly via text and an allowance bonus applied to any money they set aside for savings instead of spending as david graeber would note it s these credit and investment applications that create the potential for true growth in a financial ecosystem many view libra as a future platform like the ios apple store that will house a potentially infinite volume of applications built on top of it these could be universal rideshare apps airline rewards accounts e commerce experiences etc that all plug into the same rails that your money is built on so that the ui is entirely driven by the user intent e g buying something without requiring you to move any money between accounts money should have some guardrails the last feature money should have is built in guardrails this is the most controversial claim here and one that will ruffle the feathers of the censorship resistant self sovereign crypto community digital money has the potential of traceability and programmable rules to create safety guardrails and prevent for example terrorist financing black market purchases money laundering transfer of stolen funds etc libra with its strict know your customer standards will certainly work with financial regulators to ensure that it is meeting these guardrail standards even though early reactions from legislators have run the gamut from skeptical to apoplectic yet there are sound reasons to be skeptical of digital money guardrails repressive regimes could use them to contain capital flight and offshoring a key use case for bitcoin in china they could target an individual s wallet to shut down their freedom of movement or purchase and precisely trace their physical location back door hacks that abuse guardrail functionality to disable money could have the effect of entirely freezing a country s infrastructure and bringing down its financial system it s important to counterweight these possibilities when considering where guardrails should be set and whether they should differ across borders the future of money is just beginning these are exciting times the potential to move beyond centuries of slow progression in financial services has never been greater the internet combined with the ingenuity of blockchain and cryptosystems could build the framework for a global network that brings the world onto one universal monetary standard there are many questions to answer between here and there but with libra acting as a catalyst people are finally beginning to ask them get ready for more innovation to come this is just the beginning for more on this story go to

on the sentiment page post fed monetary policy s influence haunts but doesn t sustain trend last week offered one of the most substantial developments for the financial markets in sometime between the us indices return to record highs the dollar s breakdown and gold resurgence to levels not seen since 2013 while there are various fundamental considerations that contributed to these developments the spark for these more dramatic milestones ties back to monetary policy despite the federal reserve s stated view of restraint forecasting no changes to its benchmark rate range this year the market interpreted enough willingness that it is now pricing in almost fully 75 basis points worth of cuts that carries significant sway over speculators hopes considering the past decade s bull trend was supported heavily by a global flush of stimulus and cheap funding by the world s largest central banks chart ofdow jonesindex overlaid with gold daily for those monitoring the dow ordollar for connection to us monetary policy it is worth keeping in mind the incredible disparity between the fed own view and that of the market at large a 75 bp contrast in forecasts is not sustainable either fed speak or data will need to justify the aggressive position in benchmark assets or we are likely to experience some rebalancing looking for mile markers for central bank motivation we will start to come across a few important highlights tuesday following such a controversial policy decision and sep summary of economic projections with reports of motivated outliers bullard saying he supported a 25bp cut and kashkari a 50bp cut members will make an attempt at transparency with a run of scheduled speeches among the fray today i will be watching fed chairman powell s remarks as he is in a

anticipation for more external support between the us authorities thawing towards reversing hikes the ecb president s suggestion that qe is on the table as an option should growth falter and the boj s consistent drip feed of support but the market is still not considering the question of effectiveness in their efforts should they be called into action it is very likely that the critical point of effectiveness in these threadbare polices will not be considered until dependency hits critical mass and risk aversion is already under severe strain let s hope the burden is distributed before then but keep tabs on pure financial measures like the s p 500 relative to growth connected measures like government bond yields in the meantime assessing trade war damage before g 20 while political risks gain traction as monetary policy awaits its next charge anticipation for trade wars is drawing the market s anticipation and fears forward the g 20 summit scheduled for friday and saturday will invariably hit on multiple key issues but the supposed deadline for presidents trump and xi to sign off on a deal or else automatically escalate the already painful reciprocal taxes will ensure this particular hurdle to growth will remain front and enter it will be difficult to direct confidence in the economic standoff for better or worse before such a decisive meeting but that doesn t mean the market will not be paying close attention to developments in the meantime this past session china reported a 70 percent drop in imports of american agricultural goods and the dallas fed issued a survey of business leaders in its area that showed a third of respondents felt an impact from tariffs and 86 percent of those said it was a bad impact further updates on trade await us between now and friday with tuesday s docket presenting a few notables the us consumer sentiment survey from the conference board will be particularly important as it represents the world s largest collective

intense scrutiny on tech and chipmakers that said micron technology will offer an important read on the ongoing fallout chart of cnhusd overlaid with micron in blue and fedex in red daily another theme that deserves constant vigilance among global macro traders is the threat that political risk will be thrown off its increasingly dubious equilibrium following news last week that iran had downed a us drone an escalation from the unconfirmed attacks on oil tankers in the strait there have been reports that president trump had approved a retaliatory attack and then rescinded before the

there s been a lot of talk about how cryptocurrencies and blockchain are at odds with policy objectives and nation states especially with the emergence of libra and the reaction to it from policy makers across the world however there are areas of collaboration where the spirit of bitcoin and the cryptocurrencies it spawned reduces the volatility generated by the conventional financial system one of the most underrated implications of the great recession in 2008 was how it showed the stark weaknesses and strengths of an integrated global economy and spurred policy innovations to break out of the silo of nation by nation monetary policy one of the most direct mechanisms for this was the rise of currency swaps open lines where central banks agree to swap their domestic currencies between each other to help alleviate financial problems in foreign jurisdictions that increasingly affected globalized domestic currencies this had been something tested with the chiang mai initiative cmi and the asian financial crisis but the global financial crisis of 2008 was the first time this regional set up became a global reality and it is only now that cryptocurrencies and blockchain are playing an experimental role on december 12th 2017 the federal reserve extended us dollar swap lines with both the european central bank and the swiss national bank allowing both of them to fulfill domestic demand for us dollars european and swiss demand for us dollars was actually affecting short term funding markets and interest rates the currency swaps allowed the federal reserve to alleviate those pressures without directly funding foreign banks the ecb and snb stepped in instead after lehman brothers declared bankruptcy the federal reserve voted to extend swap lines to other established g10 central banks as well as less established central banks as needed to address strains in money markets in other jurisdictions nor was the fed alone in doing this soon the european central bank would send euros to sweden and the swiss national bank would send swiss francs to the ecb banks around the world had borrowed too many funds in foreign currencies and central banks needed to have reserves in those foreign currencies to satisfy demand in effect a global and integrated economy needed a coordinated monetary response one of the most interesting decisions for central banks when it came to swap lines was just who to extend them to what governments and central banks outside of the g10 would get the privilege in the end the fed decided to also extend swap lines to brazil mexico singapore and south korea all of which were outside the established group of g10 economies the criterion for these were not well established beyond the fact that instability in these economies might have affected the american economy however it showed what happened when a central bank whose brand runs on trust has to pick and choose which other central banks to trust in 2013 the federal reserve decided to keep the swap lines it had open during the crisis indefinitely open turning what had been a temporary solution into a permanent backstop for the global financial system ensuring that banks borrowing in foreign currencies could defray some of the risks of defaulting on those debts currency swaps are political decisions and central banks resorted to keeping collateral at hand for those partner central banks they did not fully trust every extension of a currency swap creates moral hazard on the part of the issuer european banks may have wanted us dollars because they had overextended their borrowing capabilities with this regard a currency swap with the fed guarantees they will never truly face financial consequences for that overextension into this heady policy discussion and this new monetary tool enter the monetary authority of singapore and the bank of canada s first pilot executing a bilateral currency swap between each other via distributed ledger technology in a talk at mit s business of blockchain conference chief fintech officer of the monetary authority of singapore sopnendu mohanty explicitly mentioned the pilot and expanded upon it the next wave of central bank blockchain projects can make further progress by bringing technology exploration together with policy questions about the future of cross border payments on stage he talked about distributed ledgers as a potential solution to how to deal with central banks that were not as established in the global financial system as the g10 central banks and explicitly mentioned developing future pilots of cross border currency swaps driven by distributed ledger technologies in the canadian policy speech mentioning the domestic dlt experiment project jasper the bank of canada was to embark on trade finance and cross border currency swaps were explicitly mentioned with the bank of canada claiming one estimate suggests dlt could enable banks to save as much as 20 billion a year in global back office costs if applied to cross border payments securities trading and regulatory compliance about as much money as the amount poured into fintech every year from an earlier part of the speech it is clear that dlt can help solidify the formation of currency swaps even among partner central banks who may have reasons to doubt one another dlt and blockchains allow central banks perform cross border settlement near instantly allowing much needed funds to flow quickly in times of crisis beyond that however is a tacit admission that some of the principles of bitcoin and the cryptocurrencies it spawned have paradoxically addressed key points of weakness in the evolution of the global financial system currency swaps are a realpolitik take on the reality that domestic monetary policy is eroded by foreign money markets the ability to transact without a very high threshold of trust and the need to do so immediately harken back to a fundamental tenet of cryptocurrency while much has been written about the tensions between cryptocurrencies and central banks in truth we might be witnessing an ongoing hegelian dialectic with the global financial system as thesis cryptocurrency as anti thesis and the synthesis of the two yet to come source forbes

against the backdrop of heightened uncertainties the baseline outlook of my fomc colleagues like that of many other forecasters remains favourable with unemployment remaining near historic lows inflation is expected to return to 2 per cent over time but at a somewhat slower pace than we foresaw earlier in the year however the risks to this favorable baseline outlook appear to have grown mr powell also said while many policymakers judge that the case for somewhat more accommodative policy has strengthened but we are also mindful that monetary policy should not overreact to any individual data point or short term swing in sentiment doing so would risk adding even more uncertainty to the outlook markets have been pricing in a reduction of nearly 50 basis points in july st louis fed

signal that risks to the outlook have increased as we showed recently past fed pivots have come with material downturns in financial conditions mid 2015 early 2016 and late 2018 most recently at present financial conditions are very much in accommodative territory so unless the g 20 goes sideways and that june payroll report is significantly weak it is hard to make a case for fed cuts today s

democrats including members of congress and the two dozen running for president are struggling to figure out how to effectively run against president donald trump on trade the president is highly vulnerable on the issue and there is a simple and compelling framework that explains where he has gone wrong and how democrats can repair the damage the way to beat trump on trade is twofold first put workers not multinational profits at the core of the trade debate for decades both parties have written trade deals and tax laws that have benefited international investors and corporate interests rather than workers second forget walls tariffs trade barriers and tweets and explain in concrete granular terms an alternative program that will allow american workers to benefit from globalization of course with his antipathy toward one terrible trade deal after another his inveighing against our trading partners mexico china europe and his pledges to bring back jobs trump pretended to put workers at the heart of his trade agenda and in doing so garnered the support of geographically key voters with an anti globalization message that did not come naturally to most mainstream politicians including virtually all of his republican challengers and his prime opponent hillary clinton trump s actions show where his true priorities lie his tax bill reveals that corporate profitability remains at the heart of the republican agenda and the notion that any of that largesse will trickle down to people and places hurt by trade has predictably proven false by offering a special global minimum tax rate to u s companies that outsource production a rate that s half that of the new lower corporate rate the tax cut incentivizes more outsourcing of u s production that puts domestic firms and workers at a disadvantage one that has been deepened by the erratic nature of trump s trade policy the tariff threat against mexico being the most recent example and the existing tariffs workers in industries that use imports steel and aluminum have been hurt by the tax on those goods workers in exporting industries such as farmers are hurt by retaliatory tariffs consumers especially lower income consumers who disproportionately buy imports are hurt by tariff induced price increases taxpayers who are also consumers are tapped to bail out farmers in other words so far trump s trade agenda is all pain for no gain surely all this pain is a political vulnerability for the president his argument of course is that eventually the benefits will outweigh these costs but as the trump tariff policy expands without any clear strategic goal democrats can explain why no one should believe him one line of attack is that trump s actions have had no impact on the trade deficit which has not changed as a share of gdp in part because trade wars reduce imports and exports another is that location decisions for production are unlikely to be based on short term tariffs especially with such an unpredictable chaotic leader in charge the other key to beating trump on trade is an aggressive economic agenda that most democrats have so far failed to propose or enact as presidential hopeful sen elizabeth warren d mass recently pointed out a forward looking industrial policy wherein the government identifies and supports potentially promising innovations and investments that the private sector tends to underfund offers challengers the chance to distinguish themselves from trump s insular agenda politicians and economists often disparage this idea as the government picking winners we re already knee deep in winner picking but of a particularly corrupt form through tax breaks doled out to the firms and sectors with the most connected lobbyists and the most generous campaign contributions the finance and pharmaceutical industries are egregious examples instead policymakers need to look around corners to identify areas where the united states can compete globally in emerging areas such as green technology such as energy storage artificial intelligence quantum computing additive manufacturing 3 d printing robotics autonomous vehicles and more instead of erecting random trade barriers the government should help smaller manufacturers link up to global supply chains something china japan germany and canada all do much more than we do next it s pointless to negotiate new trade deals such as nafta 2 0 if we re not enforcing existing rules on traditional trade measures such as subsidies market access fair pricing internationally recognized workers rights consumer protections and environmental standards if the united states devotes adequate resources to enforcement and monitoring ignorance and neglect will not be excuses for inaction finally although trump complains about the problem of the dollar s value in international markets he has taken no action on it for decades other countries have sought to boost their net exports by intervening in currency markets to keep the dollar overvalued making our exports expensive relative to our imports this is a great deal for outsourcers but a bad deal for both domestic businesses and for american workers there are a variety of ways to push back on such currency practices through negotiation federal intervention to purchase foreign currency assets or by taxing the foreign purchase of assets intended to manipulate exchange rates beating trump on trade requires a totally new mind set workers consumers and the environment must replace multinational profits at the core of our trade strategy the current model invent here outsource production there export back here which still flourishes under trump can be reversed by investing in innovation workers and new linkages to trade flows democrats have been flummoxed by trump on trade in part because many of them really do want to change the rules but have never articulated a coherent comprehensive way to do so that has ceded the field to trump who occupies it with phony destructive actions but he doesn t have to own it

file photo traders work on the floor at the nyse in new york by abhinav ramnarayan and ritvik carvalho london reuters gold switzerland s franc japan s yen top rated government bonds and even bitcoin investors have dashed for havens and alternative assets this week as anxiety grows about trade wars u s iran tensions and negative interest rates although world stocks and bonds remain near record highs thanks to promises of ever more central bank largesse the sudden dash for these financial bunkers shows all is not as calm as a cursory reading of headline indexes suggests fears of a global trade war have been simmering for over a year but the latest standoff between washington and beijing may come to a head at the g20 summit in japan this weekend new u s tariffs on chinese imports could kick in next month if there s no progress between the two sides military tensions between the united states and iran have also gone up several notches after tehran s downing of an unmanned american drone last week and claims that u s retaliation was stopped at the last minute a fresh wave sanctions on iran s leaders and a war of words between the two sides have followed the trade and geopolitical worries are compounding investor concern about a looming global economic downturn and whether central banks are easing policy again quickly enough to offset it even if they are the expanding universe of bonds with a negative yield effectively penalizing investors for holding them is unnerving for many it comes at the worst possible moment because we are late cycle we are worried about global growth and the u s are fighting on many fronts said frederic ducrozet a strategist at pictet wealth management referring partly to the trade conflict between the u s and china he said that under normal circumstances the reaction to the dispute in the middle east would have been confined largely to oil prices but because of worries over global growth and the tail risk from trade negotiations flows are being directed instead into safe assets this iran conflict is the cherry on the cake said ducrozet nowhere has the move been more marked than in gold the precious metal struck a six year high of 1 438 63 on tuesday up a whopping 11 2 over the past month safe currencies the japanese yen and swiss francare around 2 and 2 7 higher respectively over the same period graphic rush to safety ducrozet even pointed to bitcoin s resurgence up 40 over the last month as possibly partly driven by the search for alternative investments the promise of fresh stimulus from the world s top central banks has fueled an all inclusive rally in public assets with equities and bonds rising in tandem that is unsettling for portfolio managers who use the more typical inverse relationship between stocks and bonds to balance and insulate their funds the fear is that if they correlate on the way up they will do so on the way down hence the search for more alternative assets to diversify portfolios it seems that the world is so awash with money that it is creating financial asset price inflation wherever you look ing economist robert carnell said in a note last week something is wrong here moreover the likelihood that if and when this is realized the positive correlation between all assets means that my portfolio diversification will all count for nothing is rather disturbing what s more there are growing worries that central banks under pressure from politicians and markets alike are finding it harder to read the signals on inflation and growth due to the lack of visibility on policy and trade federal reserve chief jerome powell speaks later on tuesday following stinging criticism from u s president donald trump on monday trump again criticized the fed for not cutting interest rates fast enough saying the world s most important central bank blew it and didn t know what it was doing the story is refiled to modify graphic timeline and annotations reporting by abhinav ramnarayan graphic by ritvik carvalho editing by mike dolan and catherine evans

by simon black late last week the federal reserve gave its strongest signal yet that they would cut interest rates soon and in anticipation of yet another endless flood of cheap money the us stock market soared to an all time high honestly it s a bit absurd when you think about it look at coca cola as an example its shares are now trading at a record high price yet coca cola s business is actually shrinking its revenue has declined each year for the past eight years and coca cola s 2018 profits were 43 lower than they were back in 2011 so obviously coca cola s record high stock price has nothing to do the company s performance and everything to do with the fact that an unelected committee of central bankers has decided to print more money and slash interest rates it s not just coke as we ve discussed before most large companies in the united states and much of the world are extraordinarily expensive based on any sensible valuation metric investors are paying near record amounts for every dollar or euro etc of a company s assets revenue or average long term earnings now i grew up in a lower middle class household where my parents each worked multiple jobs to pay the rent so i was raised to always look for a great bargain investing should be no different but with central bankers constantly distorting the market and pushing the share prices of shrinking companies to all time highs finding a great bargain can be challenging that s why i maintain a global perspective by expanding my options to the entire world beyond my own backyard i increase my chances of success uzbekistan is a great example it s possibly the cheapest and most overlooked place in the world you might already be thinking uzbekistan is this guy serious most westerners would automatically deem any former soviet republic to be high risk and not worth discussing well i ve written a lot in the past about the difference between perceived risk and actual risk perceived risk is what people believe often out of complete ignorance they perceive places like uzbekistan or colombia another great example to be extremely high risk but they know almost nothing about it actual risk on the other hand is substantially lower uzbekistan has made impressive reforms over the past several years we spent the morning at an event we organized for our total access members grilling several government ministers as well as some of the country s most prominent and successful entrepreneurs many of our members told me they were astonished at uzbekistan s progress the economy is highly diversified and has been growing admirably for years with very low levels of debt and high foreign reserves reserves are like a savings account for a government or central bank surprisingly more than 50 of uzbekistan s reserves are held in gold and the country is a major gold producer we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us the government has slashed tax rates small businesses pay just 4 and larger companies and individuals pay a flat 12 and abolished certain taxes altogether they also set up special economic zones for foreign investors where qualifying businesses can operate tax free for up to 10 years the government has also cut regulations worked to eliminate corruption reduced their own role in the economy and steadily improved efficiency to make things easier for business the reforms are working we heard this morning for example from the founder of the largest retail chain in uzbekistan his company has grown 4x in just the past three years and he believes he can increase another 500 over the next few years insurance companies are another great example a typical uzbek insurance company has a loss ratio i e the percentage of its revenue that it pays out each year in claims of about 30 and an expense ratio of just 10 lower ratios mean the company is more profitable and ratios this low are practically unheard of in the west in developed countries in north america and europe a large insurance company barely breaks even on its core business with loss ratios often exceeding 50 to 60 and expense ratios averaging around 35 plus the insurance sector in uzbekistan has been growing at more than 50 per year so while these uzbek insurance companies are profitable already their profits have a lot of room to grow yet high quality uzbek businesses can sell on the local stock exchange for as little as two times its annual profit the average company in the united states in the s p 500 currently sells for 22x earnings more than ten times as expensive i would never suggest that uzbekistan is risk free nothing is this country still has plenty of frontier market challenges and the risk level is obviously higher than in north america or europe but the actual risk of uzbekistan is much lower than what people believe mostly because they haven t come here or done any research and that s really the opportunity uzbekistan is a rapidly growing completely overlooked market that s incredibly cheap overflowing with possibilities and with an actual risk level that s much lower than what ignorance may perceive now i m definitely not writing today to convince you to invest in uzbekistan in fact i sincerely hope people think i m crazy and continue to ignore this place but i do think uzbekistan is a great example in expanding your thinking most people will keep themselves mentally chained to conventional options popular stocks that are irrationally overpriced bizarrely many of these companies are perceived as low risk even though they re shrinking or losing billions each year but if you expand your thinking to the entire world you often come across overlooked ultra compelling opportunities and regardless of what you choose to do expanding your options always gives you a greater chance of success

october 2012 to 31 october 2013 six month performance source blackrock performance figures have been calculated in sterling terms on a total return basis chairman s statement for the six months ended 30 april 2019 market overview at the end of 2018 there were escalating concerns that the global economy was beginning to slip into recession after an unusually long period of continuous expansion since the financial crisis in 2008 2009 chinese data appeared to point to a slowdown and these fears were reflected in falling share and commodity prices an easing of credit conditions in china and a more dovish tone from the u s federal reserve in early 2019 signalled a reduced likelihood of further increases in u s interest rates at least in the short term this fuelled a sharp rally in equity markets recouping the losses incurred in the last quarter of 2018 notwithstanding an escalation of the u s china trade war equity markets currently remain supported by the prospect of continuing albeit modest economic growth and a benign interest rate environment performance for the six months to 30 april 2019 the company s net asset value per share nav returned 3 3 compared with a return of 5 8 in the russell 1000 value index the company s share price returned 9 5 over the same period all figures in sterling terms with dividends reinvested the movement in the share price relative to its nav led to the company trading at a premium to nav details of the factors which have contributed to or detracted from performance are set out in the investment manager s report since the period end and up to close of business on 24 june 2019 the company s nav has increased by 2 3 and the share price has risen by 5 0 both percentages in sterling with dividends reinvested earnings and dividends the company s revenue return per share for the six months ended 30 april 2019 amounted to 3 06p compared with 2 59p for the six months to 30 april 2018 on 5 march 2019 the board declared the first quarterly dividend of 2 00p per share which was paid on 12 april 2019 a second quarterly dividend of 2 00p per share has been declared and will be paid on 28 june 2019 to shareholders on the register on 24 may 2019 these are in line with payments made in 2018 as stated in the annual report the board has resolved to pay a quarterly dividend of 2 00p per share in the current financial year a full year distribution of 8 00p per share which represents a dividend yield of 4 4 based on the share price as at 30 april 2019 a small proportion of the company s capital profits are anticipated to be paid out to achieve this share issues during the six months to 30 april 2019 the company s share price to nav ranged between a discount of 0 7 and a premium of 5 2 the board is pleased to report that in the period under review the company has reissued 3 175 000 shares from treasury at a premium to the nav since the period end and up to the date of this report the company has reissued a further 1 875 000 shares outlook whilst for the most part economic indicators continue to point to modest expansion in the u s economy the extension of tariff barriers in the u s china trade war continues to have the potential to unsettle sentiment and create unintended economic consequences whilst the 2020 presidential election campaign should provide an incentive for the administration to settle the current dispute the final outcome remains uncertain for this reason our portfolio managers continue to favour those companies with sound balance sheets and those which have the potential to grow their dividends the company also has a slightly higher level of cash holdings which stand at 7 7 of net assets at the time of writing although the portfolio tends to lag the broader market during a sharp rally the portfolio managers believe the higher quality and defensive characteristics of the portfolio should provide superior returns over the cycle simon miller 25 june 2019 investment manager s report market overview for the six month period ended 30 april 2019 u s large cap stocks as represented by the s p 500 index advanced by 7 3 in gbp terms the period was volatile however as the s p 500 index declined by 7 1 in the final two months of 2018 before rebounding sharply in the first four months of 2019 in late 2018 general uncertainty increased as investors weighed the pace of federal reserve fed interest rate hikes persistent trade tensions less synchronized global growth and a shorter list of potential catalysts for upside surprise these factors culminated in late cycle sentiment shifting to recession fears and selling pressure on u s stocks through the year end sentiment improved during the first four months of 2019 as investor suspicions of a sharp economic slowdown abated an increasingly dovish fed signalled its willingness to keep interest rates stable for a time and affirmed their commitment to being patient and flexible in regard to the timing of future rate moves robust u s jobs data evidenced ongoing strength in the u s labour market while geopolitical and trade concerns had also moderated these positive factors combined with less demanding stock valuations at the beginning of the year formed a recipe for strong year to date returns and positive overall performance for u s stocks during the semi annual period portfolio overview the largest contributor to relative performance was stock selection in the energy sector led by investment decisions in the oil gas consumable fuels industry in consumer staples stock selection in the beverages and food products industries proved beneficial as did our underweight to the food staples retailing industry lastly a combination of stock selection and an overweight to information technology boosted relative returns notably our overweight to the software industry and stock selection in technology hardware and semiconductors positively impacted relative performance the primary detractor from relative performance was stock selection in utilities stock selection in the electric utilities industry was particularly weak due to the negative impacts from severe california wildfires on portfolio holdings in health care an overweight to the health care providers services industry and stock selection in health care equipment supplies also weighed on relative returns lastly stock selection and an underweight to industrials hurt relative returns as did the portfolio s cash position which averaged 7 8 for the six month period as expected writing covered call options helped relative performance during the final two months of 2018 amid falling stock prices conversely writing covered call options capped upside returns amid rising u s stock prices during the first four months of 2019 in summary the covered call options detracted from absolute performance for the six month period as designed the company s option overwrite component enhanced the portfolio s income during the period below is a comprehensive overview of our allocations in gbp at the end of the period and over underweight positions compared to the benchmark financials 3 0 overweight 25 8 of portfolio financials represent the company s largest sector allocation and we remain particularly bullish on the u s banks stocks we believe the u s banks are safer and sounder investments today than before the financial crisis they have stronger balance sheets revamped company cost structures and greater discipline in loan underwriting has contributed to benign credit trends bank valuations remain compelling especially relative to other cyclical sectors such as industrials over time we believe the banks can demonstrate improved earnings stability which may merit valuations above current multiples potential tailwinds from deregulation and investor friendly capital return policies also bode well for investors in our view information technology 2 4 overweight 12 4 of portfolio the opportunity set within the information technology it sector continues to be attractive an increasing number of constituents in the sector are what we refer to as industrial tech these firms are competitively insulated from disruptors well positioned to take advantage of long term secular tailwinds and exhibit growth in earnings and free cash flow a swelling number of companies in the sector have also adopted dividend payments to shareholders as a viable use of cash rejecting the notion that it firms can only add value to investors via their growth potential we believe this trend is poised to continue as many mature it companies are flush with cash and shareholders are increasingly willing to reward management teams for return of capital energy 1 0 overweight 10 3 of portfolio the portfolio maintains a modest overweight to the energy sector we favour oil weighted companies over those exposed to natural gas and prefer exposure to large cap integrated oil and independent oil gas producers from a quality standpoint we seek to own companies with experienced management teams disciplined capital expenditure spending plans and exposure to lower cost resource assets from a valuation standpoint we seek to own companies with free cash flow generation and margin capture stories that are underappreciated by the investment community in summary we believe companies with strong balance sheets and cash flows production growth visibility operating specialisation and pricing power at the industry level remain most desirable from an investment perspective health care 0 5 overweight 15 0 of portfolio secular growth opportunities in health care are a by product of demographic trends older populations spend more on health care than younger populations and ageing demographics i e people are living longer is a global trend in the united states a combination of greater demand for health care services and rising costs drive a need for increased efficiency within the health care ecosystem we believe innovation and strong cost control can work hand in hand to address this need and companies that can contribute in this regard may be poised to benefit on the innovation front there is a need for newer and more effective medicines and therapies the u s food and drug administration has made this a priority by increasing the volume and speed of drug approvals which bodes well for pharmaceutical manufacturers that can deliver new drugs to the market from an investment standpoint we prefer pharmaceutical companies with a proven ability to generate high research development productivity versus those that focus on one or two key drugs and rely upon raising their prices to drive growth from a cost perspective health maintenance organisations hmos have an economic incentive to drive down costs as they provide health insurance coverage to constituents the hmos have demonstrated a strong ability to manage costs by leveraging their scale and technology to drive efficiencies the u s government in turn is increasingly outsourcing to hmos as a way to lower costs and balance their budgets we prefer hmos with diversified business units exposure to faster growing areas of government including medicare and medicaid and opportunities to enhance their profitability through controlling costs consumer staples 0 1 underweight 7 7 of portfolio the consumer staples sector is a common destination for the conservative equity income investor historically many of these companies have offered investors recognisable brands diverse revenue streams exposure to growing end markets and the ability to garner pricing power these characteristics in turn have translated into strong and often stable free cash flow and growing dividends for shareholders in recent years some of these secular advantages have become challenged in our view due to changing consumer preferences greater end market competition from local brands and disruption from the rapid adoption of online shopping these challenges combined with higher than historical valuations have facilitated our more neutral stance in the sector notably we prefer ownership of companies with underappreciated growth profiles i e buy growth sticky customer bases and the ability to cut costs and or improve profit margins communication services 0 9 underweight 6 0 of portfolio we are underweight to communication services and our allocation remains concentrated in diversified telecommunication bellwether verizon communications our stock specific exposure in the sector is to companies that offer healthy dividend yields and opportunity for steady longer term growth materials 1 6 underweight 2 4 of portfolio our exposure to the materials sector consists of four stocks including dow chemicals dowdupont chemicals crh building materials and international paper paper packaging longer term secular trends in global population growth can potentially benefit well positioned companies in the agricultural chemical space we believe dowdupont with scale and high quality assets is well positioned to deliver future earnings and dividend growth industrials 1 9 underweight 6 1 of portfolio our selectiveness in the industrials sector is driven by relative valuations which we view as expensive in many cases versus other cyclical segments of the u s equity market notable portfolio positions in the sector include general electric siemens and johnson controls we also continue to maintain exposure to the aerospace defence industry from a fundamental and operating model standpoint we continue to like the profiles of the large cap aerospace defence firms many of these companies have strong balance sheets good visibility into sales and earnings and historically have demonstrated shareholder friendly capital return policies furthermore the three year outlook for defence spending looks strong thanks to the recently passed 2018 2019 department of defense budget consumer discretionary 2 2 underweight 3 1 of portfolio the balance sheet for u s consumers has improved in recent years aided by a recovering domestic housing market strong jobs growth and accelerating wages these factors have also contributed to an increase in consumer confidence until recently these positive tailwinds have failed to translate into stronger retail sales for many brick and mortar stores as changing consumer preferences technological innovation and new competitors threaten traditional business models despite improved retail sales in 2018 we remain cautious within the sector given these disruptive forces our positioning in the sector reflects stock specific opportunities that in our view are 1 trading at discounted valuations or 2 somewhat insulated from these disruptive pressures for example we are positive on dollar general a u s dollar store retailer and lowe s companies a home improvement retailer utilities 3 7 underweight 2 6 of portfolio strong investor demand for equity income in recent years has resulted in elevated valuations for many high dividend yielding stocks including utilities companies despite rich valuations at the sector level we are finding pockets of opportunity in u s regulated utilities such as public service enterprise group peg nextera energy nee and firstenergy fe peg and nee add a level of stability and defensiveness to the portfolio through their durable dividend profiles and healthy earnings growth potential alternatively fe offers us exposure to a company with a good underlying regulated franchise with some near term uncertainties i e merchant business bankruptcy this uncertainty in our view creates opportunity for patient long term investors who are willing and capable of doing deep analysis on complex investment issues real estate 5 0 underweight 0 0 of portfolio the real estate sector is our largest underweight position in the company we maintain a 0 weighting in the space due to our view that valuations are unattractive at current levels furthermore the returns of real estate stocks relative to the returns of long treasury bonds are highly correlated today therefore we believe the prospects for higher interest rates in the u s are a potential headwind for the sector as well outlook and positioning we believe the current u s economic expansion can continue to move steadily forward in 2019 with low near term risk of a domestic recession our base case is for positive albeit slowing u s growth with the trajectory of corporate earnings being a key litmus test for the durability of this business cycle that said late cycle factors such as slowing growth tightening financial conditions and pressure on profit margins can make corporate earnings more difficult to forecast as we make investment decisions for the strategy we remain focused on discerning fundamental truths about companies and their future earnings power we seek attractively valued competitively advantaged companies with healthy balance sheets and the ability to protect margins take market share and or organically grow earnings our largest portfolio exposures are in the financials health care and technology sectors in recent months notable portfolio changes included increasing our allocation to financials consumer staples and consumer discretionary and reducing our exposure to the health care and utilities sectors as always the strategy invests primarily in dividend paying companies and seeks to deliver capital appreciation and current income over time tony despirito franco tapia and david zhao blackrock investment management llc 25 june 2019 ten largest investments as at 30 april

financial flexibility overall jpmorgan is a well managed quality global franchise with above average organic growth and returns relative to industry peers citigroup 3 7 2018 3 5 is a u s based money center bank with a global footprint we believe citigroup is attractively valued on both a price to earnings and book value basis has self help opportunities within its consumer banking segment and offers the potential for dividend growth wells fargo 3 7 2018 3 6 is a u s bank which operates in three segments including community banking wholesale banking and wealth investment management wells fargo has a strong deposit franchise and we are encouraged by the company s history of strong investment returns and prudent credit risk management in our view shares of the company are

offers both applications and underlying database software oracle s database and enterprise markets are sticky in terms of customer retention which we like in addition we are positive on oracle s

delivery of software and services over the internet microsoft 2 7 2018 2 5 is a global technology leader that is engaged in developing and licensing both software and hardware products services we view microsoft as an attractive long term investment given the firm s overall ecosystem which historically has resulted in pricing power and efficient free cash flow generation over time we are bullish on the stock given the firm s dominant position in business and enterprise software and the opportunity for greater client engagement and usage by shifting from on premise to a cloud distribution model i e delivery of software and services over the internet bp group 2 7 2018 2 2 is a uk based integrated oil gas company the stock screens attractively on a valuation basis and we anticipate bp s cash flow inflecting higher from a combination of new project start ups and a decline in payments related to the deepwater horizon oil spill paired together these elements should help to fund bp s dividend organically pfizer 2 4 2018 4 1 is a diversified pharmaceutical firm based in the u s in our view pfizer trades at an attractive valuation offers investors a healthy drug

personal health diagnostics and health informatics philips competes with consumer packaged goods companies in the personal health segment general electric and siemens within diagnostics and health

financial assets and financial liabilities are either carried in the statement of financial position at their fair value investments and derivatives or at an amount which is a reasonable approximation of fair value due from brokers dividends and interest receivable due to brokers accruals cash at bank and bank overdrafts ifrs 13 requires the company to classify fair value measurements using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of inputs used in making the measurements the valuation techniques used by the company are explained in the accounting policies note 2 g as set out in the company s annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 october 2018 categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset as follows the fair value hierarchy has the following levels level 1 quoted market price for identical instruments in active markets a financial instrument is regarded as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange dealer broker industry group pricing service or regulatory agency and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm s length basis the company does not adjust the quoted price for these instruments level 2 valuation techniques using observable inputs this category includes instruments valued using quoted prices for similar instruments in markets that are considered less than active or other valuation techniques where all significant inputs are directly or indirectly observable from market data valuation techniques used for non standardised financial instruments such as options currency swaps and other over the counter derivatives include the use of comparable recent arm s length transactions reference to other instruments that are substantially the same discounted cash flow analysis option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants making the maximum use of market inputs and relying as little as possible on entity specific inputs level 3 valuation techniques using significant unobservable inputs this category includes all instruments where the valuation technique includes inputs not based on observable data and these inputs could have a significant impact on the instrument s valuation this category also includes instruments that are valued based on quoted prices for similar instruments where significant entity determined adjustments or assumptions are required to reflect differences between the instruments and instruments for which there is no active market the investment manager considers observable data to be that market data that is readily available regularly distributed or updated reliable and verifiable not proprietary and provided by independent sources that are actively involved in the relevant market the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement if a fair value measurement uses observable inputs that require significant adjustment based on unobservable inputs that measurement is a level 3 measurement assessing the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgement considering factors specific to the asset or liability the determination of what constitutes observable inputs requires significant judgement by the investment manager over the counter derivative option contracts have been classified as level 2 investments as their valuation has been based on market observable inputs represented by the underlying quoted securities to which these contracts expose the company the table below sets out fair value measurements using the ifrs 13 fair value hierarchy financial assets liabilities at fair

menafn daily outlook afghanistan the us economy hasentered its 11th year of uninterrupted expansion breaking the previous recordfor the longest period of growth in american history without a recession butfar from celebrating many economists conclude from this unprecedentedperformance that a recession is now overdue if not immediately then surelybefore the 2020 presidential election fortunately for the us economy butsadly for president donald trump s opponents the idea that economic expansionshave some kind of natural lifespan and then die of old age has neitherempirical nor theoretical support history shows that usexpansions since the end of world war ii have varied in length from 12 monthsto 120 months with no sign of mean reversion moreover it can be argued thatthe 18 year period from 1982 to 2000 was really one continuous economicupswing interrupted only briefly by the spike in oil prices caused by iraq sinvasion of kuwait and there are clearerinstances of advanced economies that have avoided recessions for much longerthan the ten year record the united states has just surpassed australia is nowin its 28th year without a recession and the united kingdom experienced 17years of uninterrupted growth from 1992 to 2008 unlike the us both australiaand the uk are more recession prone because of their dependence on commodities finance and property speculation economic principlesare equally unhelpful to advocates of the overdue recession theory thenormal condition of any reasonably well managed market economy since theinvention of active demand management policies in the 1940s is to continueexpanding at around its trend rate of growth roughly 2 in the us in thepostwar period recessions have generally resulted from three causes substantial monetary or fiscal tightening in response to inflationarypressures some kind of financial crisis such as the subprime mortgagecollapse of 2008 and the technology bust of 2000 or a massive external shockthat vastly increased energy prices until one of these events occurs we canbe fairly confident that the us expansion will not just die of old age why then are somany economists now worried about a us recession and convinced that financialmarkets are underestimating the downside risks to economic growth the mainreasons are the us china trade war and a financial warning signal the inverted yield curve the first risk is obvious the second requires someexplanation an inverted yieldcurve is a relatively unusual condition that occurs when long term bond yieldsfall below short term interest rates in the us the overnight federal fundsrate is around 2 4 but ten year yields recently fell to below 2 such an inversion isoften cited as a signal of imminent recession but it shouldn t be the signal often comes years before the recession it claims to predict moreimportant bond market pricing has drastically changed in the decade since theglobal financial crisis bond yields have become increasingly divorced fromreal economic conditions partly because of quantitative easing and regulatorypressures on pension funds to buy bonds regardless of economic conditions butmainly because inflation seems to have decoupled from unemployment and growth even if thedecoupling of growth and inflation ultimately turns out to be illusory themere fact that the us federal reserve and other central banks believe that theold growth inflation linkage is broken means that they will keep interest ratesmuch lower for much longer than in previous economic cycles as long as centralbankers continue to behave like this bond yields will continue to reflectinvestors expectations about what central banks will do with short terminterest rates rather than their expectations about economic prospects orrecession risks the main message from financial markets as i argued in april is not that the us is near a recession it is simply that the fed is preparingto cut interest rates if that happens and it almost certainly will a usrecession will become less likely not more so the same is true inchina the chinese government and central bank have responded to trump s tradewar albeit somewhat belatedly by cutting interest rates and reserverequirements reducing taxes ramping up public spending and easing creditrestraints china s stimulus measures like the fed s expected easing willtake some time to feed through into economic data but these measures virtuallyguarantee that the us china trade war will cause only limited damage to growthprospects in both countries at least in the next year or two which is thetime horizon over which macroeconomic policies operate a much more seriousthreat to the world economy comes from europe an innocent bystander in theus china trade war that has already suffered far more than either of thebelligerents when the international monetary fund revised its 2019 growthprojections in april to take account of the problems that emerged in late 2018 the forecasts for china and the us were essentially unchanged despite theirtrade war up 0 1 percentage point in china down 0 2 in the us but the imfdowngraded its growth forecast for germany by 1 1 percentage points by 0 9 foritaly and by 0 6 for the eurozone as a whole europe has been themain victim of the us china trade war for the same reason it was the mainvictim of the 2008 financial crisis which also originated in the us while theus and china are stimulating their economies to counteract the trade slowdown the european authorities are as usual responding with exactly the wrongpolicies instead of easing monetary fiscal or credit policies the eurozoneresponse is pro cyclical the european commission is trying to force italy toreduce public spending and raise taxes germany s finance ministry is usinglower than expected budget surpluses as an excuse to squeeze investment anddelay tax cuts and bank supervisors are forcing banks to tighten their creditstandards increase loss provisions and cut lending to preserve capital such policiescondemned europe to spend most of the post crisis period in recession ornear recession while the us and china enjoyed a decade of uninterruptedgrowth if similarly foolish

payments can happen cheaply and easily without banks or credit card companies as has already been demonstrated not in the united states but in china unlike in the u s where numerous firms feast on fees from handling and processing payments in china most money flows through mobile phones nearly for free in 2018 these cashless payments totaled a whopping 41 5 trillion and 90 were through alipay and wechat pay a pair of digital ecosystems that blend social media commerce and banking according to a 2018 article in bloomberg titled why china s payment apps give u s bankers nightmares the nightmare for the u s financial industry is that a technology company whether from china or a homegrown juggernaut such as amazon com inc or facebook inc replicates the success of alipay and wechat in america the stakes are enormous potentially carving away billions of dollars in annual revenue from major banks and other firms that threat may now be materializing on june 18 facebook unveiled a white paper outlining ambitious plans to create a new global cryptocurrency called libra to be launched in 2020 facebook reportedly has high hopes that libra will become the foundation for a new financial system free of control by wall street power brokers and central banks but apparently libra will not be competing with visa or mastercard in fact the libra association lists those two giants among its 28 soon to be founding members others include paypal stripe uber lyft and ebay facebook has reportedly courted dozens of financial institutions and other tech companies to join the libra association an independent foundation that will contribute capital and help govern the digital currency entry barriers are high with each founding member paying a minimum of 10 million to join this gives them one vote or 1 of the total vote whichever is larger in the libra association council members are also entitled to a share proportionate to their investment of the dividends earned from interest on the libra reserve the money that users will pay to acquire the libra currency needless to say all of this has raised some eyebrows among both financial analysts and crypto activists a zero hedge commentator calls libra facebook s crypto trojan rabbit an article in the financial times alphaville calls it blockchain but without the blocks or chain economist nouriel roubini concurs tweeting it will start as a private permissioned not trustless centralized oligopolistic members only club so much for calling it blockchain like all enterprise dlt it is blockchain in name only and an monopoly to extract massive seignorage from billions of users a monopoly scam nouriel roubini nouriel june 17 2019 another zero hedge writer calls libra the dollar s killer app which threatens not only the power of central banks but also the government s money monopoly itself from frying pan to fire to the crypto anarchist community usurping the power of central banks and governments may sound like a good thing but handing global power to the corporate controlled libra association could be a greater nightmare so argues facebook co founder chris hughes who writes in the financial times this currency would insert a powerful new corporate layer of monetary control between central banks and individuals inevitably these companies will put their private interests profits and influence ahead of public ones the libra association s goals specifically say that will encourage decentralised forms of governance in other words libra will disrupt and weaken nation states by enabling people to move out of unstable local currencies and into a currency denominated in dollars and euros and managed by corporations what libra backers are calling decentralisation is in truth a shift of power from developing world central banks toward multinational corporations and the us federal reserve and the european central bank power will shift to the fed and ecb because the dollar and the euro will squeeze out weaker currencies in developing countries as seen recently in greece the result will be to cause their governments to lose control of their currencies and their economies pros and cons caitlin long co founder of the wyoming blockchain coalition recently agreed that libra was a trojan horse but predicted it would have some beneficial effects for one she thought it would impose discipline on the u s banking system by leading to populist calls to repeal its corporate subsidies the fed is now paying its member banks 2 35 in risk free interest on their excess reserves which this year is projected to total 36 billion of corporate welfare to u s banks about half the sum spent on the u s food stamp program if facebook parks its entire u s dollar balance at the federal reserve through one of its bank partners it could earn the same rate but long predicted that facebook would have to pay interest to libra users to avoid a chorus of critics who would loudly publicize how much money facebook and its partners were pocketing from the interest on the money users traded for their libra currency but that was before the libra white paper came out it reveals the profits will indeed be divvied among facebook s libra partners rather than shared with users at one time we earned interest on our deposits in government insured banks with libra we will get no interest on our money which will be entrusted to uninsured crypto exchanges which are coming under increasing regulatory pressure due to lack of transparency and operational irregularities united kingdom economics professor alistair milne points to another problem with the libra cryptocurrency unlike bitcoin it will be a stablecoin whose value will be tied to a basket of fiat currencies and short term government securities that means it will need the backing of real money to maintain its fixed price if reserves do not cover withdrawals who will be responsible for compensating libra holders ideally milne writes reserves would be held with the central bank but central banks will be reluctant to support a private currency long also predicts that facebook s cryptocurrency will be a huge honeypot of data for government officials since every transaction will be traceable but other reviewers see this as libra s most fatal flaw facebook has been called big brother the ultimate government surveillance tool conspiracy theorists link it to the cia and the u s department of defense facebook has already demonstrated that it is an untrustworthy manager of personal data how then can we trust it with our money why use a cryptocurrency at all why has facebook chosen to use a cryptocurrency rather than following wechat and alipay in doing a global payments network in the traditional way yan meng vice president of the chinese software developer network says facebook s fragmented user base across the world leaves it with no better choice than to borrow ideas from blockchain and cryptocurrency facebook just can t do a global payments network via traditional methods which require applying for a license and preparing foreign exchange reserves with local banking one market after another meng said the advantage of wechat and alipay is they have already gained a significant number of users from just one giant economy that accounts for 20 percent of the world s population they have no need to establish their own digital currencies which they still regard as too risky meng suspects that facebook s long term ambition is to become a stateless central bank that uses libra as a base currency he writes with sufficient incentives nodes of facebook s libra network would represent facebook to push for utility in various countries for its 2 7 billion users in business investment trade and financial services which would help complete a full digital economy empire the question is whether regulators will allow that sort of competition with the central banking system immediately after facebook released its libra cryptocurrency plan financial regulators in europe voiced concerns over the potential danger of facebook running a shadow bank maxine waters who heads the financial services committee for the u s house of representatives asked facebook to halt its development of libra until hearings could be held she said this is like starting a bank without having to go through any steps to do it we can t allow facebook to go to switzerland and begin to compete with the dollar without having any regulatory regime that s dealing with them a stateless private central bank or a publicly accountable one facebook may be competing with more than the dollar jennifer grygiel assistant professor of communications at syracuse university writes seems that the company is not seeking to compete with bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies rather facebook is looking to replace the existing global financial system with an all new setup with libra at its center at least at the moment the libra is being designed as a form of electronic money linked to many national currencies that has raised fears that libra might someday be recognized as a sovereign currency with facebook acting as a shadow bank that could compete with the central banks of countries around the world long thinks bitcoin rather than libra will come out the winner in all this but bitcoin s blockchain model is too slow expensive and energy intensive to replace fiat currency as a medium of exchange on a national scale as josh constine writes on techcrunch xisting cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum weren t properly engineered to scale to be a medium of exchange their unanchored price was susceptible to huge and unpredictable swings making it tough for merchants to accept as payment and cryptocurrencies miss out on much of their potential beyond speculation unless there are enough places that will take them instead of dollars but with facebook s relationship with 7 million advertisers and 90 million small businesses plus its user experience prowess it was well poised to tackle this juggernaut of a problem for libra to scale as a national medium of exchange its governance had to be centralized rather than distributed but libra s governing body is not the sort of global controller we want jennifer grygiel writes facebook ceo mark zuckerberg is declaring that he wants facebook to become a virtual nation populated by users powered by a self contained economy and headed by a ceo zuckerberg himself who is not even accountable to his shareholders in many ways the company that mark zuckerberg is building is beginning to look more like a roman empire now with its own central bank and currency than a corporation the only problem is that this new nation like platform is a controlled company and is run more like a dictatorship than a sovereign country with democratically elected leaders a currency intended for trade on a national let alone international scale needs to be not only centralized but democratized responding to the will of the people and their elected leaders rather than bypassing the existing central banking structure as facebook plans to do several groups of economists are proposing a more egalitarian solution nationalizing and democratizing the central bank by opening its deposit window to everyone as explored in my latest book banking on the people democratizing money in the digital age these proposals could allow us all to get 2 35 on our deposits while eliminating bank runs and banking crises since the central bank cannot run out of funds profits from the public medium of exchange need to return to the public rather than enriching an unaccountable corporate controlled facebook trojan horse

the us economy has entered its 11th year of uninterrupted expansion breaking the previous record for the longest period of growth in american history without a recession but far from celebrating many economists conclude from this unprecedented performance that a recession is now overdue if not immediately then surely before the 2020 presidential election fortunately for the us economy but sadly for president donald trump s opponents the idea that economic expansions have some kind of natural lifespan and then die of old age has neither empirical nor theoretical support history shows that us expansions since the end of world war ii have varied in length from 12 months to 120 months with no sign of mean reversion moreover it can be argued that the 18 year period from 1982 to 2000 was really one continuous economic upswing interrupted only briefly by the spike in oil prices caused by iraq s invasion of kuwait and there are clearer instances of advanced economies that have avoided recessions for much longer than the ten year record the united states has just surpassed australia is now in its 28th year without a recession and the united kingdom experienced 17 years of uninterrupted growth from 1992 to 2008 unlike the us both australia and the uk are more recession prone because of their dependence on commodities finance and property speculation economic principles are equally unhelpful to advocates of the overdue recession theory the normal condition of any reasonably well managed market economy since the invention of active demand management policies in the 1940s is to continue expanding at around its trend rate of growth roughly 2 in the us in the postwar period recessions have generally resulted from three causes substantial monetary or fiscal tightening in response to inflationary pressures some kind of financial crisis such as the subprime mortgage collapse of 2008 and the technology bust of 2000 or a massive external shock that vastly increased energy prices until one of these events occurs we can be fairly confident that the us expansion will not just die of old age why then are so many economists now worried about a us recession and convinced that financial markets are underestimating the downside risks to economic growth the main reasons are the us china trade war and a financial warning signal the inverted yield curve the first risk is obvious the second requires some explanation an inverted yield curve is a relatively unusual condition that occurs when long term bond yields fall below short term interest rates in the us the overnight federal funds rate is around 2 4 but ten year yields recently fell to below 2 such an inversion is often cited as a signal of imminent recession but it shouldn t be the signal often comes years before the recession it claims to predict more important bond market pricing has drastically changed in the decade since the global financial crisis bond yields have become increasingly divorced from real economic conditions partly because of quantitative easing and regulatory pressures on pension funds to buy bonds regardless of economic conditions but mainly because inflation seems to have decoupled from unemployment and growth even if the decoupling of growth and inflation ultimately turns out to be illusory the mere fact that the us federal reserve and other central banks believe that the old growth inflation linkage is broken means that they will keep interest rates much lower for much longer than in previous economic cycles as long as central bankers continue to behave like this bond yields will continue to reflect investors expectations about what central banks will do with short term interest rates rather than their expectations about economic prospects or recession risks the main message from financial markets as i argued in april is not that the us is near a recession it is simply that the fed is preparing to cut interest rates if that happens and it almost certainly will a us recession will become less likely not more so the same is true in china the chinese government and central bank have responded to trump s trade war albeit somewhat belatedly by cutting interest rates and reserve requirements reducing taxes ramping up public spending and easing credit restraints china s stimulus measures like the fed s expected easing will take some time to feed through into economic data but these measures virtually guarantee that the us china trade war will cause only limited damage to growth prospects in both countries at least in the next year or two which is the time horizon over which macroeconomic policies operate a much more serious threat to the world economy comes from europe an innocent bystander in the us china trade war that has already suffered far more than either of the belligerents when the international monetary fund revised its 2019 growth projections in april to take account of the problems that emerged in late 2018 the forecasts for china and the us were essentially unchanged despite their trade war up 0 1 percentage point in china down 0 2 in the us but the imf downgraded its growth forecast for germany by 1 1 percentage points by 0 9 for italy and by 0 6 for the eurozone as a whole europe has been the main victim of the us china trade war for the same reason it was the main victim of the 2008 financial crisis which also originated in the us while the us and china are stimulating their economies to counteract the trade slowdown the european authorities are as usual responding with exactly the wrong policies instead of easing monetary fiscal or credit policies the eurozone response is pro cyclical the european commission is trying to force italy to reduce public spending and raise taxes germany s finance ministry is using lower than expected budget surpluses as an excuse to squeeze investment and delay tax cuts and bank supervisors are forcing banks to tighten their credit standards increase loss provisions and cut lending to preserve capital such policies condemned europe to spend most of the post crisis period in recession or near recession while the us and china enjoyed a decade of uninterrupted growth if similarly foolish policies are maintained the same thing will happen again
what does facebookâ s libra new crytocurrency really offer the dark days of 2009 now seem like forever ago we didn t know which banks would survive the fed made all banks take bailout money so that citizens wouldn t know which ones were in trouble and then drain them of deposits the fed made bank stocks ineligible for shorting so that investors wouldn t drive their market caps to zero we worried that fiat currencies those printed by governments and backed by nothing would go to zero against that backdrop bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies entered the public realm and for the next eight or nine years they gained credibility and traction cryptos were going to do everything replace the dollar end all fiat currencies replace gold put transaction companies out of business make moving money immediate and seamless with such incredible promise cryptos eventually boomed in 2018 then imploded two things drove their downfall cryptos delivered on exactly zero of their promises and we came to understand that traditional currencies are still here and will be here as long as governments exist with that as background there aren t many reasons for facebook to enter the space with its new cryptocurrency libra except one avoiding banks the new currency unveiled today though it won t be put into use until sometime next year will be a stable coin meaning all units will be backed by something of value facebook says the coins will be backed by a basket of currencies held in a trust account for every unit you buy you ll essentially own a unit of yen euro u s dollar british pound or chinese yuan for example this isn t a reason to buy libra if your home currency appreciates against others in the world like the u s dollar getting stronger against the euro then your libra will go down in value against your home currency if everything or almost everything you do financially is in one country and that country has a stable well functioning banking system then libra doesn t make much sense use your debit card to buy stuff and use venmo to send money to friends and family but if you live in a place where banking is questionable the home currency is volatile or you commonly send funds across borders then libra makes a lot of sense by exchanging your local currency for libra you can immediately hold a basket of stable large currencies you can buy things online and avoid your local banks and you can send money to anyone in the world with no slippage workers in qatar can send funds home to the philippines immigrants in the u s can send money home without paying western union farming co op members in senegal can pool resources and buy seed and equipment from foreign suppliers in may 2019 facebook had 2 38 billion active monthly users with less than 600 million in north america and europe giving the other 1 7 billion users in other parts of the world access to stable currency that can be transferred instantly with no slippage could be life changing but don t call it a cryptocurrency libra doesn t supplant national fiat currencies by definition every unit will be backed by national currencies instead libra displaces banks particularly those that deal in cross border transactions and those in less reputable parts of the world and the currency will generate a profit for facebook and its partners companies like visa and uber each partner organization will kick in 10 million to create the original pot of units and will operate one of the nodes that verify and approve transactions in return they will get their respective cut of interest earned on the pot of cash that is held in trust to back the currency as well as their share of transaction fees generated but there s a question how will governments react libra transactions are supposed to be anonymous not connected to any data that links back to your actual identity if the digital currency supplants banking in developing nations it will rob those systems of deposits which reduces money supply and will also allow consumers to move money out of the country without government approval as libra takes hold it could cause incredible disruptions and it will strengthen the u s dollar ever so slightly and as it grows it will require the trust account to grow too buying ever larger quantities of the currencies that make up the basket there is no question the u s dollar will be a part it s only a matter of how much those purchases must be made no matter what the currency trading environment looks like or the level of interest rates or anything else granted in the currency world this will be less than a drop in the bucket more like a grain of sand on a beach but in times of trouble if people are flocking to libra they will be piling into the u s dollar and the other currencies in the basket it s likely that libra will take off when facebook launches it next year gathering tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars because it s novel and gives people who ve avoided cryptocurrencies a chance to feel like they re in the group for most people it simply will be a novelty one more way to pay for stuff or transfer money which will eventually lose its appeal but for those who live in countries with questionable banks and shaky currencies it could be a godsend if their governments don t shut it down rodney johnson follow me on twitter rjhsdent by rodney johnson

by stephen s roach new haven blinded by a surging stock market and a 50 year low in the unemployment rate few dare to challenge the wisdom of us economic policy instant gratification has compromised the rigour of objective and disciplined analysis big mistake the toxic combination of ill timed fiscal stimulus aggressive imposition of tariffs and unprecedented attacks on the federal reserve demands a far more critical assessment of trumponomics politicians and pundits can always be counted on to spin the policy debate for us president donald trump and his supporters the art of the spin has been taken to a new level apparently it does not matter that federal deficits have been enlarged by an estimated 1 5 trillion over the next decade or that government debt will reach a post world war ii record of 92 per cent of gdp by 2029 the tax cuts driving these worrying trends are rationalised as what it takes to make america great again nor are tariffs viewed as taxes on consumers or impediments to global supply chain efficiencies instead they are portrayed as weaponised negotiating levers to force trading partners to change their treatment of the united states and attacks on the fed s independence are seen not as threats to the central bank s dual mandate to maximise employment and ensure price stability but rather as the president s exercise of his prerogative to use the bully pulpit as he and he alone sees fit there are three basic flaws with trump s approach to economic policy first there is the disconnect between intent and impact the political spin maintains that large corporate tax cuts boost us competitiveness but that does not mean deficits and debt do not matter notwithstanding the hollow promises of supply side economics revenue neutral fiscal initiatives that shifted the tax burden from one segment of the economy to another would have come much closer to real reform than the reduction of the overall revenue trajectory has moreover the enactment of fiscal stimulus in late 2017 when the unemployment rate was then at a cyclical low of 4 1 per cent headed towards the current 3 6 per cent added froth to markets and the economy when it was least needed and foreclosed the option of additional stimulus should growth falter similarly trump s tariffs fly in the face of one of the 20th century s greatest policy blunders the smoot hawley tariff of 1930 which sparked a 60 per cent plunge in global trade by 1932 with foreign trade currently accounting for 28 per cent of gdp versus 11 per cent in 1929 the us as a debtor country today is far more vulnerable to trade related disruptions than it was as a net creditor back then ignoring the cascading stream of direct and retaliatory taxes on consumers and businesses that stem from a tariff war trump extols the virtues of tariffs as a beautiful thing that is painfully reminiscent of the 1928 republican party platform which couched tariffs as a fundamental and essential principle of the economic life of this nation and essential for the continued prosperity of the country trump ignores the lessons of the 1930s at great peril the same can be said of trump s recent fed bashing the political independence of central banking is widely regarded as the singular breakthrough needed to achieve price stability following the great inflation of the 1970s in the us passage of the so called humphrey hawkins act of 1978 gave then fed chairman paul volcker the political cover to squeeze double digit inflation out of the system through a wrenching monetary tightening had volcker lacked the freedom to act he would have been constrained by elected leaders political calculus precisely what trump is doing in trying to dictate policy to current fed chair jerome powell the second critical flaw in trump s economic policy package is its failure to appreciate the links between budget deficits tariffs and monetary policy as the late martin feldstein long stressed to the extent that budget deficits put downward pressure on already depressed domestic saving larger trade deficits become the means to fill the void with surplus foreign saving denial of these linkages conveniently allows the us to blame china for self inflicted trade deficits but with tariffs likely to divert trade and supply chains from low cost chinese producers to higher cost alternatives us consumers will be hit with the functional equivalent of tax hikes raising the risk of higher inflation the latter possibility though seemingly remote today could have important consequences for us monetary policy provided of course the fed has the political independence to act finally there are always the lags to keep in mind in assessing the impact of policy while low interest rates temper short term pressures on debt service costs as budget deficits rise there is no guarantee that such a trend will persist over the longer term especially with the already elevated federal debt overhang projected to increase by about 14 percentage points of gdp over the next 10 years similarly the disruptive effects of tariffs and shifts in monetary policy take about 12 18 months to be fully evident so rather than bask in today s financial market euphoria politicians and investors should be thinking more about the state of the economy in late 2020 a timeframe that happens to coincide with the upcoming presidential election cycle in assessing how current policies are likely to play out there is nothing remarkable about a us president s penchant for political spin what is glaringly different this time is the lack of any pushback from those who know better the national economic council nec established in the early 1990s as an honest broker in the executive branch to convene and coordinate debate on key policy issues is now basically dysfunctional the nec s current head larry kudlow a long standing advocate of free trade is squirming to defend trump s tariffs and fed bashing the republican party long a champion of trade liberalisation is equally complicit trump s vindictive bluster has steamrolled economic policy deliberations ignoring the lessons of history rejecting the analytics of modern economics and undermining the institutional integrity of the policymaking process policy blunders of epic proportion have become the rule not the exception it will not be nearly as easy to spin the looming consequences stephen s roach former chairman of morgan stanley asia and the firm s chief economist is a senior fellow at yale university s jackson institute of global affairs

winning the war against corruption how can the anti corruption war be won it is by involving the masses who are the direct victims of official malfeasance in the crusade reports associate editor adekunle yusuf it was a conference cum dialogue unlike the usual practice of bringing in experts to talk to the audience participants at the two day conference on effects of corruption also doubled as resource persons all participants left with a vow to shun discourage and resist corruption in whatever guise the dialogue aimed at strengthening citizens resistance against corruption was organised by actionaid nigeria a humanitarian organisation working to achieve social justice gender equality and poverty eradication to set the ball rolling adewale adeduntan social mobilisation manager at actionaid nigeria asked participants mostly women and young people to explain how corruption affects them in their individual lives the conference which featured many break out sessions saw journalists from the print and electronic media women and young people sharing experiences on how corruption affects them in their private and professional capacities adeduntan said the essence of embracing the bottom up approach during the event is to let women children and other young people who are the real victims of corruption to share their perspectives on what corruption means and how best it can be tackled with corruption prevalent in the society including the private sector he stressed that it will continue to inflict monumental disaster on the country s development aspirations until the victims resolve to say enough is enough that was the theme that ran through the proceedings and break out sessions with participants agreeing that the war against corruption should not be left to the government and its agencies alone in her welcome address ene obi country director actionaid nigeria said it was important nigerians are empowered to fight corruption because it distorts competition reduces investments slows development widens economic and social inequalities and heightens injustice discontent exclusion and polarisation corruption she stressed has caused more deaths than hiv aids and malaria combined adding that it is a global scourge that has disproportionately affected us as a country with many communities littered with abandoned or non existing projects that would have improved the lives of the people obi described corruption as our common enemy because every nigerian is affected by its consequences corruption seems to have caused more deaths than hiv aids and malaria it has stolen the future of children both present and expected it has ruined our educational system destroyed our healthcare facilities increased the inequality gap exacerbated the level of insecurity and conflicts pushed back foreign direct investment opportunities and weakened the capacity of successive governments to provide basic amenities of life for citizens you may ask why it is important to empower the nigerian citizen to effectively fight corruption you may be wondering why the burden of eradicating corruption is not mounted on the government and our public officials you may even and rightly too say the government should bear the burden because corruption began with the government institutions and the government is better positioned to end it you must also think and ask yourself what you have done about corruption in your community or where you live or work obi said the answers the actionaid boss said were in the social cost of corruption and the mass unemployment and pervasive poverty it has engendered in the country while acknowledging that it is true governments have attempted to curb corruption by setting up anti graft agencies she said such efforts seemed to be insufficient to curtail the evil and its effects on the people for us in actionaid nigeria we believe that a government that can manage its resources effectively can eradicate poverty or reduce it to the barest minimum actionaid nigeria has implemented projects in several states of the federation and the federal capital territory fct we have seen the reality of poverty at the different levels including rural and urban communities and without any doubt corruption being one of the major causes of these deprivations when dealt with decisively will liberate many nigerians from the strongholds of poverty social infrastructure is the right of citizens we must demand for it when it is not given we need to build the capacity of citizens with the critical mindset to ask the right questions from our political leaders as we use human rights based approach to development we must decentralise and localise issues about corruption down to the household levels and also interpret the messages for people to understand people need to connect the state of the road non existing infrastructure to acts of corruption that way they can courageously stand up and make demands citizens must be dogged and determined to ask the right questions and political institutions must be answerable to the people because it is only in this balanced format we can collectively address our common enemy called corruption she said read also govt urged to tackle corruption across board a participant femi falana san noted that no nation can successfully fight corruption outside its political economy adding that the root of corruption in nigeria can be found in the neo liberal policies being religiously pursued by successive administrations specifically he fingered the progressive withdrawal of subsidies from social services which he said is a key component of the imf world bank sponsored structural adjustment programme sap as the biggest driver of the mass poverty that is enveloping the country the privatisation of public enterprises commercialisation of social services mass retrenchment of workers devaluation of the naira unrestrained capital flight repatriation of profits by foreign companies and hijacking of the rule of law by the ruling elite he maintained have all combined to worsen the crisis of poverty and inequality in the country while admitting that corruption is a resilient disease that is prevalent even in advanced capitalist countries where institutional mechanisms for fighting it are strong falana said the effects of corruption were more pernicious in nigeria with weak institutional infrastructure such as bad leadership weak judiciary frail legislature anaemic police system and compromised anti corruption agencies as a result the poor and vulnerable segments of the society continue to suffer as they rely very heavily on government for the provision of social and essential services which has failed to provide the most basic needs of the people the point i am labouring to make is that a neo colonial state cannot meaningfully fight corruption because it is administered on the basis of corruption executive lawlessness brigandage and violence anti graft agencies are essentially set up to impress the international community in order to attract direct foreign investments while the impression is given that corruption is being fought the anti graft agencies are deliberately underfunded and controlled by the executive to render them ineffective the example of kenya and nigeria has shown that anti corruption officials who fail to cover up the corrupt activities of a rogue regime and its friends may end up in a shallow grave or exile falana said however despite the enactment of laws and creation of anti graft agencies falana lamented that it is common knowledge that corruption is on the increase in the country due to the poverty induced programmes of the government this he insisted is bound to be so since the government is zealously committed to the implementation of neo liberal policies he criticised central bank of nigeria cbn governor godwin emefiele for failing to defend the naira falana aligned with henry boyo an economist who said recently that cbn has failed to achieve its prime mandate of price stability leaving inflation rate to be beyond 10 per cent for years said falana but how can the governor defend the naira when he is busy supervising the auctioning of small rations of the united states dollars on a weekly basis in a market that is said to be flushed with surplus naira liquidity since the cbn lacks the power to remove any money from the federation account without appropriation it is submitted that the weekly withdrawal of hundreds of millions of dollars from the nation s foreign reserves by the cbn to fund the importation of all manners of goods from foreign countries is illegal and unconstitutional to arrest further manipulation of the foreign exchange market and the skyrocketing inflation rate he urged the national assembly to as a matter of urgent national importance conduct a public hearing on the management of the economy by the executive citing constitutional provisions to buttress his point he said the rights of nigerians to socio economic development were justiciable adding that governments at all levels are under obligation to ensure national resources are harnessed to promote collective prosperity maximum welfare and happiness of the people on the basis of social justice and equal opportunity besides ensuring that the country s resources are used to serve the common good the activist said section 16 2 d of the 1999 constitution as amended compels government to provide suitable and adequate shelter suitable and adequate food old age care and pension sick benefits for all citizens as well as the welfare of the disabled he however insisted that the rights despite being guaranteed by the constitution cannot be actualised unless the government abolishes corrupt practices and abuse of power but since successive governments have failed to promote the welfare of the people about 100 million citizens have become extremely poor president muhammadu buhari has promised to rescue the 100 million people from the labyrinth of poverty in 10 years with respect that is a tall order as the implementation of neo liberal policies of the federal government will continue to promote poverty among the generality of nigerians he said falana urged president buhari to heed the advice of his rwanda counterpart paul kagame who at the democracy day anti corruption summit on june 11 urged his fellow african leaders to fight corruption from the top to bottom the rwandan leader submitted that the anti graft war should be guided by four key principles of culture responsibility accountability and effectiveness falana advised nigeria to take up kagame s challenge by creating wealth not merely fighting corruption this is a fight that can be won tolerating corruption is a choice not an inevitability it is within our power to end it that is the most important starting point otherwise it will be a waste of time to keep talking about it corruption does not take decades to eradicate once we decide to break the habit we have to set our sights high it is not enough to fight corruption by just merely fighting poverty it is too small an ambition for africa we want to create value we want to create wealth not merely fighting corruption falana quoted kagame to have said the activist urged the government to also fight impunity instead of celebrating the war against corruption according to falana the regular breach of the provisions of the appropriation act will be reduced if the execution of the budget is closely monitored by the people let the buhari administration demonstrate its commitment to the prosecution of the war against corruption by complying with the provisions of the public procurement act 2007 even though the bureau of public procurement and the national council on public procurement are charged by the law with the sole responsibility to award federal government contracts the federal executive council fec has usurped the powers of both bodies by approving the award of contracts in their weekly meetings the illegality which started in 2007 has continued unabated on account of such illegality not less than three corruption cases filed by the economic and financial crimes commission efcc have been dismissed by courts on the grounds that the contracts involved were illegally awarded by fec to avoid the loss of more corruption cases president buhari is called upon to constitute the national council on public procurement without any further delay he said he lamented the secrecy surrounding assets declaration by public office holders a few days ago the code of conduct bureau ccb turned down the request made by the socio economic rights and accountability project serap for the release of copies of the declaration forms of former state and presidents on the grounds that the declaration forms are private documents with respect it is illogical to claim that the asset declaration forms submitted by the erstwhile public officers are private documents accordingly the rejection of the request by serap is a contravention of section 1 of the freedom of information act 2011 and article 9 of the african charter on human and peoples rights however it is hoped that the ccb will review its position and allow citizens to access the information in the declaration forms submitted to it by all public officers in view of the new policy of the buhari administration to enforce effective assets declaration by public office holders he said urging civil society groups to link the fight against corruption to the struggle for participatory democracy economic independence and social justice falana said since the law was too weak to curb official corruption civil society groups should mobilise professional bodies and faith based organisations to censor their members who engage in corrupt acts with a view to bringing them into disrepute said he while the anti graft agencies are encouraged and supported in the prosecution of a few corrupt elements in the society civil society groups should demand full compliance with the provisions of the appropriation act public procurement act money laundering act and freedom of information act while the campaign for the enactment of other anti corruption laws should be intensified in order to enhance the fight against corruption at all levels states should be encouraged to adopt these legislations

against the backdrop of heightened uncertainties the baseline outlook of my fomc colleagues like that of many other forecasters remains favourable with unemployment remaining near historic lows inflation is expected to return to 2 per cent over time but at a somewhat slower pace than we foresaw earlier in the year however the risks to this favorable baseline outlook appear to have grown mr powell also said while many policymakers judge that the case for somewhat more accommodative policy has strengthened but we are also mindful that monetary policy should not overreact to any individual data point or short term swing in sentiment doing so would risk adding even more uncertainty to the outlook markets have been pricing in a reduction of nearly 50 basis points in july st louis fed president james bullard said a cut of that magnitude seemed unwarranted advertisement rbc capital markets tom porcelli said it s clear to him that rate cuts are not a lock powell was careful to note that trade on its own is not the real worry but how that impacts sentiment and or financial conditions and here he was quite clear that the committee needs to see a sustained weakness in fcis as a signal that risks to the outlook have increased as we showed recently past fed pivots have come with material downturns in financial conditions mid 2015 early 2016 and late 2018 most recently at present financial conditions are very much in accommodative territory so unless the g 20 goes sideways and that june payroll report is significantly weak it is hard to make a case for fed cuts today s

often referred to as our independence powell said in a speech he delivered at the council on foreign relations in new york congress chose to insulate the fed this way because it had seen the damage

citizens wouldn t know which ones were in trouble and then drain them of deposits the fed made bank stocks ineligible for shorting so that investors wouldn t drive their market caps to zero we worried that fiat currencies those printed by governments and backed by nothing would go to zero against that backdrop bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies entered the public realm and for the next eight or nine years they gained credibility and traction cryptos were going to do everything replace the dollar end all fiat currencies replace gold put transaction companies out of business make moving money immediate and seamless with such incredible promise cryptos eventually boomed in 2018 then imploded two things drove their downfall cryptos delivered on exactly zero of their promises and we came to understand that traditional currencies are still here and will be here as long as governments exist with that as background there aren t many reasons for facebook to enter the space with its new cryptocurrency libra except one avoiding banks the new currency unveiled today though it won t be put into use until sometime next year will be a stable coin meaning all units will be backed by something of value facebook says the coins will be backed by a basket of currencies held in a trust account for every unit you buy you ll essentially own a unit of yen euro u s dollar british pound or chinese yuan for example this isn t a reason to buy libra if your home currency appreciates against others in the world like the u s dollar getting stronger against the euro then your libra will go down in value against your home currency if everything or almost everything you do financially is in one country and that country has a stable well functioning banking system then libra doesn t make much sense use your debit card to buy stuff and use venmo to send money to friends and family but if you live in a place where banking is questionable the home currency is volatile or you commonly send funds across borders then libra makes a lot of sense by exchanging your local currency for libra you can immediately hold a basket of stable large currencies you can buy things online and avoid your local banks and you can send money to anyone in the world with no slippage workers in qatar can send funds home to the philippines immigrants in the u s can send money home without paying western union farming co op members in senegal can pool resources and buy seed and equipment from foreign suppliers in may 2019 facebook had 2 38 billion active monthly users with less than 600 million in north america and europe giving the other 1 7 billion users in other parts of the world access to stable currency that can be transferred instantly with no slippage could be life changing but don t call it a cryptocurrency libra doesn t supplant national fiat currencies by definition every unit will be backed by national currencies instead libra displaces banks particularly those that deal in cross border transactions and those in less reputable parts of the world and the currency will generate a profit for facebook and its partners companies like visa and uber each partner organization will kick in 10 million to create the original pot of units and will operate one of the nodes that verify and approve transactions in return they will get their respective cut of interest earned on the pot of cash that is held in trust to back the currency as well as their share of transaction fees generated but there s a question how will governments react libra transactions are supposed to be anonymous not connected to any data that links back to your actual identity if the digital currency supplants banking in developing nations it will rob those systems of deposits which reduces money supply and will also allow consumers to move money out of the country without government approval as libra takes hold it could cause incredible disruptions and it will strengthen the u s dollar ever so slightly and as it grows it will require the trust account to grow too buying ever larger quantities of the currencies that make up the basket there is no question the u s dollar will be a part it s only a matter of how much those purchases must be made no matter what the currency trading environment looks like or the level of interest rates or anything else granted in the currency world this will be less than a drop in the bucket more like a grain of sand on a beach but in times of trouble if people are flocking to libra they will be piling into the u s dollar and the other currencies in the basket it s likely that libra will take off when facebook launches it next year gathering tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars because it s novel and gives people who ve avoided cryptocurrencies a chance to feel like they re in the group for most people it simply will be a novelty one more way to pay for stuff or transfer money which will eventually lose its appeal but for those who live in countries with questionable banks and shaky currencies it could be a godsend if their governments don t shut it down rodney johnson follow me on twitter rjhsdent by rodney johnson

in all though it was a lacklustre day again for the asx200 yesterday in a week characterized thus far by range trading a retracement in financials stocks dragged on asx200 as the bank s retraced some of monday s gains the bearish overnight lead will manifest in the asx200 today spi futures are suggesting a 32 point dip this morning 5 rbnz highlights asian trade the reserve bank of new zealand s meeting will be the highlight of the asian economic calendar today in line with the chorus of central bankers across the globe the rbnz are expected to progressively ease monetary policy in the near term in response to what is a sluggish inflation outlook slower jobs growth as well as a forecast slowdown in the global economy markets are betting that the chances of a rate cut from the rbnz today sits at a relatively modest 20 per cent with the next rate reduction from the central bank fully implied by september at the latest 6 rbnz kiwi rates and the nzd but like many central banks the world over an rbnz rate cut is considered a matter of if not when and given the implied likelihood of a rate cut today trader interest in the event may well be directed towards deciphering what the rbnz board s language says about when that move may happen to be it s here where volatility in the new zealand dollar may arise bets are heavily skewed towards a rate cut in august it s considered a roughly 75 per cent chance a more hawkish than expected rbnz could lead to some unwinding of this positioning and consequently a pop in the kiwi dollar 7 what the rbnz means for australian markets it must be said that s a low probability high risk and high reward scenario out of today s rbnz meeting anything but a dovish title from any central banker in this current market environment would be a surprise the tides carrying the global economy towards lower interest rates appear too irresistible and of course this dynamic is as pertinent in australia as anywhere else true to history too as it relates to australia s financial markets the rbnz will likely act as a little bellwether for market participants for next week s rba meeting with action in the aud and australian interest rate markets likely to mirror their new zealand counterparts today 8 market watch asx futures down 35 points or 0 5 to 6559 near 7 15am aest aud flat at 69 60 us cents on wall st dow 0 7 s p 500 1 nasdaq 1 5 in new york bhp 0 5 rio 0 1 atlassian 3 7 in europe stoxx 50 0 3 ftse 0 1 cac 0 1 dax 0 4 spot gold 0 3 to us1423 44 an ounce near 2 40pm new york time brent crude 0 3 to us65 05 a barrel us oil 0 1 to us57 84 a barrel iron ore 2 to us114 46 a tonne dalian iron ore 1 7 to 792 yuan lme aluminium 1 2 to us1814 a tonne lme copper 1 4 to us6042 a tonne 2 year yield us 1 73 australia 0 90 5 year yield us 1 72 australia 0 94 10 year yield us 1 98 australia 1 28 germany 0 33 10 year us australia yield gap near 7 15am aest 70 basis points this column was produced in commercial partnership between the sydney morning herald the age and ig
