may 2 2019 alasdair macleod behind the huawei story we must not forget there is a wider financial war being waged by america against china and russia stories about china s banks being short of dollars are incorrect the shortage is of inward capital flows to support the us government s budget deficit by attracting those global portfolio flows instead china s belt and road initiative threatens us government finances so the financial war and associated disinformation can be expected to escalate hong kong is likely to be in the firing line due to its role in providing china with access to international finance introduction huawei is hitting the headlines from ordering the arrest of its chief financial officer in vancouver last december to the latest efforts to dissuade its allies from adopting huawei s 5g mobile technology it has been a classic deep state operation by the americans admittedly the chinese have left themselves open to attack by introducing a loosely drafted cybersecurity law in 2016 17 which according to western defence circles appears to require all chinese technology companies to cooperate with chinese intelligence services consequently no one now knows whether to trust huawei who have some of the leading technology for 5g the problem for network operators is who to believe intelligence services are in the business of dissembling which they do through political puppets all of which are professionals at being economical with the truth who can forget weapons of mass destruction more recently there was the skripal poisoning mystery the russians would have been bang to rights if it wasn t for skripal s links through pablo miller to christopher steele who put together the dodgy dossier on trump s alleged behaviour in a russian hotel the safest course is to never believe anything emanating from a government security agency which does not help hapless network operators they and the rest of us should look at motives the attack on huawei is motivated by a desire to impede china s technological progress which is already eclipsing that of america and america is using her leadership of the 5 eyes intelligence group of nations to impose her geostrategic will on her allies the row in britain this week escalated from a cabinet level security breech on this subject to american threats of withholding intelligence from the uk if uk companies are permitted to order huawei 5g equipment to the sacking of the minister of defence a threat to withhold intelligence sharing if carried out only serves to isolate the americans but you can see how desperate the americans are to eliminate huawei furthermore the huawei controversy is part of a wider conflict with america determined to stop the chinese changing the world s power structure moving it from under america s control when china was just a cheap manufacturing centre for low tech goods that was one thing but when china started developing advanced technologies and began to dominate global trade that was another china must be put back in its box so far all attempts to do so appear to have failed control of afghanistan seen as an important source of minerals ready to be exploited by china has been a costly failure for the west attempts to wrest control of syria from russia s sphere of influence also failed russia is china s economic and military ally america failed to bring russia to her knees so now the focus is directly on destroying or at least containing china china has already outspent america in africa central and south america buying influence away from america in her traditional spheres of influence attempts to neutralise north korea are coming unstuck in truth there is an undeclared war between china and russia on one side and america and her often reluctant allies on the other it will now escalate mainly because america increasingly needs global portfolio flows to cover her deficits america s financial war strategy behind the cyber war there is a financial war in the financial war america has the advantage of its currency hegemony which it exercises to the full it has allowed americans to have lived beyond their means by importing more goods than they export and the government spends more than it receives in taxes in order to achieve these benefits inward capital flows are necessary to finance them to date these have totalled in current value terms some 25 trillion being total foreign ownership of dollar assets and deposits america s policy of living beyond its means now requires more than just recycled trade flows inward portfolio flows are required as well global portfolios comprised of commercial cash balances as well as investment money periodically increase their exposure to other regions potentially leaving america short the problem is resolved by destabilising the region that has most recently benefited from capital investment to encourage money to return to dollars and thus america s domestic markets now that she is due to escalate infrastructure spending both in china and along the new silk roads it is china s turn this will be the opinion of qiao liang who was a major general in the pla and one of its chief strategists it was his explanation for the south east asian crisis of 1997 when a run started on the thai baht and spread to all neighbouring countries in the decade prior to the crisis the region saw substantial inward capital flows so much so that countries such as malaysia the philippines and indonesia ran significant deficits on their balance of payments this conflicted with the us s trade balance which was beginning to deteriorate the solution was the collapse of the south east asia investment story which stimulated the re allocation of investment resources in favour of the dollar and america qiao liang cites a number of other examples from the latin american crisis in the early 1980s to ukraine whose yellow revolution reversed investment flows into central europe this did not go to plan with over a trillion dollars worth of investment coming out of europe most being redirected to the chinese economy which was the most attractive destination at that time through the new shanghai shenzhen hong kong stock connect in april 2014 china facilitated inward investment and the ability for foreign investors to realise profits without going through exchange controls being the gateway for foreign investors our story now moves to hong kong according to chinese and russian intelligence sources america tried to destabilise it with covert support for the occupy hong kong movement between september and december 2014 the fed ended its qe that october and international capital was needed back in the us the americans had also escalated the row over the spratly islands and scarborough shoal at the beginning of that year which effectively halted free trade negotiations between china japan south korea macau taiwan and hong kong the chinese hoped this potential free trade area could be expanded to include the asean fta which would then have been the largest in the world by gdp and an area in which they could develop the renminbi as the reserve currency these plans were effectively scuppered but china was not provoked into a public response by these actions instead they started reducing their us treasury holdings in their dollar reserves from 1 27 trillion to 1 06 trillion in 2016 not a great fall but demonstrating they were not recycling their trade surpluses into dollars all that happened at a time when both the american and global economies were expanding admittedly at muted rates trump s trade protectionism has changed that and early indications are that the us economy is now stalling tax revenues are falling short while government expenditures are rising america now urgently needs more inward capital flows to finance the growing budget deficit if qiao liang were to comment doubtless his conclusion would be that america will increase its attack on china to precipitate disinvestment and reallocation to the dollar and so the attacks have begun first by trying to break huawei now the mainstream media perhaps with off the record briefings are claiming china and hong kong are facing difficulties last week the wall street journal published an article claiming china s banks are running out of dollars clearly this is untrue china s banks can acquire dollars any time they want either by selling other foreign currencies in the market or by selling renminbi to the people s bank they have their dollar position because they choose to have it and furthermore all commercial banks use derivatives which are effectively off balance sheet exposure furthermore with the us running a substantial trade deficit with china dollars are flooding in all the time following the wsj article various other commentators have come up with similar stories how convenient it seems for the us government to see these bearish stories about china just when they need to ramp up inward portfolio flows to finance the budget deficit there is anyway a general antipathy among american investors to the china story so we should not be surprised to see the china bears restating their case one leading china bear at least by reputation for his investment shrewdness is kyle bass of hayman capital management according to zero hedge he has written his first investment letter in three years saying of hong kong today newly emergent economic and political risks threaten hong kong s decades of stability these risks are so large they merit immediate attention on both fronts if only it were so simple it is time to put the alternative case hong kong is important because china uses hong kong and london to avoid being dependent on the us banking system for international finances and that s why the us s deep state want to nail hong kong lop sided analysis bass is correct in pointing out the hong kong property market appears highly geared and that property prices for office residential and retail sectors have rocketed since the 2003 trough to a large extent it has been the inevitable consequence of the currency board link to the us dollar which broadly transfers the fed s inflationary monetary policy to hong kong s more dynamic economy bass s description of the relationship between the banks the way they finance themselves and property collateral is reminiscent of the factors that led to the secondary banking crisis in the uk in late 1973 empirical evidence appears to be firmly on bass s side except that is for a significant difference between events such as the uk s secondary banking crisis and virtually every other property crisis hong kong is a truly international centre and the banks role in property transactions is as currency facilitator rather than lender in 2017 hong kong was the third largest recipient of foreign direct investment substantially property after the us and china fdi inflows rose by 104bn to total nearly 2 trillion largest investors were china followed by corporate money channelled through offshore centres so yes hong kong banks will be hurt by a property crisis but not as much as bass implies it is foreign and chinese banks that have much of the property as collateral it is not the hong kong banks that have fuelled the property boom with domestic credit but foreign money bass fails to mention that a collapse in property prices and the banking system is unlikely to be confined to hong kong central banks have made significant progress in ensuring all banking systems are tied into the same credit cycle unwittingly they have simply guarenteed that the next credit crisis will hit everyone at the same time it won t be just hong kong but the eu japan britain and america everyone will be in difficulty to a greater or lesser extent interestingly the lehman crisis which occurred after hong kong property prices had already doubled from 2003 caused strong inflows to develop driving the hong kong dollar to the top of its peg the situation appears to be similar today with us outward investment at low levels but near record levels of foreign ownership of dollar assets despite hong kong s foreign direct investment standing at 2 trillion the prospect of capital repatriation to hong kong should not be ignored probably the most important claim in bass s letter is over the future of the currency peg operated by the hong kong monetary authority hkma he claims that the aggregate balance which is a line item in the hkma s balance sheet is the equivalent of the us fed s excess reserves and that once depleted the pressure on the currency board will become untenable and the peg will break the aggregate balance on the hkma s balance sheet has declined significantly over the last year from hk 180bn to hk 54 4bn currently the decision about changes in aggregate balances comes from the banks themselves and for this reason they are commonly taken to reflect capital flows into and out of the hong kong dollar this is different from aggregate balances reflecting actual pressures on the peg as suggested by bass the hkma maintains a us dollar coverage of 105 112 5 of base money currently about 110 and has further unallocated dollar reserves if necessary the peg is maintained by the hkma varying its base money not just by managing a base lending rate giving a spread over the fed s fund rate not just by influencing the commercial banks aggregate balances but by addressing the three other components that make up the monetary base these are certificates of indebtedness government notes and coins in circulation and exchange fund bills and notes efbns in practice it is the efbns in conjunction with the aggregate balances that are used to adjust the monetary base and keep the currency secured in the convertibility zone of 7 75 and 7 85 to the us dollar in maintaining the peg the hkma prioritises maintaining it over managing the money supply there is little doubt this goes against the grain of mainstream western economists who believe inflation good deflation bad over the last year base money in hong kong contracted from hk 1 695bn to hk1 635bn does this worry the hkma not at all how the chinese will act in the circumstances of a new global credit crisis is yet to be seen but we should bear in mind that they are probably less keynesian in their approach to economics and finance than westerners admittedly they have freely used credit expansion to finance economic development but theirs is a mercantilist approach which differs significantly from ours we simply impoverish our factors of production through wealth transfer by monetary inflation we think this can be offset by fuelling financial speculation and asset inflation china enhances her production and innovation by generating personal savings wealth is created by and linked more directly to production the objectives and effects of monetary and credit inflation between china s application of it and the way we do things in the west are dissimilar and it is a common mistake to ignore these differences the threat to china s ability to manage its affairs in a credit crisis is significantly less than the threat to western welfare dependent nations whose governments are highly indebted while china s is not china is sure to see the financial and monetary stability of hong kong as being vital to the mainland s interests apart from the bank of china s hong kong subsidiary being the second largest issuer of bank notes the peoples bank itself maintains reserve balances in hong kong dollars which in the circumstances kyle bass believes likely they can increase to support the hkma s management of the currency peg conclusions it is a mistake to think the hong kong property market is as much of a systemic danger as it first appears expectations of a devaluation of the peg appear to be wishful thinking by the bears far more important are the consequences of the cyber and financial war being pursued against china and russia its close ally by the american deep state under president trump it was accelerated by his trade tariff policies which are fundamentally an attack on china s economy china will be a hard nut to crack and the effect of america s trade protectionism has been to trigger a diminution in international trade which is now becoming apparent the negative effects on the american economy appear to be being underestimated the attempt to destroy huawei s 5g global ambitions is both the current and most visible part of an undeclared cyber and financial war trade protectionism was only a step along the way the financial war is now escalating with the global economy facing at least a significant recession almost certain to trigger an overdue credit crisis the chinese have long been on a financial war footing as shown by qiao liang s analysis of how america needs global portfolio flows and what they are prepared to do to attract them western thinking that the chinese and their russian allies are vulnerable to american hegemony has been disproved time and again financial analysts consistently fail to understand the chinese are not muppets china will not be provoked and by standing firm they are sure to protect hong kong and get on with diverting investment flows from a failing us economy into its belt and road initiative this will force a financial crisis on the americans of their own making at least that s how china has always seen it and they see no need for their passive financial war strategy to change

steps in advancing our specialty focused strategy including the acquisition of columbia vista accelerated wholesale activity and advanced our mutually beneficial partnership with the huu ay aht first nations said don demens president and chief executive officer we are pleased with the progress we ve made integrating our columbia vista division and look forward to the contribution this operation will make to our business going forward the company generated revenue of 275 7 million in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to 291 6 million in the first quarter of 2018 and 284 8 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 the company mitigated the impacts of a slow start to the spring building season by reducing the production and sales of lower value commodity products the improved mix resulted in a slightly higher average lumber price on february 1 2019 the company completed its acquisition of certain assets of columbia vista corporation and related entities located in vancouver washington for us 28 4 million and on march 29 2019 completed the sale of a 7 interest in the newly formed tfl 44 limited partnership to the huu ay aht first nations western also published its first sustainability report highlighting the company s governance environmental and social practices and performance during 2018 summary of first quarter 2019 results adjusted ebitda for the first quarter of 2019 was 18 1 million as compared to 43 0 million from the same period last year results were impacted by challenging markets and difficult operating conditions which led to higher operating costs shipments declined as we reduced operating hours to align production to market demand operating income prior to restructuring items and other income decreased to 5 7 million from 32 6 million in the same period last year during the first quarter we continued to successfully advance our strategy as we completed the acquisition of the columbia vista operation in vancouver washington and closed the sale of a 7 interest in our newly formed tfl 44 limited partnership to the huu ay aht first nations sales lumber revenue was 218 9 million which was 4 lower than the same period last year shipment volumes decreased 6 due to slowing us housing starts and as extended winter in north america delayed seasonal demand average lumber pricing benefited from the successful execution of our sales and marketing strategy and a weaker canadian dollar specialty lumber revenue was supported by higher production from our duke point sawmill which drove a 30 increase in niche product sales quarter over quarter sales volumes of western red cedar wrc declined 15 compared to last year as poor weather impacted market demand first quarter japan lumber shipments declined 14 the addition of columbia vista led to an increase in douglas fir product sales to japan which was more than offset by weakness in sales of hemlock and yellow cedar hemlock market share has been challenged by subsidized japanese domestic species we successfully mitigated commodity lumber price declines by increasing our direct sales to china by 56 compared to last year specialty lumber represented 52 of first quarter shipments unchanged from the same period last year but an increase from the 49 we achieved in the fourth quarter of 2018 first quarter log revenue was 41 2 million consistent with the first quarter of 2018 a stronger domestic saw log sales mix offset declining log pricing log shipments were flat compared to the first quarter of 2018 as increased pulp log sales volumes offset lower export and domestic shipments our export log volume in the period originated from a first nation timber purchase agreement managed by western british columbia bc coastal chip pricing declined 17 compared to the same period last year declining prices and lower production due to mill curtailments led to a 30 decrease in by products revenue by products revenue in the first quarter of 2018 included 2 6 million related to third party custom production at our ladysmith sawmill operations lumber production of 202 million board feet was 3 lower than the first quarter of 2018 we grew production at our duke point sawmill through increased hours and improved operating performance challenging commodity lumber markets led to reduced operations at our commodity focused sawmills our newly acquired columbia vista division contributed incremental production of 10 million board feet in the quarter first quarter bc coastal manufacturing costs were 20 higher than the same period last year due to challenging operating conditions included in higher operating costs was 1 7 million associated with temporary mill curtailments and higher natural gas costs due to a temporary supply disruption log production from our bc coastal operations was 922 000 cubic metres 10 lower than the same period last year decreased log production was primarily due to curtailed englewood operations our bc coastal log inventory was 5 lower at march 31 2019 as compared to the same time last year our bc coastal harvest costs increased by 12 from the first quarter of 2018 primarily driven by a 31 increase in per unit stumpage costs and a mix of higher cost operations coastal stumpage inflation has resulted from bc provincial government stumpage equation updates the ongoing influence of coastal log exports and log markets that have been unresponsive to weaker lumber pricing as a result of the misalignment between the coastal stumpage system and lumber market pricing we resumed export log sales in the second quarter of 2019 bc coastal saw log purchases were 208 000 cubic metres a 22 decrease from the same quarter last year due to lower market log availability strong demand from export markets and pulp manufacturers and lower harvest levels due in part to rising stumpage rates have limited market log supply to domestic sawmills consistent with our strategy we increased direct lumber sales to china to mitigate weak north american lumber pricing increased direct sales volumes to china combined with the impact of a weaker canadian dollar cad on united states dollar usd denominated freight and fuel costs led to a 1 8 million increase in freight expense compared to the first quarter of 2018 first quarter adjusted ebitda and operating income included 9 2 million of countervailing duty cvd and anti dumping duty ad as compared to 9 7 million in the same quarter last year duty expense declined as a result of reduced shipment volume offset by higher values for us destined lumber shipments selling and administration expense first quarter selling and administration expense was 8 8 million in 2019 as compared to 8 6 million in the same period last year incremental expense arose from sales and marketing initiatives board recruitment and foundational system and process improvements in support of our growth strategy finance costs finance costs were 1 5 million compared to 0 5 million in the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to higher average outstanding debt of 55 3 million in 2019 compared to none outstanding in 2018 the company had drawings of 84 0 million on the credit facility as at march 31 2019 as a result of adopting ifrs 16 leases on january 1 2019 we recognized 0 2 million of finance costs on lease payments in comparative periods leasing finance costs were recognized in operating income net income net income for the first quarter of 2019 was 1 9 million as compared to 21 7 million for the same period of 2018 operating margins and net income were reduced by lower production and shipment volumes and higher operating expenses columbia vista asset acquisition on february 1 2019 we completed the asset acquisition of columbia vista corporation and related entities operations in vancouver washington this acquisition is consistent with our strategy of pursuing margin focused business opportunities that complement our position in selected markets bringing western and columbia vista together provides us the opportunity to expand our douglas fir specialty product offerings particularly in japan which will support our bc based hemlock programs the combination of columbia vista and western makes us more meaningful to our selected customers and creates a stronger company for all our employees sale of ownership interest in port alberni forest operations on march 29 2019 we completed the sale of a 7 interest in our newly formed tfl 44 limited partnership tfl 44 lp to the huu ay aht first nations for gross proceeds of 7 3 million tfl 44 lp s assets consist of tfl 44 and certain other associated assets and liabilities of our port alberni forest operation we will continue to source fibre from tfl 44 lp to support our bc manufacturing facilities as part of the agreement we may sell huu ay aht first nations an incremental interest in the limited partnership subject to further negotiation other expense and operating restructuring items other expense for the first quarter of 2019 includes 0 7 million of transaction costs associated with the columbia vista acquisition operating restructuring costs were 2 2 million in the first quarter of 2018 due to severance and related expenses attributable to ongoing business optimization initiatives the indefinite curtailment of our somass sawmill and retraining of employees affected by the closure of the englewood train our somass sawmill remains indefinitely curtailed as a result of a fibre supply deficit arising from years of tenure takebacks and government land use decisions and rising costs associated with the united states us softwood lumber dispute we are evaluating options to create a sustainable long term solution for the site and we are considering the input of government first nations and other stakeholders income taxes current income tax expense of 0 8 million was recognized in net income in the first quarter of 2019 total income tax expense decreased by 7 3 million from the first quarter of 2018 as a result of lower operating earnings as we used the majority of our remaining non capital loss carryforwards during the second quarter of 2018 cash taxes were payable for the tax year ended december 31 2018 in may 2018 the company received correspondence from the canada revenue agency cra regarding certain restructuring transactions occurring in 2004 and 2007 to 2011 and the general anti avoidance rule management believes the cra s position is without merit management is prepared to defend its position if a notice of reassessment is issued and as such the company has not recognized any income tax provision as at march 31 2019 relating to this matter recent developments bc government forest policies in 2018 the bc provincial government the province introduced a coastal revitalization initiative and further policy initiatives that will affect the bc forest sector on april 1 2019 the province announced the creation of fibre recovery zones which are intended to increase the supply of residual fibre from primary harvesting for secondary users on april 1 2019 the province announced bill 21 forest and range practices amendment act 2019 designed to increase opportunities for public input improve information sharing on forest planning strengthen the minister s ability to manage forest activity expand the definition of wildlife to help protect at risk species and improve and streamline range use planning on april 11 2019 the province announced bill 22 forest amendment act 2019 if passed the new legislation will require approval from the minister before disposal or transfer of a tenure agreement to a third party the act will enable the minister to refuse to approve a disposition or transfer if it is deemed not to be in the public interest or detrimental to competition in the buying or selling of timber or residuals or to place conditions on the approval the impact that these policy initiatives may have on our operations cannot be determined at this time appointment of new independent directors on march 1 2019 western announced the appointment of laura cillis and cheri phyfer to its board of directors the board in accordance with the company s planned board renewal process these appointments follow the february 12 2019 appointment of michael waites to chair of the board strategy and outlook western s long term business objective is to create superior value for shareholders by building a margin focused log and lumber business of scale to compete successfully in global softwood markets we believe this will be achieved by maximizing the sustainable utilization of our forest tenures operating safe efficient low cost manufacturing facilities and augmenting our sales of targeted high value specialty products for selected global customers with a lumber wholesale program we seek to manage our business with a focus on operating cash flow and maximizing value through the production and sales cycle we routinely evaluate our performance using the measure of return on capital employed sales marketing strategy update we are progressing with the execution of our sales and marketing strategy that focuses on the production and sale of targeted high margin products of scale to selected customers we supplement our key product offerings with purchased lumber to deliver the suite of products our customers require our columbia vista acquisition provides us the opportunity to expand our douglas fir specialty product offerings particularly in japan in the first quarter of 2019 we accelerated wholesale purchases to 11 million board feet in anticipation of spring building season and sold 5 million board feet market outlook despite recent lumber pricing volatility and slow seasonal demand due to weather events our long term view of market fundamentals remains unchanged in north america rising lumber consumption will continue to be driven by increased new home construction a robust repair and renovation sector and growth in the use of mass timber building technologies we expect lumber demand in china to continue to grow due to a government commitment to housing and economic stimulus while in japan lumber consumption is expected to remain relatively stable over the next few years in north america prolonged winter weather has delayed the onset of the spring building season resulting in a supply demand imbalance and commodity lumber pricing volatility as weather improves in north america we expect to see recovery in demand and pricing for commodity lumber we anticipate any pricing response will be moderated by higher than normal inventories and additional supply as idled commodity lumber capacity returns we will continue to monitor prices and make adjustments in our operating plans accordingly improved weather conditions will also create opportunities for our western red cedar products we anticipate prices to remain stable for wrc timbers and wide width products the narrow width wrc lumber market is expected to remain weak due to competition from low price imported lumber and an abundant supply of narrow width us domestic cedar lumber we will continue to focus on managing our product mix to mitigate the pricing impacts in japan we anticipate demand will be relatively stable ahead of the proposed increase in the japanese consumption tax we expect hemlock pricing to remain under pressure from subsidized japanese domestic product substitution while pricing for our douglas fir products may be slightly weaker we expect to grow both volumes and price realizations for our niche products as we continue to refine the product offerings from our duke point sawmill we intend to leverage the planer rebuild and auto grader installation to improve recovery and lower costs we expect domestic saw log prices to decline in response to weaker lumber markets price declines may be mitigated by low saw log supply as coastal log production may decline due to stumpage rates that have become disconnected from the lumber market strategic capital program update we continue to implement a strategic capital program that is designed to position western as the only company capable of sustainably consuming the complete profile of the coastal forest and competitively manufacturing a diverse product mix for global markets our strategic capital program is focused on the installation of technology that will deliver top quartile performance and improve our ability to manufacture targeted products that yield the best margin in addition to investments in our manufacturing assets we also allocate capital to strategic high return projects involving our information systems timberlands assets and forest inventories in the first quarter of 2019 we completed the acquisition of columbia vista corporation in vancouver washington and invested 3 8 million to substantially complete arlington infrastructure and equipment upgrades commissioning has started and we expect to begin secondary processing at arlington early in the second quarter in bc we took delivery of the first ten forklifts as we begin implementation of our centralized fleet management program and progressed on a number of small high return capital projects focused on debottlenecking our manufacturing operations softwood lumber dispute and us market update western s results for the first quarter of 2019 include 9 2 million of export duty expense comprised of cvd and ad expense at march 31 2019 western had 71 4 million of cash on deposit with the us department of treasury in respect of these softwood lumber duties on april 9 2019 a world trade organization wto panel ruled on certain matters relating to the application of softwood lumber anti dumping duties concluding that the us violated international trade rules in the way it calculated anti dumping duties included in the ruling the wto panel has allowed the us to use zeroing in its calculation of ad which canada will appeal the practice of zeroing had previously been disallowed by the wto with regard to softwood lumber the final determination of ad is subject to additional appeals from both the us and canada the us application of duties continues a long standing pattern of us protectionist action against canadian lumber producers we disagree with the us trade determination and the inclusion of specialty lumber products particularly western red cedar and yellow cedar products in this commodity lumber focused dispute as duties paid are determined on the value of lumber exported and as our shipments to the us market are predominantly high value appearance grade lumber we are disproportionately impacted by these duties we have filed a chapter 19 north american free trade agreement nafta separate like product challenge on which a ruling is not expected until late 2019 us market sales represent less than 25 of western s total revenue in 2018 continued strong demand and a lack of supply has supported improvements in our specialty lumber product pricing partly offsetting the impact of duties our acquisition of a distribution and processing centre in arlington washington and the assets of columbia vista corporation in vancouver washington are expected to partially mitigate the damaging effects of duties on our products destined for the us market while increasing us market sales we intend to

adjustments and changes in fair value of biological assets adjusted ebitda margin is ebitda presented as a proportion of revenue western uses adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin as benchmark measurements of our own operating results and as benchmarks relative to our competitors we consider adjusted ebitda to be a meaningful supplement to operating income as a performance measure primarily because amortization expense impairment adjustments and changes in the fair value of biological assets are non cash costs and vary widely from company to company in a manner that we consider largely independent of the underlying cost efficiency of their operating facilities further the inclusion of operating restructuring items which are unpredictable in nature and timing may make comparisons of our operating results between periods more difficult we also believe adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are commonly used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties to

executive summary internal and external forces are converging on the korean peninsula with potentially profound implications for korean futures and regional stability between the unprecedented flurry of bilateral summits and agreements on north korean denuclearization the two koreas have a broader goal reunifying after nearly seventy five years of division the april 2018 panmunjom declaration for peace prosperity and unification of the korean peninsula proclaims in part that south and north korea will reconnect the blood relations of the people and bring forward the future of co prosperity and unification led by koreans by facilitating comprehensive and groundbreaking advancement in inter korean relations 1 while the two koreas have starkly different ideas of what form unification should take it is an undeniable end goal of ongoing engagement while it is a worthy goal unification poses a high risk to political economic and social stability in korea even if it occurs peacefully and under the auspices of south korea s republic of korea or rok democratic government it requires careful forethought and planning however much of this planning is focused on predicting under which scenario peaceful collapse or conflict unification will occur while scenario planning is useful it downplays and neglects critical issues that will determine whether or not true political economic and social integration of the two koreas can be achieved this publication defines unification as a process of sustainable integration under a single unified korean state while different scenarios may provide different starting points on this path unification as a process will be drawn out and won t be complete until the two koreas are integrated socially economically and politically regardless of the scenario such integration is contingent upon successful stabilization and stability actions which refer to a framework for transforming fragile states into stable states although many international organizations will likely be involved in this process given the importance of the united states alliance with south korea and the positive role the united states can play in support of rok led unification assessing unification through the lens of stabilization is essential the current emphasis on scenario based planning places a premium on unpredictable elements of unification scenarios are also inherently limiting and often times politicized progressives in korea are reluctant to discuss collapse or conflict scenarios as they imply the absorption of north korea on all sides the lack of korean involvement in the original decision to divide the peninsula in 1945 among other experiences makes south korea wary of the potential for foreign actors to usurp control in any unification enterprise such views and other political obstacles severely limit and constrain the u s government and military from planning key support to the rok throughout the process of unification with the exception of conflict contingency planning however south korea also acknowledges that unification will not occur in a foreign policy vacuum in order to ensure that foreign actors have a constructive rather than a destabilizing role in unification it is very important that south korea work closely with its most important ally and as necessary other regional powers to overcome key obstacles to integration all three scenarios assume that unification will occur while north korea is in a state of fragility which will require a concerted effort on the part of south korea and its international partners to stabilize the newly unified country many if not most of these stability actions will occur regardless of whether unification is peaceful or not even in peaceful scenarios north korea s weapons of mass destruction wmd will need to be secured and dismantled the 1 2 million strong korean people s army kpa will need to be demilitarized and demobilized and to the extent possible employed in other sectors these tasks alone pose unprecedented challenges given their magnitude numerous essential services will need to be established or restored in the north including access to food clean water medical services temporary housing as well as expanded educational and employment activities and other government services creating more inclusive political and economic institutions will be very difficult given the vast socio economic political differences including the enormous economic gap north korea s gross domestic product gdp per capita for example is estimated at about 6 percent of south korea s approximately 32 000 these tasks are all critically important to fostering long term stability regardless of how unification occurs they can be divided into five major action clusters establishing civil security restoring essential services establishing rule of law supporting governance and supporting development while these five categories of stability actions will be relevant in any scenario the type of scenarios will determine the magnitude of effort each will require for example in a conflict scenario establishing civil security will be much more difficult and restoring essential services will require more effort if infrastructure is destroyed or south korea is temporarily and partially incapacitated as a result of war related damage under the stabilization framework this study analyzes what factors present the greatest and most unique challenges to long term stability in unification and how the united states can play a supporting role that mitigates potentially destabilizing factors although international organizations such as the united nations un international atomic energy agency iaea world bank and others are likely to be involved in the unification process this study focuses on the role of the united states this study also assumes that unification and stabilization will occur under a south korean rather than north korean led scenario among the most important factors to consider for u s involvement in the unification process are the following crucially the united states should at all times be the supporting partner in unification contingencies with south korea always taking the lead the united states role will primarily be in the initial and transformation phases of stabilization in the fostering sustainability phase the united states should provide assistance and should advise if called upon additionally the u s response will be primarily security and humanitarian assistance related while limited in actions related to the rule of law governance and development in a 2018 survey conducted for the u s government s stabilization assistance review 86 percent of u s government experts did not know which agencies have lead responsibility for which elements of stabilization 2 the united states must carefully pinpoint areas of responsibility within the u s government and communicate them to south korea in addition to cooperation with the rok the u s response must be carefully coordinated with international organizations to the extent south korea concurs this will lend south korea greater legitimacy to its leadership of unification efforts and make available the international community s resources and capacity to enhance stabilization efforts within the united states interagency cooperation between the department of state u s agency for international development usaid and department of defense will be critical to ensuring that stabilization efforts have unity of effort both within the u s government and in partnership with and support of its south korean ally the united states must carefully pinpoint areas of responsibility within the u s government and communicate them to south korea in addition to cooperation with the rok the u s response must be carefully coordinated with international organizations to the extent south korea concurs this will lend south korea greater legitimacy to its leadership of unification efforts and make available the international community s resources and capacity to enhance stabilization efforts within the united states interagency cooperation between the department of state u s agency for international development usaid and department of defense will be critical to ensuring that stabilization efforts have unity of effort both within the u s government and in partnership with and support of its south korean ally dismantling north korea s wmd programs and demobilizing the kpa will require the greatest magnitude of effort early on civil security is a very man power and material heavy task and it is also critical to establishing an operating environment conducive to restoring essential services establishing rule of law and sustaining governance and development without successfully establishing civil security in the initial phase of stabilization practitioners will be largely unable to carry out other stability actions dismantling wmd will be critical to ensuring the operating environment is safe enough for other stability actions to proceed even in a peaceful unification scenario dismantling wmd will probably be a prerequisite to a political agreement for unification or the initiation of economic integration between the two states this is because the international sanctions regime is largely predicated on the existence of north korea s nuclear and ballistic missile programs the nuclear non proliferation treaty npt prohibits non nuclear weapon states like south korea from having access to information and materials related to nuclear weapons this would include for instance limited involvement with dismantlement activities relating to nuclear warheads warhead components fissile material cores for warheads weapon design information and other weapons related aspects of the program in past cases and most likely in a future north korea case the united states and other npt nuclear weapon states would secure and dismantle these materials south korea would not be restricted by the npt from undertaking activities related to dismantling other elements of north korea s nuclear and missile programs that are not specifically related to nuclear weapons certain delivery vehicles material research and development and personnel related to the program in this endeavor the involvement of international organizations like the iaea united nations and the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons opcw could strengthen international confidence and consensus in the destruction of north korea s wmd while the rok s role in dismantling weaponized nuclear material may be limited rok forces and officials must have a leading role in thoroughly vetting and possibly reassigning certain north korean elites including government officials military officers and anyone with knowledge of wmd programs into nondefense sectors although integrating these elites into a new unified society will be a highly sensitive issue it is essential that elites feel the process of unification will benefit them if they feel at any point that the process does not serve their interests elites will be more inclined to engage in destabilizing activities such as resisting integration forming factions or proliferating wmd related knowledge or technology given the highly politicized nature of the kpa including the critical role of political commissars demilitarization and demobilization not only depend on military operations such as disbanding of military units including personnel weapons systems and supporting facilities but also on whether party elements in the kpa will be ready to give up their responsibilities demobilizing the kpa also entails paramilitary units and semi military forces such as units attached to various ministries and security agencies demobilizing the kpa in more ways than one is akin to demobilizing an entire nation given the highly militarized nature of north korea due to the north korean state s gross mismanagement of resources and neglect of critical infrastructure restoring essential services will require a great deal of effort regardless of the scenario however it will require significantly more effort if infrastructure in north korea is destroyed in conflict and if civilians suffer casualties injuries and displacement in restoring essential services the united states and south korea should plan to quickly establish transportation infrastructure to ensure even and expeditious distribution of resources as north korea s state imposed system of sociopolitical classification songbun often determines where citizens can live some of the most vulnerable individuals will be located in rural and isolated locations u s south korean and other foreign aid to north korea should be carefully tailored to the local economy and distribution networks to ensure it does not displace local markets jangmadang in establishing rule of law supporting governance and supporting development south korea will face major challenges in integrating north koreans into new and unfamiliar political economic and legal institutions south korea will be the predominant driver in these endeavors and should prioritize efforts that build the foundation for inclusive institutions promoting rule of law is the first step toward creating inclusive institutions but legal reform must be incremental abruptly installing a non endogenous legal code could encourage the development of de facto norms outside of the law for example if north koreans are suddenly subject to south korean standards for formal dispute adjudication many are likely to resolve disputes over property business or personal harm informally through social networks rather than through the new and unfamiliar legal system over the long term the entrenchment of these practices can prevent north koreans from being integrated into the unified korean legal system systematically disadvantaging them by creating barriers to their participation and representation in legal institutions a unified korean government should be cognizant of the political cleavages building a new democracy could create although inclusive and democratic institutions have demonstrated support of inclusive economic institutions that lead to sustained prosperity they also redistribute power and wealth in transitioning from a totalitarian autocracy there will be many in north korea who have benefited from the nation s unequal power structure who will oppose a democratic redistribution of power in the extreme these individuals could form militant or violent groups that resist south korean democratic norms moreover they may eventually accept the new political system but organize parties based on the korean workers party to contest nationwide parliamentary and municipal elections gdp per capita in north korea is just around 6 percent of south korea s gdp per capita if the two koreas unified tomorrow they would create one of the most unequal societies in the world bridging this gap will take time and it will largely depend on how successful the unified nation is in transforming north korea s extractive economic institutions into inclusive ones similar to those in south korea much of south korea s plans to develop the north hinge on investments from major conglomerates chaebol however the chaebol s massive market share already stymies competition from small and medium enterprises heavy chaebol investment in the north could therefore perpetuate extractive economic institutions that further concentrate wealth in south korean conglomerates chaebol investment in north korea should be carefully regulated so that capital flows do not exacerbate inequality the long term development of the northern provinces of a unified korea will be a primarily korean task that said the u s and international community will have a crucial role in protecting north korea from predatory and extractive investment by supporting and legitimizing domestic reform efforts the north korean labor force will be attractive to south korean and foreign companies while foreign investment should be welcome in north korea south korea should remain vigilant and monitor the nature of investment especially in regards to north korea s yet untapped rare earth mineral reserves foreign resources and capital can be very positive for north korea s development but they also have the potential to be environmentally and economically exploitative introduction at the geneva conference in 1954 south and north korea stood for the first time on an international stage as separate sovereign states the 1953 korean armistice agreement had called for a political conference to settle the korea question but few truly thought it would succeed indeed the two koreas entered the conference with what they knew to be irreconcilable conditions for unification between competing claims of legitimacy conflicting provisions for election scope and supervision and cold war alliances the conference failed to reunify the two koreas and ultimately relegated the settlement of their division to a later date the geneva conference represented a gap between idea and reality that persists in unification discourses today inter korean discussions of unification live in the broad sweeping language of high level agreements and reflect distant ideals although each side has its own vision for unification the differences that prevented the two koreas from reunifying in 1954 are now compounded by nearly seventy five years of separation and institutionalized political economic social linguistic and cultural divisions while unification occupies a central place in policy and national identity a peaceful and negotiated settlement of the korean question remains more as a long term goal recently south koreans have increasingly been thinking about greater inter korean cooperation as they witness multiple inter korean summits and two u s north korea summits while expectations are likely to grow throughout 2019 and beyond it s also important to bear in mind the huge structural challenges and impediments related to unification this study is concerned with how this gap between idea and reality impacts the role of international actors and especially the united states in unification since the first inter korean agreement in 1972 following red cross talks the two koreas have avowed that unification shall be achieved independently without depending on foreign powers and without foreign interference 3 this mindset is justifiably informed by centuries of foreign interference on the korean peninsula and has made the rok wary of involving international partners in its detailed unification plans u s policy is to support the rok vision for unification but rok reluctance to include the united states or other major powers in unification planning has created barriers that prevent either nation from determining exactly what form u s support will take chung min lee chung min lee is a senior fellow in carnegie s asia program he is an expert on korean and northeast asian security defense intelligence and crisis management more currently the united states has tacitly accepted that it will be called upon to support the rok in as yet unknown ways in the stabilization phase of unification nevertheless unification will not occur in a foreign policy vacuum and the united states can better support and help prevent unfriendly actors from undermining the rok s vision with greater preparation and cooperation on key postconflict and peaceful unification issues focusing on the importance of stabilization as an essential element of unification could allow the rok and its international partners especially the united states to form an enduring strategic consensus this introduction explains why seoul should include international actors such as the united states on a case by case basis in its unification planning to do so it assesses the current state of u s involvement in unification planning core issues presented by scenario based planning and how stabilization may provide a more productive approach to unification subsequent sections break down the challenges korea will face with its international partners regarding major facets of stability actions such as dismantling north korea s wmd programs and demobilizing the kpa to establish civil security restoring essential services longer term governance capacity building and supporting economic development given that this study focuses on the potential u s role emphasis is placed on establishing security in the immediate to near term where the u s role is likely to be the most important and effective planning for stabilization of the unified korean peninsula by approaching unification through a stabilization framework rather than scenario based planning the rok the united states and other potential international actors can open a productive and realistic conversation about unification in the u s conception of stabilization the goal is to create a stable operating environment in fragile states whether they became fragile due to conflict natural disaster severe mismanagement of government resources or another reason the 2018 stabilization assistance review defines stabilization across the u s government as an inherently political endeavor that requires aligning u s government efforts diplomatic engagement foreign assistance and defense toward

of staff august 3 2016 adrp3 07 stability operations u s department of the army headquarters august 31 2012 stability actions are commonly divided into five categories see table 1 yet this is far from an exhaustive representation of all stability actions depending on which agency is involved stability action clusters may be represented by slightly different names and divisions in this publication the five task categories in figure 2 are used for the sake of simplicity while nearly all of these actions will be critical in korean unification detailing each is beyond the scope of this publication instead this study focuses on three areas where the rok s cooperation with international partners will be most critical establishing civil security restoring essential services and supporting development governance and rule of law are discussed in the context of building inclusive institutions stability actions occur in three phases of initial response transformation and fostering sustainability see figure 2 these phases are not necessarily discrete actions in each phase may occur simultaneously with actions in another phase importantly they also interface with a fragility spectrum the initial response phase generally reflects actions to stabilize an operating environment in crisis usually directly after a conflict or as violence is still ongoing in this phase the military role in stabilization particularly in terms of civil security is most pronounced the transformation phase occurs in an environment relatively free of severe violence and is focused on host nation capacity building in the fostering sustainability phase efforts are focused on building strong institutions enabling sustainable development and preventing regression to unstable conditions 5 as such stabilization efforts do not only occur in postconflict environments they may also occur in fragile states in the absence of violence and conflict in which case stability actions may be focused in the transformation or fostering phase stabilization can prevent and mitigate issues that often plague fragile states such as violent extremism and organized crime refugees and internally displaced persons idps humanitarian emergencies pandemic diseases mass atrocities severe inequality and many more and prevent them from leading to violent conflict 6 successful stabilization is a whole of government effort as of december 2018 the department of state is the overall lead federal agency for u s stabilization efforts the u s agency for international development is the lead implementing agency for non security u s stabilization assistance 7 the department of defense is a supporting element providing proper access and resources in the operating environment to civilian agencies parts of the departments of justice treasury and agriculture play key roles as well 8 however the 2018 stabilization assistance review found that 86 percent of u s government experts were not clear which u s government agencies have lead responsibility for different elements of stabilization 9 in order to have an effective response these roles must be clarified within the u s government as soon as possible and communicated to south korea even in the absence of conflict north koreans exist in a constant state of violence inflicted upon them by a regime that denies even the most rudimentary of civil and political freedoms and essential resources according to the fragile states index north korea has been a chronically fragile state since the fund for peace began collecting data in 2006 10 regardless of how unification occurs the rok and its international partners have to undertake stability actions that ensure the safety security well being and ultimately prosperity and freedom of all north koreans this is critical not only for humanitarian reasons but to prevent the vast political economic social and cultural differences between north and south korea from becoming destabilizing connections between scenarios and stability at the simplest level the three scenarios that receive primary attention are peaceful unification collapse and absorption and unification through conflict peaceful unification would occur via a mutually agreed upon political settlement of the korean conflict between the rok and north korea and subsequent facilitation of economic political and social integration of the two koreas into a single state federation or confederation discussed in the next section collapse and absorption scenarios take a path more similar to that of german unification in this situation the kim regime is unable to maintain effective political economic social and military control which ultimately leads to regime collapse and absorption by south korea in a scenario whereby unification is achieved through conflict north korean use of force would trigger a conflict that ultimately results in the unification of the korean peninsula in this circumstance either of the two koreas could unify the peninsula all unification scenarios will require core stability actions to be undertaken however the sequence and level of effort required to complete each set of stability actions will differ between scenarios see figures 3 through 5 conflict scenario stabilization is most often referenced in postconflict scenarios see figure 3 a conflict scenario would require that the highest magnitude of effort is put toward establishing civil security as the conflict de escalates in the traditional rok u s operation plan this would begin to occur at the point when kim jong un s regime is incapacitated in this scenario political barriers to establishing civil security are minimal in certain aspects such as securing wmd most stability actions however would require a high magnitude of effort relative to other scenarios given the destruction of infrastructure that is inevitable in the course of war additionally incorporating those who benefited from the kim regime s patronage would likely take time and negotiation as reflected in the graph as u s and rok personnel secure north korean wmd establish border security and make plans for demobilizing the north korean military they would very shortly thereafter need to vet and identify those who served in all major political and military posts but especially those in security services and political prisons and begin the arduous process of restoring essential services to north koreans amid displaced civilians destroyed or dilapidated infrastructure and poor or nonexistent services returning essential services after conflict will require a greater magnitude of effort than other scenarios as essential services are being restored and negotiations with any remaining north korean factions or elites wind down civil control and governance can begin to be revived under a postconflict political order here the emphasis will also be placed on creating more durable governance and development structures peaceful scenario there are two ways in which peaceful unification is typically discussed the second of which is represented in figure 4 the first is outlined in detail in the next section and continues to be represented in rok unification policy it involves three phases of unification the first phase is akin to the steps being laid for south north reconciliation now which would ideally lead eventually to a korean federation with two systems and two governments this phase would eventually lead to the third and final phase of unification based on a common constitution peninsula wide elections and a unified government and national assembly another and perhaps more probable process of peaceful unification is predicated on economic integration rather than an overt political agreement to form a unified government this scenario would likely involve a lengthy process of negotiation as depicted in figure 4 negotiations would center around north korean activities that have led to sanctions restricting economic engagement between the two koreas particularly north korea s wmd programs and human rights abuses in this scenario negotiations for unification and civil security particularly securing wmd disarmament and kpa demobilization will likely occur simultaneously through a slower step by step process after an agreement to dismantle north korea s nuclear program and ideally its chemical and biological programs is reached south korea and the international community could begin more robust efforts to restore essential services and improve access to basic necessities and rights in north korea through sustained economic engagement legal institutional and political norms in north korea would hopefully change to accommodate international investment and trade kathryn botto kathryn botto was a senior research analyst in the asia program at the carnegie endowment for international peace her research focuses on asian security issues with particular emphasis on the korean peninsula and u s defense policy towards east asia more while the events that lead to a peaceful unification scenario will be vastly different from those leading to conflict north korea will likely remain a fragile state until its wmd programs are dismantled and sanctions are lifted as a fragile state north korea can benefit from stability actions by ensuring aspects of its fragility do not lead to instability and that any major economic changes do not become destabilizing in that sense integrating the two koreas peacefully will still require many of the same elements as a conflict scenario although the sequence and magnitude required for each stability action will differ collapse scenario the sequence and magnitude of efforts would again be distributed differently in a collapse scenario figure 5 also takes into account the possibility of chinese intervention an important element that has so far not been discussed china is just one international actor that could become involved in a unification scenario and it should be noted that it may be in the interest of other states such as russia to influence the situation as well based on china s close historical ties with north korea its aversion to a north korean collapse and steadfast opposition to the stationing of any u s forces in a unified korea the chances are high in the event of a north korean collapse china will maximize its leverage to ensure its core interests in keeping a buffer between itself and the u s forces in korea enhancing its influence over the peninsula and guaranteeing its access to north korea s natural resources on one major issue the full control and dismantlement of north korea s nuclear and other wmd facilities and programs the chinese have similar interests with the united states since neither wants a unified korea assuming control of north korea s nuclear and ballistic missile arsenals but beyond the nuclear and wmd issues active u s china cooperation on civilian displacement and economic development will be difficult if more international actors are involved many aspects of stabilization will need to be negotiated parties involved will likely permit early establishment of essential services to help those affected by the conflict but the highly controversial element of establishing civil security especially as related to wmd will take far longer to negotiate than in other scenarios as the three countries currently have no consensus on how to handle north korea s wmd one of the core assumptions in this study is that stability actions in a collapse scenario could begin after either state or regime collapse in north korea the boundary between state and regime collapse is hardly clear especially in a state like north korea where the kim dynasty embodies the state as a result while it may make conceptual sense to differentiate between state or regime collapse the underlying assumption is that a post kim jong un regime will be unable to exercise effective control over north korea and attendant responsibilities the other major assumption underlying this study is that there is a possibility of chinese military intervention in north korea as assessed in greater detail later it is entirely possible that china could undertake limited military operations during and after collapse these operations may seek to prevent the inflow of north korean refugees across the tumen yalu river to bolster an interim regime in north korea to prevent the entrance of south korean and u s forces into north korea in order to conduct disarmament and demobilization operations to enhance un approved efforts in controlling and dismantling north korea s chemical biological radiological and nuclear cbrn facilities weapons systems and personnel or to increase china s strategic leverage from the onset of collapse in north korea areas where potential chinese intervention is likely is assessed in relevant sections but chinese intervention is not assumed to be automatic however crafting contingency operations in north korea following collapse without due consideration of chinese intervention would be quite unrealistic the u s role in unification is not guaranteed and will always be negotiated with south korea however the stability approach while not an end all be all solution to the many barriers to more inclusive unification planning can help avoid the unpredictable politicized and limiting restraints scenario based planning has reinforced discrete unification scenarios peaceful unification through negotiation unification through a north korean collapse and absorption by south korea or unification through conflict offer useful insight into what triggers may lead to conditions favorable to unification however they are inherently limited by the convergence of unpredictable variables that will determine the composition of scenarios moreover once a trigger or sets of triggers prompt unification to begin almost all of the multiple plans and step by step responses are likely to be overtaken by the speed and depth of changes rather unification should be seen as a continuum and a process at times volatile with high degrees of uncertainty and at times more predictable international dimensions of unification from china s centuries long suzerainty over korea to the united states decision to cede control of the peninsula to japan in 1905 through the treaty of portsmouth that ended the russo japanese war to the unplanned u s decision to divide korea at the thirty eighth parallel in august 1945 in the wake of japanese surrender the territorial integrity of korea has always been mired in geopolitics largely outside the control of the korean people as anxieties mounted in seoul and pyongyang following rapid rapprochement between the united states and china in 1972 park chung hee and kim il sung agreed to hold the first formal inter korean dialogue the resulting july 4 south north joint communique established the principles of independent peaceful and nationwide unification this has remained as the bedrock of all subsequent inter korean agreements the 1954 geneva conference was the first and last time foreign powers were included in inter korean negotiations over unification although the two koreas desire an independent unification process south korea also acknowledges the possibility of foreign powers participation the integral involvement of the united states in guaranteeing south korean security attests to its influence especially in conflict related scenarios until full operational control of the rok military is transferred to south korea the united states will also lead the korean military in any conflict even in a peaceful unification scenario finding securing and dismantling north korea s wide array of nuclear weapons and wmd sites would require the united states and most likely with other permanent members of the un security council to play a very critical role in addition to areas that require u s support the united states has the capabilities and resources to help alleviate the strain on the rok as it assumes primary responsibility for unification while the united states has fought about eleven conventional wars since the american revolution the majority of its foreign military engagements abroad have been focused on various aspects of stabilization that will be necessary on the path toward a unified korea 11 moreover u s experience in international development and its status as the largest foreign aid donor can be useful in a korean context both successes and failures in u s led stabilization many of which will be discussed in this study can inform emerging korean needs this is particularly critical as the cost of unification will be massive for both the government and south korean taxpayers unification cost estimates are numerous and wide ranging from 2 trillion 3 trillion or 471 billion over ten years 2 5 trillion over thirty four years to even an optimistic 50 billion over forty years 12 in 2015 the rok s national assembly budget office nabo estimated that unification would cost over 9 trillion if it occurred peacefully from 2016 to 2060 the office estimated the cost of unification would begin at over 60 billion in the first year and increase annually peaking at 318 billion in 2056 after forty five years the two economies would be sufficiently integrated and the annual cost of unification related government expenditure would begin to decrease 13 that is an annual average of 207 billion a cost that will be a significant strain on taxpayers especially as south korea s population continues to decline shrinking tax revenues the cost of unification both human and economic will be even higher if it follows some form of military conflict operation iraqi freedom and the subsequent operation new dawn which lasted from 2003 to 2011 cost the united states 815 billion and those operations confronted a force much smaller than north korea s with less sophisticated weaponry 14 the costs would be astronomically higher if nuclear weapons are involved if south korea is decimated by war its capacity to conduct stability actions to unite the peninsula would be limited south korea s economy the eleventh largest in the world is bigger than that of any country that has experienced a military conflict on its own soil in the past seventy years 15 as anthony fensom described in detail in the national interest a conflict on the peninsula would disrupt global supply chains and even potentially shrink global gdp 16 after the two koreas resolve to unify the process of active integration begins in earnest the differences in development between the two koreas are not only potentially economically destabilizing but politically destabilizing as well for example rudiger frank has noted as long as the necessary infrastructure is missing economic development will not take place and economic problems will accumulate turn into social problems and have political consequences 17 south korea has copious plans to deal with unification on its own but it will be able to overcome obstacles to integration more quickly with the cooperation of foreign countries international support for korean unification although this publication focuses on u s rok cooperation in unification it by no means advocates the united states be the rok s sole partner in this endeavor stabilizing north korea will require a high magnitude of effort regardless of the scenario and sharing this burden with the international community can enhance legitimacy and provide assurances to the process and also help alleviate financial logistical and man power strains on south korea in other experiences with stabilization supporting actors have commonly been involved for instance stabilization efforts in afghanistan were supported by some 478 local and 350 international nonprofits numerous for profit companies at least twenty six un agencies five intergovernmental organizations and a coalition of forty two countries and north atlantic treaty organization nato forces 18 this is not to say that the same panoply of international actors would or should descend upon a unified korea importantly the involvement of any actor should require korean consent this publication focuses on the u s capacity to cooperate for the sake of simplicity but it acknowledges that other actors could and are likely to support or exert influence over the unification process u s support for korean unification given the centrality of u s military operations over various conflict scenarios u s involvement in potential conflict related unification is unavoidable if north korea provokes a response that requires the combined forces command cfc to incapacitate the kim regime it is understood in the alliance that unification will be the end result ultimately once specific goals of cfc s mission are concluded the rok will assume responsibility for unification however it is understood that the rok limits u s or other foreign access to their postwar plan at the end of phase iii of the operational plan where the lion s share of activities to stabilize the peninsula begin see figure 6 in essence this planning regards the end of the kim regime as the point where unification occurs beyond this point u s practitioners will likely be asked by the rok for currently unknown forms of u s support that washington will provide if possible currently it does not appear that usaid plans for unification related development and humanitarian assistance both for peaceful and nonpeaceful unification this attention to the earlier phases of unification is echoed in policy and academic discourse which focus on potential sequences of events that could lead to various unification scenarios to be sure there are other unification scenarios that could be considered but this study will focus on the more desirable rok led unification scenarios that would require stability actions moreover unification is seen here as an arduous complex but ultimately unavoidable longer term process of political social and economic integration of the two koreas as nabo acknowledges it could take more than forty years or longer for the two koreas to be fully economically integrated even at that point potentially destabilizing inequalities between the north and south are likely to persist nabo estimates that after forty five years the north s gdp will still only be 66 5 percent of the south s 19 certain studies have found that cross jurisdictional per capita income differences on the order of 40 percent are consistent with social stability 20 unification scenarios unpredictable politicized and incomplete korean unification can be positively or negatively influenced by international actors but it will not occur in a vacuum as such south korea needs to proactively plan with international partners for their role in unification nevertheless the rok government including the blue house the ministry of unification mou the ministry of foreign affairs mofa and other high level policymaking bodies have largely excluded the united states and other major powers from any direct or explicit role in unification the united states and other foreign powers cannot change the rok s historical memory that shapes its concerns about foreign involvement in the unification process however to adequately plan for unification it s important for the rok to work closely with international actors to ensure that they support rather than undermine the process building trust is crucial in facilitating cooperation between the rok and the united states and other major powers throughout the unification process in addition to the rok s pronounced skepticism of foreign involvement the scenario based planning model is a major barrier to the u s ability to support the rok s unification plans this study argues that in order to achieve stability throughout the process leading to unification the rok the united states and other friendly international actors should focus on stability based planning rather than scenario based planning since the former is a much more dynamic mechanism this approach will ultimately open more avenues to international support for the rok s unification plans as it will mitigate unnecessary sources of friction stemming from limited knowledge of the rok s and other major powers concerns over unification and likely politicization of key issues especially relating to sovereignty legal claims and jurisdictions unpredictable scenarios the current emphasis on scenario based planning places a premium on unpredictable elements of unification six events are commonly regarded as potential catalysts or triggers for unification scenarios see figure 7 each catalytic event mindful that there are many more potential catalysts than those enumerated in figure 7 has an unwieldy number of potential paths making predicting its exact trajectory and outcome virtually impossible once events reach a certain point all of them involve the crucial aspects of establishing civil security restoring essential services establishing civil control supporting governance and supporting development hence unification should be seen as a process whereby stabilization composes the lion s share of activities and responses by the rok and the united states although stabilization is commonly associated with conflict the goal of stability actions is explicitly to stabilize fragile states according to u s joint doctrine for stabilization a fragile state is a country that suffers from institutional weaknesses serious enough to threaten the stability of its central government 21 north korea certainly qualifies based on this definition and thus is considered a chronically fragile state on the fragile states index 22 even in a peaceful unification north korea s fragility will require major efforts in the five main areas of stability actions in order to prevent destabilizing disruption to economic and political institutions it is important to keep in mind that all of the essential elements necessary to fostering greater stability remain unchanged regardless of specific scenarios as a result the stabilization framework is more useful for planning and avoids unpredictable elements that are more prevalent in scenario based planning frameworks politicized scenarios on top of their artificial divisions and unpredictability scenarios are heavily politicized and sanitized in south korea although south korea and the united states would only support unification under a democratic government stating as much implies favoring absorption south korean progressives are reluctant to discuss unification in these terms for fear of upsetting north korea potentially closing doors to engagement and the building of a permanent peace regime these discussions are also not palatable in the un where principles of respecting sovereignty and noninterference are enshrined in the un charter acknowledging unification related aspects of conflict runs into similar predicaments the united states and china may be involved in peaceful unification scenarios especially if the current armistice is replaced by a permanent peace treaty ending the korean war but exactly how these two powers would be involved is a taboo subject in south korea as well as north korea given its deeply rooted reservations about any form of foreign power involvement on unification akin to the 2 4 process that resulted in german unification nevertheless the overarching importance of stabilization cannot be overemphasized since it will impinge upon a unified korea s long term prosperity and international actors can help or hurt the speed of that process incomplete scenarios lastly as enumerated earlier scenarios focus on the short term aspects of unification and are therefore incomplete given the permutations of various scenarios it is better to conceptualize unification as a process that involves the full spectrum of developments ranging from negotiations to massive disruptions indeed even if a negotiated settlement is reached integrating vastly different organizations and institutions personnel and codes of conduct between the two korea is going to be a long term process most likely for decades hence rather than rejecting international support it is in south korea s interest to integrate constructive international efforts from the onset of operations in order to minimize misperceptions and discord unification policies of the two koreas common dream different interpretations understanding why unification is such an emotionally charged politically complicated and structurally inconsistent concept lies in the very nature of bringing together two almost completely different political entities that also share common ethnic identities histories languages and cultural norms the south north divide is a mutually dependent adversarial relationship the two koreas are frenemies who emphasize the penultimate importance of achieving peaceful unification through national reconciliation and maximizing the opportunities tendered by a common ethnic identity this fundamental dichotomy has widened through seven decades of charting polar opposite political trajectories north korea that has been ruled by the kim family since 1948 under a ruthless communist dictatorship and south korea that emerged from decades of authoritarian rule into a robust democracy one of the world s largest economies the fundamental problem is whether the two koreas will be willing to compromise core national interests in the name of creating a unified korean state yet it would be extremely naïve to assume that south korea for example could discard its democratic ideals and values to achieve reunification at the same time so long as the kim dynasty remains in power it is impossible to imagine kim jong un being willing to shed the juche ideology the all important ideology of self reliance in north korea and kim il sung thought and kim jong il thought in order to foster a unified korea although both sides emphasize the ultimate importance of a common korean home the very harsh reality is the juxtaposition of two widely divergent visions of a unified korea south korea s unification formula while north korea s state propaganda machinery constantly emphasizes unification as a central goal including the penultimate importance of forsaking all foreign influence south korea also sees unification as central to its national identity the major problem however lies in diametrically different conceptions of unification a fundamental disconnect exists between unification as a national goal and as a policy precept in the preamble to the south korean constitution it is noted in part that the korean people have assumed the mission of democratic reform and peaceful unification of our homeland moreover the rok is seen as having legal authority and jurisdiction over the korean peninsula article 4 stipulates that the republic of korea shall seek national unification and shall formulate and carry out peaceful unification policy based on the free and democratic basic order hence the notion of a free and democratic unified korean state is enshrined in the constitution however notwithstanding the centrality of this point left of center governments have eschewed the term free and democratic when it comes to stating the makeup of a unified korea since they believe that such a characterization is a conduit for unification through absorption as an example the kim dae jung administration 1998 2003 emphasized its so called sunshine policy based on three key principles the two koreas won t allow armed provocation the south will not attempt unification through absorption and the south will pursue a policy of reconciliation and cooperation for the moon jae in administration ensuring peaceful co existence and common prosperity is the bedrock of inter korean cooperation through the resolution of the north korean nuclear problem sustainable inter korean relations and a new economic commonwealth on the korean peninsula 23 successive governments since democratization in 1987 have adopted their own approaches to inter korean ties but a national unification formula has remained relatively unchanged since the adoption of the korean national commonwealth unification plan in september 1989 by the roh tae woo administration 1988 1993 and subsequently reconfigured to include a three phased strategy by the kim young sam administration 1993 1998 the ministry of unification s official website notes that this unification plan is premised on the philosophy of freedom and democracy and three core principles unification by the south and the north on the basis of national self determination unification through dialogue and negotiations and not through military means and unification through democratic processes and methods 24 the three phases include the following 1 reconciliation and cooperation through the basis of mutual recognition and multiple and diverse cooperative exchanges in order to foster change from antagonistic and adversarial ties to co existence and common prosperity 2 south north federation as an interim step based on the principle of two systems and two governments and 3 creation of a unified state based on the adoption of a unification constitution through democratic processes the holding of democratic elections and the building of a unified government and national assembly 25 yet while the political rationale for these principles is understandable there is virtually no guideline on operationalizing them in any concrete fashion at lower levels such as fielding a common olympic team the two koreas have reached agreements but on major areas such as forging a common economic development plan a unified defense force and most importantly the makeup of a unified korean government emphasizing the importance of co existence and common prosperity for example won t move the negotiation needle the notion of a phased transition from two systems and two governments is politically palatable as a basic framework but remains virtually impossible to achieve at the operational level unless and until one side is willing to forego critical interests and core values since the restoration of democracy in 1987 successive left wing and right wing governments in south korea have adhered to the korean national commonwealth unification plan with some modifications nevertheless even this basic plan fails to concretely address how the two koreas hope to achieve greater integration without massive political adjustments yet continuing to ignore this fundamental flaw in south korea s unification policy is only going to result in greater obfuscation and ultimately irresponsible and ineffective policy responses north korea s unification policy north korea s views on unification have been premised on two critical principles since its founding in 1948 first that national division was caused by imperialist powers and second that national unification must be based on total independence from foreign powers in practice this means that all foreign forces must be withdrawn from the korean peninsula and that a new korean nation must be created through the basis of a joseon minjok jaeiljuwi or joseon nation first policy here north korea is referring to an ethnically pure korean race that is untainted by foreign imperialism and colonialism for north korea the purest korean race are the koreans who have thrived under the kim dynasty it excludes those who are deemed anti juche anti unification and anti socialist 26 as south korean expert park young ho puts it independence does not refer to the concept in which an individual is granted human dignity rather it refers to a component in group receives recognition as a socio political life once it is subject to the supreme leader under the juche ideology 27 in south korea particularly in the political left independence from imperialism is often discussed in the context of unification with special reference to deconstructing the so called cold war mechanism naengjeoncheje this refers to the institutional norms that have been in place in south korea since 1948 which many progressives argue were imposed on south korea by the united states these include the stationing of u s forces a capitalist economy and a pro u s political class as a result in order for peace and unification to prevail on the peninsula some progressives have argued that the cold war mechanism should be deconstructed to include diminishing or abolishing the u s military presence in south korea although this is not the stated policy of the current progressive government in his new year s address in january 2019 kim jong un stressed that he was committed to ending military hostilities between the two koreas and that since north and south committed themselves to advancing along the road of peace and prosperity we maintain that the joint military exercises with foreign forces which constitute the source of aggravating the situation on the korean peninsula should no longer be permitted and the introduction of war equipment including strategic assets from outside should completely be suspended 28 pyongyang also maintains that its nuclear weapons program has nothing to do with building a peace regime since nuclear weapons are meant solely for deterring existing nuclear threats from the united states only after the united states ceases its hostile policy toward north korea such as stopping all nuclear war related military exercises and ending the transfer of strategic assets such as bombers and nuclear submarines into south korea can north korea begin to talk about genuine denuclearization hence the key phrase in north korea s unification policy is building the conditions of peace meaning the withdrawal of u s forces and the end of the rok u s alliance contrasting views within south korea although there is nominal support for unification in south korea as an important national goal views on how rapidly unification should be pursued how necessary it is and the extent to which south koreans should bear financial responsibilities such as willingness to accept a unification tax differ substantially as a national goal or aspiration a majority of south koreans support unification as evinced by numerous surveys such as the april 2017 poll conducted by the korea institute for national unification kinu however only 13 8 percent of south koreans responded that unification was very necessary followed by 44 percent somewhat necessary 36 5 percent not very necessary and 5 7 percent not necessary at all 29 see figure 8 the support for the status quo is also reflected in the belief that if the two koreas can live in peaceful co existence then there is less urgency for unification for example 46 percent answered that a permanent state of separation was acceptable and 50 4 percent in their twenties said they re willing to live with a divided korea so long as there is peaceful coexistence 30 this poll was conducted in april 2017 and public sentiments have changed since the rush of inter korean summits in 2018 and the first ever u s north korea summit in june 2018 nevertheless 65 percent of south koreans prefer gradual unification over a decade according to a september 2018 gallup korea poll see figure 9 31 interestingly 16 percent of those under thirty felt that unification should be accelerated while those in their thirties 13 percent and forties 14 percent preferred rapid unification least see figure 10 32 even of those in their sixties and above who have the highest emotional attachment to unification given their relative lack of distance from the korean war only 26 percent felt that unification should be pursued rapidly at a conceptual level south koreans believe that there are national benefits to unification in the april 2017 poll conducted by kinu 54 1 percent said there were some benefits and 14 7 percent responded that there were significant benefits to unification at the national level see figure 11 here south koreans are referring to a peace dividend flowing from unification rather than living in fear of north korea s nuclear weapons or the possibility of another protracted conflict the story is very different when south koreans think about individual benefits from unification in 2017 for example 67 1 percent replied that there wasn t much of a personal benefit stemming from unification 20 5 percent said that there was some benefit and 3 7 percent responded that there was a lot of benefit from unification see figure 12 33 at the same time when asked whether south koreans should sacrifice everything in exchange for achieving a grand goal of unification 3 5 percent answered very much agree and 37 5 percent said they somewhat agree versus 25 4 percent who said not very much agree and 2 8 percent that not at all agree 34 unification costs are likely to be extremely high for a protracted period of time and an issue that amplifies potential direct costs for south koreans the same survey asked south koreans whether they supported a tax increase for unification and only 1 3 percent said they very much agree while 15 2 percent said they somewhat agree sixty two percent said they didn t agree much or not at all 15 percent which illustrates the divide between normative support for unification versus assuming direct personal costs 35 last but not least continuing ambivalence continues to shape south korean attitudes toward unification and north korea in a poll conducted by the asan institute for policy studies in april 2018 31 9 percent of south koreans said that north korea was a stranger enemy while 55 8 percent said that north korea was one of us neighbor so that positive views of north korea prevailed 36 what is very surprising however is that 49 3 percent of those in their twenties felt that north korea was a stranger enemy 37 this is because from the period when democracy was restored in 1987 until the 2000s ideological affinity with north korea remained strongest among those who were in their twenties and thirties the ability to speak much more freely on south north issues and the propensity to see north korea as more independent and nationalistic than south korea contributed to greater sympathy for the north but millennials in south korea are much more concerned about job security and new opportunities than focusing on pro north korean activities clearly there are millennials who are more supportive of north korea but in the mainstream most of this generation also understands north korea has committed gross violations of human rights and feels more detached from pyongyang s ideology these perceptions of unification suggest that there is a significant divergence in how the public will perceive specific aspects of unification the government s response to contingencies and the degree to which it is willing to coordinate policies with the united states many south koreans believe there will be some national benefit from unification but if they have to assume direct tax burdens suffer cuts or delays in their own social welfare benefits or agree to provide preferential treatment to north korean refugees political support for whichever government remains in power is going to dissipate in terms of stabilization this suggests that most south koreans are likely to support humanitarian responses such as economic and food aid to the north but will be less enthusiastic about the long term financial burden associated with integrating north koreans into south korea s economic institutions south koreans are more likely to support stabilizing activities such as securing wmd or implementing viable policing in north korea given that rapidly deteriorating civil security conditions in north korea could be destabilizing in south korea as well however longer term commitments required to demobilize the kpa and manage nuclear waste would be called into question this is why most south koreans some 65 percent believe that unification should be stretched out over a longer period of time such as ten years one of the most important dimensions of unification is that no one really knows the speed or magnitude of changes that are likely to be triggered in the event of regime collapse in north korea moreover even under the most peaceful unification scenario through a political settlement a very large leap of faith major obstacles will remain if a two systems two nations situation is maintained for the time being will south koreans be willing to give up their civil liberties in exchange for the creation of a unified state those in their thirties and below have always lived under a democracy in south korea it is nearly impossible for them to fathom the possibility of living in an authoritarian system as this group matures politically job security personal incomes level of social welfare benefits and educational opportunities are likely to dominate rather than any ethnic bond with north koreans there will be huge political debates within south korea as the rok together with the united states and other international partners begins to focus on establishing civil control after order and security are achieved in north korea such control could be realized by putting into place a viable criminal justice system impartially allocating private property and addressing the problem of gross human rights violations as well as de facto genocide in north korea finding a political consensus within south korea on how best to cope with reconciliation but also achieve justice for all of the suffering of the north korean people will be divided sharply along ideological lines ultimately factors that compel south koreans to think positively about unification such as overcoming more than seven decades of partition are always balanced by much more cautious views on the nature of the north korean regime in a gallup korea poll conducted in december 2018 to assess how south koreans viewed the flurry of inter korean summits in 2018 and unprecedented engagement between the two koreas 45 percent responded that north korea was unlikely to keep its promises while 38 percent said that north korea was likely to keep its word on the various agreements 38 entrenched political divisions and deep contradictions within the south such as support for unification but unwillingness to make major political concessions as well as perceiving north korea as a partner but also an adversary likely means that public support for extensive engagement with north korea will be tempered over time expectations for the results of engagement are already moderating in a poll conducted by the korea society opinion institute 54 percent of south koreans were optimistic that the second summit between kim and u s president donald trump would produce a deal leading to the eventual denuclearization of north korea compared to 75 percent at the time of the first trump kim summit 39 u s role and capacity the united states role in korean unification will be shaped largely by three factors first as south korea s most important ally and one that shares common universal values the united states has reaffirmed its support for peaceful reunification of the two koreas as well as the creation of a free and democratic korea this is crucial because regardless of the deep sensitivities involved in laying down the characteristics of a unified korea it behooves the united states as the world s most powerful democracy to throw its weight behind the creation of a unified korea that is free and democratic second u s diplomatic acumen strategy and support is going to be critical in forging a broad international coalition that reaffirms the principles of peaceful unification and the building of a democratic unified korea this will be especially relevant given the growing political influence of china across asia and indeed the world in a development that no one could have foreseen two to three decades ago all of the united states allies in asia today trade more with china than the united states in short china enjoys significant leverage over every single u s ally and partner in the asia pacific region but especially on the korean peninsula the only power that will be able to match and counter chinese influence in and around the korean peninsula is the united states third as described in greater detail below the u s role in undertaking stability actions in north korea as the unification process begins if managed properly will be constructive and significant dismantling north korea s cbrn demobilizing the kpa and controlling the country s security apparatuses cannot be done solely by south korea on top of that the u s capacity to assist in restoring essential services establishing civil control and supporting governance and economic development can be a stabilizing force behind south korea s efforts regardless of the second u s north korea summit the likelihood of a peace agreement formally ending the korean war and the normalization of relations between the united states and north korea the united states will continue to play an important role in supporting korean security and taking the lead in multilateral diplomacy german unification relied on a 2 4 mechanism the two germanies plus france the soviet union the united kingdom and the united states and something similar could work in the korean context however it seems highly unlikely that china russia or the two koreas in case of a negotiated settlement would agree to any formal role for japan in the end as south korea s most important ally the united states steadfast commitment to a unified korea that is led by the rok is the best conduit for ensuring the highest levels of cooperation throughout the process of unification establishing civil security i weapons of mass destruction in the stabilization context civil security refers to the provision of security for state entities and the population including protection from internal and external threats 40 creating a secure and stable environment helps not only ensure the protection of civilians but also create conditions for other stability actions to succeed without civil security practitioners will find extreme difficulty in restoring essential services establishing rule of law or sustaining governance and development the exact scale of north korea s wmd programs is unknown but they will certainly require an extensive and complex dismantlement effort additionally although its soldiers are malnourished and possess outdated equipment north korea still has the fourth largest military in the world with 1 2 million personnel or 5 percent of its population 41 by contrast saddam hussein s army in 2003 had just 360 000 to 420 000 men with far inferior conventional capabilities 42 at this scale even if unification occurs without conflict demobilizing all of these elements and simultaneously dealing with the challenge of maintaining civil security will require massive amounts of man power and money as well as careful strategic planning securing and dismantling wmd programs and particularly the nuclear program will be one of the most critical stability actions in north korea building a nuclear program is an expensive and time consuming process but so is its dismantlement in iraq 1 625 u s and un inspectors took two years to search nearly 1 700 sites for wmd at a cost of 1 billion after russia bought soviet era strategic warheads back from the ukraine the united states provided 500 million through the nunn lugar cooperative threat reduction ctr fund to dismantle ukraine s remaining intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms icbm silos heavy bombers and cruise missiles over a period of six years 43 iaea safeguards in iran to implement the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa cost 18 42 million in 2017 to perform inspection activities at eighteen facilities and nine other locations 44 libya dismantled its nuclear and chemical weapons programs with assistance from the uk south africa decided of its own volition to dismantle its six air deliverable nuclear weapons in just a few months 45 needless to say the size scope and character of past wmd dismantlement efforts have varied greatly dismantlement of north korean wmd will be different still u s intelligence estimates that north korea has the fissile material to build between thirty and sixty nuclear bombs and has assembled ten to twenty 46 its copious missile tests have confirmed its ability to manufacture delivery vehicles including icbms a 2017 u s intelligence assessment concluded that north korea had successfully miniaturized a nuclear warhead to fit icbms 47 experts estimate that north korea has upwards of 1 000 missiles of varying ranges 48 on top of weapons and delivery vehicles securing all of north korea s highly enriched uranium plutonium weapons r d materials and personnel will be major tasks in addition to nuclear weapons north korea is believed to possess an arsenal of 2 500 to 5 000 tons of chemical weapons as well the potential to produce biological pathogens such as anthrax and smallpox 49 fully eliminating north korea s wmd programs would require securing at the very least 141 known and certainly many more unknown cbrn related sites dismantling nuclear arms halting uranium enrichment disabling reactors closing nuclear test sites ending hydrogen bomb fuel production destroying germ arms destroying chemical arms and curbing its missile program 50 north korea s wmd will require far more extensive counter wmd cwmd operations than recent efforts in libya syria iraq or iran not only is the scale of north korea s wmd programs immense but in the event of conflict or a messy regime collapse securing north korea s wmd will have to occur in severely unstable conditions many of north korea s wmd are in heavily fortified concealed or unknown locations that will take time to locate without the cooperation of north koreans with knowledge of the programs moreover securing wmd requires a major ground force presence and the united states and south korea have never fought a ground war with loose cbrn material in the operating environment once secured dismantling north korea s nuclear program will also be a decidedly slow endeavor while national security adviser john bolton has said that fully verified dismantlement can occur within a year experts estimate the full process could take anywhere from a few years to fifteen years 51 and after that a critical remaining issue will be how to dispose of nuclear material major challenges to eliminating weapons of mass destruction in the korean context in the short term the most immediate priorities for wmd elimination wmd e related civil security actions will be verifiably locating all wmd securing cbrn materials and securing elites and others with wmd related knowledge these tasks will be sufficient to ensure enough security that other stability actions can proceed however because many of the locations of north korea s nuclear biological and chemical weapons are unknown this phase will be a major undertaking requiring a considerable amount of time delaying other vital missions each phase of stabilization initial response transformation and fostering sustainability poses its own challenges but the initial phase will be the most critical as it possesses the most potential for instability if done poorly in the fog of war a power vacuum or pronounced political uncertainty the threat of uncontained wmd is amplified and the potential for enemy combatants to seize use or proliferate wmd poses a serious threat for this reason quickly finding and securing wmd in an unstable scenario is absolutely critical to protecting local populations and enabling subsequent stability actions as such the military should first focus on securing population centers and known sites so that essential services can be delivered to these areas as quickly as possible simultaneously the military will have to scour the country to locate any as yet unknown wmd sites of which there may be many in situations where the north korean government is incapacitated or conflict occurs securing wmd will be far more integral to ensuring civil security and laying the foundation for other stability actions to begin although an incapacitated north korean government will allow for less restricted access to wmd sites if north korean officials do not cooperate the united states and south korea will enter into an operational environment with hazardous wmd in unknown locations fighting a war in this context poses extremely high risks including the potential for accidental detonation of a nuclear weapon in a scenario with various military factions and insurgents enemy elements could also gain control of wmd it goes without saying that ascertaining and securing the location of wmd as quickly and thoroughly as possible will be critical to reducing potential harm in these contexts in iraq no wmd were found but the experience offers insights into the challenges in securing wmd in north korea north korea is a little less than one third the size of iraq and physically searching for hidden wmd could conceivably take less time however north korea s terrain also presents different challenges iraqi terrain consists mostly of broad plains with some mountains and marshes on the border north korea meanwhile is predominately mountainous which makes finding securing and dismantling wmd far more difficult and the kpa has heavily prioritized concealment of everything including command posts foxholes runways fighter jet and naval bases and cave strongholds 52 based on defector accounts and evidence from tunnels discovered leading into the north ihs janes estimates that north korea has a network of 11 000 fortified underground facilities some of which could potentially conceal wmd 53 searching for and locating all the wmd in north korea could take months or even years wargames conducted by rand that accounted for factors specific to the korean context found that securing a single site could take weeks or months depending on the level of interference from north korean forces once located securing a single large site is estimated to take four days and then another three days to ascertain whether the site is critical to the wmd program the process of systematically searching for and collecting information material and persons from a designated location and analyzing them to answer information requirements facilitate subsequent operations or support criminal prosecution exploitation would take an average of eighteen days although very large sites like yongbyon could take months to secure and exploit 54 as the rand study noted reaching these sites is extremely difficult as is finding the weapons the mountainous channelized terrain along the dmz is defended by dug in north korean forces if these units actively defend their positions analysis found that u s forces would not arrive at the first nuclear site for almost two weeks and then only after suffering substantial combat losses even when wargames posited weak to nonexistent north korean resistance allowing u s forces to quickly reach the closest sites locating nuclear weapons and material took a considerable amount of time tying up both large maneuver units and the highly specialized units that locate and safely eliminate nuclear weapons moreover in the wargames analysts playing the role of north korean factions impeded the u s search efforts by sabotaging the facilities blowing up tunnels and contaminating the sites with radiological waste 55 in a peaceful scenario negotiating away north korea s nuclear program will likely be a precursor to economic integration and a condition for the unification process to begin it will therefore not be an initial stability action as the lack of volatility and negotiated access to nuclear sites will make wmd less of a threat to the general population however regardless of whether denuclearization results through diplomatic negotiations or seizure in an unstable context providing security assurances to north korean officials will be critical to ensuring nonproliferation and long term stability of the process in any scenario there will be elites and officials in north korea that have had a stake in and knowledge of its wmd program successful unification requires that they believe the process will not be harmful to them if they are uncertain or unconvinced of the positive outcomes of unification they will have an incentive and resources to undermine cwmd and nonproliferation efforts north korea has learned from the experiences of ukraine iraq libya and iran specifically that nuclear weapons are the ultimate deterrent against foreign intervention ukraine gave up its large nuclear stockpile in exchange for security assurances from russia and the united states yet russia annexed ukrainian crimea in 2014 iraq did not have nuclear weapons and thus could not stave off u s forces in 1991 or 2003 muammar gaddafi renounced libya s wmd on december 19 2003 only to be deposed and killed in the libyan civil war in 2011 iran entered into the jcpoa to reduce its nuclear program and watched as it was jeopardized by u s president donald trump s decision to withdraw from the agreement as a result regardless of an agreement if north korean elites believe at any point that protections afforded by an external security guarantee will expire they will be more likely to sell knowledge expertise or even smuggle nuclear technology outside of the country given the scale of north korea s nuclear program and the number of people involved this has the potential to create a proliferation threat similar and likely larger than that posed by a q khan the one time head of pakistan s uranium enrichment program who sold uranium enrichment technology to many international buyers including north korea libya and iran 56 as such it is highly important that elites scientists and anyone with knowledge of north korea s wmd programs especially nuclear be quickly located and secured while unification will require transitional justice to address human rights abuses committed by elites vetted elites and professionals with wmd knowledge should have opportunities to contribute meaningfully in a unified korea the u s learned this lesson the hard way in iraq when after the invasion of iraq in 2003 it systematically eliminated saddam s ruling baath party confiscated some of its wealth and removed party members from their government jobs without offering viable alternative occupations or ensuring their safety the baath party was so integral to the governance of iraq that its elimination left the government short staffed and hardly able to function de baathification fueled resentment in many communities and led to widespread political and social instability in iraq that undermined stabilization and contributed to the insurgency the legacy of which still undermines governance in iraq today 57 the same potential exists in north korea with the added threat of elite and professionals access to information on north korea s wmd programs the rok government s plans for north korean scientists and elites are opaque but allowing north korean scientists and officials to maintain their status will likely be unpalatable to many koreans a transitional justice process that judges the future of these people based on their individual conduct not their affiliations will be critical to demonstrating to the public rigorous vetting and formally legitimizing security guarantees for wmd related personnel even once transitional justice is complete elites will need to be constantly reassured of their security although technology and wmd research and development materials can be physically secured individual knowledge cannot those with wmd knowledge will continue to pose a proliferation risk throughout their lifetime u s role and capacity securing and dismantling north korea s nuclear weapons is perhaps the only aspect of unification in which rok involvement is restricted by international treaty the npt explicitly prohibits south korea and other non nuclear weapon states from handling nuclear weapons and related materials or information 58 although south korea can secure non weapons related nuclear materials or delivery vehicles only the five npt nuclear weapon states are permitted to handle weapons related materials technologies and information even iaea involvement in this endeavor is restricted except where participating member states are restricted to the five nuclear weapon states in the fog of war it may be difficult to distinguish which sites have a combination of weaponized and other material even in a peaceful context north korea s nuclear weapons program may be inextricable from peaceful elements of the nuclear program which could restrict the rok s involvement further biological and chemical weapon disposal however can include much more robust south korean participation it remains unclear how the biological weapons convention would be implemented in north korea as the un security council s power to investigate violations of the convention has never been invoked 59 this in and of itself poses a stability risk the united states and south korea should delineate tasks responsibilities and lead agencies to counter biological weapons in conflict or collapse there is more precedent for chemical weapons and the opcw will likely have a leading role in coordinating the destruction as both south korea and the united states are members discovery of chemical weapons can be reported to the opcw under article iv of the chemical weapons convention and generally states are permitted to select and implement the appropriate destruction technologies for chemical weapons by which chemicals are converted in an essentially irreversible way to a form unsuitable for production of chemical weapons and which in an irreversible manner renders munitions and other devices unusable as such 60 these activities will occur under the supervision of the opcw which will verify the completion and legitimacy of destruction 61 the united states and rok have plans for how they will handle cwmd in conflict although the details of the operational plan are classified the u s joint publication 3 40 on countering weapons of mass destruction however lays out u s doctrine for neutralizing wmd 62 the doctrine is geared toward conducting cwmd operations in a failing or collapsing state where intervention to secure wmd is required although the principles outlined would largely apply in a conflict scenario as well while the task designations will be the same in korea understanding the operational environment threats and vulnerabilities will require far greater effort than depicted in this publication as it stands the united states and rok know of many wmd storage sites research centers factories and other facilities but many remain unknown if access is permitted units can be immediately dispatched to secure known sites and the rok and u s may be given information on the location of as yet unknown sites that can be subsequently secured however if conflict occurs and especially if a north korean insurgency is involved completely and verifiably securing north korea s wmd could take much longer in many aspects of stability actions in the north particularly restoring essential services and establishing rule of law the united states will be most heavily involved in the initial phase of restoration however in the case of civil security the united states needs to remain engaged in the transformation and fostering sustainability phases as well due to the npt s restrictions on south korea s access to nuclear weapons as well as the logistics denuclearization will require while chemical weapons can be destroyed relatively easily and safely through incineration or neutralization 63 and biological weapons can be eliminated through heat or chemical compounds dismantling north korea s nuclear program will create enormous amounts of nuclear waste that poses a security risk decommissioning yongbyon alone will be a hugely challenging endeavor whang jooho and george t baldwin have explained result in anywhere from 50 to 100 metric tons of uranium spent fuel as much as 500 000 liters of liquid high level waste as well as miscellaneous high level waste sources from the radiochemical laboratory a substantial quantity of intermediate level waste will result from disposing 600 metric tons of graphite from the reactor an undetermined quantity of chemical decladding liquid waste from reprocessing and hundreds of tons of contaminated concrete and metal from facility dismantlement 64 dealing with this waste will be a long term challenge with international implications one option for disposing of fissile material and delivery vehicles is to remove them from the country a very expensive process and one that could be opposed by residents of their destination country a second option is to transport the spent fuel to a location abroad where it can be vitrified and then return it to north korea for storage countries with the infrastructure required to vitrify north korea s nuclear waste include the united states japan france and the uk because of south korea s npt status and north korea s radioactive waste dismantling its nuclear program will at some point become an international endeavor the rok s closest ally the united states may not immediately be able to access locate or secure north korea s wmd sites but china might a number of north korea s known nuclear facilities are much closer to the border with china than south korea including the pyunggye ri nuclear test site suspected uranium enrichment facilities yeongjeo ri and cheonmasan and suspected underground nuclear facilities bakcheon taechon and hagap in short almost all of north korea s major nuclear facilities other than yongbyon are closer to china than south korea china has the ability to deploy those forces on the ground to wmd sites much more quickly than the united states and that access has the potential to be destabilizing if not properly coordinated with the united states and south korea if south korea does not involve china in planning china s reactions could be discordant from joint u s rok responses although it has a vested interest in ensuring stability on the peninsula including china in planning for wmd e operations could decrease the time required to secure the area allowing for other organizations to come in more quickly and restore essential services to populations in need still this would likely be a difficult sell in both south korea and the united states not to mention key obstacles that information sharing with china presents to open a conversation the united states and the rok could approach china first on the basis of dealing with north korea s nuclear waste the issue of nuclear waste is less sensitive than securing and dismantling nuclear material but still will be a significant challenge in dismantling north korea s nuclear program in the long term this phase of denuclearization also requires less intelligence sharing and therefore is easier to approach with china in fact the united states and china have cooperated before to remove highly enriched uranium from ghana 65 assuming trust can be built through discussing this topic the united states and the rok can potentially work backward to china s cooperation on other wmd e tasks to mitigate the potential political risks of involving china such as giving it too much influence in addition to the iaea the united states and s
the us dollar will collapse or it will be replaced by another currency we hear such statements all the time are they true we decided to check these claims so we invite you to read our today s article about the us dollar s international supremacy and find out whether the greenback s demise is likely in the foreseeable future let s also draw implications from the analysis for the precious metals market we have heard about the fall of the us dollar s significance for over half a century in particular the rise of china s economy threatens the greenback s dominance trump s unsound fiscal policy and the recent powell s dovish turn only reinforce these fears so let s analyze whether such a scenario is likely in the foreseeable future and let s draw implications for the precious metals market the dollar s supremacy started around 1955 when reserves held in greenback exceeded those held in pound sterling since then the us dollar is a king to be clear we do not maintain that greenback is a wonderful currency without problems and better than gold no it simply has no competitors among other fiat currencies it is a king of beggars initially after the gradual demise of british currency the only possible alternatives to the greenback were the japanese yen and the deutsche mark as japan and germany noted impressive pace of economic development however both economies were much smaller and with less liquid financial market moreover the us army stationed in both countries which cast a shadow over their currencies the situation has not improved since then in the 1990s germany struggled with the reunification while japan fell into multi year stagnation after the burst of the enormous asset price bubble actually one may convincingly claim that japan has not fully recovered yet as the country still faces deflation weak banks adverse demographics sluggish growth or even periodic bouts of negative growth and negative interest rates indeed the bank of japan is running the most accommodative machine of any central bank that it systematically important hence yen is not likely candidate to replace the us dollar many analysts believed that 21th century will bring some changes as the ecb launched euro a new common currency for several european countries however for almost every economist with some knowledge about the international monetary system it was clear that a project based on a unified monetary policy and heterogeneous fiscal policy each member of the eurozone conducts its own policy could not pose a serious threat to the us dollar the euro is too fragile which was revealed by the great recession and the sovereign debt crisis the current italy s problems are just an old shortcomings in a new disguise i write more about the latest twenty years of the eurozone in the february edition of the market overview last but not least germany is also an obstacle for euro to gain in importance you see berlin favors the policy of a balanced budget for us it is a very sound policy but it results in the small supply of german bunds so investors prefer to park their funds in the us treasury market which is the most liquid market in the world if not euro and not yen so maybe yuan will dethrone the us dollar this is what many analysts expect based on china s economic potential after all the imf included the chinese renminbi into the sdr basket in october 2016 however the yuan is not likely to replace the us dollar anytime soon the main reason is shallow financial market in china it still lacks transparency and it is controlled to large extent by the authorities do you remember august 2015 when the people s bank of china devalued the currency i bet you do let s look at the chart below the share of the yuan in global currency reserves amounted to 1 8 percent in q3 2018 it does not look like a great threat for us dollar does it chart 1 composition of world s total foreign currency reserves from q1 2010 to q3 2018 green line us dollar blue line euro purple line pound sterling orange line japanese yen red line chinese yuan investors should remember that there are four things needed in order for a currency to play a global role size stability liquidity and security although china s economy and trade payments are big the yuan is not stable not liquid and not secure the financial system is still heavily controlled by the authorities and it is not open and transparent although the share of the us dollar in the world s total foreign reserves has declined somewhat since 2015 it remained dominant with share above 60 percent the euro which is the second most popular reserve currency has share amounting to 20 percent or one third of the greenback s share moreover although dollar s role as official reserve diminished slightly its share in bank external claims has risen similarly volumes through u s based dollar wire transfer and settlement systems have also continued to rise to sum up tina says that the us dollar will remain the world s global reserve despite all its shortcomings who is tina it is the slogan used by margaret thatcher there is no alternative yen let s be serious japan still cannot stand on its own feet after post bubble recession approaching the third lost decade euro no way as long as there are doubts about the eurozone s survival yuan maybe someday but not anytime soon as the renminbi is not freely floating while china s capital markets are not yet fully open the implications for the precious metals market are clear the gold bulls should not count on yuan replacing the us dollar it is not going to happen anytime soon you may not like america and its currency but the fact is the greenback will remain the dominant fiat currency us dollar will remain relatively strong which will be a headwind for the yellow metal however when china liberalizes and opens its capital market the gradual reshuffle in the composition of the foreign reserves may occur which could support gold

new york may 3 2019 the april jobs report printed at 263 000 new jobs the consensus estimate had been just 181 000 revisions for february 23 000 and march 7 000 netted 16 000 more jobs the revisions resulted in average three month job creation of 169 000 jobs and six month average job creation of 204 000 that compares to 185 000 average three month new jobs and 206 000 six month new jobs for march 2019 and 218 000 and 204 000 jobs for those same periods respectively for april of last year job creation was up 50 2 from the same month last year which had printed at 175 000 it was up 29 2 over march which printed at a revised 189 000 the unemployment rate was 3 6 down 2 10ths of a percent but down 2 10ths of a percentage point from march 2019 and 3 10ths of a percent from april 2018 the u 6 unemployment at 7 3 unchanged from march but down 5 10ths of a percentage point since last year the two months are the lowest u 6 number since march 2001 nominal average weekly wages increased by 2 94 year on year at a rate that is higher than inflation real wages increased by just 0 98 assuming the january trimmed mean pce annual inflation rate of 1 96 analysis details and outlook we have been saying since our november jobs report that we see a flashing red light requiring investors and businesses to stop and assess conditions before moving forward in march we urged investors who were in or near retirement to move toward cash but since then our confidence has improved in light of the following chinaâ s reduction in its reserve ratio in early january apparent progress in a china u s trade agreement the fedâ s more dovish stance on interest rates a headline 3 2 2019 q1 gdp report that vastly exceeded expectations and the strongest labor productivity in 2019 q1 at 3 6 since 2010 q3 have made us more optimistic nevertheless we still have considerable concerns about the global economy and its impact on the u s these concerning data points are discussed further below in other macro data and include germanyâ s substantial slowdown italy which had also concerned us has just moved out of recession moved out china reducing its reserve ratio over obvious concerns about its economy and the rollover of dollar euro and pound denominated debt it owes american european and british banks continuing short term yield curve inversions some disconcerting data on housing starts and rising gas prices the length of the recovery no deal brexit overall concerns about demographics and some odd trading patterns in currency pairs and interest rates and some â window dressingâ in european banks as pointed out by gillian tett in her financial times column last month all things considered our stance remains at a yellow flashing light but soon to be a green light we anticipate 2019 q2 gdp to print at just 1 9 to 2 4 after what we viewed as an outlier in 2019 q1 data let s look at our exclusive jobs creation by average weekly wages for the april jobs report april jobs creation by average weekly wage source the stuyvesant square consultancy compiled from bls establishment data for april 2019 the number of people employed in march was 156 645 000 down by 103 000 from march but up 1 297 000 from the same period last year some 162 470 000 individuals were in the workforce down by 490 000 from the 162 960 000 who were in the workforce last month the labor participation rate slipped 2 10ths of a percentage point to 62 8 down from 63 0 last month but up from the 62 7 rate from april 2018 the jolts survey for february the latest available data released april 9th showed 538 000 fewer new job openings from january thatâ s 910 000 fewer new job openings than were created from december to january but 550 000 more jobs created than in february of 2018 still that is down significantly from the year on year change from the january 2019 jolts report when 1 686 million new jobs had been created oil pricing and geopolitical concerns we re heartened to see fuel prices continuing below the 3 per gallon threshold gasoline prices for april are 11 1 higher than last month and 0 3 higher than last year but oil prices as measured by west texas intermediate crude have climbed 10 7 from last month as of april 4th but are 1 4 lower than the same day last year u s sanctions against iran will also adversely affect the economy of its neighbor iraq thereby putting pressure on the countryâ s political regime the effect of the white house announcement late last month that it was ending waivers of sanctions on those countries that still imported iranian oil china turkey japan and india among others remains to be seen as the waivers officially ended at 12 01 am this morning there is resistance and several of the countries with expiring waivers have asked for more time but there seems to be compliance provided the trump administration does not move too aggressively to impose sanctions on the importers we remain concerned of some flashpoint occurring in the region iran foreign minister mohammad javad zarif made the rounds among tv networks and u s think tanks late last month offering both threats and accommodation as iran moves further from joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa and becomes further estranged from the west it further enhances the odds iran will abandon the usd as the currency for its oil trading as we discussed in greater detail here iran can do more damage to the us by joining the nations which have tried de dollarizing oil because it could greatly diminish the usd s status as the worldâ s reserve currency and wreak economic hardship upon the us iranâ s other threats seem less troubling the republic has said several times it would cease all flow of oil through the straits of hormuz if iran could not sell oil because of the u s sanctions the regime has engaged in more missile testing causing the u s to request even stronger sanctions from the un in february it announced it had developed an indigenous surface to surface missile hoveyzeh as of april 29 the kearsarge afg is posted off the coast of the straits of hormuz and the uss lincoln cvn 72 carrier strike group is off the coast of egypt approaching the suez canal clearly the national command authority will continue to deter if not intimidate iranâ s leadership from pursuing misadventures in the straits particularly given that the u s has now completely shut down iranian oil exports the situation in venezuela continues to unfold and continues to concern us largely because venezuela supplies oil to india but so far it is too early to judge what might happen there notwithstanding predictions earlier this week that the maduro government would fall a lessening of concerns our concerns in earlier months about the u s possibly sanctioning saudi arabia ksa over the murder of washington post columnist jamal khashoggi have largely dissipated and ksa will be pumping more oil to replace oil prohibited from import from iran dollar denominated debt similarly in earlier months we had concerns that higher rates and a stronger dollar impinge developing nations ability to repay dollar and euro denominated debt they owe to american and european banks while the fed has signaled it will be more dovish we note nevertheless that the dxy cur is at one of its highest point in nearly two years moreover the central bank of chinaâ s attempts at easing are yet to prove they will resuscitate the country s slowing economy and the increasing amount of loans including to struggling small chinese businesses estimated up 7 year on year as of march raises the risk of higher defaults so we continue to be concerned about foreign debt held by china as well as the strength of the overall economy china has 750 billion in usd denominated offshore corporate dollar bonds or â ocdbâ toward the end of last year nomura had warned to monitor the situation and expressed concerns about the bond rollovers could be problematic given the decline of the yuan we have similar concerns but mostly related to a weakening chinese economy with other developing economies particularly india where the usd inr exchange rate had ended 2018 at 1 70 weâ re seeing recovery presumably because the fed has pulled back the inr traded at its lowest point in history in october 1 74 as of today it was 1 69 war tensions with pakistan seem to have flared again overnight over a vote at the un labeling a pakistani a terrorist the move allows india to petition to declare pakistan a terrorist financing nation our earlier fears which had largely been allayed are heightened this morning other macro data note that we have substituted the department of transportation statistic the transportation services index tsi in our model because the data is produced more closely to the monthly jobs report and it has a closer correlation to gdp than the north american transborder freight numbers we had been using for february the tsi printed at 0 1 down from 0 4 last month we continue to be heartened that people are taking home more cash from the tax cut so that debt service will account for a lesser percentage of disposable income data released early last month for 2018 q4 continued to support our thesis we have expected since the tax bill passed that will be offset though by higher gasoline prices to slightly weaken consumer spending we note these other developments since our last jobs report the wholesale trade report for february reported april 17th showed sales up 2 1 year on year and 0 3 month on month inventories were up 6 9 from last year and 0 2 month on month the inventory to sales ratio was 1 35 up from the 1 29 of february of last year building permits for march released april 19th dropped 1 7 from january and were down 7 8 from last year housing starts dropped 0 3 month to month and 14 2 year on year the ism manufacturing report for february released wednesday showed continuing growth at 55 3 up from 54 2 the ism non manufacturing report for april released this morning printed at 55 5 points down from 56 1 in march personal income outlays for march 29 released april 29th personal income is 0 2 in current dollars and chained 2012 dollars were not available march disposable personal income declined by 0 2 in current dollars chained 2012 dollars were not available personal consumption expenditures pce for march were up 09 in current dollars in chained 2012 pce was up 0 7 the ibd tipp economic optimism index released april 9th dropped 2 7 percentage points to 54 2 anything above 50 indicates growth fed normalizing for now we continue to be heartened by the fed moving away from tightening rates too much too quickly while inflation for personal consumption expenditures less food and energy or real pce had hit the fed s target of 2 percent weâ re seeing that slip somewhat in the last couple of months we continue to believe that moves toward normalization should take place more slowly and only after growth had become decidedly more robust over several more quarters at least four quarters of a consistent 3 gdp growth we are only halfway to that goal as of 2018 q4 we would also like to see more stable growth in gross domestic investment with growth in that component of gdp of at least 1 to 1 5 excluding inventory as we have illustrated in our gdp report for 2018 q4 the 2018 q3 and 2018 q2 the better than expected gdp reports for those quarters included a lot of â shiftingâ from and to earlier or later quarters similarly 130 bps of the stunning 2019 q1 gdp figure came from a net export figure that is unlikely to be repeated by some inventory restocking we would like to see steady consistent growth in each of the four categories of gdp growth we have long held the view that trimmed mean pce produced by the dallas fed is a better measure of inflation in the day to day costs of most americans it is currently 1 8 but it has been volatile the 2 â¼ to 2 â½ federal funds rate the fed continued in its may meeting and the stable 2 inflation will likely put a damper on further fed normalizing the yield curve of which we have been gravely concerned in the last several months is now simply dangerously volatile the fed rate hikes which have their greatest effect on short term rates and why we use the 3mo 10yr curve in 2018 were premature and outpaced the economy s growth we started 2018 with a spread of the 3 month 10 year yield curve of nearly 102 bps just half the 200 or so bps that started 2017 as of may 2 the 3 month 10 year yield curve was just 8 bps apart weâ re also seeing repeated yield curve inversions among the shorter term rates as illustrated here 2019 ytd treasury yield curve 3mo to 5yr the 10 year rate is barely able to sustain 2 50 so far in 2019 increasing the likelihood that yield curves will invert we would like to see a minimum of two quarters of at least a 75 bps spread pulling back from the higher 150 bps spread we had cited earlier between the 3 mo and 10 yr yield before the fed even considers another rate increase after what we view was an erroneous increase last year we are simply not seeing any holistic appetite among investors for increased risk as signaled by moving away from treasuries and into â risk onâ assets which would tend to drive rates higher treasury yields are inversely proportional to risk appetite so the lower the treasury rate the more dollars invested there and not in risk on assets even with weakening foreign economies we see an outflow versus an inflow of foreign capital to the u s further heightening our concerns of a â risk offâ u s economy with asia europe and north america all showing evidence of a slowdown or at least early signs of one we think it is vitally important for the finance ministers and central bankers of all three major economies agree a strategy to address what we foresee as a very challenging time later this year for the global economy we remain unperturbed by the trade dispute with china and by the trump tariffs but weâ re not willing to ignore the â herd instinctâ of ignorant investors who buy into the lie that â tariffs cause or worsen depressionsâ milton friedmanâ s estate has a nobel prize that says otherwise weâ re seeing it appears increasing signs his threats of tariffs are bringing china to heel on its mercantilist trade policies that said we would like to see the president engage americaâ s asian and european allies to step up to join a coalition of the willing to challenge china s decades old unfair trade practices and thefts of intellectual property because the one on one dispute could simply trigger mutual retaliation there is more power in american dealings with xi from a multilateral â weâ than a unilateral â usâ weâ re circumspect about the rate of gdp growth reflected in the last three reported quarters we think the 2018 q4 gdp of 2 6 will likely presage just moderate growth for 2019 2019 q1 was an outlier skewed by a strong 1 03 increase in net exports as we explained here our doubts will continue until we see two consecutive quarters of increases in all four categories of gdp i e personal consumption expenditures net exports gross domestic investment and government consumption expenditures for now we re expecting just moderate growth around 2 for most of 2019 barring unforeseen political considerations we expect 2019 q2 to print at 1 9 to 2 4 percent the narrowing yield curve concerns about china and europe the increasing likelihood of a â no dealâ brexit the failed summit in hanoi and iranâ s increasing isolation from the west all give us pause investors who are at or near retirement can up their levels of risk but should do so cautiously until we see additional data we simply donâ t think there is sufficient capital growth prospect for equities to justify a high level of equity risk given risks of a sharper market downturn on a grey or black swan event such as a resumption of north korean nuclear testing iran totally abandoning the jcpoa to further embrace china and russia or further political troubles in the us or europe investment summary in equities weâ re mostly inclined to stand pat with these sectors from our 2019 q1 summary but in less proportion and with some changes as follows outperform consumer discretionaries in the mid to high end retail sector

higher the increases reflect the strong performance of our legacy assets along with contributions from approximately 5 3 billion of growth projects that were placed into service in first quarter 2019 with the demand for our existing assets driving historically high utilization rates and 30 billion of secured growth projects underway approximately 7 billion of which are expected to be completed by the end of the year earnings and cash flow are forecast to continue to rise these projects are supported by regulated or long term contracted business models that are expected to support annual dividend growth of eight to ten per cent through 2021 added girling we have invested 10 billion in these projects to date and are well positioned to fund the remainder of our secured growth program through significant and growing internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets we also continue to progress various portfolio management activities including the announced sale of our coolidge generating station which is expected to close by mid year this will allow us to prudently fund our capital program in a manner that is consistent with achieving targeted leverage metrics including debt to ebitda in the high four times area in 2019 and thereafter and deliver ongoing growth as measured on a per share basis looking ahead we continue to methodically advance more than 20 billion of projects under development including keystone xl and the bruce power life extension program success in progressing these and other growth initiatives that are expected to emanate from our five operating businesses across north america could extend our growth outlook well into the next decade concluded girling highlights all financial figures are unaudited and in canadian dollars unless noted otherwise first quarter 2019 financial results net income attributable to common shares of 1 004 billion or 1 09 per common share comparable earnings of 987 million or 1 07 per common share

permit for keystone xl completed commissioning on white spruce pipeline issued 1 0 billion of 30 year fixed rate medium term notes in april 2019 net income attributable to common shares increased by 270 million or 0 26 per common share to 1 004 billion or 1 09 per share for the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to the same period last year per share results reflect the dilutive impact of common shares issued under our drp in 2018 and 2019 and our corporate atm program in 2018 first quarter 2019 and 2018 results included an after tax loss of 12 million and an after tax gain of 6 million respectively related to our u s northeast power marketing contracts these specific items as well as unrealized gains and losses from changes in risk management activities are excluded from comparable earnings comparable ebitda increased by 320 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to the net effect of the following higher contribution from u s natural gas pipelines mainly due to increased earnings from columbia gas and columbia gulf growth projects placed in service higher contribution from liquids pipelines primarily due to higher volumes on the keystone pipeline system and increased earnings from liquids marketing activities higher contribution from canadian natural gas pipelines mainly due to the recovery of increased depreciation in 2019 as a result of higher rates approved in both the canadian mainline neb 2018 decision and the ngtl 2018 2019 settlement and higher incentive earnings for the canadian mainline lower contribution from power and storage primarily due to the sale of our interests in the cartier wind power facilities in 2018 and costs related to napanee s delayed in service foreign exchange impact of a stronger u s dollar on the canadian dollar equivalent earnings from our u s operations comparable earnings increased by 123 million or 0 09 per common share for the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 and was primarily the net effect of changes in comparable ebitda described above higher depreciation largely in canadian natural gas pipelines which is fully recovered in tolls as reflected in the increase in comparable ebitda described above therefore having no impact on comparable earnings in addition higher depreciation reflects new projects placed in service higher interest expense primarily as a result of long term debt issuances net of maturities and the foreign exchange impact on translation of u s dollar denominated interest higher income tax expense due to higher comparable earnings before income taxes and lower foreign tax rate differentials lower interest income and other due to realized losses in 2019 compared to realized gains in 2018 on derivatives used to manage exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations on u s dollar denominated income higher afudc due to increased capital expenditures for our ngtl system and mexico projects comparable earnings per common share for the three months ended march 31 2019 also reflects the dilutive impact of common shares issued under our drp in 2018 and 2019 and our corporate atm program in 2018 notable recent developments include canadian natural gas pipelines coastal gaslink pipeline project following the october 2018 positive final investment decision fid

gordondale lateral loop and the boundary lake north projects on march 14 2019 we filed the ngtl system rate design and services application with the neb which includes a settlement agreement negotiated between ngtl and members of its tolls tariff facilities and procedures ttfp committee which represents stakeholders the settlement is supported by a majority of members of the ttfp committee the application addresses rate design terms and conditions of service for the ngtl system and a tolling methodology for the north montney mainline given the complexity of the issues raised in the application the neb decided to hold a public hearing application to participate and comments on the application were due april 12 2019 and reply comments were submitted by ngtl on april 18 2019

underlying operations in the period except as otherwise described herein these comparable measures are calculated on a consistent basis from period to period and are adjusted for specific items in each period as applicable our decision not to adjust for a specific item is subjective and made after careful consideration specific items may include certain fair value adjustments relating to risk management activities income tax refunds and adjustments to enacted tax rates gains or losses on sales of assets or assets held for sale legal contractual and bankruptcy settlements impact of regulatory or arbitration decisions relating to prior year earnings restructuring costs impairment of goodwill investments and other assets acquisition and integration costs we exclude the unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of derivatives used to reduce our exposure to certain financial and commodity price risks these derivatives generally provide effective economic hedges but do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting as a result the changes in fair value are recorded in net income as these amounts do not accurately reflect the gains and losses that will be realized

contribution from liquids pipelines primarily due to higher volumes on the keystone pipeline system and increased earnings from liquids marketing activities higher contribution from canadian natural gas pipelines mainly due to the recovery of increased depreciation in 2019 as a result of higher rates approved in both the canadian mainline neb 2018 decision and the ngtl 2018 2019 settlement and higher incentive earnings for the canadian mainline lower contribution from power and storage primarily due to the sale of our interests in the cartier wind power facilities in 2018 and costs related

earnings and cash flows are exposed to currency fluctuations a portion of our businesses generate earnings in u s dollars but since we report our financial results in canadian dollars changes in the value of the u s dollar against the canadian dollar can affect our net income as our u s dollar denominated operations continue to grow this exposure increases a portion of this risk is offset by

financial assurance provisions that may require us to provide collateral if a credit risk related contingent event occurs for example if our credit rating is downgraded to non investment grade we may also need to provide collateral if the fair value of our derivative financial instruments exceeds pre defined exposure limits based on contracts in place and market prices at march 31 2019 the

in the normal course of business if the credit risk related contingent features in these agreements were triggered on march 31 2019 we would have been required to provide collateral of 4 million

have sufficient liquidity in the form of cash and undrawn committed revolving bank lines to meet these contingent obligations should they arise other information controls and procedures management including our president and ceo and our cfo evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as at march 31 2019 as required by the canadian securities regulatory authorities and by the sec and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at a reasonable assurance level there were no changes in first quarter 2019 that had or are likely to have a material impact on our internal control over financial reporting critical accounting estimates and accounting policy changes when we prepare financial statements that conform with u s gaap we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the timing and amounts we record for our assets liabilities revenues and expenses because these items may be affected by future events we base the estimates and assumptions on the most current information available using our best judgement we also regularly assess the assets and liabilities themselves a summary of our critical accounting estimates is included in our 2018 annual report our significant accounting policies have remained unchanged since december 31 2018 other than described below a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in our 2018 annual report changes in accounting policies for 2019 leases in february 2016 the fasb issued new guidance on the accounting for leases the new guidance amends the definition of a lease such that in order for an arrangement to qualify as a lease the lessee is required to have both 1 the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset and 2 the right to direct the use of the asset the new guidance also establishes a right of use rou model that requires a lessee to recognize a rou asset and corresponding lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with a term longer than twelve months leases will be classified as finance or operating with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the consolidated statement of income the new guidance does not make extensive changes to lessor accounting the new guidance was effective january 1 2019 and was applied using optional transition relief which allowed entities to initially apply the new lease standard at adoption january 1 2019 and recognize a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption this transition option allowed us to not apply the new guidance including disclosure requirements to the comparative periods presented we elected available practical expedients and exemptions upon adoption which allowed us not to reassess prior conclusions on existing leases regarding lease identification lease classification and initial direct costs under the new standard to carry forward the historical lease classification and our accounting treatment for land easements on existing agreements to not recognize rou assets or lease liabilities for leases that qualify for the short term lease recognition exemption to not separate lease and non lease components for all leases for which we are the lessee and for facility and liquids tank terminals for which we are the lessor to use hindsight in determining the lease term and assessing rou assets for impairment the new guidance had a significant impact on our condensed consolidated balance sheet but did not have an impact on our condensed consolidated statements of income and cash flows the most significant impact was the recognition of rou assets and lease liabilities for operating leases and providing significant new disclosures about our leasing activities refer to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information related to the impact of adopting the new guidance and our updated accounting policies related to leases in the application of the new guidance significant assumptions and judgments are used to determine the following whether a contract contains a lease the duration of the lease term including exercising lease renewal options the lease term for all of our leases includes the noncancellable period of the lease plus any additional periods covered by either our option to extend or not to terminate the lease that we are reasonably certain to exercise or an option to extend or not to terminate the lease controlled by the lessor the discount rate for the lease fair value measurement in august 2018 the fasb issued new guidance that amends certain disclosure requirements for fair value measurements this new guidance is effective january 1 2020 however early adoption of certain or all requirements is permitted we elected to adopt this guidance effective first quarter 2019 the guidance was applied retrospectively and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements future accounting changes measurement of credit losses on financial instruments in june 2016 the fasb issued new guidance that significantly changes how entities measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other financial instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income the new guidance amends the impairment model of financial instruments basing it on expected losses rather than incurred losses these expected credit losses will be recognized as an allowance rather than as a direct write down of the amortized cost basis the new guidance is effective january 1 2020 and will be applied using a modified retrospective approach we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance and have not yet determined the effect on our consolidated financial statements defined benefit plans in august 2018 the fasb issued new guidance which amends and clarifies disclosure requirements related to defined benefit pension and other post retirement benefit plans this new guidance is effective january 1 2021 and will be applied on a retrospective basis however early adoption is permitted we are currently evaluating the timing and impact of the adoption of this guidance and have not yet determined the effect on our consolidated financial statements implementation costs of cloud computing arrangements in august 2018 the fasb issued new guidance requiring an entity in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract to follow the guidance for internal use software to determine which implementation costs should be capitalized as an asset and which costs should be expensed the guidance also requires the entity to amortize the capitalized implementation costs of a hosting arrangement over the term of the arrangement this guidance is effective january 1 2020 however early adoption is permitted this guidance can be applied either retrospectively or prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption we are currently evaluating the timing and impact of adoption of this guidance and have not yet determined the effect on our consolidated financial statements consolidation in october 2018 the fasb issued new guidance for determining whether fees paid to decision makers and service providers are variable interests for indirect interests held through related parties under common control this new guidance is effective january 1 2020 and will be applied on a retrospective basis however early adoption is permitted we are currently evaluating the timing and impact of the adoption of this guidance and have not yet determined the effect on

billion or 1 09 per share compared to net income of 734 million or 0 83 per share for the same period in 2018 comparable earnings for first quarter 2019 were 987 million or 1 07 per common share compared to 864 million or 0 98 per common share for the same period in 2018 transcanada s board of directors also declared a quarterly dividend of 0 75 per common share for the quarter ending june 30 2019 equivalent to 3 00 per common share on an annualized basis we are very pleased with the performance of our diversified and irreplaceable portfolio of high quality long life energy infrastructure assets which continued to produce record financial results through the first quarter of 2019 said russ girling transcanada s president and chief executive officer comparable earnings per share increased nine per cent compared to the same period last year while comparable funds generated from operations of 1 8 billion were eleven per cent higher the increases reflect the strong performance of our legacy assets along with contributions from approximately 5 3 billion of growth projects that were placed into service in first quarter 2019 with the demand for our existing assets driving historically high utilization rates and 30 billion of secured growth projects underway approximately 7 billion of which are expected to be completed by the end of the year earnings and cash flow are forecast to continue to rise these projects are supported by regulated or long term contracted business models that are expected to support annual dividend growth of eight to ten per cent through 2021 added girling we have invested 10 billion in these projects to date and are well positioned to fund the remainder of our secured growth program through significant and growing internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets we also continue to progress various portfolio management activities including the announced sale of our coolidge generating station which is expected to close by mid year this will allow us to prudently fund our capital program in a manner that is consistent with achieving targeted leverage metrics including debt to ebitda in the high four times area in 2019 and thereafter and deliver ongoing growth as measured on a per share basis looking ahead we continue to methodically advance more than 20 billion of projects under development including keystone xl and the bruce power life extension program success in progressing these and other growth initiatives that are expected to emanate from our five operating businesses across north america could extend our growth outlook well into the next decade concluded girling highlights all financial figures are unaudited and in canadian dollars unless noted otherwise first quarter 2019 financial results net income attributable to common shares of 1 004 billion or 1 09 per common share comparable earnings of 987 million or 1 07 per common share comparable earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization of 2 4 billion net cash provided by operations of 1 9 billion comparable funds generated from operations of 1 8 billion comparable distributable cash flow of 1 6 billion or 1 76 per common share declared a quarterly dividend of 0 75 per common share for the quarter ending june 30 2019 placed approximately 5 3 billion of projects in service including mountaineer xpress gulf xpress and certain ngtl system expansions continued pre construction activities on coastal gaslink pipeline project received new presidential permit for keystone xl completed commissioning on white spruce pipeline issued 1 0 billion of 30 year fixed rate medium term notes in april 2019 net income attributable to common shares increased by 270 million or 0 26 per common share to 1 004 billion or 1 09 per share for the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to the same period last year per share results reflect the dilutive impact of common shares issued under our drp in 2018 and 2019 and our corporate atm program in 2018 first quarter 2019 and 2018 results included an after tax loss of 12 million and an after tax gain of 6 million respectively related to our u s northeast power marketing contracts these specific items as well as unrealized gains and losses from changes in risk management activities are excluded from comparable earnings comparable ebitda increased by 320 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to the net effect of the following higher contribution from u s natural gas pipelines mainly due to increased earnings from columbia gas and columbia gulf growth projects placed in service higher contribution from liquids pipelines primarily due to higher volumes on the keystone pipeline system and increased earnings from liquids marketing activities higher contribution from canadian natural gas pipelines mainly due to the recovery of increased depreciation in 2019 as a result of higher rates approved in both the canadian mainline neb 2018 decision and the ngtl 2018 2019 settlement and higher incentive earnings for the canadian mainline lower contribution from power and storage primarily due to the sale of our interests in the cartier wind power facilities in 2018 and costs related to napanee s delayed in service foreign exchange impact of a stronger u s dollar on the canadian dollar equivalent earnings from our u s operations comparable earnings increased by 123 million or 0 09 per common share for the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 and was primarily the net effect of changes in comparable ebitda described above higher depreciation largely in canadian natural gas pipelines which is fully recovered in tolls as reflected in the increase in comparable ebitda described above therefore having no impact on comparable earnings in addition higher depreciation reflects new projects placed in service higher interest expense primarily as a result of long term debt issuances net of maturities and the foreign exchange impact on translation of u s dollar denominated interest higher income tax expense due to higher comparable earnings before income taxes and lower foreign tax rate differentials lower interest income and other due to realized losses in 2019 compared to realized gains in 2018 on derivatives used to manage exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations on u s dollar denominated income higher afudc due to increased capital expenditures for our ngtl system and mexico projects comparable earnings per common share for the three months ended march 31 2019 also reflects the dilutive impact of common shares issued under our drp in 2018 and 2019 and our corporate atm program in 2018 notable recent developments include canadian natural gas pipelines coastal gaslink pipeline project following the october 2018 positive final investment decision fid by lng canada pre construction activities continue at many locations

we filed the ngtl system rate design and services application with the neb which includes a settlement agreement negotiated between ngtl and members of its tolls tariff facilities and procedures ttfp committee which represents stakeholders the settlement is supported by a majority of members of the ttfp committee the application addresses rate design terms and conditions of service for the ngtl system and a tolling methodology for the north montney mainline given the complexity of the issues raised in the application the neb decided to hold a public hearing application to participate and comments on the application were due april 12 2019 and reply comments were submitted by ngtl on april 18 2019 u s natural gas pipelines mountaineer xpress and gulf xpress the mountaineer xpress

comparable earnings per common share funds generated from operations comparable funds generated from operations comparable distributable cash flow comparable distributable cash flow per common share these measures do not have any standardized meaning as prescribed by gaap and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities comparable measures we calculate comparable measures by adjusting certain gaap measures for specific items we believe are significant but not reflective of our underlying operations in the period except as otherwise described herein these comparable measures are calculated on a consistent basis from period to period and are adjusted for specific items in each period as applicable our decision not to adjust for a specific item is subjective and made after careful consideration specific items may include certain fair value adjustments relating to risk management activities income tax refunds and adjustments to enacted tax rates gains or losses on sales of assets or assets held for sale legal contractual and bankruptcy settlements impact of regulatory or arbitration decisions relating to prior year earnings restructuring costs impairment of goodwill investments and other assets acquisition and integration costs we exclude the unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of derivatives used to reduce our exposure to certain financial and commodity price risks these derivatives generally provide effective economic hedges but do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting as a result the changes in fair value are recorded in net income as these amounts do not accurately reflect the gains and losses that will be realized at settlement we do not consider them reflective of our underlying operations the

supported committed projects that are either under construction or are in or preparing to commence the permitting stage but are not yet fully approved an additional 21 5 billion of projects under development are commercially supported except where noted but have greater uncertainty with respect to timing and estimated project costs and are subject to certain approvals during first quarter 2019 we placed approximately 5 3 billion of projects in service including mountaineer xpress gulf xpress and certain ngtl system expansions three years of maintenance capital expenditures for our

utilize short term and long term debt to finance our operations which exposes us to interest rate risk we typically pay fixed rates of interest on our long term debt and floating rates on our commercial paper programs and amounts drawn on our credit facilities a small portion of our long term debt is at floating interest rates in addition we are exposed to interest rate risk on financial instruments and contractual obligations containing variable interest rate components we manage our interest rate risk using a combination of interest rate swaps and option derivatives foreign exchange risk we generate revenues and incur expenses that are denominated in currencies other than canadian dollars as a result our earnings and cash flows are exposed to currency fluctuations a portion of our businesses generate earnings in u s dollars but since we report our financial results in canadian dollars changes in the value of the u s dollar against the canadian dollar can affect our net income as our u s dollar denominated operations continue to grow this exposure increases a portion of this risk is offset by interest expense on u s dollar denominated debt the balance of the exposure

commodity prices interest rates and foreign exchange rates derivative instruments including those that qualify and are designated for hedge accounting treatment are recorded at fair value the majority

effectiveness testing credit risk related contingent features of derivative instruments derivatives often contain financial assurance provisions that may require us to provide collateral if a credit risk related contingent event occurs for example if our credit rating is downgraded to non investment grade we may also need to provide collateral if the fair value of our derivative financial instruments exceeds pre defined exposure limits based on contracts in place and market prices at march 31 2019 the aggregate fair value of all derivative contracts with credit risk related contingent features that were in a net liability position was 4 million december 31 2018 6 million with no collateral provided in the normal course of business if the credit risk related contingent features in these agreements were triggered on march 31 2019 we would have been required to provide collateral of 4 million december 31 2018 6 million to our counterparties collateral may also need to be provided should the fair value of derivative instruments exceed pre defined contractual exposure limit thresholds we have sufficient liquidity in the form of cash and undrawn committed revolving bank lines to meet these contingent obligations should they arise other information controls and procedures management including our president and ceo and our cfo evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as at march 31 2019 as required by the canadian securities regulatory authorities and by the sec and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at a reasonable assurance level there were no changes in first quarter 2019 that had or are likely to have a material impact on our internal control over financial reporting critical accounting estimates and accounting policy changes when we prepare financial statements that conform with u s gaap we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the timing and amounts we record for our assets liabilities revenues and expenses because these items may be affected by future events we base the estimates and assumptions on the most current information available using our best judgement we also regularly assess the assets and liabilities themselves a summary of our critical accounting estimates is included in our 2018 annual report our significant accounting policies have remained unchanged since december 31 2018 other than described below a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in our 2018 annual report changes in accounting policies for 2019 leases in february 2016 the fasb issued new guidance on the accounting for leases the new guidance amends the definition of a lease such that in order for an arrangement to qualify as a lease the lessee is required to have both 1 the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset and 2 the right to direct the use of the asset the new guidance also establishes a right of use rou model that requires a lessee to recognize a rou asset and corresponding lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with a term longer than twelve months leases will be classified as finance or operating with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the consolidated statement of income the new guidance does not make extensive changes to lessor accounting the new guidance was effective january 1 2019 and was applied using optional transition relief which allowed entities to initially apply the new lease standard at adoption january 1 2019 and recognize a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption this transition option allowed us to not apply the new guidance including disclosure requirements to the comparative periods presented we elected available practical expedients and exemptions upon adoption which allowed us not to reassess prior conclusions on existing leases regarding lease identification lease classification and initial direct costs under the new standard to carry forward the historical lease classification and our accounting treatment for land easements on existing agreements to not recognize rou assets or lease liabilities for leases that qualify for the short term lease recognition exemption to not separate lease and non lease components for all leases for which we are the lessee and for facility and liquids tank terminals for which we are the lessor to use hindsight in determining the lease term and assessing rou assets for impairment the new guidance had a significant impact on our condensed consolidated balance sheet but did not have an impact on our condensed consolidated statements of income and cash flows the most significant impact was the recognition of rou assets and lease liabilities for operating leases and providing significant new disclosures about our leasing activities refer to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information related to the impact of adopting the new guidance and our updated accounting policies related to leases in the application of the new guidance significant assumptions and judgments are used to determine the following whether a contract contains a lease the duration of the lease term including exercising lease renewal options the lease term for all of our leases includes the noncancellable period of the lease plus any additional periods covered by either our option to extend or not to terminate the lease that we are reasonably certain to exercise or an option to extend or not to terminate the lease controlled by the lessor the discount rate for the lease fair value measurement in august 2018 the fasb issued new guidance that amends certain disclosure requirements for fair value measurements this new guidance is effective january 1 2020 however early adoption of certain or all requirements is permitted we elected to adopt this guidance effective first quarter 2019 the guidance was applied retrospectively and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements future accounting changes measurement of credit losses on financial instruments in june 2016 the fasb issued new guidance that significantly changes how entities measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other financial instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income the new guidance amends the impairment model of financial instruments basing it on expected losses rather than incurred losses these expected credit losses will be recognized as an allowance rather than as a direct write down of the amortized cost basis the new guidance is effective january 1 2020 and will be applied using a modified retrospective approach we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance and have not yet determined the effect on our consolidated financial statements defined benefit plans in august 2018 the fasb issued new guidance which amends and clarifies disclosure requirements related to defined benefit pension and other post retirement benefit plans this new guidance is effective january 1 2021 and will be applied on a retrospective basis however early adoption is permitted we are currently evaluating the timing and impact of the adoption of this guidance and have not yet determined the effect on our consolidated financial statements implementation costs of cloud computing arrangements in august 2018 the fasb issued new guidance requiring an entity in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract to follow the guidance for internal use software to determine which implementation costs should be capitalized as an asset and which costs should be expensed the guidance also requires the entity to amortize the capitalized implementation costs of a hosting arrangement over the term of the arrangement this guidance is effective january 1 2020 however early adoption is permitted this guidance can be applied either retrospectively or prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption we are currently evaluating the timing and impact of adoption of this guidance and have not yet determined the effect on our consolidated financial statements consolidation in october 2018 the fasb issued new guidance for determining whether fees paid to decision makers and service providers are variable interests for indirect interests held through related parties under common control this new guidance is effective january 1 2020 and will be applied on a retrospective basis however early adoption is permitted we are currently evaluating the timing and impact of the adoption of this guidance and have not yet determined the effect on our consolidated financial statements quarterly resu
my recent letters described what i think the future will look like i hasten to add it isn t what i think the future should look like or what i want to see almost the entire developed world has painted itself into a corner it won t necessarily be terrible i don t expect another great depression or economic upheaval but we will have to adapt our portfolios and lifestyles to this new reality the good news is the changes will happen relatively slowly we have time to adapt in war movies it s common for the dashing leader to make bold promises like we will never retreat ahead of a glorious victory the assumption is that retreat is bad but real life military strategists say retreat can be the right move when the odds are against you better to save your ammunition for another time better yet adopt a new strategy that gives you a better chance my last few letters may look like retreat but i m just recognizing reality there is no plausible path to stopping the world s debt overload much less paying it off without a serious and painful purge if you know of such a path please share it with me but i haven t seen one so i foresee a tough decade ahead summing up entitlement spending interest on the debt defense spending and so forth will continue to produce trillion dollar plus deficits no constituency is arguing to reform the entitlement system by reducing benefits by the middle of the next decade deficits will be in the 1 5 trillion range even under the cbo s optimistic assumptions while the numbers look marginally different elsewhere the developed countries are all going the same direction toward higher deficits following the next recession and there is always one coming the us deficit will be well north of 2 trillion and the total debt will quickly rise to 30 trillion it will almost certainly be in the 40 trillion range before 2030 unless interest rates drop significantly simply paying the interest will consume much of the tax revenue fortunately i expect interest rates to drop significantly think japan a growing body of academic literature and real world experience suggests there is a point beyond which debt becomes a drag on growth that means that the recovery after the next recession will be even slower than the last one if as i expect the federal reserve and other central banks react with massive quantitative easing it is entirely possible that the whole developed world will begin to look like japan slow nominal gdp growth low interest rates that penalize savers low inflation or even deflation etc in such an environment normal equity index funds won t produce the returns many have grown to expect public pension funds will get hammered in the bear market and many will have difficulty meeting their obligations governments will be forced to either cut benefits raise taxes or both that is not going to make for a happy citizenry it will play out in different manners all across the world but the resulting frustration will be the same and to put it very bluntly frustration is inadequate to describe the result of underfunded pensions retirees made plans for their futures based upon receiving those pensions and taxpayers likewise make plans all of this will have significant investment implications which we will visit below and in great detail in the coming weeks and months but japanification to use a word is going to make income and wealth inequality worse not better this all being the case the priority now isn t whether to retreat in the sense of changing your investment strategies but how and to where so you can pick up the fight later developing a strategy requires us to understand exactly what is happening and why so i m looking at the situation from different angles you have likely heard of income inequality that wealthy people are making a larger share of our collective income in one sense it s nothing new of course the people with the highest incomes have more of the total math guarantees it but it is true that the top s share has grown in recent decades as has the share of assets owned by the wealthiest ray dalio of bridgewater associates has been writing about this for a few years now here s a chart and quote from his latest article as shown below the income gap is about as high as ever and the wealth gap is the highest since the late 1930s today the wealth of the top 1 of the population is more than that of the bottom 90 of the population combined which is the same sort of wealth gap that existed during the 1935 40 period a period that brought in an era of great internal and external conflicts for most countries those in the top 40 now have on average more than 10 times as much wealth as those in the bottom 60 that is up from six times in 1980 source ray dalio dalio thinks it is significant that inequality at least by these measures is now in the same area it was in the great depression it plunged in the postwar years and began rising again in the 1980s i suspect if we had data going back a few centuries we would see that those 30 or so years between 1950 and 1980 were actually the statistical aberration mass prosperity hasn t been the historic norm it certainly wasn t that in the 1800s and the gilded age nor was it so in europe some people see this inequality as somehow unfair i think it is more complex than that it depends on how those with wealth became so there s a big difference between a despots who use political authority to enrich themselves and their friends b monopolists who thrive by taking choice away from consumers instead of adding to it and c entrepreneurs who grow wealthy by selling useful products to willing consumers incidentally dalio does a good job describing the problem but i think he lays the blame at the wrong doorstep his proposed solutions leave a lot to be desired i will discuss this at length in a forthcoming letter the problems begin when people perceive the wealthy are getting rich at the expense of others and it s hard to escape that conclusion when the data say the top tier is keeping a bigger share of the pie even if the pie is growing especially when your piece of the pie is not growing nearly as fast as those of the top the relative distance becomes even more stark let s review some charts from my friend bruce mehlman s latest fascinating slide deck he has much more that you can and definitely should view here source bruce mehlman if you take gdp as a proxy for national income it s been growing far faster than median family income even adjusted for inflation the wider that gap gets the more people feel like they are being left behind here s another one comparing stock market growth with family net worth this isn t really surprising since we know the top quintile owns most of the stocks the lower 80 see little direct benefit but the magnitude of the disparity is still remarkable source bruce mehlman like what you re reading get this free newsletter in your inbox every saturday read our privacy policy here first name this is required email this is required subscribe for free recaptcha one reason income may be unequal is that talent is increasingly unequal too or at least the willingness of businesses to buy talent here s a chart showing the most valuable companies have been getting that way with a smaller headcount source bruce mehlman mehlman cites technology as the explanation for this and i agree that s a significant part of it but so are other things like the increasing number of sectors where a small number of companies whose existence is enabled by financial engineering and monetary policy dominate their respective markets my good friend ben hunt of epsilon theory notes that the s p 500 companies have the highest earnings relative to sales in history source ben hunt quoting ben this is a 30 year chart of total s p 500 earnings divided by total s p 500 sales it s how many pennies of earnings s p 500 companies get from a dollar of sales earnings margin essentially at a high level of aggregation so at the lows of 1991 1 in sales generated a bit more than 0 03 in earnings for the s p 500 today in 2019 we are at an all time high of a bit more than 0 11 in earnings from 1 in sales it s a marvelously steady progression up and to the right temporarily marred by a recession here and there but really quite awe inspiring in its consistency yay capitalism ben goes on to say many people think that is because of technology he argues it is the financialization of our economy and the fed s loose policies i agree 100 if you think they haven t changed the rules since the 1980s and 1990s you aren t paying attention boys and girls work saving technology isn t bad in the past it freed our bodies from dangerous exhausting toil and now it s freeing our minds from mental drudgery we can adjust the problem is that it is hitting us so fast farming went from manual labor to automation over several generations now we re traveling an equal distance in only a few years resulting in millions of unemployed humans as unhappy as all this is making people now imagine how it will be when recession hits and then couple that with an ever increasing explosion of new technologies that reduce demand for many types of labor like automated driving some degree of unhappiness and discontent is part of the human condition it s what drives us to improve our lives we accept challenges as long as we think we have a fair chance at overcoming them many americans no longer believe they have that chance that s partly because they have higher expectations possibly too high but right or wrong the perception is there it affects behavior and more to the point it affects what people expect from the government when they perceive less ability to reach the next level on their own they look to washington for help i noted last week that almost no one really wants to cut government spending even the so called fiscal conservatives mostly nibble around the edges reducing budget growth here and there bill clinton was wrong when he said the era of big government is over in 1996 it s bigger than ever and growing faster than ever whether you like it or not that is a fact government revenue is not growing faster than ever which means rising debt even in today s relative prosperity again whether you like this or not is irrelevant it s happening i see no way out raising taxes on the wealthy won t get us even close to a balanced budget even at confiscatory levels raising taxes on the middle class won t happen in a recession the only tax system with a shot at actually paying for current spending even without adding the new programs some democrats want is a vat or value added tax and it is anathema in both parties no matter how i look at this i keep coming back to gigantic deficits that the federal reserve will have to monetize in some fashion probably something like the previous qe rounds but on a vastly larger scale and thus my belief it will launch an era of japan like deflation and economic doldrums if you think this is impossible or i m being too pessimistic please please tell me why i m wrong show me where we can get the necessary tax revenue without severely impacting the economy show me how we can cut benefits without getting massive pushback from politicians and please show me how we get off the path we are on and tell me what scenario you think is more plausible i don t see one i really don t you probably read my letters because they help inform your investing strategy if so then let me say this loud and clear your strategy probably needs to change the methods that worked well recently won t cut it in the new era i think we will enter soon at the risk of repeating myself for the 20th time bear markets like last december that are not accompanied by recessions have v shaped recoveries bear markets that happen in the context of a recession have long recoveries the next one because of the massive debt that will be increasing at an astounding rate is likely to see an even slower recovery like what you re reading get this free newsletter in your inbox every saturday read our privacy policy here first name this is required email this is required subscribe for free recaptcha friends don t let friends buy and hold at a minimum you need some type of hedging program on your equity portfolios using a simple 200 day moving average to signal the time for going to cash while not the best will help protect you from the worst of a massive bear market the recent flurry of ipo filings by unicorn companies like wework ought to be ringing alarm bells the venture capital investors who financed these businesses thus far are ready to exit they re doing so because they think the risk reward equation is as favorable as it will ever be possibly they re wrong but i don t think so we have reached the distribution stage when insiders and professional investors become net sellers while the small investors who missed most of the bull market finally jump in history says it won t end well for the latter group as the economy weakens into recession and public markets retreat i think we ll see two strategic trends first active management will return to prominence as investors realize prices can move in both directions the rias mutual funds managers and hedge funds that have managed to hold on through the lean years and many didn t will draw assets once again that doesn t mean they will succeed performance wise but they ll get a chance to try second and possibly more important the best opportunities will leave the public markets entirely we already see this unfolding as the number of listed companies declines mainly at the expense of small caps there is just no reason for most successful companies to accept the hassles and expense of an exchange listing they can raise all the capital they need from that small number of investors in whom most of the wealth is now concentrated this will unfortunately aggravate the inequality frustrations our regulatory structure keeps most private investments off limits to the average investor or even above average net worth investors so even if you manage to accumulate some capital you may not have the much better options for investing it than those with a few million dollars and more the government has rigged the markets against small investors in the name of protecting them that doesn t mean investment success will be impossible you ll have opportunities but you may have to hunt for them and act quickly when you find them that s what active managers do and not just in stocks and bonds i foresee many opportunities in real estate as well there are going to be amazing opportunities in new technologies like smart generals sometimes we have to retreat from the unwinnable battle and develop a different plan that s what i am doing we ll go deeper into this subject at my conference in dallas which is now less than two weeks away i can t wait you can hear and or see most of it with a virtual pass i truly don t know of a better educational opportunity for investors than either directly attending the strategic investment conference or getting your virtual pass please note that for people like me who prefer to learn by reading and not listening all of the speeches will be transcribed for the virtual pass and attendees automatically get them the conference is may 13 16 and there are usually a few spots that open from people having to cancel at the last minute if you can make it you probably should i look forward to seeing you there shane and i will head for dallas next wednesday taking care of some local business and meeting friends and hopefully getting to watch the new avengers movie and then turn our complete focus to the conference surprisingly my travel calendar after that is fairly sparse for the early summer with a few potential spots here and there i was in washington dc this week where i did a video interview with my friend neil howe we discussed a wide variety of subjects including what the last half of the fourth turning will look like he foresees a great deal of political angst there is the real potential for the same kind of political stresses that gave us franklin roosevelt almost 90 years ago for some of you that is a scary thought and others will say about time i then had the privilege of spending some time with good friend newt gingrich and some of his staff we drove to a bookstore in virginia for a book signing and then he took two of us to a hole in the wall italian restaurant near his home he quizzed me for some time on my view of the economy and its interplay with society and in return i got to ask a few questions as well newt has some of the best stories as does neil howe i have been with them together and it is a priceless moment just for the record i also met with those of a different political and economic philosophy i do so all the time one of the greatest investment risks is a lack of imagination in that we can t imagine what could actually go wrong with our main investment thesis as mark twain supposedly said it ain t what you don t know that gets you into trouble it s what you know for sure that just ain t so michael lewis s book the big short opens with this similar quote from leo tolstoy the most difficult subjects can be explained to the most slow witted man if he has not formed any idea of them already but the simplest thing cannot be made clear to the most intelligent man if he is firmly persuaded that he knows already without a shadow of a doubt what is laid before him i spend a great deal of time trying to determine if what i already know for a fact is actually the case that is especially true when i m developing a new thesis that makes me uncomfortable but if the facts change what else can we do but evolve with them and on that note let me wish you a great week find a friend or two and swap a few stories it will make your life

s presentation appendix now i m pleased to turn the call over to jim zallie jim zallie president and chief executive officer advertisement advertisement thanks heather and welcome to everyone joining us today let me start with a brief recap of our first quarter performance and recognize two issues which as expected continue to impact year over year results global foreign exchange negatively impacted our net sales by approximately 100 million and our earnings per share by 0 19 a share second north america continues to face a challenging raw material market and we lap higher co product values in the year ago period our volumes were down 2 driven by the planned shed of high fructose corn syrup and industrial starch from our stockton wet mill closure and weaker volumes in south america partially offset by specialty growth these and other factors combined with lowered total company operating income by 17 operating income in north america was impacted by higher inventory and production costs higher net corn costs and a modest impact from the extreme weather in the u s and canada across our other regions we continue to experience effects of foreign currency devaluations as well as higher net corn costs in response we re taking a series of actions we are also accelerating our 125 million cost mark savings program which is expected to exceed our 2019 year end cumulative run rate savings target of 24 million to 34 million moving to our growth platforms we are excited to have acquired the western polymer business which strengthens our higher value specialty potato starch texturizer portfolio and provides expanded capacity for future growth furthermore we continue to make progress on our previously announced 200 million of strategic investments in sugar reduction and plant based proteins we are on schedule to produce allulose a rare low calorie sugar by the end of this year at our state of the art facility in san juan del río mexico we anticipate sales starting in early 2020 advertisement advertisement we are excited about the fda s recent initial guidance that allulose will not need to be declared as an added sugar on the label of u s food products which now follows its approved labeling in mexico allulose will be a great complement to our existing portfolio of specialty sweeteners moving on to our plant based protein growth platform we expect to be operational at our sal sioux city nebraska plant to produce pea protein isolates by the end of this year our joint venture with verdient for a range of pulse based flowers is progressing as planned we expect to commercialize verdient products in pet food applications the in the near term and to expand sales into other consumer food products during the second half of the year we are also excited by our recently announced investment in and distribution agreement with clara foods a san francisco based biotech start up with breakthrough technology to produce high value animal free proteins traditionally found in eggs now moving to north america as we indicated in our fourth quarter call we expected north america to be lower in the first half versus the second half with a contributing factor being the layout of corn costs we also experienced extreme weather which impacted our make and sort of move costs across both our sweetener and starch network additionally we carried in higher inventory costs related to our ongoing efforts to optimize our starch network operating income in north america was 125 million down 13 from last year net sales were down given our planned stockton high fructose corn syrup and industrial starch shed specialty and mexico volume increases partially offset lower u s volumes in south america net sales were down for the quarter due to significant foreign currency devaluations and to lower volumes operating income was 18 million down 31 from the year ago period driven by forex impacts partially offset by pricing and cost improvements advertisement advertisement we are experiencing lower volumes related to the economic recession in argentina along with negative foreign exchange impacts given the continued devaluation of the peso given the severity of the situation we are exploring every measure to improve argentina s business performance in brazil we also experienced the weaker co product returns and we remain cautious about the prospects for a near term economic recovery our andean region continues to demonstrate net sales volume growth led by strong specialty growth in asia pacific net sales were flat foreign currency devaluations and higher regional corn costs were offset by price mix increases across the region as expected our specialty tapioca franchise has rebounded nicely after managing through a challenging crop shortfall in 2018 the pricing actions we took along with the recent reduction in tapioca costs has helped us recover margin in this strategically important product family the region delivered 20 million of operating income down 13 versus the prior year due primarily to a lag in pricing pass through of higher corn costs currency devaluations in both pakistan and europe impacted the emea region which experienced a 3 decline in net sales partially offsetting this was the growth in specialty volumes in europe and core ingredients in pakistan our pakistan team continues to pass through the impact of foreign exchange and higher corn costs operating income was 24 million down 23 driven by foreign exchange impacts and higher corn costs partially offset by favorable price mix now let me hand it off to jim gray who will discuss our financial performance in more detail advertisement advertisement jim gray executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks jim net sales of 1 4 billion were down for the quarter gross profit margin was lower by 180 basis points driven by fx devaluations and higher raw material and production costs across the regions reported and adjusted operating incomes were 161 million and 166 million respectively reported operating income was lower than the adjusted operating income by 5 million the difference was due to 4 million of restructuring charges associated with our cost smart initiatives and 1 million associated with the acquisition and integration of the western polymer business our reported and adjusted earnings per share were 1 48 and 1 54 respectively q1 net sales of 1 4 billion were down 49 million for the same quarter last year unfavorable fx of 95 million was primarily then attributable to currency devaluations in argentina brazil pakistan asia pacific and europe lower volumes accounted for 27 million of the sales decrease while favorable price mix was a 73 million increase and in north america volume was down year over year driven by planned volume shed as we ceased wet milling at our stockton facility price mix in north america was up advertisement advertisement in south america foreign exchange devaluation was the largest driver of the year over year net sales decline volume was down 6 due to the impacts of the recession on beverage sales in argentina in weaker dextrose sales in brazil price mix was up 19 as our teams took price increases to pass through a higher raw material cost and recapture some of the foreign exchange impact in argentina and brazil asia pacific had flat net sales as foreign exchange devaluations and lower core volume growth were offset by higher price mix due to corn pricing and fx pass throughs emea had lower net sales due to foreign exchange impacts across the region that were only partially offset by volume growth and price mix for the quarter reported and adjusted operating income decreased 36 million and 34 million respectively north america operating income decreased 18 million due to higher inventory and production costs higher net corn costs and a modest impact from extreme weather in u s and canada south america operating income was down 8 million driven by the impacts of currency devaluation in argentina and brazil in lower volumes in argentina and brazil versus the year ago period asia pacific was down 3 million driven primarily by higher regional corn costs and foreign exchange impacts emea was down 7 million due to the impacts of unfavorable foreign exchange and the higher costs across the region offset partially by favorable specialty volume growth corporate costs were lower by 2 million for the quarter we ll wrap up the discussion of the quarter with earnings per share on the left side of the page you can see the reconciliation from the reported to adjusted on the right side operationally we saw a decrease of 0 36 per share unfavorable foreign exchange was 0 19 per share while margin was a decline of 0 14 per share attributable to lower operating income across the regions advertisement advertisement other income was minus 0 03 a share due to a onetime true up in mexico for social security contributions moving to our nonoperational items we saw a decrease of 0 04 per share for the quarter largely driven by unfavorable tax and higher financing costs partially offset by lower average shares outstanding financing costs were 0 06 per share decrease driven by a higher debt balance and higher interest rates as compared to the year ago period higher adjusted taxes contributed to a 0 10 per share decrease primarily driven by lapping tax benefits from share based payment awards in the prior year shares outstanding contributed a benefit of 0 13 a share first quarter 2019 cash provided by operations was 18 million lower than last year as a result of timing and working capital and lower net income given the increase in short term lending rates versus the prior year it was more cost effective to fund accounts receivable balances rather than access supplier financing programs additionally inventories are higher given the timing of corn purchases in pakistan and mexico capital expenditures of 80 million were 15 million lower year over year driven by lapping prior year s higher investments of our specialties growth platforms finally as jim mentioned earlier we completed the acquisition of western polymer in the quarter for an investment of 41 million turning to our outlook we anticipate 2019 adjusted earnings per share in the range of 6 80 to 7 20 we are lowering the top end of our adjusted eps guidance range to reflect an anticipated deeper and more prolonged recession in argentina continued higher than historical north america production costs as we continue to optimize our starch network and an anticipated incremental fx impacts in emea and asia pac our guidance excludes acquisition related integration and restructuring costs as well as any potential impairment costs we are expecting adjusted operating income to be flat to slightly down for the year we anticipate that the impact of foreign exchange will be negative for 2019 we expect the significant negative currency impact of 30 million to 35 million during the first half of the year relative to prior year advertisement advertisement for the full year we expect a negative currency impact to eps of 0 40 to 0 45 we expect operating expenses including corporate expenses to be up over a year as we invest in global business process optimization innovation and digital investments to drive both cost savings and an improved customer experience we expect financing costs for the year to be in the range of 82 million to 87 million due to higher interest rates on our floating rate debt and a higher debt balance our adjusted effective annual tax rate is expected to be between 26 5 and 27 5 we anticipate a slightly higher tax rate as we have taken into consideration our expected mix of south america operating income we expect total diluted weighted average shares of outstanding to be in the range of 68 million to 69 million for the year considering the impact of the accelerated share repurchase agreement lastly we have accelerated our cost smart program to identify additional ways to organize people and processes to drive structural savings we anticipate exceeding our cumulative cost smart run rate savings of 24 million to 34 million by the end of 2019 and against an anticipated inflation of 2 5 to 3 in north america we expect net sales and volume to be down for the full year we expect operating income to be flat to slightly down we expect the first half down significantly due to the lapping of higher co product values in the first half of 2018 and continued starch network optimization efforts and the second half is expected to be up as we lap onetime manufacturing cost impacts from 2018 south america net sales are expected to be flat to up modestly versus the prior year volumes are expected to be up modestly given the magnitude of fx devaluations as well as the effects of the argentine recession during the first quarter we expect operating income to be in a similar range to prior year we remain watchful of economic reforms inflation in the impact of the upcoming election in argentina we continue to focus on cost discipline and business performance improvement asia pacific net sales are expected to be up and operating income is expected to be flat to up modestly we expect weaker operating income in the first half and as stronger second half in emea we expect net sales to be up we anticipate strong specialties performance in europe and core growth in pakistan although we expect flat to modest operating income growth we anticipate a weaker first half versus the second half due to currency impacts throughout the region raw material cost overlaps in pakistan and a prolonged brexit in 2019 we expect cash from operations to be in the range of 630 million to 680 million we expect to invest between 330 million and 360 million in capital expenditures around the world to support growth as well as cost and process improvements importantly we remain committed to investing in opportunities to accelerate our growth platforms which provide attractive returns to our shareholders that brings my comments to a close and now back to jim zallie jim zallie president and chief executive officer thanks jim i want to highlight a few milestones of which we are particularly proud on earth day we released our eighth annual sustainability update that outlines the progress we have made toward our 2020 goals and in addition earlier this year we were once again named to bloomberg s gender equality index and we were also recognized as one of ethisphere s world s most ethical companies for the sixthth consecutive year in closing i want to take a moment to highlight the driving growth road map we introduced at cagny which defines our strategic direction and the value proposition we offer customers and the value creation opportunities for shareholders the road map is anchored to our purpose and performance driven culture our growth ambition in core food and industrial ingredients is supported by sustainable and trusted source in supply chain and operational excellence our specialties growth strategy across five growth platforms line with consumer trends and changes that are shaping the food industry we deliver value through customer co creation in differentiated go to market capabilities and lastly we are committed to living our purpose of bringing together the potential of people nature and technology to create ingredion solutions that make life better we remained focused on executing our strategy and delivering shareholder value and now let s open the call for questions questions answers operator and first in line is david driscoll with citi research cornell burnette citi research analyst this is cornell burnette calling in for david drisco just wanted to dig in a little bit on north america and kind of the guidance especially in the back half so when you say that you re expecting profits to be up in the back half and there s a number of kind of transitional onetime items that probably don t hit this year just wondering if you can put a dollar number around some of the kind of transitory items in the back half of last year that you don t expect to recur for this year and then secondly kind of excluding those issues would you have expected the back half to be up anyway just given perhaps the way your net corn costs are going to be laid out across the year jim zallie president and chief executive officer let me ask jim gray to take that jim gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yes yes i think cornell from last year we spoke about some difficulties that we had in argo in q3 which also then carried into q4 that was around approximately 10 million and then we also had some other kind of operational efficiencies that was about another 10 million we would expect to be lapping those in more as one timers i think the majority of that has occurred in the second half of 18 with regard to how the corn lays out really the difficulty is in the first half of 18 the value of meal and the value of corn oil is higher and so we just don t see we re lapping that in the first half i think when you look forward to the second half of 19 right now and the way that we really kind of look at our expectations is we really kind of take what the current values are for our core products relative to our gross cost to corn and so we don t really see that improving there s no signals to us that says that that s going to tighten up for the second half of 19 we don t see it necessarily getting worse either and there is some anticipation that if the u s and china come to some trade resolution you may see some of the soy market and the corn market start to clear more in the second half but we really think that s going to take some time cornell burnette citi research analyst ok and then just kind of comparing kind of using spot rates when you get to the back half of the year kind of how would those co products compare with where co products were kind of last year in the back half of 18 is it more kind of a flattish comparison or is it still a headwind jim gray executive vice president and chief financial officer it s more of a flattish comparison and though i d say there s recent slight weakness but generally i think it s a flattish comparison cornell burnette citi research analyst ok and then the last question for me i know it s relatively small in terms of your exposure to ethanol through the deal but i think kind of weak ethanol margins is something that you called out last year as being a hindrance to the north american profitability and it felt like in the first quarter it seemed like the ethanol markets got even a bit weaker and perhaps what we saw then last year so just wondering what s your take on that and is that something that s creating kind of incremental pressures for the north american business this year as well jim zallie president and chief executive officer jim do you want to take that jim gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yes sure yes cornell i would say that for us in q1 we saw system of modest improvement in ethanol albeit at a very very low margin level and so we we right now we re not anticipating that something as materially better for the year operator next we ll go to rob moskow with credit suisse rob moskow credit suisse analyst jim zallie i guess i m a little bit confused about the 200 million investment that you re making in plant based and can you give us a little more color as to what kind of return we should expect from this investment going forward and what areas of the market it s going to get you to when is it just kind of like part of your overall plan for shifting the mix to specialty value add is there a big margin that you re seeing right now and those products that just that can that are twice the margin of your commodity just like you said for the rest of the portfolio latreille talked about this in your cagny presentations but maybe just a little more clarity i d appreciate jim zallie president and chief executive officer thank you rob yes so just to first clarify on the 200 million figure the 200 million figure was a figure for the total specialties investments growth investments that we have made in and are making across the growth platforms and i specifically called out sugar reduction which would relate to allulose as well as pea protein isolates as well as the verdient pulse based flowers and concentrates so it s across those growth platforms as it relates specifically to plant based proteins it s about 125 million to 125 million so as it relates to the attractiveness of that space we had a cagny called out a revenue opportunity that we see over the next four to five years of about 100 million of incremental growth related to then something that is extremely on trend it s just going to in the last three years the compounded annual growth of plant based non soy based consumption is up 51 and there s a lot of drivers behind that so right now we still see a supply deficit certainly coming from non chinese sources of these products strong demand and good pricing so we think that the market offers a lot of opportunity for accelerated growth as well as a good margin structure relative to how tight the market is and we ll remain based on those growth rates and based on the small number of suppliers and the position that we re going to have as a domestic supplier sourcing from the pulse belt i guess for the pea protein isolates and where we ll be producing at a facility that was a state of the art soy protein facility that we re retrofitting to produce the pulse based isolates or the pea protein isolates the pulse based flowers and concentrates are also obviously very much on trend and that business is continuing to grow so and just one just and then so that s just basically an answer to your question rob moskow credit suisse analyst and how quickly do you think you ll realize a return from these because the commodity markets just seem to be getting tougher not easier i guess you need something to get you back to your algorithm what s the timing jim zallie president and chief executive officer yes i think that we see i think we see all of these investments contributing starting to contribute in a ramp up capacity over a four to five year period so with both allulose having strong drivers for growth especially related to now the labeling change here in the united states that s impending and the growth of again the plant based proteins sector so we re going to see growth in 2020 in 2021 and it s going to be ramping up we believe at a pretty fast clip but from a standpoint of the capital and the return on those investments you re probably looking in the years three four and five jim jim gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yes and rob as we ve mentioned in the past so today we are selling pulse based proteins to customers really understanding their needs understanding the abstract mandate from customers that s allowing us to fill our pipeline and as assets come online and we have expanded capacity then the sales teams really have the green light to really go forward and strongly commit to the quality level of the plant based protein whether it s an isolate or a concentrate or a flower that our customers are seeking to work into their innovation work into their recipes and as we ve mentioned in the past we usually think about ramp up over a four to five year period jim zallie president and chief executive officer the other thing rob that i would just want to mention and something that we re very committed to as a company and you ve heard me call it out previously is in relationship to the emphasis we re bringing to customers around customer co creation and we believe that the five growth platforms and the product portfolios and those growth platforms specifically the starch based texturizers the clean and simple ingredients the plant based proteins and the sugar reduction capabilities all lend themselves to co create systems and solutions for customers that will help to actually boost the growth across all five so as we look at the return on investment for something that is extremely on trend that is driving so much innovation plant based proteins and sugar reduction it s where we re working with customers right now and having that in our portfolio is we think going to enhance starch based texturizers and the clean and simple portfolio as well so i think that the return on investment that we re going to have to look at in hindsight three years from now as to what it s lifted in regards to our overall specialties portfolio because that s the intent of working with customers which are very receptive right now both small and medium size entrepreneurial customers are receptive to solutions and systems as well as the larger customers that are looking for and efficiencies in their supply chain operator next we ll go to adam samuelson with goldman sachs adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst i was hoping first if you could provide a little bit more color on some of the margin pressure that you felt in south america it seemed like that was a bigger driver of kind of you taking the high end of the range down and in terms of making more cautious comments about argentina specifically but specifically around the volume outlook for that region and the specific margin pressures that you felt in the quarter jim zallie president and chief executive officer yes yes let me take it first and then jim can add some additional comments we had a slow first quarter attributable really to the harsh recession and the unfavorable forex in argentina and higher net corn costs in brazil and the impacts really were significant and caused us to moderate our self american outlook the recession has proven to be harsher in south america which has had a dampening effect on consumer spending and volumes so in that country that s what we re experiencing jim do you want to make some additional comments jim gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yes and adam i don t we obviously look at corn and the cost of corn as well as to how we can look at pricing and so i think the team does a really nice job of trying to manage the price mix relative to the cost of corn so i feel more confident in our ability to manage margin what really is i think new for us is that the volume takeaway some in argentina but also a little bit of soft volume in brazil and that s really a more of what the the indicator or contributing factor for us to reduce our guidance for the full year with regard to south america s operating income adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst ok and then in emea the margins is that is the decrement year over year and really relative to the last several years just purely pakistan or is there some more competitive competition in europe that you re seeing just make sure we clarify that jim zallie president and chief executive officer yes it s mainly pakistan forex and a little bit of europe so jim gray executive vice president and chief financial officer europe jim zallie president and chief executive officer a little bit euro forex as well so it s mainly pakistan forex and euro forex and then a little bit of catch up as it takes time to pass through the price increases related to corn run up in pakistan as well jim gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yes and but i would not say i would not characterize that the competitive intensity has changed at all europe s a modest market and we re fine there jim zallie president and chief executive officer no we feel right we feel very very good about our emea business as it relates to and the specialty it is mainly in specialties business and it continues to perform very well adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst ok and then just finally for me in north america one of your competitors announced that they re going to be kind of switching some of their hfcs 42 capacity over to more food and industrial grade starches and i m just it doesn t seem like it s going to cost very much to actually make that shift i m just wondering how do you think about the competitive intensity or do you see the competitive landscape evolving in the u s in your base starch business as over time and are you worried that if the declines in hfcs both 42 and 55 continue or accelerate that others might look to do that just versus just shutting the corn mills entirely jim zallie president and chief executive officer yes i mean really it s yes regarding the specific news announcement that you referenced it s really too early to make any assessments and our policy really is not to comment on what competitors are doing reminder we took out industrial starch capacity and high fructose corn syrup capacity with our stockton closure so that was in reaction to what we see happening in the market and i m sure the market s going to continue to evaluate its supply demand dynamics going forward but really it s too early to make any assessments in that regard operator and we ll go to brett hundley with seaport global brett hundley seaport global analyst i actually wanted to stay on that same topic and ask the question a little bit differently so same competitor news from last week about the repurposing my question has to do with the draft guidance that you guys mentioned from the fda on allulose and whether or not this could lead ingredion to make some finishing changes to here in united states you guys are formally in the process of adding allulose capabilities in mexico right now but can you talk about any desires to maybe follow through on this in the u s and then whether or not that could further display some meaningful amount of core product production at any of your american facilities jim zallie president and chief executive officer yes i mean we re obviously very excited about what the potential for allulose offers especially now with this fdi fda issued draft guidance which again would exclude allulose from being labeled in total and added sugars on nutrition labels so that we feel lends itself very well also with the strong demand for sugar reduction solutions in mexico where it s already approved not to be added as a sugar as well as now in the united states so we re very enthused about that and we do think we re going to have very strong customer receptivity starting in early 2020 so looking forward we ll continue to evaluate how the market develops and we ve got a great partner in matsutani with great technology in this space they ve been researching rare sugars for 15 years so we ll look to it we ll continue to evaluate it and our intent is to grow to have this be as a central part of our growth platform for sugar reduction so i think one step at a time we want to get the customer wins under our belt in 2020 and then we ll evaluate and it ll be part of our strategic investment certainly going forward with the great partner brett hundley seaport global analyst ok and then i do have a question about the drop off in volumes in north america i m admittedly a little confused there i know you re talking to stockton as the reasoning but i m curious if there was any follow through on business loss from closing stockton because if i go back and look at the numbers and just look at two years stack performance for volumes inside north america your volume change in q1 was a minus call it 1 5 over two years and then in q4 of last year it was plus 3 5 or higher on a two year basis and i went back and looked at your script from q4 and you guys were talking about how other parts of your business had offset volume declines from stockton at that point so with stockton presumably closed during q4 i don t understand why that would be a reason for a sequential volume falloff for q1 and so i m just trying to understand the change a little bit better or maybe i m misunderstanding jim zallie president and chief executive officer yes i m just going to just mention one thing just for clarification sake and then jim can comment from his perspective just to kind of correct the record in relationship to the stockton closure the stockton closure i guess you could say officially closed in december month it was i think officially closed in november mid november or something like that and then you take into account the holidays so really it wasn t for the full quarter of quarter 4 so jim do you want to comment just on volume because we are attributing certainly the majority or if not all of it on the back of the shed jim gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yes and brett i mean as we purposely thought about serving the customers on the west coast really we saw probably some of that shed really start to hit us mid and midway through q1 for what we kind of purposely went after we were very much ok with serving and retaining customers from other sourcing locations be it cedar rapids or other plants and the midwest as we have been used stockton as a break station to get out there i think maybe overall if you look at kind of a two year trend one of the things that we didn t call out in 18 was that generally there was some weaker sweetener volume mostly attributable to kind of hf 55 into beverages so i m just wondering if as you gain more time and a little more data you might have seen that that s stepped down from 17 to 18 played out and then we ll see kind of a different run rate for 2019 as we go forward for hf brett hundley seaport global analyst ok i mean that makes sense i mean really quickly do you feel like hf is falling off incrementally here as we move into this summer compared to last summer jim zallie president and chief executive officer no i think it s saying it s declining at the jim gray executive vice president and chief financial officer long term historical rate jim zallie president and chief executive officer yes yes yes brett hundley seaport global analyst ok that s helpful and then just one quick one for me and then i ll get out of here is korea do you have a view on and when korean corn could moderate a little bit or your ability to get corn in there i think getting corn in there from outside is a little bit more structurally tough but can you just give us an update on when corn cost can moderate there because i hear you it would be nice to see some of your reboot come through from your recovery in thailand as well as some of the mix changes that you ve made in asia so i think some of us are very really expecting that margin profile to get better i just didn t realize that korean corn cost would be this big of a hit jim zallie president and chief executive officer it s really a continuation from q3 and q4 of last year so i think once we get through q2 we ll start to see much better net corn cost into korea as well as our other asia pac countries in the second half operator and we ve no further questions in queue i ll turn it back to the company for any closing comments jim zallie president and chief executive officer ok well i just wanted to thank everybody for joining us today and we look forward to seeing you in the near future thank you so much operator duration 43 minutes call participants heather kos vice president investor

bangladesh is a workers land more than seven million people are working here as manufacturing workers nearly nine million in hotels and tea shops more than four million in transport two million in construction and more than 20 million women and men are actively engaged in agriculture with their unemployed dependents they constitute more than 90 percent of the population and yet they share less than 20 per cent of the gdp with the rise in gdp and a good growth rate the share of working people in gdp has declined at the time of independence bangladeshi society was dominated by small and middle income groups petty traders low and middle income professionals small and medium farmers small entrepreneurs there were large farmers and jotedars in rural areas but an elite class based on industry or in trade was almost non existent therefore the number of industrial non agricultural workers was also small that social composition changed radically over the following decades multimillionaires with big properties have grown in thousands through the capital accumulation process mostly primitive in nature in the same process both the size and proportion of illegal underground unreported and criminal economic activities have increased on an unprecedented scale the size of this economy has grown with bribery commissions to approve bad projects leakages from different development projects violent crimes arms and drug trade corruption land grabbing women child and manpower trafficking sex trade cheating and fraudulent activities etc these activities have affected the social fabric and uprooted a huge number of people expansion of the service sector has captured a major part of the economy thereby increasing the informal sector and its number of workers in the industrial sector the rise of an export oriented garments sector has also changed the scenario in many ways such as higher number of factory workers with lower real wage and insecurity in recent decades as a newly independent country bangladesh inherited some big industrial enterprises in jute textile steel and sugar most of these were initially established by state patronage or with big subsidies from the state and later transferred ownership to pakistani big business houses these were abandoned by them after independence in december 1971 and nationalised in early 1972 these enterprises formed the industrial mainstay of the newly independent country these had strong trade unions mostly organised by leftist parties workers of these big enterprises located mostly in dhaka khulna and chittagong had been very organised and politically active since the early 1960s they played a crucial role in the political movement against military rule led by general ayub khan the mass uprising in 1969 and later the war of independence in 1971 after independence all governments civil and military did all they could to capture these trade unions they even resorted to violence and killing to gain control over industrial areas and to plant corrupt persons in the trade union leadership abuse of trade unions climbed to its extreme during the 1980s under the military rule of general ershad it continued with later regimes with the labour leaders co opted into the ruling elite corruption at the management level became a common phenomenon this spread mistrust among workers towards their leaders and weakened the unions power to assert the workers agenda with the world bank s privatisation projects top labour leaders were bribed in various ways including with foreign trips to ensure the success of privatisation gradually most of these trade unions became tools of the ruling party thus separatedfrom the general workers these practices have contributed to a loss of credibility and a decline in the strength of the trade unions illustration noor us safa anik during the 1980s like many other neighbouring countries bangladesh s ruling class es also accepted its development path in accordance with the structural adjustment programs sap the other face of the washington consensus prescription there were many elements in the package such as reordering of public expenditure priorities competitive exchange rates liberalised trade and foreign direct investment fdi privatisation and deregulation in sum the programmes aimed to bring everything within the reach of private business turning every activity into profit making schemes and opening everything for corporate interests these are collectively known as neo liberal economic policies privatisation of state owned enterprises education health care and other public services downsizing industrial units closing down loss making enterprises and retrenchment of workers have been the high priority of successive governments these reforms resulted in erosion of public enterprises and consequent widespread unemployment and alienation the process was at its peak in 2002 with the closure of adamjee jute mills the largest jute industry of the world the demise of the enterprise was arranged under the guise of jute sector development with a usd 250 million loan from the world bank in this model privatisation of common property grabbing of natural resources appear as progress destruction of wetland forest or cropland in favour of profitable business are seen as development dismantling of public institutions are seen as economic reforms the neo liberal reforms that shaped the government actions also had a strong ideological political dimension dismantling old industries was prioritised not only to expand the rule of private capital but also to break workers stronghold moreover they were intended to create a large pool of labour disorganised scattered unable to assert its rights and forced to accept low wages the evolution of the export oriented rmg industry in bangladesh coincided with these reforms reaping benefits from the rising unemployment and new international division of labour however this new emerging sector enjoyed policy and material support from both the government and the international financial institutions it also enjoyed other favourable factors including quotas under the multi fibre agreement that ensured an international market the new rising rich were looking for high profit investment they became new owners a huge pool of unemployed young women from poor families ready to work for rock bottom wages and longer working hours made up the new workforce while old factories had been suffering from hostility from the policy makers a long list of incentives became available for export oriented industries these incentives included duty free import of capital machinery for 100 percent export oriented industries outside the export processing zones epzs creation of an export promotion fund epf for product development and market promotion of new items exemption from payment of 50 percent of income tax on income derived from export exemption from payment of import license fees by exporters who import raw materials exclusively for export production and retention of up to 10 percent of earnings for general business purposes soon to be raised to 20 percent in later years on many occasions garment exporters could pull more benefits and favours from the governments by the 1990s it became clear that the old industries were dying while export oriented industries and construction materials showed strong and steady growth in old factories workers had trade unions housing facilities schools for their kids in the new phase of industrialisation instead of improving these facilities the new generation of workers found themselves totally disorganised and unprotected almost no trade unions no schools no hospitals real wages also decreased permanent industrial jobs were replaced by a temporary part time outsourced unstable work system remittances sent by migrant workers appeared as the lifeline of the economy but they got little support for their job security and life safety big public enterprises were dismantled the land of large mills was replaced by export processing zones shopping malls and real estate during this phase export oriented garments factories became the mainstay of the manufacturing sector despite its high growth incidents like that of spectrum and tazreen exposed the vulnerability of the sector even the rana plaza collapse in 2013 the deadliest industrial horror in the world that killed more than 1100 could not change workers lives significantly this sector its global chain remains a source of huge profit for owners as well as buyers and brands with the lowest wages in the world and great vulnerability for its workers migration from agriculture to non agriculture within rural areas and to semi urban or urban areas has increased only to find temporary low wage jobs in the informal sector small industries transport and services desperate attempts by many unemployed youth to find jobs overseas have contributed to increase in human trafficking it is evident that ngo microcredit programmes helped non farm activities to grow in the rural areas like small trade small money lending small scale handicrafts and rickshaw vans but many studies have revealed the limits of microfinance as a tool of poverty reduction or stable job creation therefore the supply of youths including teens from rural areas to urban areas looking for jobs remains steady photo star the main features of the workers in bangladesh today may be summarised as follows average wage level remains much lower than living wage less than five percent of the workers are trade unionised a significant number of the workers work in unregistered establishments without any protection the informal sector remains the biggest employer where low wage jobs with low security dominate government monitoring to protect workers is in reality absent on the contrary police and government institutions are highly biased towards big private owners gender composition of workers changed to include more women workers untimely death and injury of workers has become common in factories transport and construction jobs because of unsafe working conditions there is no protection from the government compensation is like peanuts and even that is not available for many it is well publicised that bangladesh can now show some good numbers regarding gdp growth remittance export foreign exchange reserve etc the main contributors behind these good numbers are mostly migrant workers garments workers and agricultural workers but all these macro statistics could not ensure good and stable job opportunities and other public rights for them there is a constant tension over job search and the flow of job seeking people has increased the size of the reserve army of labour which gives more manipulating power to the employers there is no security for job no security even for life because of a weak organisational base of working people and declining power of their political support the situation is getting worse this has become in fact a global pattern in neoliberal models no regular job no trade union no organised workers power i agree with leo panitch et al 2012 that added to the huge numbers of the unemployed is the precariat the growing segment of the working population in jobs that are temporary low wage and without benefits or protection conditions that were once associated with the informal sector in the developing world are now becoming truly global in bangladesh democratic institutions and practices are far from real workers agenda and politics have become insignificant in the power struggle governance has become a zamindari system that overrules any institutional and legal process in the country therefore the space for healthy growth of political and cultural activism in favour of workers is still a dream and a matter of continuous struggle nevertheless sparks of protest arise against overtly torturous acts by the state under every regime and against anti people policies from the state that gives birth to new formation in every section of society among students workers and women we find anger and new forms of alliances as a result despite regimented control over labour we have seen outbursts of non trade unionised workers several times in the past decade at one point thousands of workers women and men demonstrated their strength to seize the capital city we see the anger of deprived workers in and around dhaka repeatedly it has not however progressed yet to transform spontaneous angry workers into an organised political force therefore deprivation torture abuse and uncertainty contunue to haunt the workers in this workers land anu muhammad is professor of

the removal of president al bashir and the takeover by the military did nothing to convince protesters to go home or dampen their call for regime change crowds of protesters continue to demonstrate rejecting the military s move as a regime coup and demand the handover of power to a civilian transitional government now that sudan s future transition remains unclear while it searches for a viable democratic alternative it is important to examine the origins of the contestation forces that shook the country for the last four months and the different phases of their formation what is the sudanese professionals association spa anyway perplexed commentators and news anchors on sudan s government aligned television channels asked repetitively as if bound by a spell an anchor on the bbc arabic channel described the spa as mysterious and bewildering most were asking about the apparently unfathomable body that has taken the sudanese political scene by surprise since december 2018 when the ongoing wave of popular protests against president omar al bashir s 30 year authoritarian rule began the initial spark of protests came from atbara a dusty town pressed between the nile and the desert some 350km north of the capital khartoum a crowd of school pupils market labourers and university students raged against the government in response to an abrupt tripling of the price of bread as a result of the government s removal of wheat subsidies protestors in several towns across the country set fire to the headquarters of the ruling national congress party ncp and stormed local government offices and zakat chamber storehouses taking food items in a show of popular sovereignty territorial separation and economic freefall since the independence of south sudan in 2011 sudan s economy has been experiencing a freefall as the bulk of its oil and government revenues withered away almost overnight currency depreciation hyperinflation and dwindling foreign currency reserves coupled with the rise in the prices of good and a banking crisis with severe cash supply shortages have all contributed to the economic crisis the government responded with a new round of austerity measures cutting expenditures on social services and subsidies on fuel electricity and wheat when popular protests and insurgencies against entrenched authoritarian regimes rocked the arab world in 2011 sudan was consumed by the separation of south sudan under international supervision the politics of divorce were expectedly complex and culminated in the renewal of warfare in sudan s borders with south sudan fighting resumed in sudan s south kordofan and the blue nile after a brief interregnum of peace and a civil war engulfed the newly independent south sudan as the two capitals khartoum and juba jockeyed for influence sudan s first post separation budget included a set of austerity measures in september 2013 the government was confronted and brutally crashed a series of riots in khartoum protesting increases in fuel and bread prices at least 185 protesters were killed in the mayhem according to a 2014 joint report by amnesty international and african centre for justice and peace studies with hindsight the september 2013 events were a forerunner of the ongoing wave of popular protests against al bashir and his government the new generation of protestors mostly students and young professionals eschewed the hierarchical structures of the established political parties and forged their own horizontal networks supported by the widespread use of the internet instead of identifiable ringleaders groups such as girifna we are fed up sharara spark and change now provided the acephalous protests of september 2013 with loud voices and powerful images amplified by the global reach of social media the islamists between two dictators at the time president bashir dismissed claims that the fever of the arab spring had infected the country arguing that sudan had already bypassed that stage in a way he was right sudan s arab spring moment was arguably the intifada of april 1985 that ushered in the army coup which ended the 16 year dictatorship of president gaafar nimeiry and introduced a brief period of parliamentary democracy between 1986 and 1989 nimeiry a nasser style autocrat switched allegiance from the communist bloc to the usa and became washington s man in the horn of africa after accumulating formidable debts as a result of failed state led development megaprojects his government was forced to undertake a raft of economic reforms designed by the international monetary fund imf to liberalise the economy and drastically reduce government expenditures these reforms incorporated all the familiar prescriptions of the neoliberal model currency devaluation subsidy cuts privatisation of public enterprises and reduction of social spending gurdon 1991 nimeiry did not survive the imf reforms popular anger at austerity in khartoum a city strained by streams of rural migrants fleeing war in the south and famine in the west brought his rule to an end after only two weeks of massive protests in april 1985 while egyptian president anwar sadat nimeiry s major regional ally had managed to crush the 1977 riots against austerity in egypt and win the favour of the islamists he was later killed at the hands of the very islamists he sought to instrumentalise to tame the masses opposed to his economic model in sudan nimeiry forged a similar alliance with the sudanese islamic movement led by hassan al turabi sudan s islamists exploited their alliance with nimeiry to position a new corps of aspiring educated cadres mostly from sudan s provincial towns in state institutions in preparation for a bid for power the promise of an islamic renaissance provided this ambitious middle class with a novel political grammar of opposition to sudan s ruling classes eventually the islamic movement won the state with the help of the military in 1989 creating an autocracy of an islamic blend while islamist movements in the countries of the arab spring were three decades later the carriers of opposition to autocratic rule and symptomatic urban anger against neoliberal transformation joya 2011 islamists in the sudanese government implemented the very reforms that nimeiry was not able politically to carry through their interpretation of the state was wholly congruent with the neoliberal model marchal ahmed 2010 the state they recreated operated as a driver of privatisation and economic liberalisation that regulates economic activity in conformity with the interests of big business popularises a consumption and competition culture rewards the few winners and controls the many losers through a combination of disciplinary legislation and brute force for the past 30 years opposition to the rule of sudan s islamists came from two expected quarters the old ruling class displaced by the islamist takeover and the armed movements in sudan s peripheries south kordofan the blue nile and darfur the first has pursued a self defeating policy of return to the ancien régime of patrician rule the socio economic foundations of which have long been eroded the second has repeatedly attempted and failed to forge a broad alliance of sudan s marginalised non arabic speaking peoples with a view to ending the system of racial and social privilege that sustains the dominance of the elite from the riverine heartland of the country the islamists response to this dual challenge has been a largely successful policy of co optation by integrating elite members of the old establishment parties and the peripheries into the ruling class the demands of government and the realpolitik of survival against regional and international odds were key in al bashir s turn away from the ideological zeal of islamic renaissance to a more pragmatic modus operandi of co optation and patronage to secure this move he got rid of hassan al turabi the veteran leader of the islamic movement and subsequently most of the movement s eminent politicians freedom peace and justice a rallying cry for the young women and men protesting on sudan s streets today most of whom come from professional student and middle class backgrounds political islam remains the ideology of the enemy in power it is the koz meaning scoop in arabic a sudanese term used to symbolise the islamists greed that the protesters want to stamp out robbed of the moral and ideological traction of islam as an oppositionist idiom by the very bankruptcy of the islamist project in government sudan s protesters are faced with the challenge of inventing an alternative political grammar to articulate their demands so far their rallying cry has been based on vague notions of freedom peace and justice their critics in government media often poke in this political blind spot demanding the articulation of a programme of government beyond captivating slogans indeed one reason for the success of the spa as a vehicle of political mobilisation against al bashir and his government is its perceived political innocence the young women and men who answer the spa s regular calls for protest do so because it reflects their anger against entrenched corruption cronyism and government inefficiency but also because it mirrors their frustration at the failures of the political class across the spectrum as an organisation the spa claims no political orientation and that it speaks a universal functional language of freedoms and rights to which every citizen is entitled and promises a way out from the clutches of autocracy interestingly its mobilisation rhetoric derives largely from the heritage of sudan s effendiya nationalism the working ideology of the small class of educated sudanese the latter were mostly muslim arabic speakers from the riverine heartland who served as junior clerks and administrators under anglo egyptian colonial rule and inherited the colonial state sharkey 2007 this appropriation of the graduates congress nationalist language could be interpreted as a discursive manoeuvre meant to revive a fantasy of national cohesion from an imagined past it is however exactly this poetic but narrow nationalism of the effendiya class that failed to imagine a political home for sudan s many peoples and is blamed for the hastened decay of sudan post colony in raging civil wars harir tvedt 1994 in contradistinction to this notion of organic national unity sudan s many disenfranchised had launched alternative nationalisms of the working class sikainga 2010 of the women s movement ibrahim 2010 and of oppressed nationalities garang 1987 a free ride for the political opposition forces beyond mobilisation the obfuscation of political conflict in the glorification of the nation serves a precise function that of allowing the ever quarrelsome opposition forces to ride the wave of mass political engagement generated by the spa as alliance partners sudan s competing opposition coalitions the sudan call and the national consensus forces as well as a faction of the democratic unionist party opposed to the alliance of the mainstream party with the ruling ncp have co signed the spa s freedom and change declaration the sudan call alliance was launched in 2014 in addis ababa as an opposition platform allowing sadiq al mahdi s umma party and other non armed political actors to partner with the armed movements of the sudan revolutionary front srf the primary purpose of the sudan call was to demonstrate a unity of purpose in the mediation process led by the african union high level implementation panel for sudan and south sudan between the sudanese government and its many opponents established in 2011 the srf joined the main darfur armed movements the sudan liberation army movement led by abd al wahid mohamed nur the sudan liberation army movement led by minni minawi and the justice and equality movement and the sudan people s liberation army movement in north sudan spla m n due to rivalry over chairmanship of the coalition by 2014 the srf was split between the darfur armed movements on one side and the spla m n and its allies on the other the spla m n itself suffered a leadership dispute that led to its division in 2017 between a majority in the nuba mountains south kordofan led by abd al aziz al hilu with the declared aim of achieving self determination for the region and a minority in the blue nile led by malik agar who maintain a nation wide agenda divisions over strategy and competition over leadership also pitted non armed opposition actors against each other sadiq al mahdi the leader of the umma party parted ways with the national consensus forces ncf an opposition coalition launched in 2010 and joined beside his party the communist party hassan al turabi s popular congress party the opposition sudanese congress party and a list of smaller baathist and nasserite groups al mahdi was not happy with a subordinate position in the ncf under the chairmanship of farouq abu issa a veteran politician with leftist inclinations and soon sought a route out tired of the ncf al turabi s pcp joined president al bashir s national dialogue process announced in 2014 to eventually become a partner in government with the armed movements as his allies sadiq al mahdi finally became chairman of an opposition umbrella the sudan call in march 2018 although a signatory to the sudan call the ncf accused its allies of subservience to an internationally backed soft landing agenda of reconciliation with the government as part of a managed transition walked out of the coalition and called for regime change as its only goal as to the opposition sudanese congress party it preferred the company of the sudan call partners to the ncf now reduced to the communist party and its baathist and nasserite friends in the throes of a leadership crisis since the death of its veteran secretary general mohamed ibrahim nugud in 2012 the communist party under its new leader mohamed mukhtar al khateeb purged elements it accused of toying with the idea of a soft landing ahead of its sixth party conference in 2016 to noble isolation at the helm of the ncf a union umbrella and a political agent the success formula of spa no wonder then that the emergence of the rather obscure spa was received with popular acclaim in a political theatre riddled by incessant squabbling the spa was established in 2016 as an alliance of three professional organs the sudan doctors central committee the sudan journalists network and the alliance of democratic lawyers the first is a strike coordination committee that emerged out of a successful 2016 doctors strike action the second was established in 2012 as a representative organ of sudanese journalists opposed to the government aligned sudan journalist union the third grew out of an electoral list of opposition lawyers that regularly competes for the leadership of the government aligned sudanese bar association in august 2018 the spa held a poorly attended press conference in khartoum to unveil a study on the minimum wage on the background of the depreciation of the national currency and spiralling hyperinflation speakers at the press conference included mohamed yusif ahmed al mustafa one of a few veteran northern senior members of the ancestor spla m after the independence of south sudan he remained aloof of the spla m n but took the unexpected move of siding with abd al aziz al hilu in the 2017 split of the spla m n another speaker was mohamed naji al assam a young doctor known for his engagement in strike actions and affiliation with a faction of the democratic unionist party opposed to the alliance with the ruling ncp al assam and al mustafa would appear again to speak for the spa and are today under arrest the spa announced a plan to submit its minimum wage proposal to the national assembly in a mass procession but the eruption of protests in atbara gedaref and other provincial towns in sudan raised the bar of political action the spa responded with the announcement of the freedom and change declaration on the eve of sudan s independence anniversary on 1 january 2019 calling for the unconditional departure of the regime of president al bashir and the formation of a national transitional government the spa captivated the political imagination of sudan s busy social media its success among the sudanese diaspora is a case in point it provided anchor and agency to broad segments of young women and men wishing to live out their political identity as sudanese citizens groups of activists from different professions university lecturers veterinary doctors engineers health inspectors plastic artists and others formed their own associations along the spa model to join the freedom and change declaration the dual formula of spa as an aspiring trade union umbrella and a political agent proved its success in this regard it resembles older political organisations in sudan namely the syndicated front which spearheaded the 1964 october revolution that ended the rule of sudan s military ruler general abboud and the trade unions association which played a pivotal role in the april 1985 intifada that toppled the regime of president nimeiry there are however critical differences in content that override the resemblance in form the 1964 syndicates front and the 1985 trade unions association operated in a socio economic field where the government was the primary employer of the educated professionals who sought to challenge it through strike action and popular mobilisation both organisations could draw on the support of militant labour organisations such as the sudan railway workers union strategically positioned to paralyse a cash crop economy they could also substantiate their representative claims through electoral procedures in their constituent trade unions and professional associations the actors of the spa in contradistinction are primarily drawn from the free professions capitalist penetration under the aegis of sudan s islamists transformed sudan s labour market in favour of commercial enterprises because of the commoditisation of health and education and the privatisation of public assets employers in these sectors multiplied and private interests emerged that collide with sectoral strike actions government employees as well as employees in the banking industry or communications sectors who could arguably overturn this unfavourable balance are yet to develop their trade union platforms and join the spa s repeated calls for a general strike by its very composition the spa is somewhat removed from the concerns and challenges of sudan s many subsistence farmers small peasantry agricultural labour the many artisan miners scavenging for gold in deserts and valleys far and wide urban small producers and the masses of the urban poor forces inhibiting change in this moment of revolutionary crisis in sudan an array of forces are obstructing change in the country these are made of security men and military officers privatised militias big businesses and food importers bankers and financiers large landowners preachers and bureaucrats they all share interests in maintaining the current status quo it is no surprise therefore that president al bashir s response to months of protests was to declare a nationwide state of emergency on 22 february he also dissolved the government replaced 10 state governors with military and security men and appointed a disciplinarian as deputy chairman of the ruling party with the authorities of the first officer these steps amounted to an adjustment of the balance of forces in the ruling establishment in favour of the military security apparatus with a view to winning new partners from the very ranks of the aggrieved professionals in support of a new transitional cabinet sudan s continued protests have rightfully rekindled the spirit of the arab spring but also spurred the powerful counter revolutionary forces of the region into action in his many speeches since the start of protests president al bashir made a point of thanking egypt qatar russia and china for their support the combination of these countries appears counter intuitive but speaks to the composite character of the sudanese regime a military autocracy born out the capture of the state by a modern islamic movement that ascribes to neoliberalism and employs a chauvinistic ideology grounded in the alleged supremacy of sudan s arabic speaking muslims over its many peoples president al bashir s greatest surprise is the fact that resistance to his rule emanates today from close quarters the very people he claims to defend against plotting rebels and international conspirators protests intensified on 6 april the anniversary of the peaceful protests that ousted nimeiry with thousands gathering near the army headquarters in khartoum security services loyal to al bashir fired live ammunition tear gas and rubber bullets on protesters which killed dozens of protesters as well as army officers trying to protect them the protests continued to call for the military leadership not to support al bashir and to set up a civilian transitional government however the army responded only with half measures while they deposed al bashir on 11 april they also announced that a military council headed deputy president and defence minister general ahmed awad ibn auf will run the country for the next two years but provided no details the protesters rejected the move as a regime coup and vowed to guard their revolution

in today s presentation appendix now i m pleased to turn the call over to jim zallie jim zallie president and chief executive officer thanks heather and welcome to everyone joining us today let me start with a brief recap of our first quarter performance and recognize two issues which as expected continue to impact year over year results global foreign exchange negatively impacted our net sales by approximately 100 million and our earnings per share by 0 19 a share second north america continues to face a challenging raw material market and we lap higher co product values in the year ago period our volumes were down 2 driven by the planned shed of high fructose corn syrup and industrial starch from our stockton wet mill closure and weaker volumes in south america partially offset by specialty growth these and other factors combined with lowered total company operating income by 17 operating income in north america was impacted by higher inventory and production costs higher net corn costs and a modest impact from the extreme weather in the u s and canada across our other regions we continue to experience effects of foreign currency devaluations as well as higher net corn costs in response we re taking a series of actions we are also accelerating our 125 million cost mark savings program which is expected to exceed our 2019 year end cumulative run rate savings target of 24 million to 34 million moving to our growth platforms we are excited to have acquired the western polymer business which strengthens our higher value specialty potato starch texturizer portfolio and provides expanded capacity for future growth furthermore we continue to make progress on our previously announced 200 million of strategic investments in sugar reduction and plant based proteins we are on schedule to produce allulose a rare low calorie sugar by the end of this year at our state of the art facility in san juan del río mexico we anticipate sales starting in early 2020 we are excited about the fda s recent initial guidance that allulose will not need to be declared as an added sugar on the label of u s food products which now follows its approved labeling in mexico allulose will be a great complement to our existing portfolio of specialty sweeteners moving on to our plant based protein growth platform we expect to be operational at our sal sioux city nebraska plant to produce pea protein isolates by the end of this year our joint venture with verdient for a range of pulse based flowers is progressing as planned we expect to commercialize verdient products in pet food applications the in the near term and to expand sales into other consumer food products during the second half of the year we are also excited by our recently announced investment in and distribution agreement with clara foods a san francisco based biotech start up with breakthrough technology to produce high value animal free proteins traditionally found in eggs now moving to north america as we indicated in our fourth quarter call we expected north america to be lower in the first half versus the second half with a contributing factor being the layout of corn costs we also experienced extreme weather which impacted our make and sort of move costs across both our sweetener and starch network additionally we carried in higher inventory costs related to our ongoing efforts to optimize our starch network operating income in north america was 125 million down 13 from last year net sales were down given our planned stockton high fructose corn syrup and industrial starch shed specialty and mexico volume increases partially offset lower u s volumes in south america net sales were down for the quarter due to significant foreign currency devaluations and to lower volumes operating income was 18 million down 31 from the year ago period driven by forex impacts partially offset by pricing and cost improvements we are experiencing lower volumes related to the economic recession in argentina along with negative foreign exchange impacts given the continued devaluation of the peso given the severity of the situation we are exploring every measure to improve argentina s business performance in brazil we also experienced the weaker co product returns and we remain cautious about the prospects for a near term economic recovery our andean region continues to demonstrate net sales volume growth led by strong specialty growth in asia pacific net sales were flat foreign currency devaluations and higher regional corn costs were offset by price mix increases across the region as expected our specialty tapioca franchise has rebounded nicely after managing through a challenging crop shortfall in 2018 the pricing actions we took along with the recent reduction in tapioca costs has helped us recover margin in this strategically important product family the region delivered 20 million of operating income down 13 versus the prior year due primarily to a lag in pricing pass through of higher corn costs currency devaluations in both pakistan and europe impacted the emea region which experienced a 3 decline in net sales partially offsetting this was the growth in specialty volumes in europe and core ingredients in pakistan our pakistan team continues to pass through the impact of foreign exchange and higher corn costs operating income was 24 million down 23 driven by foreign exchange impacts and higher corn costs partially offset by favorable price mix now let me hand it off to jim gray who will discuss our financial performance in more detail jim gray executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks jim net sales of 1 4 billion were down for the quarter gross profit margin was lower by 180 basis points driven by fx devaluations and higher raw material and production costs across the regions reported and adjusted operating incomes were 161 million and 166 million respectively reported operating income was lower than the adjusted operating income by 5 million the difference was due to 4 million of restructuring charges associated with our cost smart initiatives and 1 million associated with the acquisition and integration of the western polymer business our reported and adjusted earnings per share were 1 48 and 1 54 respectively q1 net sales of 1 4 billion were down 49 million for the same quarter last year unfavorable fx of 95 million was primarily then attributable to currency devaluations in argentina brazil pakistan asia pacific and europe lower volumes accounted for 27 million of the sales decrease while favorable price mix was a 73 million increase and in north america volume was down year over year driven by planned volume shed as we ceased wet milling at our stockton facility price mix in north america was up in south america foreign exchange devaluation was the largest driver of the year over year net sales decline volume was down 6 due to the impacts of the recession on beverage sales in argentina in weaker dextrose sales in brazil price mix was up 19 as our teams took price increases to pass through a higher raw material cost and recapture some of the foreign exchange impact in argentina and brazil asia pacific had flat net sales as foreign exchange devaluations and lower core volume growth were offset by higher price mix due to corn pricing and fx pass throughs emea had lower net sales due to foreign exchange impacts across the region that were only partially offset by volume growth and price mix for the quarter reported and adjusted operating income decreased 36 million and 34 million respectively north america operating income decreased 18 million due to higher inventory and production costs higher net corn costs and a modest impact from extreme weather in u s and canada south america operating income was down 8 million driven by the impacts of currency devaluation in argentina and brazil in lower volumes in argentina and brazil versus the year ago period asia pacific was down 3 million driven primarily by higher regional corn costs and foreign exchange impacts emea was down 7 million due to the impacts of unfavorable foreign exchange and the higher costs across the region offset partially by favorable specialty volume growth corporate costs were lower by 2 million for the quarter we ll wrap up the discussion of the quarter with earnings per share on the left side of the page you can see the reconciliation from the reported to adjusted on the right side operationally we saw a decrease of 0 36 per share unfavorable foreign exchange was 0 19 per share while margin was a decline of 0 14 per share attributable to lower operating income across the regions other income was minus 0 03 a share due to a onetime true up in mexico for social security contributions moving to our nonoperational items we saw a decrease of 0 04 per share for the quarter largely driven by unfavorable tax and higher financing costs partially offset by lower average shares outstanding financing costs were 0 06 per share decrease driven by a higher debt balance and higher interest rates as compared to the year ago period higher adjusted taxes contributed to a 0 10 per share decrease primarily driven by lapping tax benefits from share based payment awards in the prior year shares outstanding contributed a benefit of 0 13 a share first quarter 2019 cash provided by operations was 18 million lower than last year as a result of timing and working capital and lower net income given the increase in short term lending rates versus the prior year it was more cost effective to fund accounts receivable balances rather than access supplier financing programs additionally inventories are higher given the timing of corn purchases in pakistan and mexico capital expenditures of 80 million were 15 million lower year over year driven by lapping prior year s higher investments of our specialties growth platforms finally as jim mentioned earlier we completed the acquisition of western polymer in the quarter for an investment of 41 million turning to our outlook we anticipate 2019 adjusted earnings per share in the range of 6 80 to 7 20 we are lowering the top end of our adjusted eps guidance range to reflect an anticipated deeper and more prolonged recession in argentina continued higher than historical north america production costs as we continue to optimize our starch network and an anticipated incremental fx impacts in emea and asia pac our guidance excludes acquisition related integration and restructuring costs as well as any potential impairment costs we are expecting adjusted operating income to be flat to slightly down for the year we anticipate that the impact of foreign exchange will be negative for 2019 we expect the significant negative currency impact of 30 million to 35 million during the first half of the year relative to prior year for the full year we expect a negative currency impact to eps of 0 40 to 0 45 we expect operating expenses including corporate expenses to be up over a year as we invest in global business process optimization innovation and digital investments to drive both cost savings and an improved customer experience we expect financing costs for the year to be in the range of 82 million to 87 million due to higher interest rates on our floating rate debt and a higher debt balance our adjusted effective annual tax rate is expected to be between 26 5 and 27 5 we anticipate a slightly higher tax rate as we have taken into consideration our expected mix of south america operating income we expect total diluted weighted average shares of outstanding to be in the range of 68 million to 69 million for the year considering the impact of the accelerated share repurchase agreement lastly we have accelerated our cost smart program to identify additional ways to organize people and processes to drive structural savings we anticipate exceeding our cumulative cost smart run rate savings of 24 million to 34 million by the end of 2019 and against an anticipated inflation of 2 5 to 3 in north america we expect net sales and volume to be down for the full year we expect operating income to be flat to slightly down we expect the first half down significantly due to the lapping of higher co product values in the first half of 2018 and continued starch network optimization efforts and the second half is expected to be up as we lap onetime manufacturing cost impacts from 2018 south america net sales are expected to be flat to up modestly versus the prior year volumes are expected to be up modestly given the magnitude of fx devaluations as well as the effects of the argentine recession during the first quarter we expect operating income to be in a similar range to prior year we remain watchful of economic reforms inflation in the impact of the upcoming election in argentina we continue to focus on cost discipline and business performance improvement asia pacific net sales are expected to be up and operating income is expected to be flat to up modestly we expect weaker operating income in the first half and as stronger second half in emea we expect net sales to be up we anticipate strong specialties performance in europe and core growth in pakistan although we expect flat to modest operating income growth we anticipate a weaker first half versus the second half due to currency impacts throughout the region raw material cost overlaps in pakistan and a prolonged brexit in 2019 we expect cash from operations to be in the range of 630 million to 680 million we expect to invest between 330 million and 360 million in capital expenditures around the world to support growth as well as cost and process improvements importantly we remain committed to investing in opportunities to accelerate our growth platforms which provide attractive returns to our shareholders that brings my comments to a close and now back to jim zallie jim zallie president and chief executive officer thanks jim i want to highlight a few milestones of which we are particularly proud on earth day we released our eighth annual sustainability update that outlines the progress we have made toward our 2020 goals and in addition earlier this year we were once again named to bloomberg s gender equality index and we were also recognized as one of ethisphere s world s most ethical companies for the sixthth consecutive year in closing i want to take a moment to highlight the driving growth road map we introduced at cagny which defines our strategic direction and the value proposition we offer customers and the value creation opportunities for shareholders the road map is anchored to our purpose and performance driven culture our growth ambition in core food and industrial ingredients is supported by sustainable and trusted source in supply chain and operational excellence our specialties growth strategy across five growth platforms line with consumer trends and changes that are shaping the food industry we deliver value through customer co creation in differentiated go to market capabilities and lastly we are committed to living our purpose of bringing together the potential of people nature and technology to create ingredion solutions that make life better we remained focused on executing our strategy and delivering shareholder value and now let s open the call for questions questions answers operator and first in line is david driscoll with citi research cornell burnette citi research analyst this is cornell burnette calling in for david drisco just wanted to dig in a little bit on north america and kind of the guidance especially in the back half so when you say that you re expecting profits to be up in the back half and there s a number of kind of transitional onetime items that probably don t hit this year just wondering if you can put a dollar number around some of the kind of transitory items in the back half of last year that you don t expect to recur for this year and then secondly kind of excluding those issues would you have expected the back half to be up anyway just given perhaps the way your net corn costs are going to be laid out across the year jim zallie president and chief executive officer let me ask jim gray to take that jim gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yes yes i think cornell from last year we spoke about some difficulties that we had in argo in q3 which also then carried into q4 that was around approximately 10 million and then we also had some other kind of operational efficiencies that was about another 10 million we would expect to be lapping those in more as one timers i think the majority of that has occurred in the second half of 18 with regard to how the corn lays out really the difficulty is in the first half of 18 the value of meal and the value of corn oil is higher and so we just don t see we re lapping that in the first half i think when you look forward to the second half of 19 right now and the way that we really kind of look at our expectations is we really kind of take what the current values are for our core products relative to our gross cost to corn and so we don t really see that improving there s no signals to us that says that that s going to tighten up for the second half of 19 we don t see it necessarily getting worse either and there is some anticipation that if the u s and china come to some trade resolution you may see some of the soy market and the corn market start to clear more in the second half but we really think that s going to take some time cornell burnette citi research analyst ok and then just kind of comparing kind of using spot rates when you get to the back half of the year kind of how would those co products compare with where co products were kind of last year in the back half of 18 is it more kind of a flattish comparison or is it still a headwind jim gray executive vice president and chief financial officer it s more of a flattish comparison and though i d say there s recent slight weakness but generally i think it s a flattish comparison cornell burnette citi research analyst ok and then the last question for me i know it s relatively small in terms of your exposure to ethanol through the deal but i think kind of weak ethanol margins is something that you called out last year as being a hindrance to the north american profitability and it felt like in the first quarter it seemed like the ethanol markets got even a bit weaker and perhaps what we saw then last year so just wondering what s your take on that and is that something that s creating kind of incremental pressures for the north american business this year as well jim zallie president and chief executive officer jim do you want to take that jim gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yes sure yes cornell i would say that for us in q1 we saw system of modest improvement in ethanol albeit at a very very low margin level and so we we right now we re not anticipating that something as materially better for the year operator next we ll go to rob moskow with credit suisse rob moskow credit suisse analyst jim zallie i guess i m a little bit confused about the 200 million investment that you re making in plant based and can you give us a little more color as to what kind of return we should expect from this investment going forward and what areas of the market it s going to get you to when is it just kind of like part of your overall plan for shifting the mix to specialty value add is there a big margin that you re seeing right now and those products that just that can that are twice the margin of your commodity just like you said for the rest of the portfolio latreille talked about this in your cagny presentations but maybe just a little more clarity i d appreciate jim zallie president and chief executive officer thank you rob yes so just to first clarify on the 200 million figure the 200 million figure was a figure for the total specialties investments growth investments that we have made in and are making across the growth platforms and i specifically called out sugar reduction which would relate to allulose as well as pea protein isolates as well as the verdient pulse based flowers and concentrates so it s across those growth platforms as it relates specifically to plant based proteins it s about 125 million to 125 million so as it relates to the attractiveness of that space we had a cagny called out a revenue opportunity that we see over the next four to five years of about 100 million of incremental growth related to then something that is extremely on trend it s just going to in the last three years the compounded annual growth of plant based non soy based consumption is up 51 and there s a lot of drivers behind that so right now we still see a supply deficit certainly coming from non chinese sources of these products strong demand and good pricing so we think that the market offers a lot of opportunity for accelerated growth as well as a good margin structure relative to how tight the market is and we ll remain based on those growth rates and based on the small number of suppliers and the position that we re going to have as a domestic supplier sourcing from the pulse belt i guess for the pea protein isolates and where we ll be producing at a facility that was a state of the art soy protein facility that we re retrofitting to produce the pulse based isolates or the pea protein isolates the pulse based flowers and concentrates are also obviously very much on trend and that business is continuing to grow so and just one just and then so that s just basically an answer to your question rob moskow credit suisse analyst and how quickly do you think you ll realize a return from these because the commodity markets just seem to be getting tougher not easier i guess you need something to get you back to your algorithm what s the timing jim zallie president and chief executive officer yes i think that we see i think we see all of these investments contributing starting to contribute in a ramp up capacity over a four to five year period so with both allulose having strong drivers for growth especially related to now the labeling change here in the united states that s impending and the growth of again the plant based proteins sector so we re going to see growth in 2020 in 2021 and it s going to be ramping up we believe at a pretty fast clip but from a standpoint of the capital and the return on those investments you re probably looking in the years three four and five jim jim gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yes and rob as we ve mentioned in the past so today we are selling pulse based proteins to customers really understanding their needs understanding the abstract mandate from customers that s allowing us to fill our pipeline and as assets come online and we have expanded capacity then the sales teams really have the green light to really go forward and strongly commit to the quality level of the plant based protein whether it s an isolate or a concentrate or a flower that our customers are seeking to work into their innovation work into their recipes and as we ve mentioned in the past we usually think about ramp up over a four to five year period jim zallie president and chief executive officer the other thing rob that i would just want to mention and something that we re very committed to as a company and you ve heard me call it out previously is in relationship to the emphasis we re bringing to customers around customer co creation and we believe that the five growth platforms and the product portfolios and those growth platforms specifically the starch based texturizers the clean and simple ingredients the plant based proteins and the sugar reduction capabilities all lend themselves to co create systems and solutions for customers that will help to actually boost the growth across all five so as we look at the return on investment for something that is extremely on trend that is driving so much innovation plant based proteins and sugar reduction it s where we re working with customers right now and having that in our portfolio is we think going to enhance starch based texturizers and the clean and simple portfolio as well so i think that the return on investment that we re going to have to look at in hindsight three years from now as to what it s lifted in regards to our overall specialties portfolio because that s the intent of working with customers which are very receptive right now both small and medium size entrepreneurial customers are receptive to solutions and systems as well as the larger customers that are looking for and efficiencies in their supply chain operator next we ll go to adam samuelson with goldman sachs adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst i was hoping first if you could provide a little bit more color on some of the margin pressure that you felt in south america it seemed like that was a bigger driver of kind of you taking the high end of the range down and in terms of making more cautious comments about argentina specifically but specifically around the volume outlook for that region and the specific margin pressures that you felt in the quarter jim zallie president and chief executive officer yes yes let me take it first and then jim can add some additional comments we had a slow first quarter attributable really to the harsh recession and the unfavorable forex in argentina and higher net corn costs in brazil and the impacts really were significant and caused us to moderate our self american outlook the recession has proven to be harsher in south america which has had a dampening effect on consumer spending and volumes so in that country that s what we re experiencing jim do you want to make some additional comments jim gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yes and adam i don t we obviously look at corn and the cost of corn as well as to how we can look at pricing and so i think the team does a really nice job of trying to manage the price mix relative to the cost of corn so i feel more confident in our ability to manage margin what really is i think new for us is that the volume takeaway some in argentina but also a little bit of soft volume in brazil and that s really a more of what the the indicator or contributing factor for us to reduce our guidance for the full year with regard to south america s operating income adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst ok and then in emea the margins is that is the decrement year over year and really relative to the last several years just purely pakistan or is there some more competitive competition in europe that you re seeing just make sure we clarify that jim zallie president and chief executive officer yes it s mainly pakistan forex and a little bit of europe so jim gray executive vice president and chief financial officer europe jim zallie president and chief executive officer a little bit euro forex as well so it s mainly pakistan forex and euro forex and then a little bit of catch up as it takes time to pass through the price increases related to corn run up in pakistan as well jim gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yes and but i would not say i would not characterize that the competitive intensity has changed at all europe s a modest market and we re fine there jim zallie president and chief executive officer no we feel right we feel very very good about our emea business as it relates to and the specialty it is mainly in specialties business and it continues to perform very well adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst ok and then just finally for me in north america one of your competitors announced that they re going to be kind of switching some of their hfcs 42 capacity over to more food and industrial grade starches and i m just it doesn t seem like it s going to cost very much to actually make that shift i m just wondering how do you think about the competitive intensity or do you see the competitive landscape evolving in the u s in your base starch business as over time and are you worried that if the declines in hfcs both 42 and 55 continue or accelerate that others might look to do that just versus just shutting the corn mills entirely jim zallie president and chief executive officer yes i mean really it s yes regarding the specific news announcement that you referenced it s really too early to make any assessments and our policy really is not to comment on what competitors are doing reminder we took out industrial starch capacity and high fructose corn syrup capacity with our stockton closure so that was in reaction to what we see happening in the market and i m sure the market s going to continue to evaluate its supply demand dynamics going forward but really it s too early to make any assessments in that regard operator and we ll go to brett hundley with seaport global brett hundley seaport global analyst i actually wanted to stay on that same topic and ask the question a little bit differently so same competitor news from last week about the repurposing my question has to do with the draft guidance that you guys mentioned from the fda on allulose and whether or not this could lead ingredion to make some finishing changes to here in united states you guys are formally in the process of adding allulose capabilities in mexico right now but can you talk about any desires to maybe follow through on this in the u s and then whether or not that could further display some meaningful amount of core product production at any of your american facilities jim zallie president and chief executive officer yes i mean we re obviously very excited about what the potential for allulose offers especially now with this fdi fda issued draft guidance which again would exclude allulose from being labeled in total and added sugars on nutrition labels so that we feel lends itself very well also with the strong demand for sugar reduction solutions in mexico where it s already approved not to be added as a sugar as well as now in the united states so we re very enthused about that and we do think we re going to have very strong customer receptivity starting in early 2020 so looking forward we ll continue to evaluate how the market develops and we ve got a great partner in matsutani with great technology in this space they ve been researching rare sugars for 15 years so we ll look to it we ll continue to evaluate it and our intent is to grow to have this be as a central part of our growth platform for sugar reduction so i think one step at a time we want to get the customer wins under our belt in 2020 and then we ll evaluate and it ll be part of our strategic investment certainly going forward with the great partner brett hundley seaport global analyst ok and then i do have a question about the drop off in volumes in north america i m admittedly a little confused there i know you re talking to stockton as the reasoning but i m curious if there was any follow through on business loss from closing stockton because if i go back and look at the numbers and just look at two years stack performance for volumes inside north america your volume change in q1 was a minus call it 1 5 over two years and then in q4 of last year it was plus 3 5 or higher on a two year basis and i went back and looked at your script from q4 and you guys were talking about how other parts of your business had offset volume declines from stockton at that point so with stockton presumably closed during q4 i don t understand why that would be a reason for a sequential volume falloff for q1 and so i m just trying to understand the change a little bit better or maybe i m misunderstanding jim zallie president and chief executive officer yes i m just going to just mention one thing just for clarification sake and then jim can comment from his perspective just to kind of correct the record in relationship to the stockton closure the stockton closure i guess you could say officially closed in december month it was i think officially closed in november mid november or something like that and then you take into account the holidays so really it wasn t for the full quarter of quarter 4 so jim do you want to comment just on volume because we are attributing certainly the majority or if not all of it on the back of the shed jim gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yes and brett i mean as we purposely thought about serving the customers on the west coast really we saw probably some of that shed really start to hit us mid and midway through q1 for what we kind of purposely went after we were very much ok with serving and retaining customers from other sourcing locations be it cedar rapids or other plants and the midwest as we have been used stockton as a break station to get out there i think maybe overall if you look at kind of a two year trend one of the things that we didn t call out in 18 was that generally there was some weaker sweetener volume mostly attributable to kind of hf 55 into beverages so i m just wondering if as you gain more time and a little more data you might have seen that that s stepped down from 17 to 18 played out and then we ll see kind of a different run rate for 2019 as we go forward for hf brett hundley seaport global analyst ok i mean that makes sense i mean really quickly do you feel like hf is falling off incrementally here as we move into this summer compared to last summer jim zallie president and chief executive officer no i think it s saying it s declining at the jim gray executive vice president and chief financial officer long term historical rate jim zallie president and chief executive officer yes yes yes brett hundley seaport global analyst ok that s helpful and then just one quick one for me and then i ll get out of here is korea do you have a view on and when korean corn could moderate a little bit or your ability to get corn in there i think getting corn in there from outside is a little bit more structurally tough but can you just give us an update on when corn cost can moderate there because i hear you it would be nice to see some of your reboot come through from your recovery in thailand as well as some of the mix changes that you ve made in asia so i think some of us are very really expecting that margin profile to get better i just didn t realize that korean corn cost would be this big of a hit jim zallie president and chief executive officer it s really a continuation from q3 and q4 of last year so i think once we get through q2 we ll start to see much better net corn cost into korea as well as our other asia pac countries in the second half operator and we ve no further questions in queue i ll turn it back to the company for any closing comments jim zallie president and chief executive officer ok well i just wanted to thank everybody for joining us today and we look forward to seeing you in the near future thank you so much operator duration 43 minutes call participants heather kos vice president investor

venezuela what a mess despite how bad things are right now i think that venezuela could become happy in prosperous in a very short time and become the wealthiest country in latin america within fifteen years or even ten in 1948 what you are now seeing in venezuela hyperinflation and general economic collapse was happening in germany and japan two years later both countries economies were roaring to life and they continued roaring throughout the 1950s and 1960s they were among the greatest economic comebacks of all time venezuela could do the same today the solutions implemented in germany and japan were very similar first in 1948 49 the hyperinflationary mark and yen were linked to the dollar at fixed rates since the dollar itself was linked to gold at 35 oz within the bretton woods system this meant that the mark and yen were effectively linked to gold stable money second both germany and japan had huge tax reductions in 1948 1950 and followed up with several more rounds of tax cuts in the 1950s and 1960s third price controls rationing labor restrictions and other socialistic interventions were eliminated in 1948 49 fourth in 1948 49 both germany and japan outlawed all deficit spending and bond issuance to eliminate the urge to finance the government with the printing press the government was to spend out of current income only i described this process in japan in more detail in gold the once and future money 2007 and for germany in the magic formula 2019 the solution for venezuela must involve what i ve called the magic formula low taxes and stable money the stable money aspect should include a link to a major international currency probably the dollar although the euro could also be used this should be either a formal currency board such as used by bulgaria or adoption of the currency itself i e dollarization or euroization unfortunately such a step would probably induce some fears of excessive political influence by the united states or eu and these fears have some justification however venezuela could adopt a dollar linked currency board or even dollarize without any other u s influence on policy hong kong today which is of course part of china has a dollar based currency board el salvador is dollarized but maintains its sovereign independence in other spheres the introduction of euro based currency boards in estonia and bulgaria stopped hyperinflation overnight for low taxes i suggest an aggressive approach that is suited to venezuela s present crisis condition a review of successful emerging market economies around the world shows a common pattern of a tax revenue gdp ratio between 10 and 20 although developed economies often have a revenue gdp ratio much higher than this they do not have high growth economies france or denmark can stagnate in apparent comfort with these heavy taxes but when such systems are applied to emerging markets the result tends to be stagnation at poverty levels for venezuela to get rich the tax burden or revenue gdp ratio should be in the teens the next question is what is the best way to generate this level of tax revenue i suggest that venezuela should have a one tax system a vat of 20 this is only a little above today s vat of 16 in venezuela and all the administrative structures are already in place the present personal income tax 34 top rate corporate income tax 34 top rate and payroll tax 24 5 combined can be eliminated with the addition of a few other taxes such as property taxes or tariffs the result should be a revenue gdp ratio around 15 18 this is enough to provide basic government services and also some social services including public education health and welfare it is about the same as china and singapore today with no income or payroll taxes and stable money in the form of a dollar link venezuela should be one of the best places to do business in the world gdp would quickly grow and with that tax revenue would also grow which would allow a broader range of government services people have little idea how much an economy can grow when it has the magic formula between 1994 and 2004 china s economy in terms of nominal u s dollars grew 24 times larger tax revenue naturally also got about 24 times larger but this sort of thing has happened before between 1950 and 1970 japan s economy got about sixteen times larger nathan lewis with low taxes and stable money in place there would be no more need for the various socialistic band aids that seem necessary in an environment of hyperinflationary collapse price controls rationing restrictions on hiring and firing and other such measures can be eliminated overnight in 1948 the german government announced on the radio that price controls and rationing would be eliminated german citizens were surprised to hear that the changes would apply the next morning in the next ten months industrial production grew 71 nathan lewis the last element in the successful german japanese example was a hard ban on all government deficit spending and bond issuance until 1965 all japanese government bond issuance was outlawed the country had no government debt but the soaring economy quickly produced so much tax revenue that they had to have a special meeting each year a supplementary budget to get rid of the excess money they cut taxes further and also increased their spending plans especially on public works hong kong which combined its dollar currency board with a 16 flat tax and a tax revenue gdp ratio of 13 enjoyed so much revenue that not only did it have no government debt but years of budget surpluses accumulated into a fiscal reserve of assets that was recently 67 of gdp i would add one more principle for venezuela fifth ignore everything the international monetary fund says i would normally add the world bank also but david malpass the world bank s new president would probably agree with every element in my plan the magic formula works it worked for germany it worked for japan and it would work for venezuela today
stop feeding the chinese empire â belt and roadâ trojan horse whoever has an army has power mao zedong in march italy broke ranks with its eu partners in joining china s belt and road initiative known also as one belt one road or the new silk road students of history know the original silk road refers to the ancient network of trading routes between china and europe which served as both a conduit for the movement of goods and an exchange of ideas for centuries the new silk road is the term for an ambitious trade corridor first proposed by the chinese regime under its current president xi jinping in 2013 the grand design also known confusingly as the belt and road initiative bri is a belt of overland corridors and a road of shipping lanes it consists of a vast network of railways pipelines highways and ports that would extend west through the mountainous former soviet republics and south to pakistan india and southeast asia so far over 60 countries containing two thirds of the world s population have either signed onto bri or say they intend to do so according to the center for foreign relations the chinese government has already spent about 200 billion on the growing list of mega projects projects including the 68 billion china pakistan economic corridor morgan stanley predicts china s expenditures on bri could climb as high as 1 3 trillion by 2027 the belt and road initiative is seen by proponents as an economic driver of proportions never seen before in human history it would not only allow asia to relieve its infrastructure bottleneck ie an 800 billion annual shortfall on infrastructure spending but bring less developed neighboring nations into the modern world by providing a growing market of 1 38 billion chinese consumers opponents argue that is naive and the real intent of bri is to carve new chinese spheres of influence in asia that will replace the united states in debt poor nations to china for decades and restore china to its former imperial glory this article leans heavily towards the latter interpretation of bri particularly its linkages between china s industrial and military build up it explains why belt and road is really a dangerous trojan horse hiding behind china s territorial ambitions that should be resisted especially by vulnerable countries that are risking long term debt servitude the new silk road the silk routes connected china india tibet the persian empire the mediterranean countries and parts of north and east africa the 7 000 mile silk road begins at the chinese city of x an formerly chang an when it reaches dunhuang the silk road splits into three routes the southern route central route and and northern route these trade routes spread throughout the xinjiang uygur autonomous region and extended as far as pakistan india and even rome the silk road routes were established during the han dynasty which opened trade to the west in 130 bc and they lasted until 1453 ad when the ottoman empire boycotted trade with china and closed them the han extended the great wall of china to protect the movement of chinese goods along the silk road the maritime silk road was a network of shipping lines from the red sea to east africa india china and southeast asia the network consisted of ship routes in two general directions the east china sea routes and the south china sea routes the east china sea routes connected the chinese mainland to the northeast asian regions of the liaodong peninsula the korean peninsula and the japanese islands the south china sea route heads down then up through the malacca straits into the bay of bengal opening up china to the coasts of the indian ocean the red sea the persian gulf and the african continent these shipping lanes are still in use as mentioned the belt part of the belt and road initiative introduced by president xi jinping in 2013 refers to a network of overland road and rail routes and oil natural gas pipelines planned to run along the major eurasian land bridges china mongolia russia china central and west asia china indochina peninsula china pakistan bangladesh china india myanmar they ll stretch from xi an in central china through central asia reaching as far as moscow rotterdam and venice the road is a network of ports and other coastal infrastructure projects from south and southeast asia to east africa and the northern mediterranean sea china is already the world s largest consumer of commodities why does it need to build a belt and road there are a few reasons the first as mentioned is to construct physical infrastructure such as railways roads and bridges that will help the region to meet its 800 billion annual infrastructure shortfall estimated by the asian development bank china would also build 50 special economic zones modeled after the shenzhen special economic zone first launched in 1980 under economic reformer president deng xiaoping less benevolently bri would allow china to expand the use of the chinese currency the yuan something we have written about as the global influence of the us dollar as the world s reserve currency wanes according to the centre for foreign relations bri is also a central tenet of xi jinping s pushback against obama s pivot to asia contain china by extending us ties to southeast asia and distancing himself from his predecessors who followed deng s philosophy bide your strength bide your time for xi the waiting is over the time for imperialist expansion is now political aspirations an asia geopolitical expert says that while the new silk road satisfies a number of economic goals for china including expanding its supply chains accessing overseas labor and preventing massive layoffs when companies run out of domestic infrastructure to build the over riding goal is regional influence richard javad heydarian author of asia s new battlefield the usa china and the struggle for the western pacific writes above all however it allows china to lock in precious mineral resources and transform nations across the eurasian land mass and indian ocean into long term debtors a leading credit rating agency recently warned that the obor is driven primarily by china s efforts to extend its global influence where genuine infrastructure needs and commercial logic might be secondary to political motivations the result is what one observer aptly described as debt trap diplomacy since some nations end up piling up unsustainable debts to china meanwhile larger nations such as india have raised concerns over china s geopolitical intensions since the project runs through the disputed kashmir region other countries from indonesia to the philippines and nigeria have raised concerns over the quality of chinese infrastructure investments their compliance with good governance and environmental regulations and beijing s tendency to employ not only chinese technology and engineers but also chinese labourers for overseas projects debt trap so far we have learned the 5ws of the belt and road initiative it s easy to see how the trillion dollar infrastructure network benefits china but what about the 60 odd nations who have said they want in what s in it for them the huge projects need to be paid for somehow china s idea is for chinese state owned firms to build the infrastructure paid for by participating countries those who can t afford it and that is most of them would be offered inexpensive loans and credit it s no different from banks offering rock bottom interest rates to homeowners whose incomes are below that needed to support a mortgage chinese state owned banks and china led international financial institutions like the asian infrastructure investment bank aiib would shoulder the debt burden china has set up an initial 40 billion silk road fund while the aiib is allocating an additional 50 billion but the loans come with huge risks in 2017 when sri lanka couldn t pay off its chinese creditors beijing took control of colombo a strategic port through a 99 year lease by the end of 2018 nearly a quarter of sri lanka s foreign debt was owed to china the money accepted for around 8 billion worth of ports and highways planned through bri some countries have scaled back or canceled bri projects due to the specter of unsustainable debt burdens states al jazeera hopefully italy is aware of the risks the southern european country is heavily in debt and went into recession last year it reportedly wants to re balance sino italian trade by exporting more to china it is the 13th eu member country that has signed an mou with china regarding bri but the first g7 nation to do so sparking condemnation from the united states which is engaged in a trade war with china and the eu which earlier this year branded china a systemic rival and wants to restrict chinese investment in europe al jazeera said military buildup is it a coincidence that the chinese president xi jingping is racing around trying to sign countries onto bri while at the same time posing for photos in full military uniform saluting chinese soldiers we don t think so tuesday was the 70th anniversary of the founding of the people s liberation army pla and the chinese navy did not squander the opportunity to show its latest show of power a stealth destroyer according to a reuters story the combat ready 10 000 ton nanchang 101 is armed with 113 vertical launch sales able to fire hhq 0 surface to air missiles yj 18 anti cruise missiles and cj 10 land attack cruise missiles we have written extensively on the escalating tensions between the us and china in the south china sea where china holds historical claims despite international treaties to the contrary ie the un convention on the law of the sea china has been dredging seabed and building islands on which it has constructed outposts including missile batteries despite claims of ownership by vietnam malaysia philippines taiwan and brunei ongoing maneuvers demonstrate that beijing is willing to flex its muscles in a region it sees as strategically and economically important china is increasing its military drills around japan with japanese interceptors scrambled 638 times within a year against chinese aircraft according to japan s annual military white paper there are also frequent tensions in the taiwan strait the body of water separating china and taiwan a us ally the united states supplies weapons to taiwan despite not having diplomatic relations with the island and its government china sees taiwan as a breakaway territory that must be re united with the chinese mainland its independence is not recognized by beijing a forced reunification between china and taiwan would almost certainly cause a war between china and the us meanwhile china continues to expand its military a year ago it was reported that china planned to boost military spending by 8 1 in 2018 compared to a 7 increase in 2017 a reuters in depth report on how china is displacing america as the world s predominant military power in asia is required reading for anyone interested in how the geopolitical balance of power in the north pacific is shifting it details how xi jinping is overhauling the pla which includes the navy by pouring more resources into the navy and ridding the pla s ranks of corruption in just over two decades china has built a force of conventional missiles that rival or outperform those in the u s armory china s shipyards have spawned the world s biggest navy which now rules the waves in east asia beijing can now launch nuclear armed missiles from an operational fleet of ballistic missile submarines giving it a powerful second strike capability and the pla is fortifying posts across vast expanses of the south china sea while stepping up preparations to recover taiwan by force if necessary for the first time since portuguese traders reached the chinese coast five centuries ago china has the military power to dominate the seas off its coast conflict between china and the united states in these waters would be destructive and bloody particularly a clash over taiwan according to serving and retired senior american officers and despite decades of unrivaled power since the end of the cold war there would be no guarantee america would prevail the u s could lose said gary roughead co chair of a bipartisan review of the trump administration s defense strategy published in november we really are at a significant inflection point in history industry military connection we know that china is planning a huge infrastructure buildout in its trillion dollar bri involving some 60 odd countries and we know that beijing is at the same time bulking up its military what we don t know is if the two are related is china covertly funneling money from bri into its military in december 2018 the new york times reported on a secret proposal to expand a program by the pakistani air force by building chinese military jets weaponry and other hardware there would also be increased cooperation between china and pakistan in space where rocket propelled technology often overlaps with the military according to the article the military projects were designated as part of china s belt and road initiative in response to that claim cnbc quoted michael fuchs a senior fellow at the center for american progress and a former u s deputy assistant secretary of state for east asian and pacific affairs from 2013 to 2016 that doesn t necessarily mean the chinese military will use the entire bri to its advantage but it will certainly tap into a number of projects he added bri infrastructure schemes in member countries such as pakistan sri lanka and djibouti are all about giving access to china s military he said a 2018 report by c4ads a us based research group sought to tease out whether china s portrayal of bri as strictly economic is true as explained by south china morning post the report looked at 15 chinese funded port projects in bangladesh sri lanka cambodia australia oman malaysia indonesia djibouti and elsewhere in the indo pacific region it found that the projects were not win win for china and the host countries as china claimed rather the investments appear to generate political influence stealthily expand china s military presence and create an advantageous strategic environment in the region the report stated resource raids of course none of this should come as a shock if we look at how china has repeatedly sought raw materials necessary to feed its resource ravenous economy we ve covered how china is locking up critical resources in the us s own backyard we also know that bri whatever china s motivations is going to require a hell of a lot more mined commodities it doesn t have an abundance of like copper zinc iron ore etc mining com reported in under 10 years the number of china headquartered mining companies with assets in africa went from just a handful in 2006 to 120 in 2015 two high profile examples are the acquisition by china general nuclear power corporation of the husab uranium project in namibia and zijin mining s involvement 39 6 in the massive kamoa kakula copper deposit in the drc while iron ore and copper have been the hot targets of overseas acquisitions by chinese firms the chinese have also gone after gold nickel tin and coking coal more recently the most desired metals are those that feed into the tectonic global shift from fossil fuels to the electrification of vehicles china molybdenum bought the tenke copper and cobalt mine in the democratic republic of congo for 2 65 billion in an effort to secure a supply of cobalt for ev batteries last summer china s ganfeng lithium paid chilean state lithium miner 87 5 million for sqm s 50 stake in the cauchari olaroz lithium project in argentina the purchase means china now effectively controls half of the world s lithium production necessary for lithium ion batteries conclusion china s ascent from an economic backwater to a 21st century superpower is nothing short of incredible within 30 years the country whose citizenry was oppressed impoverished and riding around on bicycles is now the world s biggest consumer of mined commodities influences real estate markets worldwide just look at vancouver and has obscenely rich people driving 100 000 luxury cars except for its horrible air quality china is now the envy of many poorer countries but that doesn t mean they should roll over and let china take advantage of its weaker brethren the belt and road initiative is not some modern day asian version of the marshall plan the united states had obvious economic motivations in giving 12 billion to help rebuild western europe but there was also the strategic imperative of helping europe to get back on its feet in order to contain a rising ussr no such threat exists with bri china has no reason to come to its neighbors aid with multi billion dollar infrastructure loans other than to gain economic and political influence over them sure there may be some programs where it s a win win but it appears the deck is way stacked against bri host nations where the outcome will almost certainly leave china the clear winner as uncle ben in spider man said with great power comes great responsibility that assumes that the one wielding the power

points to 36 4 and operating cash flow is up 6 to 286 million by all accounts this is a solid quarter and customers are responding well to our enterprise information management products or eim to our enterprise ready cloud and to our vision of the intelligent and connected enterprise our enterprise world europe and asia events this quarter underscore all of this with over 2 000 attendees 500 partners 100 sessions and 60 exhibitors our revenue growth was driven by demand within our core offerings of content services and business networks and the emerging importance of our security and ai products the demand was both cloud and off cloud our margin expansion was driven by additional scale and efficiencies in our cloud and support businesses as well as product mix our cloud margin expanded 160 basis points year over year as we look longer term there continues to be ample opportunities to expand our margin we take the approach that the best run companies keep getting better year over year and we plan to keep improving and expanding year to date our adjusted ebitda is 38 5 already entering our fiscal 2021 aspirational range of 38 to 40 we ended the quarter with 765 million in cash and a net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio of 1 7 times this is the strongest level in eight quarters and we have ample m a capacity given this incredible execution progress and outlook we are raising our quarterly dividend by 15 today from 0 1518 to 0 1746 per share six years ago we started our dividend program our first year dividend was 71 million our last four quarter dividends totaled 163 million and we have returned to shareholders a total of 667 million to date our capital allocation strategy continues to target returning 20 of our trailing 12 month operating cash flows to shareholders via our dividend program please note that going forward we plan to more naturally align our annual dividend review with our annual results earning call so that means our next annual dividend review will be during our q4 fiscal 20 call not during our q3 fiscal 20 earnings call we ll remind everyone as we get closer to the date we think that alignment to our annual calendar is a better way to do a dividend review the opentext leadership team is world class they executed very well within the quarter while also on boarding liaison and catalyst and to note both acquisitions are on target to be on the opentext operating model and be fully integrated within the first 12 months it has also been eight quarters since we acquired the ecd documentum division from dell emc let s reflect on our incredible progress we re now number one in content services our core market with a 15 billion total addressable market or tam delivered double digit cloud growth stellar margins 38 5 adjusted ebitda year to date 647 million ocf year to date ample m a capacity we ve rapidly de levered and have returned to our pre acquisition net debt to adjusted ebitda levels as i noted earlier we re currently at 1 7 times and through time we have now returned 667 million in cash dividends and growing far more than our 600 million equity offering in december 2016 we delivered these results by putting in action the opentext business system there are five key wins i d like to highlight from the quarter as they reflect our strategy and our continued focus as an eim software company tata steel is a global provider of iron and steel generating approximately 20 billion in revenues tata will be leveraging the open text business network to digitize their supply chains it is a large and complex supply chain of sourcing subcontractors engineers manufacturers buyers and sellers norton rose fulbright is a global law firm of over 4 000 professionals and approximately 2 billion of revenues norton rose will be leveraging our legaltech software to provide advanced analytics and machine learning for legal review and discovery of critical evidence ntt data is a multinational system integration company with 118 000 employees and approximately 19 billion in revenues ntt data will be leveraging our content services platform for its clients worldwide the european parliament is extremely important in today s world as the binding party for eu policy governance and law reflecting 40 languages hundreds of parliamentary members and over 11 000 employees the european parliament is standardizing on opentext content services and our information platform canada is among the top 10 economies of the world 1 8 trillion in annual commerce 400 000 government employees a g7 country and the home both physically and culturally to opentext we are proud to announce that we have won the next generation digital platform for the government of canada these q3 wins highlight our strategy execution around the global 10 000 or g10k for short the g10k are the world s largest companies typically those greater than 2 billion in revenues as well as the world s largest governments and organizations this is the marquee market for eim in organic growth to date we re only one third penetrated in the g10k and we can more than double opentext in the coming years by focusing on and connecting the g10k to our information platform let me also comment on our professional services we run and operate one of the industry s most effective and profitable ps businesses over the last year we ve partnered more with global system integrators we have discontinued low margin contracts we inherited from acquisitions and more work is becoming standardized and moving into the opentext cloud within q3 we delivered 71 million of revenues at 21 margins you should expect the same levels of revenue here in q4 finally let me provide a brief update on our irs matter the irs matter is following a standard irs process and we are now entering the appeals phase as the matter has progressed and we begin to enter the next phase time has strengthened our resolve we remain steadfast in our position that the irs is wrong and we are vigorously defending our position let me transition my remarks to fiscal 19 and the annual nature of our business we plan on an annual basis we measure ourselves annually our recurring revenue is just that annual or arr we typically deliver large product releases annually and our customers budget annually while thinking over multi year periods we re an annual business and running our business on an annual cycle allows us to make better long term strategic and operational decisions centered on value creation quarters will vary any low single digit quarterly variance is not meaningful in the context of our annual business i m excited about the growing basis of our annual recurring revenues in fiscal 09 10 years ago fiscal 09 our annual recurring revenues was 405 million we have grown arr every year over the last 10 years including this year our arr this fiscal year is on track to be greater than 2 billion representing 400 growth over the last 10 years we re also on target for our fiscal 19 business plan and we re on target for our fiscal 19 target ranges and our fiscal 21 aspirations on our next earnings call we ll recap fiscal 19 and highlight fiscal 20 targets as well as provide updated 3 year aspirations that will then include fiscal 2022 on our current annual trend fiscal 19 will be a strong year for arr cloud revenues adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda dollars and cash flow next let us go through our q4 quarterly factors as a reminder our quarterly factors are those key items for you to factor into your short term financial modeling the items are important but tactical and these items do not affect the long term nature of our business our q4 factors include the following global recession concerns continue we all read the same newspapers we see the same concern around trade wars tariffs goods and wage inflation prolonged brexit uncertainty gdpr and data regulation concerns secondly the u s dollar continues to be strong against the euro pound canadian dollar and yen expect a q4 negative revenue impact of approximately 20 million usd due to fx when compared to the prior year third our business is annual as i said earlier and quarters will vary given strong execution in q3 do not expect the historical sequential revenue uplift in q4 compared to q3 expect ps revenues to be consistent sequentially and q3 revenues were 71 million also q4 is the last quarter of the fiscal year expect operating expenses to be up quarter over quarter 4 to 6 given end of year expenses and though q4 is a seasonally higher quarter for adjusted ebitda it is historically lower than q2 and consistent with last quarter we expect liaison to negatively impact adjusted ebitda by approximately 100 bps in q4 looking beyond the short term now my fourth topic is to talk about the longer term the next 12 to 24 months and how we plan on competing growing and creating value let me step back and look at the big picture our business is incredibly strong we have market leading retention rates in our support business powerful product releases and incredible customer loyalty our core business is tremendous and it is about 75 recurring and coming from highly predictable revenue sources this will grow stronger as more workloads and customers move to the open text cloud as more digital transformation happens as security requirements grow and the market transitions to industry 4 0 and customers rely not just on automation but ai and machine learning as well our flagship offering of release 16 will have enhancement pack 6 or ep6 delivered to customers this month release 16 ep6 has intelligent capture continuous endpoint monitoring wider integrations to all major erp and crm providers our cloud suite 19 2 includes a new identity access management platform application to application integration and new track and trace capabilities ot2 has a large update for industry applications and financial services pharma legal and retail we re already managing over 1 5 million trading partners 30 million endpoints and 60 million identities all in the opentext cloud we built a comprehensive horizontal market leading information platform for digital transformation over the last five years via the opentext business system we have deployed 4 5 billion in capital and 1 3 billion in r d creating our intelligent information platform we will continue to run our opentext business system playbook we ll continue to acquire strategically to then integrate and then to innovate and deepen and strengthen our intelligent information platform for customers we are now on the other side of an inflection point an important milestone where we can self fund our core m a high margin and effective tax rate low capex and strong cash flows has put us into this new and powerful zone of self funding core m a the world s most trusted companies trust opentext to transform into industry 4 0 let me wrap up my prepared remarks q3 is a continuation of our total growth strategy growth from acquisitions and growth from organic execution it was a solid q3 and we re on plan for fiscal 19 the open text cloud remains our greatest opportunity our enterprise cloud strategy is scaling into a 1 billion business our annual recurring businesses will be north of 2 billion this fiscal year and our adjusted ebitda year to date is already in our fiscal 2021 aspirational range of 38 to 40 we are well on track to a record fiscal year for annual operating cash flow and a return of capital since the inception of our dividend program we have returned to shareholders 667 million and given our confident outlook as we mentioned earlier we are raising our annual dividend by 15 we are the market leader in both of our core markets of content services and business networks our roadmap has never been stronger with additions like ot2 intelligent capture new iam and liaison application to application integration our total addressable market is 100 billion we have a strong balance sheet and getting stronger with ample m a capacity to deploy on the right target at the right roic our m a pipeline is active our r d pipeline is strong i m sure i ll see many of you before our global enterprise world event i hope you can make the toronto event july 9 sir tim berners lee the inventor of the world wide web will be joining me at enterprise world and sir tim will be outlining a compelling vision of what s next over the world wide web we look forward to our very bright future and thank you for the support of opentext it s my pleasure to hand the call over to our cfo madhu madhu madhu ranganathan executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you mark and hello and thank you all for joining us today q3 s results strongly reflect our collective efforts to maintain upper quartile operational performance including integration work on two acquisitions the results show consistent and significant improvement over last year across all key metrics now turning to details of our quarterly and year to date results and similar to prior quarters my references will be in millions of usd and compared to the same period in a prior fiscal year as you will see from our results the impact of foreign exchange was significant and broad across all lines of revenue at 19 million during the quarter and 31 million year to date given the strength of the usd since the start of our fiscal 2019 total revenues for the quarter were 719 million up 4 9 or up 7 7 on a constant currency basis as we continue to look at our business on an annual basis year to date total revenues were 2 1 billion up 2 9 or up 4 5 on a constant currency basis the geographical split of revenues in the quarter was americas 61 emea 30 and apj 9 annual recurring revenues were 549 million for the quarter up 5 4 or up 7 8 on a constant currency basis year to date annual recurring revenues were 1 6 billion up 4 7 from last year or up 6 on a constant currency basis annual recurring revenues as a percentage of total revenues remain solid at 76 4 and 75 4 respectively for the quarter and year to date our cloud revenues were particularly strong in the quarter at 239 million up 14 1 or up 16 1 on a constant currency basis we also generated 63 8 million in new mcv up compared to 52 7 million in q3 last year year to date cloud revenues were 666 million up 9 from last year or up 10 on a constant currency basis cloud renewals remain in the mid 90s range our customer support revenues were 311 million down 0 5 or up 2 3 on a constant currency basis year to date customer support revenues were 933 million up 1 8 from last year or up 3 3 on a constant currency basis our customer support renewal rate was consistent with prior quarters and prior years at approximately 91 our license revenues were 99 million up 17 4 or up 22 2 on a constant currency basis year to date license revenues were 308 million up 3 6 from last year or up 5 9 on a constant currency basis our professional service revenues were 71 million down 11 6 or down 8 4 on a constant currency basis year to date professional service revenues were 215 million down 9 3 from last year or down 7 1 on a constant currency basis turning to the details of our margin performance in q3 gaap gross margin for the quarter was 67 up 210 basis points over the same period last year our adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 73 up 140 basis points over the same quarter last year and primarily driven by scale and product mix cloud was 57 up from 55 last year customer support was 90 up from 89 last year our license margin was 97 up from 96 last year and professional services margin was 21 up from 20 last year fx had a negative impact on adjusted gross margin in the quarter by approximately 14 million our adjusted ebitda was 262 million this quarter up 15 year over year adjusted ebitda margin was 36 4 an increase of 320 basis points compared to 33 2 in the prior fiscal year and driven by our deep operating lens into the business as well as the restructuring activities we first announced in our q1 call year to date adjusted ebitda was 816 million up 10 5 compared to the same period last year adjusted ebitda margin year to date was 38 5 an increase of 270 basis points compared to 35 8 in the same period last year gaap net income for the quarter was 73 million up 0 27 per share on a diluted basis up from 59 million or 0 22 per share for the same period last year year to date gaap net income was 214 million or 0 79 per share on a diluted basis up from 181 million or 0 68 per share for the same period last year our adjusted net income in the quarter was 173 million up 18 6 year over year or up 21 2 on a constant currency basis year to date adjusted net income was 550 million up 12 compared to the same period last year or up 12 5 on a constant currency basis our adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were 0 64 on a diluted basis up 18 5 from 0 54 per share for the same period last year year to date our adjusted earnings per share was 2 04 up 10 9 from 1 84 for the same period last year our operating cash flows for the quarter were 286 million up 5 7 year over year year to date operating cash flows were 647 million up 28 3 from the same period last year and turning to the balance sheet we had 765 million in cash net of the 70 million payment for catalyst our consolidated net leverage ratio at 1 7 times is well within our external debt covenant ratio of four times and provides us with meaningful flexibility to execute on our total growth strategy in the third quarter dso was 60 days and compared to 67 days in the same quarter last year we achieved record quarterly collections in the quarter and overall a huge applause to the opentext teams for achieving such outstanding cash flow results while integrating two acquisitions in the quarter we continue to learn from and optimize our cash management framework on dividend as mark indicated in his remarks we are very pleased to be raising our quarterly dividend by 15 today up from 0 1518 to 0 1746 per share our dividend program continues to be a very important component of our capital allocation strategy and now for perspectives on our operating model as mark outlined we remain on track to our fiscal 2019 target model which as a reminder is included in our investor presentation on our ir website so let me summarize and reiterate the quarterly factors that we anticipate for our fiscal q4 q3 was negatively impacted by fx of 19 million as we look at where the rates are today as well as geographical level components of our business we expect fx headwind in q4 of approximately 20 million given strong execution in q3 do not expect historical sequential uplift in q4 compared to q3 ps revenues in q4 to remain constant sequentially and q3 ps revenues of 71 million as the last quarter of our fiscal year in q4 we expect operating expenses to be up quarter over quarter in the range of 4 to 6 and given end of year expenses with respect to adjusted ebitda q4 is a seasonally higher quarter although historically lower than q2 and liaison is expected to negatively impact adjusted ebitda by approximately 100 basis points in q4 it is important to incorporate these quarterly factors as you model us for q4 note that liaison and catalyst remain on target to be on our operating model and to be fully integrated in the first 12 months on the interest expenses they remain as noted in our fiscal 19 target model of 144 million to 149 million and our adjusted tax rate remains at 14 so turning to our long term targets as mark mentioned with year to date adjusted ebitda margin at 38 5 and year to date operating cash flows at 647 we are strongly on our way to adjusted ebitda margin in fiscal 2021 of 38 to 40 and operating cash flows target of 1 billion annually as we exit fiscal 2021 on our next earnings call we look forward to recapping fiscal 2019 sharing highlights of our expectations for fiscal 2020 and provide updated 3 year aspirations to include 2022 at the start of the year we introduced our communication framework and quarterly factors to help you model opentext in a way that is closely aligned to how we see our business and within that framework there are two metrics at the end of each fiscal year that we will provide to you on a historical basis annual organic growth and return on invested capital or roic we will update you on both of these annual metrics during our next call so before i conclude i am really excited

meetings in canada and the united states please do connect with greg secord for more information so at this time i would like to open the call for your questions operator questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions our first question comes from phillip huang of barclays phillip huang barclays analyst hi thanks good afternoon a couple of quick ones from me first i think maybe a question for madhu on the strong license revenue i was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on that just given that it s a seasonally light quarter just based on your comments around the quarterly factors wanted to make sure i understood it correctly so that it was mainly driven by timing or pull forward of deals i was just wondering if it was at all driven by perhaps larger deal sizes or any other factors that you d point out mark j barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer phillip hi it s mark here i ll probably take the first one on the quarterly factors madhu yes hello madhu can certainly speak a little more deeply to the quarterly factors we had a strong quarter in both cloud and off cloud and it was driven by competing very effectively against ibm there s a new enterprise software landscape forming so we ve always been agnostic as we transitioned to the cloud and transitioned to our recurring revenue focused we are agnostic to how customers purchase whether it be a license to subscription managed service other options in our cloud but we re not calling out any larger deal q3 was a continuation of our total growth strategy both organically and acquisition i will note we are competing very effectively and when i called the new enterprise software landscape that has a shrinking ibm presence in it phillip huang barclays analyst got you madhu ranganathan executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you mark and do you want to expand on your question on the quarterly factors so that i phillip huang barclays analyst no just based on the comments around the sequential fiscal q3 to q4 not there because of the strong execution i was just trying to i guess piece together the puzzle whether it was driven by just a pull forward of deals into fiscal q3 and that s why we re not seeing the historical bump into q4 or was the strength driven by other factors that you would also point out i think mark answered part of the question on not calling out larger deal sizes but was wondering if there were any other factors that drove the strong license revenue this quarter madhu ranganathan executive vice president and chief financial officer right so mark i think addressed the license revenue i would just i mean i would just reiterate just when you look at q4 revenue right there are three factors one is the fx and we are looking at where we sit today at about 20 million impact to q4 and back to the overall strong execution in q3 license and the cloud it s important to not expect the same historical sequential uplift in q4 and of course professional services for all the reasons outlined we do expect a constant ps revenues between q3 and q4 mark j barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer i think the only thing i would add to madhu statement if i can is back to the remarks to the prepared remarks or an annual business right in any given quarter might vary a little here or there but we re very focused on the annual nature of the business and again it s all up to the question we re not calling out any big deals we competed second we competed very effective or competing very effectively when i called the new enterprise software landscape we re competing effectively against those incumbents like ibm and others and we ve got a strong outlook phillip huang barclays analyst got it that s very helpful and then just on the quickly on the global recessions concerns i know it s a very similar wording that you put in in the last quarterly factors as well was just wondering if you could give us an update on any visibility on potential impact to your pipeline i know you mentioned that there wasn t any that you ve noted in the last quarter so was wondering what your thoughts are for an update on that comment mark j barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer yeah we re keeping it in our quarterly factors we don t see a change yet to the trajectory of our business but i ll just continue to note you don t know where brexit still is going to land there are some there are headline news around growth in europe plateauing or shrinking slightly typically what you would see is either the close dates moving out deal size shrinking more approvals coming into place we re not seeing any of those statistical factors in our pipeline but i think it s healthy to kind of continue to call out a headline kind of bullet in this category phillip huang barclays analyst that s really helpful thanks very much mark j barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer thank you madhu ranganathan executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator our next question comes from richard tse of national bank financial richard tse national bank financial analyst yes thank you so i m attending a conference this week and the theme of this event has largely been this explosion of data it seems to be still a fairly big pain point for a lot of enterprises i m kind of just wondering in your role i think on the technology side as well what you see today as sort of your biggest challenges from your customers when it comes to data mark j barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer richard thanks thanks for the question i think i ll put my cto hat on for a moment little more of a cto question i think back 10 years ago i remember the headline mobile eats the world i think back a few years ago and we re all software companies right and maybe the headline this year or next year is we re all data companies and how can each company unlock their data and monetize excuse me leverage the data to make them smarter a more effective competitor in the market or to use their data or data exhaust to go out into the market and go sell and i think back over the last 10 years erp has really provided a processed advantage i think over the next 10 years a look at eim we re here to provide the information advantage so i think the biggest challenge right now when i look into the enterprise landscape is taking an inventory of the data is it in the right format and do i have the right tools to kind of unlock that data exhaust so i think the greatest challenge right now is i think everyone gets it they understand it the landscape is shifting from process automation to leveraging the data so we see trends like platform consolidation master data management getting data into a usable format picking the right algorithms right to make yourself better or can you then get to a next step to sell your data in the right way for that information advantage and then of course is it secure is it governed does it meet the right privacy so i think richard it s a great actual question and those are some of the immediate things that i see and i think we sit in a great place to help take advantage of it richard tse national bank financial analyst yes it sounds like you are and i guess the context of my question is that when you look at products that you have like magellan for instance do you think that we re in a position that your enterprise customers are currently evaluating it and we could see this potential that you kind of get a real material increase in those products and also what has the traction been like for magellan lately mark j barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer yes well i think there are two things the first is microsoft is a wide horizontal company you don t have the pharma version of word right or the paper and pulp version of excel right they re a wide horizontal platform opentext is a wide horizontal platform and we want to get into the global 10 000 and be the standard for the horizontal information platform we want their supply chain cash management content services we want to be the standard for that intelligent and information core for that wide horizontal platform and that is the largest opportunity in front of us to keep driving that type of penetration on top of that we re going to continue to deliver vertical applications ot2 is coming to market with healthcare financial services legal tech applications and then another pillar on top of that for a long term strategy is the ai and analytics with magellan and of course securing that platform as well so it s still early days with magellan it is contributing to the p l and it s a very strategic piece for us in the future richard tse national bank financial analyst okay great and just one last one from me with respect to the acquisitions have you changed the comfort level in terms of what your leverage ratio is i forgot what it was last quarter but if you d just remind us that d be great thank you mark j barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer yeah thanks richard no we still believe in the same ratios that we think up to three times leverage is a comfortable zone i think we all can take some confidence in looking back over the last two years there s one thing for a management team to say what they believe in and then deliver data points performance we said we would be comfortable going over that slightly in the short term and then rapidly de levering if we needed to so we went up to about 3 3 times when we completed the documentum emc acquisition and here we are eight quarters later sitting at 1 7 times of net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio so our philosophy is consistent hasn t changed of going up to three times and i think we can take confidence that if we do need to go above it we would rapidly de lever just as we have shown richard tse national bank financial analyst that s great thank you madhu ranganathan executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you as well operator our next question comes from walter pritchard of citi research walter pritchard citi research analyst hi thanks couple question here mark just on the ibm side i wonder if you could call out which areas of the business are you seeing that i mean obviously not a new trend but they took the best some asset this quarter i m curious which areas of the business are you seeing in particular that resonate positively in your sale pipeline and activity mark j barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer yes thanks walter i d say three areas the first is filenet we ve called out a few times where they have not been innovating as rapidly and the enterprise landscape is just changing excuse me let me correct myself has changed and that there really is a new set of enterprise software companies from slack servicenow i m putting ourselves in this category as well as companies look to get that information advantage versus a process advantage we ve turned our platform into a cloud ready platform containerized we have a saas version with ot2 we have deep application integration deep saas integration integration to sap to oracle to salesforce and we re just competing very effectively against a filenet the second area is ibm sterling commerce which is their commerce platform and the commerce platform has evolved it s evolved into an identity and access management platform we acquired covisint technologies and been able to bring in and bring version two and version three their identity and access platform and i think we re up to almost we re well over 10 million iot devices connected into our network our acquisition of liaison has put us into the market of any to any integration i hate to throw out examples like this but i ll use an example of mulesoft right where we now have a library of 10 000 canonical connectors where we can tie erp to erp cloud to cloud process to process within our business network so we re competing very effectively against ibm and sterling commerce and lastly the ibm cloud is sort of a clouds are not a place to go to just get a cost advantage it needs to be a platform of innovation and so i look at our cloud today and us being able to provide this full eim stack and yes we can provide a cost advantage and security but we can also now provide it as a platform for innovation for the next generation of workloads so these are the thee areas we re competing effectively content services commerce platform and the cloud walter pritchard citi research analyst got it and then maybe mark for you as you brought this up on the call around sort of a new era and other side of an inflection where you can self fund m a but then still mentioning the three times leverage is the takeaway here just as you get larger you can do bigger deals or should we expect i d almost think if you re talking about self funding you may be looking to take on less leverage going forward help us interpret what you were saying there mark j barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer yes i don t know if it all of the above look it s always the right deal at the right price with the right roic and it s really a very simple mantra for us and our pipeline is active as i like to say in small medium and large categories got to be the right company at the right price in the right roic our model is different than other companies we look to acquire integrate and innovate we ve delivered a we re delivering a horizontal platform so pipeline active we have ample capacity in general we think as a management philosophy up to three times leverage is a good ratio say it very simply if the world will go sideways i like to pay my debt off in three years right i mean that s the philosophy of a ratio and if we take our cash flows and just very simply take out interest take out dividend take out capex that puts us in a place to be able to self fund self perpetuate our core m a walter pritchard citi research analyst okay great thank you operator our next question comes from howard leung of veritas investment research howard leung veritas investment research analyst thank you and thanks taking my question i had a few of them the first one i ll start with is for the gross cloud margin they re kind of at the 56 57 level now for a few years can you maybe give some comments or some color around what could potentially drive it higher and what you see is the result is why it s kind of stayed at that level mark j barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer howard welcome and thanks for the question mark here so we delivered 56 5 cloud margin in the quarter up 150 basis points year over year and last quarter we were just under 60 in cloud margin look we re targeting medium term to be in the low 60s for our cloud margin and as we ve on boarded new acquisitions like liaison and catalyst and making investments to grow in the cloud cloud was 243 million in constant currency this quarter up 16 margins have dipped a little bit below 60 but all for the right reasons right to grow the cloud to on board a couple great acquisitions and note the margin is up year over year 150 basis points and our target range for the year is between 57 and 59 and we re smack in that range so it s right where we want it to be howard leung veritas investment research analyst okay that s very helpful and then the other one i wanted to touch on was on license revenues it looks like for the quarter based on the md a there was a 17 million impact from the 605 606 conversion and i think that was just kind of acceleration of some of the licenses upfront just want to find out for that 17 million how many licenses term licenses were sold that contributed to the 70 million mark j barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer howard a very detailed question let me start sort of at the conceptual piece so first and foremost for us it s all about how a customer wants to buy and we don t go into the global 10 000 and say you must buy this one way it s all around how a customer wants to procure and deploy so if they want to do that in our cloud off cloud license or in somebody else s cloud we re all in right for us it s all about the annual recurring revenue adjusted ebitda and cash flow so i ve just started at the principled level it s all about how a customer wants to procure second the 606 business it s all new business for us right these are brand new wins these are new contracts it s all new business for us and third there is no alternative it is gaap and it is the standard there is no alternative for us so i don t know if that answers your question or if there s another level to the question that you have howard leung veritas investment research analyst i mean i completely understand it s not an accounting choice at all it s just a change in the policy i was just wondering for these new licenses which you have signed for the quarter it s not in any way i guess pulling forward from future quarters it s just kind of new business that you guys won mark j barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer no new business new wins very good wins madhu ranganathan executive vice president and chief financial officer yes howard leung veritas investment research analyst yes now it looks very strong but this quarter so that s good thanks guys that was really helpful mark j barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer thank you howard appreciated madhu ranganathan executive vice president and chief financial officer and howard thank you as well howard leung veritas investment research analyst no problem operator our next question comes from stephanie price of cibc world markets stephanie price cibc world markets analyst good afternoon i just wanted to touch on services revenue for a minute mark i was hoping you can give us a bit of an update on your thoughts on that services business and maybe go into a bit more detail of the puts and takes that you mentioned in your prepared remarks mark j barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer yes sounds great thanks thanks stephanie and thanks for the question we run a very i think of our ps business sort of in three pillars pillar one is always accelerated time to value for the customer and we run one of the best ps organizations inside a software company our ps organization does an amazing job deploying our software getting accelerated time to value i d put our organization up against anyone s any day second is can you do that profitably and i look back to companies like bmc ca other large enterprise companies who had run their ps businesses at no to negative margin and that s just not in our philosophy it s not a loss leader it s a profit center because there s value that we re delivering for customers so regardless of our revenue levels we ve been able to deliver margins around 20 which is in the zone of the world s best run ps businesses the third sort of pillar if you will is the quantum of the revenue and we ve taken out the strategy that we re going to bring on more global system implementers like an ntt like tcs accenture deloitte others and they re going to go out and put us into their framework and we think we can grow the more strategic revenues of cloud by having that partnership we re going to give up some ps revenues to do that and that s perfectly ok second is as more work becomes standard in the cloud and it s configured it s self serviced you need less of the ps organization and that s fine as well and then thirdly we acquire businesses that don t quite have our philosophy of how to run a ps business and we need to wean ourselves off that and complete deployments and then move on so i mean those are the three reasons why ps is down slightly other revenues are up and it s all for the right strategic reasons stephanie price cibc world markets analyst great thanks and then in terms of your slide deck the slide on selected customer and product expansion seems to be growing here i m hoping you can talk about cross sell opportunities in the install base and whether they were a factor in the outperformance in the quarter mark j barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer yes we have thanks for pulling it out we have it in our investor deck and i m just reaching for it here slide 13 14 and 15 where we have selected customer and product expansions where we re kind of showing businesses like coca cola fujitsu gm nestle who are running multiple pillars for us look it is a key strategy for us is to have a strong portfolio of solutions to provide i d go back to some of my earlier comments around how we ve expanded our offering and companies like ibm have not in content services and or the business network i d say the strength in the quarter was again i d go back to our two core markets content services and business network and just keep widening the capabilities we re deploying stephanie price cibc world markets analyst great thank you very much mark j barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer thanks stephanie i ll look forward to joining cibc a may 14 madhu ranganathan executive vice president and chief financial officer yep thank you as well operator our next question comes from thanos moschopoulos of bmo capital markets thanos moschopoulos bmo capital markets analyst hi good afternoon with respect to your q4 outlook i m just a little unclear on your commentary so just to be very clear are you suggesting there will be no quarter on quarter revenue uptick or are you suggesting that there may be a quarterly revenue uptick but that it will be a more modest uptick than we ve seen historically for q4 mark j barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer there will be we expect an uptick just not as seasonally strong thanos moschopoulos bmo capital markets analyst okay great yeah that s what i thought i just wanted to confirm that point in terms of cash flows your cash flow was a obviously up year over year as you highlighted although your cash conversion of ebitda was lower than for q3 last year was that just because of a working capital drag from the two recent tuck in acquisitions madhu ranganathan executive vice president and chief financial officer yes thanos this is madhu i would say yes and some of the billings and the deferred revenue this quarter were also much higher right so that also contributed to the conversion but the conversion is still very high keep in mind thanos moschopoulos bmo capital markets analyst okay fair enough and just one last one from me was all the liaison catalyst revenue in the cloud services line or was it sprinkled in some other lines as well madhu ranganathan executive vice president and chief financial officer it s predominantly in the cloud services line thanos moschopoulos bmo capital markets analyst okay thanks i ll pass the line madhu ranganathan executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you as well mark j barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer yeah thanks operator our next question comes from paul treiber of rbc capital markets paul treiber rbc capital markets analyst thanks so much and good afternoon madhu ranganathan executive vice president and chief financial officer hi paul paul treiber rbc capital markets analyst hi there i don t want to beat a dead horse on this but you mentioned following that i remember before when they were public they had some very significant deals in the mid year range just hope he can put some bounds around the potential size of deals if you can confirm that there weren t any deals as large as in the figures mark j barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer yes filenet they ve been private a long time haven t they ve been private a long time thanos we re not calling out any larger deals in the quarter so i appreciate the commentary again we re competing very effectively in our two core markets and we re not here to call out any larger transaction paul treiber rbc capital markets analyst okay that s fair just turning to documentum or emc ecd when you mentioned that earlier how does the are you seeing documentum customers migrate to the latest versions of your products at a similar rate to the core opentext customers and also consider your cloud as a similar rate as your core business mark j barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer hey paul thanks for the question i can just say off the top of my head i m not seeing any real difference in a rate of upgrade or migration i ll have to go back and kind of check the data but i m pretty data sensitive but nothing s sort of jumping out at me as a different rate in terms of embracing the cloud this is a strong upsell opportunity for us and customers are looking i used this phrase a little earlier a platform for innovation and our cloud allows our customers to get the latest and greatest software to get a fuller stack of software to remove the burdens of security and compliance and management up time and really free their brains up to innovate so yes the ability to upsell managed services to upsell saas workloads is a strong opportunity for us in the documentum base paul treiber rbc capital markets analyst okay thanks for taking my question mark j barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer thank you paul operator our next question comes from steven li of raymond james steven li raymond james analyst hey guys i have a question for madhu so madhu given 606 has a positive impact on revenue recognition when you do your organic growth calculation next quarter would you be adjusting out the positive 606 impact given you re base in 2018 would be on 605 madhu ranganathan executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you for the question i d go back to what mark said earlier growth is growth and new business is new business and all of this is new business right so when we look at the q4 we are looking at new businesses and what i d probably point out is look at the 739 million of revenue in constant currency and even if you took the 21 million that we shared as sort of adjustment 605 to 606 it s 718 million and if you do apples to apples it was 686 million in q3 of last year but 698 for 605 adjusted we still grew from 698 million to 718 million and i would encourage that s how you think about growth steven li raymond james analyst okay thank you madhu ranganathan executive vice president and chief financial officer you re very welcome and thank you as well operator this concludes the question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to mr barrenechea for any closing remarks mark j barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer all right thank you madhu thank you greg thank you harry and thank you everyone for

which of these two developments strike you as a bigger risk to economy a an annual inflation rate of only 1 6 percent instead of the target of 2 percent or b a stock market levitating at record levels as a result of artificially low interest rates record levels of corporate indebtedness and stock buybacks an orgy of richly priced mergers and initial public offerings and a trillion dollar federal budget deficit at a time of full employment if you answered b then congratulations you pass the 10 second sanity test offered by the society of american economic historians if you answered a then you might want to apply for one of the two still open seats on the federal reserve board where you will feel right at home with other policymakers who appear to have learned nothing from the past four recessions advertisement over the past 30 years it s not a tightening of monetary policy by the fed in response to inflation that has caused recessions as was the pattern for most of the 20th century rather in the current era of low inflation it has been the failure to tighten monetary policy when asset bubbles develop that has led to recessions when those bubbles burst and bring the economy down with them that s what happened with the junk bond bubble and the savings and loan crisis of the late 1980s with the telecom and dot com bubble of the early 2000s and most recently the mortgage and real estate bubble that nearly brought down the financial system only a decade ago just before those crises the fed policymakers would assure us how fundamentally strong the economy was how inflation was well contained and how they would continue to be guided by the latest economic data but that for the moment everything was well in hand and while they were careful to acknowledge that some asset prices might be slightly higher than normal it was neither the job of the fed to set asset prices nor within its competence to distinguish a healthy bull market from bubble even if there were a bubble they argued these were problems best dealt with through targeted bank regulation rather than using the blunt instruments of monetary policy advertisement not surprisingly that was exactly the same script followed by chair jerome h powell this past week in explaining why the fed had left interest rates unchanged and why it would soon halt its efforts to soak up some of the 2 trillion it printed during the recent great recession to those old timers listening it felt like bill murray in the movie groundhog day indeed larry fink chairman of blackrock the world s largest asset management company said recently that it wasn t a meltdown on financial markets he was most worried about but a melt up which is just what has happened since the fed waved the white flag at the end of december and announced it was halting what was expected to be a long slow increase in interest rates after keeping them near zero for eight years back in december powell rationalized the surrender to himself and to the country as a response to sudden weakening economic data which in the end turned out to be transitory as evidenced by friday s news that 263 000 jobs were added to payrolls in april but in reality powell a former investment banker who remains closely attuned to signals from wall street hadn t been moved by the data he was spooked by the 20 percent drop in stock prices in the last quarter of 2018 advertisement in the context of an eight year bull run that had seen stock prices climb by 300 percent a 20 percent decline should have been viewed as the first phase of a necessary and welcome correction in asset prices but with president trump daily tweeting his displeasure and the wall street propaganda machine shifting into high gear to blame the fed for the coming recession powell and his colleagues lost their nerve declaring there would be no further rate hikes any time soon triumphant traders piled back into the market confident the powell fed had been whipped into submission share this article share there are of course times such as when consumer and business confidence is in a free fall and unemployment is heading toward double digits when it s the fed s job to try to put a floor under asset prices that s one of the well recognized channels through which monetary policy is supposed to work but doing so when the economy is operating at full capacity simply to add a few tenths of a percent to the inflation rate is monetary malpractice in today s global low inflation environment what the mandarins at the fed seem incapable of acknowledging is that they no longer control the cost or the supply of money in the economy and the financial system in the way they once did part of it is that global financial flows are so large that they can confound the policies of any one country s central bank even the fed advertisement and part of it is that with the unregulated shadow banking system responsible for more than half of all credit creation the financial system and the economy can be at risk even if the regulated banks are not in this new world the only way monetary policy can achieve its goals of economic and price stability is to use its interest rate policy to tame the boom and bust cycles of financial markets by leaning against asset and credit bubbles and offsetting the overly stimulative effects of runaway deficit spending is there a risk they will get it wrong by taking the punch bowl away too soon and in the process lose the opportunity to drive unemployment even lower and drive wages and profits and stock prices even higher sure but the risk is even greater that all the gains from an extra year of economic growth will be more than wiped out if that extra growth is fueled more by cheap debt and excessive risk taking than by a genuine increase in productivity and a burst bubble leads to deep recession that takes years from which to recover we know from behavioral economics that people would rather avoid a dollar of loss even if it means foregoing a dollar of gain and we know from recent history that it is the working class not the investing class that suffers most from the boom and bust cycle that the fed has been reluctant to tame advertisement the central challenge facing the modern fed is to figure out a way for the economy to operate at full employment without being reliant on cheap money and asset bubbles to generate growth i don t pretend that figuring out how to meet that challenge will be easy or self evident
central banks don t matter there is no money in monetary policy could it be true is there no money in monetary policy yesterday we argued the federal reserve cannot even define money much less measure it to any reasonable satisfaction today we venture upon a heresy deeper still that central bank monetary policy has no actual existence no money stands beneath it behind it beside it the emperor is well and truly nude who then actually controls monetary policy today the answer may very well lie hidden in the shadows the details the shocking details to follow monetary policy is actually about credit and debt first moneyman par excellence jeff snider author of today s opening quotation rams a sharp stake through the heart of the monetary myth monetary policy has been quite intentionally stripped of money banks evolved and there was really no easy way to define money beyond a certain point in the 60s so economists just gave up trying money as it relates to monetary policy is not really money at all what monetary policy refers to in contemporary terms is something wholly different when the federal reserve act on monetary measures they seek not to increase the supply of money to the economy but rather the supply of credit monetary policy in the modern sense of the word actually has little to do with money instead it is always and everywhere about credit and debt all money is debt based money in today s lunatic and preposterous world the dollar in your wallet you consider an asset but only someone else s previous debt fanned it into existence technically it is a federal reserve note a note is a debt instrument none of the foregoing will stagger or flabbergast daily reckoning readers money is debt in today s world debt represents a claim upon the future the federal reserve is a vast engine of debt a menace but this snider fellow strays far beyond the normal run of grievances he commits perhaps the grandest heresy in the universes of economics and finance that the federal reserve and all central banks are largely powerless the central bank is not central they are merely men behind curtains irrelevancies and the emperor in fact wears no clothing here snider strips the emperor bare the fed is largely outside of temporary sentiment irrelevant the central bank is not central the thing people have the most trouble with is the idea that central banks are not central it flies in the face of everything you have been taught and told your whole life the media still give these guys every benefit of every doubt and central bankers ab use that privileged platform to perpetuate their myth central banks are not central the federal reserve is irrelevant as well argue that gravity is a vicious fiction that 2 and 2 is 9 that washington never axed the cherry tree snider further argues that the interest rate the federal reserve monkeys the fed funds rate is likewise an irrelevancy there is absolutely no legitimate reason why anyone should the federal funds market is a nonentity pocket change it is the sparest of spare liquidity today federal funds is nothing an extraneous anachronism the fed s target audience you why then does the federal reserve target the fed funds rates because it wants you to believe that it bosses the markets that its false fireworks are real what was decided essentially was to keep federal funds as the primary monetary policy focus the reason you monetary policy contains no money it runs entirely on expectations therefore according to this view what ultimately matters is how you perceive monetary policy so the fomc decided that for the public they would still use federal funds to signal to you their intentions there is no money in monetary policy it is entirely psychology what about quantitative easing was it not about printing money qe accomplished next to nothing qe s real purpose was in trying to manage expectations which central bankers were more than happy to let you believe this was all money printing then you might act in anticipating all that money printing was going to have stimulative and even sharp inflationary effects you might then pull forward purchasing activity or if a business hiring and production before the expected higher costs arrived blasphemy mounts upon blasphemy but if not the central banks who or what is central who then is running monetary policy the shadow banking system you will find the answer in the shadows says snider the shadow banking system the shadow banking system that is the deeply interconnected network of banking institutions that operate outside direct control of central banks they include the large banks and their offshore units this shadow banking system extends through europe the caribbean and asia the world over in 2017 the bank for international settlements the central bank of central banks estimated 13 trillion to 14 trillion dwell within the shadow system but this shadow banking system is invisible it hides in shadow leaving only traces of its activity as a thief leaves traces of his crime only a properly trained sleuth can sniff them out no one can directly observe this global system what is actually the world s reserve currency first of all it is primarily based offshore from everywhere therefore outside of official recognition there are no direct statistics the term shadow is in this case perfectly appropriate the united states dollar is the coin of this realm the shadow system first took shape in the 1950s and 60s after bretton woods placed the dollar at the center of the international monetary system it expanded through the 1980s 90s into the early aughts and beneath notice the shadow banking system shouldered the central banks out of the international monetary system snider the global money system moved on without central banks bothering to notice did the shadow banking system cause the great financial crisis these shadow banks traded heavily in derivatives and other risky instruments all without oversight where do asset bubbles come from asks snider they came from the shadows is his answer including the u s housing bubble especially from the 1960s forward and particularly in the 1990s forward was that as the replaced other forms of mediation in global trade what actually happened was it became a parallel banking system unto itself not so much that a company in japan could import goods from sweden but so that the banks in japan or sweden or switzerland or anywhere around the world could participate in this system that at the time was stoking a u s housing bubble while at the same time creating vast bubbles in emerging market so what we re describing here is almost an entire massive complete system that existed offshore and wholesale in the shadows because there was no regulatory authority no government authority over the conduct of this system it was essentially a self contained system that operated beyond the reach of everybody to repeat snider argues that the 2008 crisis was not merely a housing crisis it was rather a crisis of the shadow banking system the great financial crisis has been laid at the doorstep of subprime a bunch of greedy wall street bankers insufficiently regulated to have not known any better that was just a symptom of the first the housing bubble itself was more than housing what was going on in the shadows wasn t bounded by national borders or geography the great financial crisis was a event nothing less why hasn t the global economy recovered from the great financial crisis might the answer involve the shadow banking system more tomorrow regards brian maher managing editor the daily reckoning

with u s gaap we use foreign exchange fx neutral measures this non gaap measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with u s gaap and may be different from non gaap measures used by other companies in addition this non gaap measure is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles non gaap measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with u s gaap this non gaap financial measure should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the most comparable u s gaap financial measures reconciliation of this non gaap financial measure to the most comparable u s gaap financial measures can be found in the tables included in this quarterly report the company believes that reconciliation of fx neutral measures to the most directly comparable gaap measure provides investors an overall understanding of our current financial performance and its prospects for the future specifically we believe this non gaap measure provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding the foreign currency exchange rate impact that may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook the fx neutral measures were calculated by using the average monthly exchange rates for each month during 2018 and applying them to the corresponding months in 2019 so as to calculate what our results would have been had exchange rates remained stable from one year to the next the table below excludes intercompany allocation fx effects finally this measure does not include any other macroeconomic effect such as local currency inflation effects the impact on impairment calculations or any price adjustment to compensate local currency inflation or devaluations the following table sets forth the fx neutral measures related to our reported results of the

currency also adjusted ebitda is up 320 basis points to 36 4 and operating cash flow is up 6 to 286 million by all accounts this is a solid quarter and customers are responding well to our enterprise information management products or eim to our enterprise ready cloud and to our vision of the intelligent and connected enterprise our enterprise world europe and asia events this quarter underscore all of this with over 2 000 attendees 500 partners 100 sessions and 60 exhibitors our revenue growth was driven by demand within our core offerings of content services and business networks and the emerging importance of our security and ai products the demand was both cloud and off cloud our margin expansion was driven by additional scale and efficiencies in our cloud and support businesses as well as product mix our cloud margin expanded 160 basis points year over year as we look longer term there continues to be ample opportunities to expand our margin we take the approach that the best run companies keep getting better year over year and we plan to keep improving and expanding year to date our adjusted ebitda is 38 5 already entering our fiscal 2021 aspirational range of 38 to 40 we ended the quarter with 765 million in cash and a net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio of 1 7 times this is the strongest level in eight quarters and we have ample m a capacity given this incredible execution progress and outlook we are raising our quarterly dividend by 15 today from 0 1518 to 0 1746 per share six years ago we started our dividend program our first year dividend was 71 million our last four quarter dividends totaled 163 million and we have returned to shareholders a total of 667 million to date our capital allocation strategy continues to target returning 20 of our trailing 12 month operating cash flows to shareholders via our dividend program please note that going forward we plan to more naturally align our annual dividend review with our annual results earning call so that means our next annual dividend review will be during our q4 fiscal 20 call not during our q3 fiscal 20 earnings call we ll remind everyone as we get closer to the date we think that alignment to our annual calendar is a better way to do a dividend review the opentext leadership team is world class they executed very well within the quarter while also on boarding liaison and catalyst and to note both acquisitions are on target to be on the opentext operating model and be fully integrated within the first 12 months it has also been eight quarters since we acquired the ecd documentum division from dell emc let s reflect on our incredible progress we re now number one in content services our core market with a 15 billion total addressable market or tam delivered double digit cloud growth stellar margins 38 5 adjusted ebitda year to date 647 million ocf year to date ample m a capacity we ve rapidly de levered and have returned to our pre acquisition net debt to adjusted ebitda levels as i noted earlier we re currently at 1 7 times and through time we have now returned 667 million in cash dividends and growing far more than our 600 million equity offering in december 2016 we delivered these results by putting in action the opentext business system there are five key wins i d like to highlight from the quarter as they reflect our strategy and our continued focus as an eim software company tata steel is a global provider of iron and steel generating approximately 20 billion in revenues tata will be leveraging the open text business network to digitize their supply chains it is a large and complex supply chain of sourcing subcontractors engineers manufacturers buyers and sellers norton rose fulbright is a global law firm of over 4 000 professionals and approximately 2 billion of revenues norton rose will be leveraging our legaltech software to provide advanced analytics and machine learning for legal review and discovery of critical evidence ntt data is a multinational system integration company with 118 000 employees and approximately 19 billion in revenues ntt data will be leveraging our content services platform for its clients worldwide the european parliament is extremely important in today s world as the binding party for eu policy governance and law reflecting 40 languages hundreds of parliamentary members and over 11 000 employees the european parliament is standardizing on opentext content services and our information platform canada is among the top 10 economies of the world 1 8 trillion in annual commerce 400 000 government employees a g7 country and the home both physically and culturally to opentext we are proud to announce that we have won the next generation digital platform for the government of canada these q3 wins highlight our strategy execution around the global 10 000 or g10k for short the g10k are the world s largest companies typically those greater than 2 billion in revenues as well as the world s largest governments and organizations this is the marquee market for eim in organic growth to date we re only one third penetrated in the g10k and we can more than double opentext in the coming years by focusing on and connecting the g10k to our information platform let me also comment on our professional services we run and operate one of the industry s most effective and profitable ps businesses over the last year we ve partnered more with global system integrators we have discontinued low margin contracts we inherited from acquisitions and more work is becoming standardized and moving into the opentext cloud within q3 we delivered 71 million of revenues at 21 margins you should expect the same levels of revenue here in q4 finally let me provide a brief update on our irs matter the irs matter is following a standard irs process and we are now entering the appeals phase as the matter has progressed and we begin to enter the next phase time has strengthened our resolve we remain steadfast in our position that the irs is wrong and we are vigorously defending our position let me transition my remarks to fiscal 19 and the annual nature of our business we plan on an annual basis we measure ourselves annually our recurring revenue is just that annual or arr we typically deliver large product releases annually and our customers budget annually while thinking over multi year periods we re an annual business and running our business on an annual cycle allows us to make better long term strategic and operational decisions centered on value creation quarters will vary any low single digit quarterly variance is not meaningful in the context of our annual business i m excited about the growing basis of our annual recurring revenues in fiscal 09 10 years ago fiscal 09 our annual recurring revenues was 405 million we have grown arr every year over the last 10 years including this year our arr this fiscal year is on track to be greater than 2 billion representing 400 growth over the last 10 years we re also on target for our fiscal 19 business plan and we re on target for our fiscal 19 target ranges and our fiscal 21 aspirations on our next earnings call we ll recap fiscal 19 and highlight fiscal 20 targets as well as provide updated 3 year aspirations that will then include fiscal 2022 on our current annual trend fiscal 19 will be a strong year for arr cloud revenues adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda dollars and cash flow next let us go through our q4 quarterly factors as a reminder our quarterly factors are those key items for you to factor into your short term financial modeling the items are important but tactical and these items do not affect the long term nature of our business our q4 factors include the following global recession concerns continue we all read the same newspapers we see the same concern around trade wars tariffs goods and wage inflation prolonged brexit uncertainty gdpr and data regulation concerns secondly the u s dollar continues to be strong against the euro pound canadian dollar and yen expect a q4 negative revenue impact of approximately 20 million usd due to fx when compared to the prior year third our business is annual as i said earlier and quarters will vary given strong execution in q3 do not expect the historical sequential revenue uplift in q4 compared to q3 expect ps revenues to be consistent sequentially and q3 revenues were 71 million also q4 is the last quarter of the fiscal year expect operating expenses to be up quarter over quarter 4 to 6 given end of year expenses and though q4 is a seasonally higher quarter for adjusted ebitda it is historically lower than q2 and consistent with last quarter we expect liaison to negatively impact adjusted ebitda by approximately 100 bps in q4 looking beyond the short term now my fourth topic is to talk about the longer term the next 12 to 24 months and how we plan on competing growing and creating value let me

hello and thank you all for joining us today q3 s results strongly reflect our collective efforts to maintain upper quartile operational performance including integration work on two acquisitions the results show consistent and significant improvement over last year across all key metrics now turning to details of our quarterly and year to date results and similar to prior quarters my references will be in millions of usd and compared to the same period in a prior fiscal year as you will see from our results the impact of foreign exchange was significant and broad across all lines of revenue at 19 million during the quarter and 31 million year to date given the strength of the usd since the start of our fiscal 2019 total revenues for the quarter were 719 million up 4 9 or up 7 7 on a constant currency basis as we continue to look at our business on an annual basis year to date total revenues were 2 1 billion up 2 9 or up 4 5 on a constant currency basis the geographical split of revenues in the quarter was americas 61 emea 30 and apj 9 annual recurring revenues were 549 million for the quarter up 5 4 or up 7 8 on a constant currency basis year to date annual recurring revenues were 1 6 billion up 4 7 from last year or up 6 on a constant currency basis annual recurring revenues as a percentage of total revenues remain solid at 76 4 and 75 4 respectively for the quarter and year to date our cloud revenues were particularly strong in the quarter at 239 million up 14 1 or up 16 1 on a constant currency basis we also generated 63 8 million in new mcv up compared to 52 7 million in q3 last year year to date cloud revenues were 666 million up 9 from last year or up 10 on a constant currency basis cloud renewals remain in the mid 90s range our customer support revenues were 311 million down 0 5 or up 2 3 on a constant currency basis year to date customer support revenues were 933 million up 1 8 from last year or up 3 3 on a constant currency basis our customer support renewal rate was consistent with prior quarters and prior years at approximately 91 our license revenues were 99 million up 17 4 or up 22 2 on a constant currency basis year to date license revenues were 308 million up 3 6 from last year or up 5 9 on a constant currency basis our professional service revenues were 71 million down 11 6 or down 8 4 on a constant currency basis year to date professional service revenues were 215 million down 9 3 from last year or down 7 1 on a constant currency basis turning to the details of our margin performance in q3 gaap gross margin for the quarter was 67 up 210 basis points over the same period last year our adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 73 up 140 basis points over the same quarter last year and primarily driven by scale and product mix cloud was 57 up from 55 last year customer support was 90 up from 89 last year our license margin was 97 up from 96 last year and professional services margin was 21 up from 20 last year fx had a negative impact on adjusted gross margin in the quarter by approximately 14 million our adjusted ebitda was 262 million this quarter up 15 year over year adjusted ebitda margin was 36 4 an increase of 320 basis points compared to 33 2 in the prior fiscal year and driven by our deep operating lens into the business as well as the restructuring activities we first announced in our q1 call year to date adjusted ebitda was 816 million up 10 5 compared to the same period last year adjusted ebitda margin year to date was 38 5 an increase of 270 basis points compared to 35 8 in the same period last year gaap net income for the quarter was 73 million up 0 27 per share on a diluted basis up from 59 million or 0 22 per share for the same period last year year to date gaap net income was 214 million or 0 79 per share on a diluted basis up from 181 million or 0 68 per share for the same period last year our adjusted net income in the quarter was 173 million up 18 6 year over year or up 21 2 on a constant currency basis year to date adjusted net income was 550 million up 12 compared to the same period last year or up 12 5 on a constant currency basis our adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were 0 64 on a diluted basis up 18 5 from 0 54 per share for the same period last year year to date our adjusted earnings per share was 2 04 up 10 9 from 1 84 for the same period last year our operating cash flows for the quarter were 286 million up 5 7 year over year year to date operating cash flows were 647 million up 28 3 from the same period last year and turning to the balance sheet we had 765 million in cash net of the 70 million payment for catalyst our consolidated net leverage ratio at 1 7 times is well within our external debt covenant ratio of four times and provides us with meaningful flexibility to execute on our total growth strategy in the third quarter dso was 60 days and compared to 67 days in the same quarter last year we achieved record quarterly collections in the quarter and overall a huge applause to the opentext teams for achieving such outstanding cash flow results while integrating two acquisitions in the quarter we continue to learn from and optimize our cash management framework on dividend as mark indicated in his remarks we are very pleased to be raising our quarterly dividend by 15 today up from 0 1518 to 0 1746 per share our dividend program continues to be a very important component of our capital allocation strategy and now for perspectives on our operating model as mark outlined we remain on track to our fiscal 2019 target model which as a reminder is included in our investor presentation on our ir website so let me summarize and reiterate the quarterly factors that we anticipate for our fiscal q4 q3 was negatively impacted by fx of 19 million as we look at where the rates are today as well as geographical level components of our business we expect fx headwind in q4 of approximately 20 million given strong execution in q3 do not expect historical sequential uplift in q4 compared to q3 ps revenues in q4 to remain constant sequentially and q3 ps revenues of 71 million as the last quarter of our fiscal year in q4 we expect operating expenses to be up quarter over quarter in the range of 4 to 6 and given end of year expenses with respect to adjusted ebitda q4 is a seasonally higher quarter although historically lower than q2 and liaison is expected to negatively impact adjusted ebitda by approximately 100 basis points in q4 it is important to incorporate these quarterly factors as you model us for q4 note that liaison and catalyst remain on target to be on our operating model and to be fully integrated in the first 12 months on the interest expenses they remain as noted in our fiscal 19 target model of 144 million to 149 million and our adjusted tax rate remains at 14 so turning to our long term targets as mark mentioned with year to date adjusted ebitda margin at 38 5 and year to date operating cash flows at 647 we are strongly on our way to adjusted ebitda margin in fiscal 2021 of 38 to 40 and operating cash flows target of 1 billion annually as we exit fiscal 2021 on our next earnings call we look forward to recapping fiscal 2019 sharing highlights of our expectations for fiscal 2020 and provide updated 3 year aspirations to include 2022 at the start of the year we introduced our communication framework and quarterly factors to help you model opentext in a way that is closely aligned to how we see our business and within that framework there are two metrics at the end of each fiscal year that we will provide to you on a historical basis annual organic growth and return on invested capital or roic we will update you on both of these annual metrics during our next call so before i conclude i am really excited on behalf of mark and the management team to welcome harry blount to opentext harry has joined our team this week as senior vice president and

analysts through conferences and one on one meetings in canada and the united states please do connect with greg secord for more information so at this time i would like to open the call for your questions operator questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions our first question comes from phillip huang of barclays phillip huang barclays analyst hi thanks good afternoon a couple of quick ones from me first i think maybe a question for madhu on the strong license revenue i was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on that just given that it s a seasonally light quarter just based on your comments around the quarterly factors wanted to make sure i understood it correctly so that it was mainly driven by timing or pull forward of deals i was just wondering if it was at all driven by perhaps larger deal sizes or any other factors that you d point out mark j barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer phillip hi it s mark here i ll probably take the first one on the quarterly factors madhu yes hello madhu can certainly speak a little more deeply to the quarterly factors we had a strong quarter in both cloud and off cloud and it was driven by competing very effectively against ibm there s a new enterprise software landscape forming so we ve always been agnostic as we transitioned to the cloud and transitioned to our recurring revenue focused we are agnostic to how customers purchase whether it be a license to subscription managed service other options in our cloud but we re not calling out any larger deal q3 was a continuation of our total growth strategy both organically and acquisition i will note we are competing very effectively and when i called the new enterprise software landscape that has a shrinking ibm presence in it phillip huang barclays analyst got you madhu ranganathan executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you mark and do you want to expand on your question on the quarterly factors so that i phillip huang barclays analyst no just based on the comments around the sequential fiscal q3 to q4 not there because of the strong execution i was just trying to i guess piece together the puzzle whether it was driven by just a pull forward of deals into fiscal q3 and that s why we re not seeing the historical bump into q4 or was the strength driven by other factors that you would also point out i think mark answered part of the question on not calling out larger deal sizes but was wondering if there were any other factors that drove the strong license revenue this quarter madhu ranganathan executive vice president and chief financial officer right so mark i think addressed the license revenue i would just i mean i would just reiterate just when you look at q4 revenue right there are three factors one is the fx and we are looking at where we sit today at about 20 million impact to q4 and back to the overall strong execution in q3 license and the cloud it s important to not expect the same historical sequential uplift in q4 and of course professional services for all the reasons outlined we do expect a constant ps revenues between q3 and q4 mark j barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer i think the only thing i would add to madhu statement if i can is back to the remarks to the prepared remarks or an annual business right in any given quarter might vary a little here or there but we re very focused on the annual nature of the business and again it s all up to the question we re not calling out any big deals we competed second we competed very effective or competing very effectively when i called the new enterprise software landscape we re competing effectively against those incumbents like ibm and others and we ve got a strong outlook phillip huang barclays analyst got it that s very helpful and then just on the quickly on the global recessions concerns i know it s a very similar wording that you put in in the last quarterly factors as well was just wondering if you could give us an update on any visibility on potential impact to your pipeline i know you mentioned that there wasn t any that you ve noted in the last quarter so was wondering what your thoughts are for an update on that comment mark j barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer yeah we re keeping it in our quarterly factors we don t see a change yet to the trajectory of our business but i ll just continue to note you don t know where brexit still is going to land there are some there are headline news around growth in europe plateauing or shrinking slightly typically what you would see is either the close dates moving out deal size shrinking more approvals coming into place we re not seeing any of those statistical factors in our pipeline but i think it s healthy to kind of continue to call out a headline kind of bullet in this category phillip huang barclays analyst that s really helpful thanks very much mark j barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer thank you madhu ranganathan executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator our next question comes from richard tse of national bank financial richard tse national bank financial analyst yes thank you so i m attending a conference this week and the theme of this event has largely been this explosion of data it seems to be still a fairly big pain point for a lot of enterprises i m kind of just wondering in your role i think on the technology side as well what you see today as sort of your biggest challenges from your customers when it comes to data mark j barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer richard thanks thanks for the question i think i ll put my cto hat on for a moment little more of a cto question i think back 10 years ago i remember the headline mobile eats the world i think back a few years ago and we re all software companies right and maybe the headline this year or next year is we re all data companies and how can each company unlock their data and monetize excuse me leverage the data to make them smarter a more effective competitor in the market or to use their data or data exhaust to go out into the market and go sell and i think back over the last 10 years erp has really provided a processed advantage i think over the next 10 years a look at eim we re here to provide the information advantage so i think the biggest challenge right now when i look into the enterprise landscape is taking an inventory of the data is it in the right format and do i have the right tools to kind of unlock that data exhaust so i think the greatest challenge right now is i think everyone gets it they understand it the landscape is shifting from process automation to leveraging the data so we see trends like platform consolidation master data management getting data into a usable format picking the right algorithms right to make yourself better or can you then get to a next step to sell your data in the right way for that information advantage and then of course is it secure is it governed does it meet the right privacy so i think richard it s a great actual question and those are some of the immediate things that i see and i think we sit in a great place to help take advantage of it richard tse national bank financial analyst yes it sounds like you are and i guess the context of my question is that when you look at products that you have like magellan for instance do you think that we re in a position that your enterprise customers are currently evaluating it and we could see this potential that you kind of get a real material increase in those products and also what has the traction been like for magellan lately mark j barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer yes well i think there are two things the first is microsoft is a wide horizontal company you don t have the pharma version of word right or the paper and pulp version of excel right they re a wide horizontal platform opentext is a wide horizontal platform and we want to get into the global 10 000 and be the standard for the horizontal information platform we want their supply chain cash management content services we want to be the standard for that intelligent and information core for that wide horizontal platform and that is the largest opportunity in front of us to keep driving that type of penetration on top of that we re going to continue to deliver vertical applications ot2 is coming to market with healthcare financial services legal tech applications and then another pillar on top of that for a long term strategy is the ai and analytics with magellan and of course securing that platform as well so it s still early days with magellan it is contributing to the p l and it s a very strategic piece for us in the future richard tse national bank financial analyst okay great and just one last one from me with respect to the acquisitions have you changed the comfort level in terms of what your leverage ratio is i forgot what it was last quarter but if you d just remind us that d be great thank you mark j barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer yeah thanks richard no we still believe in the same ratios that we think up to three times leverage is a comfortable zone i think we all can take some confidence in looking back over the last two years there s one thing for a management team to say what they believe in and then deliver data points performance we said we would be comfortable going over that slightly in the short term and then rapidly de levering if we needed to so we went up to about 3 3 times when we completed the documentum emc acquisition and here we are eight quarters later sitting at 1 7 times of net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio so our philosophy is consistent hasn t changed of going up to three times and i think we can take confidence that if we do need to go above it we would rapidly de lever just as we have shown richard tse national bank financial analyst that s great thank you madhu ranganathan executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you as well operator our next question comes from walter pritchard of citi research walter pritchard citi research analyst hi thanks couple question here mark just on the ibm side i wonder if you could call out which areas of the business are you seeing that i mean obviously not a new trend but they took the best some asset this quarter i m curious which areas of the business are you seeing in particular that resonate positively in your sale pipeline and activity mark j barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer yes thanks walter i d say three areas the first is filenet we ve called out a few times where they have not been innovating as rapidly and the enterprise landscape is just changing excuse me let me correct myself has changed and that there really is a new set of enterprise software companies from slack servicenow i m putting ourselves in this category as well as companies look to get that information advantage versus a process advantage we ve turned our platform into a cloud ready platform containerized we have a saas version with ot2 we have deep application integration deep saas integration integration to sap to oracle to salesforce and we re just competing very effectively against a filenet the second area is ibm sterling commerce which is their commerce platform and the commerce platform has evolved it s evolved into an identity and access management platform we acquired covisint technologies and been able to bring in and bring version two and version three their identity and access platform and i think we re up to almost we re well over 10 million iot devices connected into our network our acquisition of liaison has put us into the market of any to any integration i hate to throw out examples like this but i ll use an example of mulesoft right where we now have a library of 10 000 canonical connectors where we can tie erp to erp cloud to cloud process to process within our business network so we re competing very effectively against ibm and sterling commerce and lastly the ibm cloud is sort of a clouds are not a place to go to just get a cost advantage it needs to be a platform of innovation and so i look at our cloud today and us being able to provide this full eim stack and yes we can provide a cost advantage and security but we can also now provide it as a platform for innovation for the next generation of workloads so these are the thee areas we re competing effectively content services commerce platform and the cloud walter pritchard citi research analyst got it and then maybe mark for you as you brought this up on the call around sort of a new era and other side of an inflection where you can self fund m a but then still mentioning the three times leverage is the takeaway here just as you get larger you can do bigger deals or should we expect i d almost think if you re talking about self funding you may be looking to take on less leverage going forward help us interpret what you were saying there mark j barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer yes i don t know if it all of the above look it s always the right deal at the right price with the right roic and it s really a very simple mantra for us and our pipeline is active as i like to say in small medium and large categories got to be the right company at the right price in the right roic our model is different than other companies we look to acquire integrate and innovate we ve delivered a we re delivering a horizontal platform so pipeline active we have ample capacity in general we think as a management philosophy up to three times leverage is a good ratio say it very simply if the world will go sideways i like to pay my debt off in three years right i mean that s the philosophy of a ratio and if we take our cash flows and just very simply take out interest take out dividend take out capex that puts us in a place to be able to self fund self perpetuate our core m a walter pritchard citi research analyst okay great thank you operator our next question comes from howard leung of veritas investment research howard leung veritas investment research analyst thank you and thanks taking my question i had a few of them the first one i ll start with is for the gross cloud margin they re kind of at the 56 57 level now for a few years can you maybe give some comments or some color around what could potentially drive it higher and what you see is the result is why it s kind of stayed at that level mark j barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer howard welcome and thanks for the question mark here so we delivered 56 5 cloud margin in the quarter up 150 basis points year over year and last quarter we were just under 60 in cloud margin look we re targeting medium term to be in the low 60s for our cloud margin and as we ve on boarded new acquisitions like liaison and catalyst and making investments to grow in the cloud cloud was 243 million in constant currency this quarter up 16 margins have dipped a little bit below 60 but all for the right reasons right to grow the cloud to on board a couple great acquisitions and note the margin is up year over year 150 basis points and our target range for the year is between 57 and 59 and we re smack in that range so it s right where we want it to be howard leung veritas investment research analyst okay that s very helpful and then the other one i wanted to touch on was on license revenues it looks like for the quarter based on the md a there was a 17 million impact from the 605 606 conversion and i think that was just kind of acceleration of some of the licenses upfront just want to find out for that 17 million how many licenses term licenses were sold that contributed to the 70 million mark j barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer howard a very detailed question let me start sort of at the conceptual piece so first and foremost for us it s all about how a customer wants to buy and we don t go into the global 10 000 and say you must buy this one way it s all around how a customer wants to procure and deploy so if they want to do that in our cloud off cloud license or in somebody else s cloud we re all in right for us it s all about the annual recurring revenue adjusted ebitda and cash flow so i ve just started at the principled level it s all about how a customer wants to procure second the 606 business it s all new business for us right these are brand new wins these are new contracts it s all new business for us and third there is no alternative it is gaap and it is the standard there is no alternative for us so i don t know if that answers your question or if there s another level to the question that you have howard leung veritas investment research analyst i mean i completely understand it s not an accounting choice at all it s just a change in the policy i was just wondering for these new licenses which you have signed for the quarter it s not in any way i guess pulling forward from future quarters it s just kind of new business that you guys won mark j barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer no new business new wins very good wins madhu ranganathan executive vice president and chief financial officer yes howard leung veritas investment research analyst yes now it looks very strong but this quarter so that s good thanks guys that was really helpful mark j barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer thank you howard appreciated madhu ranganathan executive vice president and chief financial officer and howard thank you as well howard leung veritas investment research analyst no problem operator our next question comes from stephanie price of cibc world markets stephanie price cibc world markets analyst good afternoon i just wanted to touch on services revenue for a minute mark i was hoping you can give us a bit of an update on your thoughts on that services business and maybe go into a bit more detail of the puts and takes that you mentioned in your prepared remarks mark j barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer yes sounds great thanks thanks stephanie and thanks for the question we run a very i think of our ps business sort of in three pillars pillar one is always accelerated time to value for the customer and we run one of the best ps organizations inside a software company our ps organization does an amazing job deploying our software getting accelerated time to value i d put our organization up against anyone s any day second is can you do that profitably and i look back to companies like bmc ca other large enterprise companies who had run their ps businesses at no to negative margin and that s just not in our philosophy it s not a loss leader it s a profit center because there s value that we re delivering for customers so regardless of our revenue levels we ve been able to deliver margins around 20 which is in the zone of the world s best run ps businesses the third sort of pillar if you will is the quantum of the revenue and we ve taken out the strategy that we re going to bring on more global system implementers like an ntt like tcs accenture deloitte others and they re going to go out and put us into their framework and we think we can grow the more strategic revenues of cloud by having that partnership we re going to give up some ps revenues to do that and that s perfectly ok second is as more work becomes standard in the cloud and it s configured it s self serviced you need less of the ps organization and that s fine as well and then thirdly we acquire businesses that don t quite have our philosophy of how to run a ps business and we need to wean ourselves off that and complete deployments and then move on so i mean those are the three reasons why ps is down slightly other revenues are up and it s all for the right strategic reasons stephanie price cibc world markets analyst great thanks and then in terms of your slide deck the slide on selected customer and product expansion seems to be growing here i m hoping you can talk about cross sell opportunities in the install base and whether they were a factor in the outperformance in the quarter mark j barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer yes we have thanks for pulling it out we have it in our investor deck and i m just reaching for it here slide 13 14 and 15 where we have selected customer and product expansions where we re kind of showing businesses like coca cola fujitsu gm nestle who are running multiple pillars for us look it is a key strategy for us is to have a strong portfolio of solutions to provide i d go back to some of my earlier comments around how we ve expanded our offering and companies like ibm have not in content services and or the business network i d say the strength in the quarter was again i d go back to our two core markets content services and business network and just keep widening the capabilities we re deploying stephanie price cibc world markets analyst great thank you very much mark j barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer thanks stephanie i ll look forward to joining cibc a may 14 madhu ranganathan executive vice president and chief financial officer yep thank you as well operator our next question comes from thanos moschopoulos of bmo capital markets thanos moschopoulos bmo capital markets analyst hi good afternoon with respect to your q4 outlook i m just a little unclear on your commentary so just to be very clear are you suggesting there will be no quarter on quarter revenue uptick or are you suggesting that there may be a quarterly revenue uptick but that it will be a more modest uptick than we ve seen historically for q4 mark j barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer there will be we expect an uptick just not as seasonally strong thanos moschopoulos bmo capital markets analyst okay great yeah that s what i thought i just wanted to confirm that point in terms of cash flows your cash flow was a obviously up year over year as you highlighted although your cash conversion of ebitda was lower than for q3 last year was that just because of a working capital drag from the two recent tuck in acquisitions madhu ranganathan executive vice president and chief financial officer yes thanos this is madhu i would say yes and some of the billings and the deferred revenue this quarter were also much higher right so that also contributed to the conversion but the conversion is still very high keep in mind thanos moschopoulos bmo capital markets analyst okay fair enough and just one last one from me was all the liaison catalyst revenue in the cloud services line or was it sprinkled in some other lines as well madhu ranganathan executive vice president and chief financial officer it s predominantly in the cloud services line thanos moschopoulos bmo capital markets analyst okay thanks i ll pass the line madhu ranganathan executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you as well mark j barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer yeah thanks operator our next question comes from paul treiber of rbc capital markets paul treiber rbc capital markets analyst thanks so much and good afternoon madhu ranganathan executive vice president and chief financial officer hi paul paul treiber rbc capital markets analyst hi there i don t want to beat a dead horse on this but you mentioned following that i remember before when they were public they had some very significant deals in the mid year range just hope he can put some bounds around the potential size of deals if you can confirm that there weren t any deals as large as in the figures mark j barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer yes filenet they ve been private a long time haven t they ve been private a long time thanos we re not calling out any larger deals in the quarter so i appreciate the commentary again we re competing very effectively in our two core markets and we re not here to call out any larger transaction paul treiber rbc capital markets analyst okay that s fair just turning to documentum or emc ecd when you mentioned that earlier how does the are you seeing documentum customers migrate to the latest versions of your products at a similar rate to the core opentext customers and also consider your cloud as a similar rate as your core business mark j barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer hey paul thanks for the question i can just say off the top of my head i m not seeing any real difference in a rate of upgrade or migration i ll have to go back and kind of check the data but i m pretty data sensitive but nothing s sort of jumping out at me as a different rate in terms of embracing the cloud this is a strong upsell opportunity for us and customers are looking i used this phrase a little earlier a platform for innovation and our cloud allows our customers to get the latest and greatest software to get a fuller stack of software to remove the burdens of security and compliance and management up time and really free their brains up to innovate so yes the ability to upsell managed services to upsell saas workloads is a strong opportunity for us in the documentum base paul treiber rbc capital markets analyst okay thanks for taking my question mark j barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer thank you paul operator our next question comes from steven li of raymond james steven li raymond james analyst hey guys i have a question for madhu so madhu given 606 has a positive impact on revenue recognition when you do your organic growth calculation next quarter would you be adjusting out the positive 606 impact given you re base in 2018 would be on 605 madhu ranganathan executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you for the question i d go back to what mark said earlier growth is growth and new business is new business and all of this is new business right so when we look at the q4 we are looking at new businesses and what i d probably point out is look at the 739 million of revenue in constant currency and even if you took the 21 million that we shared as sort of adjustment 605 to 606 it s 718 million and if you do apples to apples it was 686 million in q3 of last year but 698 for 605 adjusted we still grew from 698 million to 718 million and i would encourage that s how you think about growth steven li raymond james analyst okay thank you madhu ranganathan

investing activities phx energy used net cash in investing activities of 10 5 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 2 4 million in the 2018 quarter in the first quarter of 2019 the corporation received proceeds of 2 5 million 2018 2 7 million from the disposition of drilling equipment primarily related to the involuntary disposal of drilling equipment in well bores additionally the corporation spent 11 3 million on capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2019 2018 3 1 million these expenditures included 7 6 million downhole performance drilling motors 2 5 million in mwd systems and spare components and 1 2 million in collars machining and equipment vehicles and other assets the capital expenditure program undertaken in the period was financed from funds from operations and drawdowns on credit facilities during the three month period ended march 31 2019 the corporation had no acquisitions in intangible assets 2018 3 696 the change in non cash working capital balances of 1 8 million use of cash for the three month period ended march 31 2019 relates to the net change in the corporation s trade payables that are associated with the acquisition of capital assets this compares to a 2 0 million use of cash for the three month period ended march 31 2018 financing activities the corporation reported cash flows generated from financing activities of 1 2 million in the three month period ended march 31 2019 as compared to 1 8 million in the comparable 2018 quarter in the 2019 quarter the corporation drew net proceeds of 2 6 million from its operating and syndicated facilities the corporation made payments of 0 8 million towards lease liability in line with the newly adopted ifrs 16 leases standard under the corporation s ncib 0 7 million was spent on repurchase of common shares and 45 000 common shares were issued for proceeds of 0 1 million upon the exercise of share options capital resources as of march 31 2019 the corporation had 19 0 million drawn on its syndicated facility 8 8 million drawn on its operating facility and a cash balance of 4 0 million as at march 31 2019 the corporation had approximately cad 39 2 million and usd 2 0 million available to be drawn from its credit facilities the credit facilities are secured by substantially all of the corporation s assets as at march 31 2019 the corporation was in compliance with all its financial covenants cash requirements for capital expenditures historically the corporation has financed its capital expenditures and acquisitions through cash flows from operating activities debt and equity on april 8 2019 the corporation announced an increase to its 2019 capital expenditure program from 15 million to 25 million the increase to the capital expenditure program was primarily dedicated to increasing the capacity of the velocity fleet for activity in early 2020 with the remainder of the increase anticipated to be allocated toward maintenance of the velocity and performance motor drilling fleets including atlas motors these planned expenditures are expected to be financed from a combination of one or more of the following cash flow from operations the corporation s unused credit facilities or equity if necessary however if a sustained period of market uncertainty and financial market volatility persists in 2019 the corporation s activity levels cash flows and access to credit may be negatively impacted and the expenditure level would be reduced accordingly conversely if future growth opportunities present themselves the corporation would look at expanding this planned capital expenditure amount outlook the first quarter results are a continuation of the positive momentum built in the 2018 year and were driven by the corporation s strategic initiatives focused on the us market and building a fleet of disruptive technologies phx energy s us division has consistently demonstrated its growth potential over the last 2 years and the corporation s high performance technologies remain in high demand and are contributing to the improvements in revenue and profitability in the first quarter the us remained the largest area of operation for the corporation and the majority of phx energy s premium technologies such as velocity systems atlas motors and powerdrive orbit rss were deployed in the us the us industry remains extremely favourable and with the corporation s unique position phx energy s growth strongly outpaced the industry phx energy s us operating days increased 38 percent quarter over quarter as compared to the 9 percent increase in the us rig count this increased activity combined with the premiums and surcharges related to the high performance technology has led the us division to consistently grow phx energy remains optimistic that it can further build upon the strong growth and market share gains over the past few quarters as additional atlas and velocity capacity is deployed later this year and into 2020 commodity prices appear to have recovered from the decline in the fourth quarter of 2018 and if these levels persist industry activity may be greater than anticipated and this may further increase the potential opportunities for phx energy as expected the canadian industry remains challenged with limited market access and political uncertainty both the industry and phx energy saw activity levels decrease quarter over quarter although the corporation s strong position in this market sheltered it slightly phx energy experienced a 19 percent decline in operating days as compared to the industry s decline of 35 percent the canadian industry has seen improvements in the price of canadian crude oil and this provides some optimism that industry activity will not see steeper declines as the year progresses in the first quarter the spring break up period began earlier than is typical and this slow period will continue through the second quarter rig counts are currently trending 30 percent below what they were last year and in spite of these activity levels phx energy remains committed to the canadian industry and protecting its strong market share for the future the first quarter was very similar to the fourth quarter of 2018 for phx energy s international operations the albania division continued to operate on 3 rigs while the russian operations relied more on the mwd rental business as key clients decreased their drilling programs the russian division is focused on gaining more full service work and phx energy believes in upcoming quarters activity levels will begin to increase technology update as the industry continues to strive for efficiencies core directional technologies have changed the time and economics for operators to drill long horizontal wells making directional services the most impactful services for operators performance and cost of drilling as a directional provider who has successfully developed manufactured and deployed these advanced technologies phx energy continues to be recognized as an industry leader which is positively contributing to its financial and operational results as in the fourth quarter of 2018 the surcharges and premiums generated from phx energy s high performance technologies aided the strong revenue and profitability achieved and phx energy has dedicated its 2018 and 2019 capital expenditure programs to expanding the fleets of velocity systems and atlas motors in the quarter phx energy continued to operate its fleet of powerdrive orbit rss and is leveraging its ability to rent this technology to meet demand when it exceeds its own fleet capacity as 2019 progresses phx energy will continue to execute on its strategies for technology development us growth and protecting its

operator good day and welcome to the intercontinental exchange first quarter 2019 earnings conference call and webcast operator instructions please note that this event is being recorded i would now

call may contain forward looking statements these statements which we undertake no obligation to update represent our current judgment and are subject to risks assumptions and uncertainties for a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements please refer to our 2018 form 10 k in our earnings supplement we refer to certain non gaap measures including adjusted income eps operating income operating margin expenses effective tax rate free cash flow and ebitda we believe our non gaap measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance you ll find a reconciliation to the equivalent gaap terms in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful as well as how management uses these measures in our form 10 q when used on this call net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction based expenses and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share please see the explanatory notes on the second page of the earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain terms also with us on the call are jeff sprecher chairman and ceo scott hill chief financial officer and ben jackson our president i ll now turn the call over to scott scott hill chief financial officer advertisement advertisement thanks warren good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today i ll begin on slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our first quarter performance ice s consolidated first quarter net revenues totaled 1 3 billion up 5 year over year on a constant currency basis trading and clearing net revenues grew 5 and data revenues increased 6 each on a constant currency basis this strong revenue performance helped delivered the second best quarter of earnings per share and free cash flow in our company s history first quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled 528 million including a roughly 7 million nonrecurring benefit in comp expense adjusted for that we would have been at the low end of our guidance range at around 535 million second quarter adjusted expenses are expected to increase to be between 537 million and 547 million largely driven by the full quarter impact of annual merit increases and equity grants we didn t expect the subsequent quarter to increase sequentially by about 3 million to 5 million reflecting increased technology investments and spend related to bakkt incorporating all of those dynamics we are now lowering our full year adjusted expense guidance to a range of 2 15 billion to 2 18 billion i ll pause here to note that in the first quarter we recognized 19 million of nonoperating income related to a true up for occ s 2018 results additionally unlike last year we did not receive a dividend from euroclear in the first quarter we do however expect the dividend of around 20 million in the fourth quarter a 40 increase from the dividend received in the first quarter of 2018 shifting to capital return we deployed over 95 of our free cash flow to dividends that once again are increasing by double digits and share repurchases of note the 440 million distributed via share buybacks in the first quarter included an additional 100 million we opportunistically spent to repurchase shares at an average price of 75 during the month of march the nearly 600 million in total capital that we returned during the first quarter has only been surpassed by the second quarter of last year when we similarly deployed an additional 160 million to repurchase shares we remain committed to strong capital returns a dividend that grows as we do and opportunistic repurchases even as we continue to make key strategic growth investments now let s move to slide 5 where i ll provide additional color on the performance of our trading and clearing business first quarter revenues were up 3 year over year or 5 on a constant currency basis in our energy markets average daily volume was down 12 versus the prior year as trading in the u s natural gas markets and the henry hub in particular suffered from lower levels of price volatility participation in the brent and gasoil markets was negatively impacted by a combination of various geopolitical uncertainties and supply demand dynamics as you will note though the volume declines were almost entirely offset by an 11 improvement in our average rate per contract the improved rpc reflects strong volume growth in our european natural gas business where adv increased 42 in the quarter as well as our emissions business where volumes were up 35 that strong performance continued in april and more importantly overall energy open interest continues to grow and is up 3 versus the end of 2018 in our financial futures markets while interest volumes were impacted by brexit and an certain european economic backdrop msci volumes improved by 9 year over year importantly while interest rate volumes have been somewhat muted april to date open interest continues to trend higher up 11 year over year as of the end of april advertisement advertisement moving to cash equities volumes increased 9 year over year in the first quarter and market share improved to roughly 25 wrapping up with our fixed income and credit business revenues totaled 87 million in the quarter this compared to 56 million last year and includes the addition of tmc and mers both of which were acquired in the second half of 2018 turning next to slide 6 i ll discuss our data and listing segment starting with listings revenues of 111 million were up 2 year over year while the u s government shutdown delayed ipo activity to the end of january the nyse helped raised over 2 5 billion of ipo proceeds during the quarter in addition the second quarter is off to a strong start with year to date proceeds raised now in excess of 5 billion including the pinterest ipo in april both uber and slack have also recently announced their choice of the nyse as their listing partner moving to data on a constant currency basis data services revenues grew 6 year over year to a record 546 million in pricing and analytics revenues increased 6 over the prior year the automation of fixed income workflows and the growth in passive strategy is continuing to drive increased demand for our valued pricing services both realtime and end in the day as well as our reference data and our index offerings exchange data and feeds revenues grew 8 year over year driven by growth in the number of customers using our futures data and improve market share at the nyse which determines the revenue we receive from the shared take plan and finally desktops and connectivity revenue was up 3 versus last year connectivity services related to our futures exchanges generated solid growth benefiting from the aforementioned increase in our customer base mitigating the strength connectivity revenues related to the nyse were roughly flat as we continue to roll out our pillar technology which we expect will improve efficiency while reducing industry costs we believe the momentum in data revenue growth will continue in the second quarter with revenues expected to increase sequentially to a range of between 550 million and 555 million our confidence is supported by an annual subscription value that was 6 higher than a year ago entering the quarter 2019 is off to a great start the resiliency of the business model we have constructed is evident in our ability to deliver the second best earnings and cash generation quarter in our company s history despite a challenging backdrop for industry trading volumes i ll be happy to take your questions during q a but for now we ll turn the call over to jeff advertisement advertisement jeff sprecher chairman and chief executive officer thank you scott and good morning to everyone on the call i ll begin on slide 7 our first quarter performance highlights the value of the organic and inorganic initiatives that have undertaken over the last year we ve been engaged in a deliberate evolution to add growing subscription based revenues and to increase our addressable market by expanding our asset class coverage despite softer trading volumes across our industry in the first quarter and as a result of this evolution we grew revenue earnings per share and free cash flow and we returned nearly 600 million in capital to our shareholders the second most in any quarter in our history 10 years ago we were largely a commodities trading venue at the time roughly 85 of our revenue was transaction based today half of our business is recurring revenue in nature and spans a diverse set of asset classes asset classes that we think are well positioned to continue to grow at roughly 30 of our business commodities markets still remain an important component of our growth profile we offer a full spectrum of risk management tools that are critical to the daily hedging and trading needs of global energy and agricultural commodity market participants global benchmark contract such as brent crude oil gasoil sugar and european natural gas to name a few anchor what is the industry s most diverse commodity complex our financial markets business is home to futures on global interest rates and equity indices such as the msci index complex where we recently launched a suite of new indices as we partner to expand the range of risk management tools offered to our customer base in our cash equities business the new york stock exchange stands as the leading provider of listing and trading services we are the listing venue of choice for the world s largest and most sophisticated companies and as the deepest liquidity pool for equities on the planet the nyse provides customers with a state of the art technology platform helping to reduce volatility as well as reducing their trading costs advertisement advertisement in our fixed income business an asset class that now represent about 1 4 of our revenue with the leading goal provider of our valued pricing and reference data our pricing and reference data business is also the foundation for our index business and for our comprehensive suite of pre trade and post trade analytics this suite of data services together with its institutional customer connectivity is highly complementary to ice bonds execution venues that offer our customers choice across execution protocols including auction click to trade and rfq conventions demand for automation in the fixed income markets is accelerating and whether it s through initiatives such as our etf hub or new data products such as realtime pricing curves best execution analytics or indices our platform of fixed income assets is uniquely positioned to capture this growth trend similarly the u s residential mortgage market is experiencing an analog to digital conversion it s an evolution that we ve seen before and much like in other asset classes we re providing products services and key infrastructure aimed at facilitating that transformation digital mortgage solutions are gaining traction the electronic mortgage notes or e notes are an important step toward a fully electronic mortgage ecosystem and in the first quarter alone more e notes were registered on mers than in all quarters of 2018 combined e notes can bring meaningful efficiency gains to the industry by shortening closing time improving quality control and helping to reduce friction and with e notes representing less than 1 of the outstanding mortgages today the opportunity for future growth is substantial turning now to slide 8 as you may have seen last night we announced the acquisition of simplifile simplifile is the leading provider of electronic recording services to the mortgage industry helping to streamline the real estate transaction process it operates one of the largest mortgage networks connecting originators settlement agents servicers and counties it s a network that s been constructed over 2 decades and includes transaction recording counties that together represent 80 of the u s population with the electronification of the mortgage industry in its early innings of transformation the number of eligible documents that could record digitally is 4x the size of what simplifile currently handles when combined into ice mortgage services we will be better positioned to address the increasing demand for digital mortgage solutions helping the mortgage industry reduce cost and making the closing process simpler faster and more transparent turning now to slide 9 we remain committed to balancing our growth today with ensuring that the groundwork is laid for growth tomorrow an example of this is our effort to support the development of an institutional market for digital assets based on feedback from institutional investors seeking a way to participate in this nascent asset class we re building out key infrastructure starting with a custody platform advertisement advertisement secure custody of private keys on bakkt will feature the high level of cybersecurity oversight that protects our global markets coupled to the regulatory structure of a qualified custodian for which bakkt has now applied earlier this week bakkt announced that it acquired the digital asset custody company to further scale its capabilities and also announced that it is working with bny mellon to enhance its physical security and geographic diversity of custody bakkt is building a strong team including senior leadership with experience from ice paypal vantiv worldpay coinbase and google wallet and bakkt remains focused on launching physical delivery futures on our ice futures u s exchange to enable trusted pricing within the digital asset ecosystem and to facilitate institutional adoption in summary we re excited about the addressable market that we have in front of us and while our business is certainly larger and more diverse than it was only 10 years ago we re still guided by a management team that operates in sync and we are growth focused our integrated platform enables us to drive efficiencies across our technology and our operations while still significantly investing for future growth which is clear in our operating margins of nearly 60 and our footprint provides us with unique foundation to drive growth while continuing to create value for shareholders so i d like to thank our customers for their business and their trust in the quarter and i want to thank all of my colleagues for their efforts that contributed to another very strong quarter for ice with that i ll now turn the call back to our moderator sherry to conduct the question and answer session and that will last until 9 30 eastern time questions and answers operator operator instructions the first question is from mr michael carrier of bank of america please go ahead advertisement advertisement michael carrier bank of america analyst all right thanks and good morning thanks for taking the question just the first question some of that fixed income business you guys have done well on the data side i think on the trading the team s a bit more competitive with some of the incumbent platforms out there so how are you thinking or strategically how are you differentiating between the other platforms that are already in the market in order to win over the next few years ben jackson president thanks michael this is ben jackson and i think jeff captured it in the comments that he was making in his opening script there and that the key differentiator that we have is the scale and size of our fixed income business when you look at it as a vertical and it represents now 1 4 of our revenues across our entire revenue base so think about a 1 3 billion business and if you look at the cornerstone of that 1 3 billion business and in that is really our data businesses advertisement advertisement the data businesses that we ve established pricing reference data index and analytics capabilities that we ve provided to customers for more than 3 decades data businesses and data services are very hard to establish with customers you have to have a long track record of a trust for them to trust that you as a benchmark price that they re going to reference takes a long time to establish the credibility in our relationship and it s those institutional relationships that we have solidified over multiple decades that really is our differentiator that we re going to leverage as it comes into execution for our execution platforms themselves we ve seen similar performance to what you ve seen from the other platforms that have recently announced we had strong performance in corporates in u s corporates we ve seen trade sizes increase we have seen a little bit of relative weakness in municipals as the spread between municipals and treasuries has narrowed and treasuries have come into favor but we have seen treasuries perform very strong at our platform so net net our platforms what we ve done in q1 is we have fully integrated our ice bonds business to now execute as one business we ve restructured the organization rationalize and take some cost out and now have a single vision to leverage the institutional relationships that we ve established over multiple decades so that s really what you see as our differentiator operator the next question is from rich repetto of sandler o neill advertisement advertisement rich repetto sandler o neill analyst first thanks for slide 7 jeff it s guided it s been an experience watching the company expand over the years so anyway my question is on what you ve schooled us on scott the annual subscriber value for market data and went up nicely but again you talk about this what we re working on right now is 2020 revenue for market data and i guess the questions i know you ve accelerated the growth from the low single digits to the 4 to 6 now but as you go forward is there anything as you add this annual subscriber values is there any momentum to anything to point that you can grow it faster than the upgrade you have right now and is it still coming from the same sort of buckets that you talked about when you a couple of years ago when you first gave some guidance on the growth there scott hill chief financial officer thanks for the question rich and i do think the asc is a good metric to focus on because it is forward looking as i proved last year it doesn t give perfect forecast but it s directionally very indicative i think the key thing you see not just in asp but in the growth trends we ve established our compound growth rate since 2015 through the end of 2018 was just under 6 every year on average this quarter we grew 6 that s the third quarter in a row that we put up 6 and if you look at our guidance for the second quarter we re again going to be kind of in that 5 to 6 range with midpoint being around right around 5 5 so it s a growth trend that s been consistently delivered and asv indicates that it can continue and it can continue because of some of the things that we ve talked about in the script there are a lot of tailwinds in the fixed income space there s a move from active to passive management there s a movie that ben spent a lot of time talking about toward bond etfs which if you look at it well the equity eps is a much smaller space but one where everybody is pointing to a strong future and so i think in the fixed income area and that s largely our pricing and analytics business which we ve grown 6 7 ever quarter for the last 4 or 5 quarters it s really those trends that have driven it and continue to drive it i think if you then look at the exchange data and the connectivity piece again i go back to the remarks i made we continue to see more customers wanting our data and connecting to our platform and so our connectivity services related to futures exchanges was up solidly again this quarter our futures exchange data was up again this quarter and that goes back to the nature of the commodities business the futures business that we offer we offer a global set of interest rates that are subject to european economic and european central bank dynamics and federal reserve dynamic we offer commodities and energy space that most comprehensive global oil market the most comprehensive global natural gas market the most comprehensive global ag market and we continue to see commercial customers who are managing their price risk exposures in our market and that drives a demand for connectivity and for exchange data and so again i would suggest to you you ve been seeing that in the growth results we put up i think it s definitely reflected in our first quarter and second quarter guidance and i see i think you see in the asv which indicates that those trends continue rich repetto sandler o neill analyst okay thanks a lot operator the next question is from mr patrick o shaughnessy of raymond james please go ahead patrick o shaughnessy raymond james analyst yes good morning jeff good morning scott to follow up on the first question on your fixed income business is there any quantification you can provide regarding customer growth or average trade size and kind of metrics that you can provide to us that would indicate that you are progressing along your goals ben jackson president thanks patrick i think the as i mentioned we ve seen relative performance to what you ve seen from the other platforms this past quarter with corporates being strong and municipals in particular seeing some relative weakness if you look at our platforms we do have a bit of a tilt in our mix toward municipals so we did see that impact the businesses to some degree but all that said trends that we ve seen and as we re leveraging the rest of our businesses to really move into the institutional space some of the metrics that i ve said in prior calls that we continue to see this trending very positive is the development of our rfq capabilities to move into the institutional space and rfq represents close to 20 of our trading volumes on a day in and day out basis we continue to see and continue to develop that and continue to see customers utilizing that we have on our platform on any given day over 10 000 securities that have prices of 250 up on either side so that is some real indicator that central limit order book trading in fixed income is starting to develop and we look forward to continuing to provide customers choice on central order book trading options through our click to trade protocol in addition to our rfq capabilities that we have built out on the back of a long standing capability that we ve had in all of our futures markets and being able to provide that protocol as well so it s those 2 pieces and leveraging the institutional relationships that we have across our business that we believe well positions us to continue to change the mix of assets they re trading our platforms and also increasing trade sizes patrick o shaughnessy raymond james analyst great that s helpful thank you operator the next question is from dan fannon of jefferies please go ahead dan fannon jefferies analyst thanks i guess one more on fixed income just to make sure that we re thinking about what your goals are i guess what is the kind of right way to gauge success is it because we don t really have market share we re not getting this clean data yet is it aggregate revenues or i guess what just kind of holds you accountable in terms of that success what should we think about as a goal post as we think about the remainder of this year or even further jeff sprecher chairman and chief executive officer it s a good question this is jeff it s complicated for us because we don t run our businesses the way we recorded them on that chart in other words we have an integrated management team who are running all those businesses together and culminating them on common technology platforms where we can do it in common sales and marketing efforts but if you step back the goal post that we set internally with senior management i referenced in my prepared remarks that 10 years ago we were a very different company we were sitting here around 10 years ago thinking wow there s going to be an analog to digital conversion in fixed income how do we participate and we were pretty knowledgeable we are very knowledgeable about markets this management team has been together a long time and our team had a lot of international cross border experience and we decided to go right for the high value part of the business the high value part of the businesses in mature markets is not the execution and i can tell you a very mature new york stock exchange has 12 other exchange competitors and 5 more that are rumored to be signing up and some estimate as many as 50 different venues where you can execute trades on u s equities the high value part of the business is getting those institutional relationships getting your data your connectivity your higher value products onto people s systems it s very hard when you re running a fund to change your benchmarks to change your underlying data as people consume information that is crippling through organizations and becomes institutionalized so in looking at fixed income market and the difficulty that if we all had in our industry on how to digitize that we decided to start with where we thought the higher value part is so you ve seen growth scott talked about asv and we talked about our company as a data company and how that is performing the reality is what you re really seeing there is those fixed income trends against a very very weak market for commodities and equities and other asset classes in the quarter and so it s why we decided to try to better show you how the business operates we ll take it away that other metrics that we can put out we don t run the business that way so it s hard we don t have those metrics at our fingertips i ll just make one other point which is 10 years ago we weren t in the interest rate business and we had very formidable exchange competitors like cme and deutsche borse and lse and at that time nyse euronext that had very strong interest rate franchise so what did we do we looked and said the nascent part of the market where there s no analog to digital conversion yet is mortgage that s the interest rate market that we should go after and so you re starting to see some of the decisions that we made 10 years ago play out and it s why we spent little bit of time talking about bakkt and digital assets i don t know where that company will go none of us do but we have the luxury in this company of being have an entrepreneurial team and the ability to make investments that are very strategic and still maintain our operating margins given the technology footprint that we have so anyway that s the overarching theme here we ll take away specific metric interest and see if we can come up with something dan fannon jefferies analyst great thank you operator the next question is from mr jeremy campbell of barclays please go ahead jeremy campbell barclays analyst hey thanks jeff just piggybacking on that mortgage commentary there i mean now with mers and simply simplifile can you just provide some color how ice mortgage services fits within the existing kind of mortgage technology infrastructure so for instance i think of like black knight that has something like 80 of mortgage services on their technology platform with also a large origination technology platform is something like that a partner for ice mortgage services a competitor or just an entirely different sphere of influence jeff sprecher chairman and chief executive officer it s very good question so when we bought mers mers really was is a company that registers if you will paper based mortgages it gives every u s mortgage mortgage identification number all the min number mortgage identification number and that s all that s for basic paper based income system what we did is over 2 years we built the digital ecosystem and we worked with fannie and freddie to hook that digital ecosystem to them as an end point and we started with these enotes that we mentioned which is essentially the mortgage it was the loan documents can we get the industry to digitize the essential loan document and send that to fannie and freddie now with and to each other to the extent they want to now we are going to have simplifile which says ok i can send that same mortgage to be recorded at the closing so we re starting to build the back end of endpoints if you will there are a lot of companies out there that have digitized the front end there s a very competitive market when you arrive go to get a mortgage today we may be on a digital platform or we may be talking to somebody in an office that is actually typing into a digital platform that s a highly competitive space and those and well worn in the industry itself to sort of start the time to figure out how to automate the front end we would hope that that we re going to have an open api on this network that we re building we re hoping that those people will plug in what they re doing onto our network so that those essential digital documents can be codified and recorded there are literally hundreds of documents that exist in the world that go into a mortgage your mortgage provider will ask for your tax returns they want to see 1099 they wanted you to go after various forms that are somewhat unique to them they want past appointment history they may do a credit search all of that stuff is if there is an industry that s trying to organize that as you mentioned and it s in various states of way but largely in today s world that all gets printed out into paper documents and put in boxes and store it somewhere and there s so many different fields that are entered into on those forms because they re not that standardized there are acronyms and conventions and things that are hard for people to translate to bring that whole file together and so what we ve done is said let s start with the nugget the essential core which is the actual note itself and then allow we ll build some of it and will have this network built where others can plug into it and let s try to get the entire industry standardizing around our network if you will which will be the essential way to close the transaction jeremy campbell barclays analyst great thank you operator the next question is from mr kyle voigt of kbw please go ahead sir kyle voigt kbw analyst hi good morning maybe to switch gears to the trading business i know you re seeing some really good growth in global oil and other energy products but brent is still in the large features product by revenue and we ve seen some soft open interest throughout the past 2 years there just wondering if you can talk about why you think we haven t been seeing some of the same type of more historical growth rates in brent at least over the past 2 years and if there s anything in the horizon that could reaccelerate those growth rates ben jackson president kyle it s ben thanks for the question and yes we have seen what we view as a temporary pullback in open interest in volumes in brent and i think what you can point to is a lot of this happened in particular in the last 2 3 weeks you can point to a lot of very unforeseen events that have recently happened things such as removal of waivers against iran oil sanctions new bands being implemented on venezuelan oil and now the potential for contagion in russian oil all of this has led to a pretty uncertain environment for traders and while you ll hear us as an exchange operator and others point to times of volatility being great for volumes what s not great for volumes is complete uncertainty and an area where there is a complete unforeseen event that happens which tend to see and what we ve seen over time is the traders will go into a risk off mode and take a step back assess the situation and try to form a view on directionally where the market is going and we think that s what we re seeing in brent itself but you touched on an area that we re seeing that we are seeing growth and that s made up of significant amount of the pull of that recent temporary pullback and that s in that global oil complex and when you think about what is that global oil complex you ve got a whole suite of products that basically hang off of brent the gasoil and our wti business so these are products that are very precise basis locations for people to hedge risk at a point of consumption or a point of production in north america in the middle east in europe and across asia you see complementary spread in differential contracts between brent and gasoil and these contracts you also see refined products spreads so a barrel of oil versus refined products that come off of it oftentimes called crack spreads we ve seen significant growth in this part of the complex with open interest up 6 year over year and volumes up 18 year over year so when you combine this whole complex as one global oil business with over 500 contracts that have been developed with our commercial traders at the core you see a complex that s priced 2 3 of the world s oil it has led and continues to lead in open interest market share and has gained market share over the past year and that s a global complex that includes both futures options and all of our oil products together so we re going to begin to work with our commercial customers customer base to build that out kyle voigt kbw analyst got it thank you operator the next question is from alex blostein of goldman sachs please go ahead alex blostein goldman sachs analyst hey guys good morning and i ll follow up around the mortgage business can you guys update us on the i guess the revenues and expense contribution from the simplifile business that you bought i think the press release just mentioned strong track record of revenues revenue growth and profitability just trying to pencil out what that is and then jeff definitely helpful to summary of kind of what mers is and kind of what it does but again maybe update us on what the revenue there stands today and i guess bigger picture how does this business ultimately get a leverage ice s data and trading segments or is that meant to be really almost kind of like a stand alone part of what you guys do scott hill chief financial officer thanks for the question i m going to take the numbers part and then i ll hand it over to jeff for the important stuff so just quickly just in terms of the numbers simplifile we literally just signed it yesterday and as we mentioned on the press release we don t anticipate it closing until the third quarter what we will do as we typically have is once we ve closed it we ll update our guidance and give you the expense and the revenue associated with it what i can tell you is that when i give the expense update particularly if it s only in the fourth quarter i m hoping we could contain it in our current guidance and it ll be more than offset by revenue because it is a profitable business so more to come on that once we get the deal closed and as we said in the press release that that will be sometime in the third quarter we anticipate in terms of the mers revenue we actually had a strong first quarter the business tends to correlate a little bit or i guess it s a negative correlation with interest rates and so with them having moved a little bit higher as we move through last year is a little bit of concern it might impact that business but as it stabilized the first quarter was actually relatively strong on a pro forma basis well above 20 million of revenue we re up double digits year over year and so you ll recall that we gave you guidance i think of revenues 17 million to 19 million in the fourth quarter and we actually did a little better than 20 million in the first quarter and as i think i mentioned on that call is against the relatively low expense base so high incremental margin like a lot of the other businesses that we operate with that i ll hand it to jeff to talk about how it fits jeff sprecher chairman and chief executive officer well you re somewhat foreshadowing the ideas that we have here on data and analytics once a mortgage has been digitized and the information around it has been standardized so that it s searchable and can be run through analytics platforms fannie and freddie theoretically ought to be able to more quickly get to an underwrite decision that would speed up that process speed up funds flow and closing and as fannie and freddie layoff risk in the market as they do today they will allow the third party that are going to undertake that risk to be able to do more research on the portfolio of mortgages that would be in there so we do view that the data component of mortgage will become more interesting and valuable and will help drive down cost and speed up closing times mers when we acquired it was essentially a consortium and a membership organization with 5 000 members it has data policies within that the industry agreed to essentially we ve in taking control of the business we ve asked many of the companies that have been involved on the board of directors to stay on the board so we have representatives from the gses from large banks and what have you and really the reason that we ask them to stay on is to continue to contribute exactly to the dialogue that i just mentioned which is what is the information that the industry wants and needs how do we deal with pii information as we digitize things and make information more accessible what are the levels of information that the market needs versus the need to be kept proprietary thinking about the expansion of this business globally and into other asset classes of lending how does it meet the european standards and what have you so those are all tbd future conversations that we started honestly when we first got involved in the business and there ll be a natural by product that i think of digitization and standardization in this industry alex blostein goldman sachs analyst great thanks very much operator the next question is from mr brian bedell of deutsche bank please go ahead sir brian bedell deutsche bank analyst great thanks very much i want to stay on the mers topic i think jeff you jeff or scott you mentioned about 1 of outstanding mortgages right now are electronically documented through the enotes system can you help us think about the run rate path or the revenue growth path over the long term is it most is it entirely dependent on new originations or is there a path to convert existing mortgage documents that don t have any activity to them electronically in terms of bringing up that mortgage and then maybe just how many enotes actually did you register in 1q i know it was more than all of 18 altogether jeff sprecher chairman and chief executive officer i m going to start with the second part of your question 19 000 enotes in q1 is still a very small when you think of it in the context of the u s mortgage industry is still nascent but you ve seen what s going on underneath that is the early adopters people that are anxious to become more digital have embraced this idea and are moving quickly to try to build it into their workflow there s a broad cross section of people in the mortgage industry that are talking to us or looking at the api or figuring out how to build it into their current workflow and it s not unlike any analog to digital transition that you ve witness in other asset classes so what you see are early adaptors are getting in there quickly as they get in there and start to experience cost savings and ability to serve their customers better it s driving competition so we are very encouraged by the early results even though it s a low number the revenue model is simply we charge to you to it s a list essentially enote on our platform and simplifile charges to registered enote and the more that that can all be put into one workflow to make it easy for the lender and mortgage underwriters you can imagine that the pace of increase as for existing documents there are a number of companies out there that are exploring how to go back and digitize existing mortgages there s a lot of error rate in dealing with boxes of paper mortgages that exist in warehouses when there is a change of servicing rights when there is a foreclosure and one of the things that simplifile and mers has been working on over the last decade is changing local law and what have you so that the golden record if you will can be digital that the original mortgage you can may recall during the last financial crisis people showed up with global sign mortgages in courts and many judges rejected them and as a result mers the entity that was helping to find and produce those mortgages on behalf of the original lenders and so moving to electronic system with the golden record which is much like what s done in many other asset classes that can be respected by the courts will essentially be a reason that all these legacy mortgages will be scanned and put in that system and i mean like i had of the meeting i actually had a meeting on this topic yesterday with a third party who wanted to talk about how they can plug in the mers if they were to offer those kind of services brian bedell deutsche bank analyst so do you anticipate being able to get a bulk transfers of existing mortgages without any activity so no refi or no foreclosure or no new mortgage just go into some record keepers and be able to do a giant bulk transfer of those existing paperback you meant into enotes jeff sprecher chairman and chief executive officer potentially the problem is that those records are not standardized and you need essentially not just the ability to scan but you need essentially artificial intelligence or rules based engine that on a document that says somebody is named robert and another document has him down as bobby but that s the same person and where people have made errors in writing social security numbers down and all this other stuff you can get pretty quickly into chaos so the people that are and there are people looking at this are trying to figure out is their ability to scan those create an indelible record that will be respected by the courts and in foreclosures and store that record point it at mers and the enote and allow the marketplace itself to better transfer potentially those mortgages between one another particularly servicing rights which happens quite often brian bedell deutsche bank analyst okay great thank you so much for the color operator there s a follow up question from mr rich repetto of sandler o neill please go ahead sir rich repetto sandler o neill analyst yes hi just a question for ben on the fixed income side when you re back in to the revenue it looks like for tmc and bondpoint it looks like revenue went down quarter to quarter and i know you mentioned ben some softness in the muni market but it did look like from trace volumes that there was a record volume in 1q so just trying to understand the actual revenue from the fixed income on the trading side ben jackson president yes and rich i tried to hit that on the comments i made earlier where a lot of it had to do with a mix so the municipal space and our platforms compared to the others that you see out there tend to be more tilted toward the municipal space and the muni space has had a rough go at it lately again given that spreads between treasuries and munis has narrowed and treasuries have come into favor so what we have seen is that treasuries have picked up the treasuries tend to be at a lower price point price per transaction so what we do see is that with the efforts that we have under way and that i ve talked about on prior calls with the etf hub initiative and the build out of our rfq we are continuing to advance those efforts and with etf hub on schedule to be released later this year we see that the initiatives like that as well as the connection that we re building across the institutional businesses that we have we ll continue to change that mix as well as increase average trade size that we ll see on the platform rich repetto sandler o neill analyst got it thank you operator it s a follow up question from mr patrick o shaughnessy of raymond james please go ahead sir patrick o shaughnessy raymond james analyst hey great thank you so bakkt has obviously had some pretty well publicized delays since you announced the initiative how do you think the market opportunity for bakkt and how that s changed since you relaunched the effort jeff sprecher chairman and chief executive officer well to be completely transparent with you it s really been helpful that the cryptocurrency industry sort of went into what they call a winter that took some of the heat off of the timetable to launch there s been a and secondly we ve actually been looked at a number of different companies and acquired a company earlier this week that wouldn t have been available to us had this market been really hot because valuations were really hot so i see this kind of maturation that s going on where for example the people the blockchain engineers that we acquired through our recent acquisition became really interested if you will in affiliating with a larger more corporate if you will effort to move this to move the industry forward there s a lot of interest still in this market it s not when we talk about institutions the institutions have are regulated banks are regulated the regulators are trying to get their arms around this asset class and how to regulate it that s and we want to be a regulated venue which is why it s taken a while but that said you can t really get into the true institutional markets that we serve without being highly regulated and highly trusted and so the juices worth the squeeze in terms of it the way and it s going well now there were a lot of things that had to get sorted out over jurisdiction and custody and how these what will happen in a bankruptcy and those kinds of issues that in my mind need to be resolved before there s going to be wide adoption of the asset class and we ve been at the forefront of solving those and building the solutions for those and we re very very close now to finalizing all of that so once we re sure this sort of downturn in the value of these assets allowed us to attract some really great people and gave legislators regulators the time to think about in particular in the united states how to deal with this asset class patrick o shaughnessy raymond james analyst thank you operator the next question is from mr chris allen of compass point please go ahead chris allen compass point analyst good morning guys i wanted to ask a follow up on the muni market in general where does that market stand in terms of electronification particularly in the institutional side what are the impediments if there are any right now and how do you see that kind of evolving moving forward ben jackson president thanks chris yes so the municipal space it is far behind where even u s corporates are so if you look at estimates of the u s corporate market in terms of how much is electronic being 20 to 25 but clearly moving more and more electronic the municipal space is further behind where our estimates are call it 10 to 12 of it are electronic we are seeing that continue to move more electronic we re beneficiary of that obviously but the municipal space structurally has been tough for the point that i brought up before with the spreads between municipals and treasuries coming down but also if you just look at muni issuance if you look back 2 years ago it s significantly higher than where it is now now it s starting to just rebound at this point and as new issuance starts to come around we should see some benefit in the secondary trading on that and it takes a while to get behaviors to change from the analog type of transaction but it s early days but we are starting to see that move as well chris allen compass point analyst has the banks taking any steps toward electronic through new munis ben jackson president similar to corporates the dialogues that we re having with banks is that they start at certain trade sizes and started small trade sizes and looking to electronify that and then over time as they get more and more comfortable with it they ll move up in move up that threshold in terms of what s the minimum size that they no longer want a phone involved in that transaction they want to build more algorithms into pricing those trades more electronic execution in pricing those trades and municipals just a few years behind where corporates are chris allen compass point analyst thanks guys operator the next question is a follow up from michael carrier of bank of america please go ahead sameer murukutla bank of america analyst hey guys this is actually sameer murukutla mike had to jump off but a quick question related to your thought process around acquisition especially in the fixed income space or maybe can you give an update on how you think about the return in accretion goals meaning historically it s been a focus but given some of the structural growth in certain areas would you sacrifice those goals if you think the structural growth make up for it over a longer period jeff sprecher chairman and chief executive officer i guess the operant part of your question for me is longer period we try to be very disciplined about the return on invested capital we feel like we can pay a premium for a business if we can put it on our platform and quickly grow it or digitize it so and also integrate the business so that if we look generally out 3 years we want to start to see very high returns on invested capital we give ourselves we tend to give ourselves 3 years to integrate a business and honestly internally we try to drive ourselves to 2 and so we want to see very positive results mathematically coming out of that we i m smiling because we built 1 billion revenue business in fixed income i think without a lot of people realizing what we were doing because we really didn t talk about it in that way and we were able to acquire key parts of that business at valuations that were incredibly low relative to where people are valuing fixed income assets today i m not sure that the market has recognized that it s partly why we decided to pull the curtain back a little on this call and give you more color on what we look like today and so i don t know now that that sort of the curtains now that the wizard is visible i m not sure that we re going to be able to continue to find interesting assets that deliver on the metrics that i just tried to describe but we re always looking scott hill chief financial officer i think the only thing i would add to that as you ve heard us talk about our acquisition how does it fit our strategy how does it enable our growth how quickly can we integrate it how many synergies can we generate what s the return on the investment you ve seldom heard us say the word accretion because of the end of the day you can financially engineer accretion you can t financially engineer returns and if the deal done fits strategically we are not likely to be able to get those returns and so that we showed you the model a couple of summers ago and it was the case before we showed it to you it is the case now that it s about strategic fit it s about growth and its about returns those are the things that matter and it s one of the reasons you see our return on invested capital now back at 9 when our weighted average cost of capital is only 6 because we do focus on creating economic value sameer murukutla bank of america analyst thanks for the color jeff sprecher chairman and chief executive officer thank you warren gardiner vice president of investor relations well it s 9 30 i think we ll wrap up oh i m sorry sherry were you going to wrap it up for me jeff sprecher chairman and chief executive officer thank you currently i was more anxious to get off the call but thank you all it was a great quarter and we ll look forward to reporting our next quarter

dividend is now 1 15 per share and represents the largest 1 increase in eog s history this is a tremendous vote of confidence in eog s future and demonstrates a strong commitment to capital discipline and returning cash to shareholders through the dividend our premium combination of higher returns and organic growth is evident in every area of the company with 2019 shaping up to be one of the best operating performances in company history well cost and operating costs are falling and well productivity is strong eog is growing oil volumes at lower cost per barrel than ever before we re excited about 2019 and the outstanding operational and financial results we are delivering some of the highlights this quarter include year over year oil growth of 20 exceeding the high end of our crude oil production target capital expenditure below the low end of the expectations strong year over year lease operating and transportation per unit cost reductions additional reductions in completed well costs and we secured significant crude oil export capacity increasing our ability to receive the best prices eog continues to improve unit costs capital efficiency and profitability in fact we made the same amount of net income compared to the first quarter of last year with significantly lower oil prices a remarkable achievement demonstrating eog s resiliency to low oil prices and the company s sustainable ability to continuously improve in addition to great results this year we re excited about the steps we re taking to improve future results through our organic exploration of new high quality plays our exploration focus in 15 years of experience drilling horizontal oil wells has generated mountains of proprietary data that gives us an edge in identifying new plays we have 13 years of premium oil inventory so we are squarely focused on further improving the quality of our inventory rather than just adding more quantity adding a low cost organic inventory with better rock will enable the company to grow oil at lower cost and higher margins for years to come at eog we have an unwavering commitment to creating shareholder value through our long standing business model exploration driven organic growth operational excellence technical leadership all underpinned by a distinctive culture our decentralized structure and focus on returns combined with our entrepreneurial pleased but never satisfied mindset continues to produce outstanding results today and is set to produce sustainable improvements in the future eog has never been in better shape and the company has never had a brighter future next up is billy to review our first quarter operational performance and outlook for the remainder of 2019 billy helms chief operating officer thanks bill before i go into the quarter results i want to be clear on this point we will not increase capex we remain confident in our 2019 plan and activity will be adjusted throughout the year to achieve our production and capital objectives now on to the first quarter our results reflect our tremendous efficiency gains that were beginning to emerge late last year and materialized more fully early this year we delivered more oil producing 436 000 barrels per day exceeding our forecast to be more specific the wells completed at the end of last year are outperforming our forecast and that trend has continued into the first quarter of this year of equal importance we spent less capital than expected our capital was well below our forecast for the quarter as we are realizing the increase in efficiencies across our operations unit operating cost performance was also stellar coming in at the low end of our forecast and in the case of lease operating expense we were well below our forecast it s important to note that our strong operational execution is not related to the reduction in service costs it s driven by our relentless quest for continuous improvements and our attempts to focus on developing new technology all areas of our operations contributed to eog s first quarter execution and capital efficiency first our drilling teams continued to markedly improve their drilling times and performance more importantly the consistency of the improved performance can be seen across our entire rig fleet this is a result of two factors one we made the decision to maintain the high performing drilling teams and services that are now consistently executing our internally engineered drilling program in each of our major areas of activity we continue to achieve new record drilling times and cost and two our drilling teams continue to adopt new technology processes and specialized tools that improve both drilling performance and repeatability ideas are developed in house and deployed by partnering with service providers for example eliminating even one trip where the drill bit must be brought back to service can save up to 100 000 to capture those savings we first analyze then design the best downhole motor to use in our bottom hole assembly and took the additional step of bringing quality assurance in house as a result of having direct control of this equipment we have observed a pronounced reduction in the number of trips while also improving the rate of penetration together reducing the trips and increasing the penetration rate is saving up to 400 000 per well it s this type of innovation that helps eog continue to deliver best in class drilling performance across all of our plays second our completion teams are experimenting with new design advancements that combine both technique and the use of new diverting agents this proprietary formula is noticeably improving well performance and equally important reducing completion costs well performance in these low permeability reservoirs improved due to enhanced fracture complexity completion costs are reduced due to lower material cost and faster execution allows us to complete more lateral feet per day the result is a solid improvement in our capital efficiency further testing and production time will yield more fulsome data and place specific recipes for each of our operating areas but suffice is to say that the early results are encouraging finally investments in strategic water oil and gas infrastructure along with gathering partnerships allow us to leverage our scale and our core operating areas and are having a long term sustainable impact on our operating costs particularly lease operating expenses we continue to evaluate additional high return long term impact opportunities to further reduce cost in summary we ve had a great start to 2019 our operational teams are on track to deliver on our improved capital efficiency goals average well cost across our portfolio are down about 2 5 halfway toward our goal our 5 goal for the year we ve made significant progress towards our goal to reduce per barrel finding cost these improvements will continue to drive down our dd a rate over time and along with unit operating cost improvements enable eog to achieve our return objective in low commodity price environments here s lance to provide a marketing update highlighted by our recent progress to secure gulf coast export capacity lance terveen senior vice president marketing thanks billy eog has established marketing agreements that provide access to crude oil export markets in corpus christi and houston our capacity in corpus christi will ramp up from 100 000 barrels of oil per day in 2020 to 250 000 barrels of oil per day in 2022 we expect to sell crude oil to export markets from multiple plays including the eagle ford and delaware basin as we illustrate on slide 19 eog will control its crude volumes from the basin all the way across the dock as our agreements provide for pipeline capacity terminal tankage and dock access with the option to price our crude oil farther downstream we expand our flexibility to sell product to domestic or international markets whichever provides the highest margins this optionality ensures strong price discovery and liquidity for eog barrels our export marketing agreements are an example of our integrated marketing strategy which is designed to achieve four objectives first is control control means firm capacity of our product to the point where margins are maximized second is flexibility we plan ahead to establish multiple options to deliver product to the highest netback market third is diversification we take a portfolio approach knowing the optimal netback price will move around faster than we can adjust transportation agreements fourth is duration we prefer shorter term contracts to avoid long term high cost fixed commitments this strategy is reflected in advantaged positioning of our oil takeaway in the permian basin eog controls this barrels from the wellhead to the sales point delaware basin barrels are transported out of the basin on a fit for purpose gathering system to five pipeline interconnect points which can transport the oil anywhere from cushing houston corpus christi and even midland and we have accomplished this with limited long term commitments and competitive transportation rates this strategy paid off in the first quarter despite the volatility of oil and natural gas prices in the permian eog was able to flow all of its production and realize strong prices during the quarter in aggregate eog s realized us oil price was 1 21 above wti in the first quarter and our us gas price was only 0 36 below henry hub this is a tremendous achievement in navigating a volatile market crude oil and natural gas marketing is an integral part of eog s value creation strategy we anticipate future infrastructure needs to protect flow assurance and diversify our marketing options so that we can maximize our price realizations net of transportation costs we accomplish this by working closely with our operating teams in each of our major plays and divisions to understand the potential future development plans and by keeping a pulse on market fundamentals of each product and marketing point our proven marketing strategy has helped eog successfully navigate bottlenecks across all areas of operations including most recently in the permian basin we measure the success of our marketing efforts through our price realizations which we highlight on slide number 20 as well as the transportation costs we incur to deliver our production to market next up is ken to review the eagle ford highlights kenneth w boedeker executive vice president exploration and production thanks lance the eagle ford remains the workhorse asset for eog earning high returns and delivering sustainable growth while generating strong cash flow eog has been developing the eagle ford for about 10 years however less than 40 of the identified locations have been drilled last year eagle ford production grew 9 we forecast the eagle ford is capable of growing for at least 10 more years at premium rates of return while generating significant cash flow in excess of capital expenditures each year more importantly we believe the capital productivity of the eagle ford will continue to improve in the years ahead sustainable cost reduction has been a key theme throughout our 10 year history developing the eagle ford even in a play that has already accumulated significant operating efficiencies we were able to reduce drilling costs by 7 and increase completed lateral feet per day by over 50 in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 2018 in fact the first quarter of 2019 was our best drilling efficiency quarter that we ve ever had in the eagle ford on our dollar per foot basis highlighting our culture of always getting better on the production side we are continuing our efforts to further optimize artificial lift and manage water production which will help us control lease operating expenses longer term drilling in our western eagle ford acreage continues to deliver strong premium returns net present value finding cost and capital efficiency our western acreage will be a crucial component of long term growth for the play and we expect it will make up the majority of our eagle ford drilling program by 2021 growing from about 40 of our program in 2019 capital efficiency in the west is caught up over time and is nearing parity with the east as illustrated on slide 39 compared to the east laterals in the west are longer and perfect drilling costs are lower so productivity and economics per well are competitive our proprietary enhanced oil recovery process in the eagle ford continues to perform at technical and commercial expectations eur is as a secondary recovery process in this play and primary development remains the main focus of our operations in 2019 the eur footprint will be expanded after a larger portion of the play has been fully developed the best days of the eagle ford are still ahead we continue to convert non premium inventory to premium status through sustainable cost reductions productivity improvements and leasehold consolidation the eagle ford is a strong growth asset for eog and we expect it to remain one for many years ahead now here s ezra to discuss the delaware basin ezra yacob executive vice president exploration and production thanks ken in the delaware basin we continue to improve on operational momentum we gained last year retaining top performing drilling rigs and completion crews towards the end of 2018 had an immediate impact on the first quarter we drilled and completed 78 gross wells across six different premium targets with just 18 rigs and 7 completion crews compared to the first quarter of 2018 we drilled and completed 42 more lateral feet however we used one less rig and one less completion crew as a result we ve made strong progress towards our full year cost reduction goals in addition we reduced drilling days by 29 transferred 99 of our water by pipe which reduces traffic and saves 2 per barrel compared to trucking source more than 70 of our water through reuse and reduced total well cost by 5 finally first quarter wells are outperforming our expectations and we beat our production and financial targets for the first quarter including capital expenditures the result is a first quarter development program that achieved an all in finding cost below 10 per barrel of equivalent while earning 9 million of npv per well at an average 100 direct rate of return eog is a vast industry leading 400 000 net acre position in the core of the delaware basin the rock is about one mile thick and geologically complex due to our 15 years of experience drilling horizontal oil wells we have accelerated the learning curve in this basin as a result even though the delaware basin is still early in its evolution and one of our highest growth areas this asset is already creating significant value through high return drilling low operating expense and positive cash flow just three short years since focusing on its development i ll now turn it over to tim driggers to discuss our financials and capital structure timothy driggers chief financial officer executive vice president thanks ezra eog had strong financial performance in the first quarter the company generated discretionary cash flow of 1 9 billion invested 1 7 billion in capital expenditures before acquisitions which was below the low end of our guidance and paid 128 million in dividends this left 55 million in free cash flow in addition we invested 303 million in bolt on property acquisitions located in new exploration areas as part of our debt reduction plan we expect to repay the 900 million bond scheduled to mature on june 1 with cash on hand which as of march 31st was 1 1 billion i m happy to report moody s recognized eog s growing financial strength last month upgrading eog s credit rating to a3 with a stable outlook to quote the moody s press release announcing the upgrade the company stated the upgrade of eog s ratings into the a category recognized as the company s high capital productivity backed by operating excellence and a long life high quality asset base that will continue to underpin the strong credit profile amid a number of oil price scenarios the a3 rating is also supported by the company s conservative financial policies last but not least we announced a dividend increase of 31 in yesterday s earnings release the indicated annual rate is now 1 15 per share eog has added hedges for 150 000 barrels of oil per day at an average price of 62 50 this covers about one third of our crude oil production over the remainder of 2019 for natural gas we added hedges for 250 000 mmbtu per day at an average price of 2 90 which is about 20 of our us natural gas production through october we believe the decision to lock in a portion of our crude our current crude oil and natural gas prices is prudent considering the volatility in prices and the high return on investment of our capital program at these prices i ll turn it back over to bill for closing remarks william thomas chairman of the board chief executive officer thanks tim i have a few highlights to leave you with first we re running under plan on capital and over plan on volumes and we re not raising capital second eog has tremendous momentum across all facets of the business drilling completions operating expenses marketing and exploration third we re still getting better along with continuous cost reduction and strong well performance we re optimistic our low cost organic exploration efforts this year will increase the quality of our inventory even further and lower the cost of future oil production fourth our export marketing agreements provide direct access to international markets and expand our ability to capture the best prices fifth the dividend increase shows our confidence in our sustainable business model to deliver performance through the commodity price cycles and finally our sustainable business model is driven by our culture we have an insatiable drive to continue to get better we re confident eog can deliver double digit returns and double digit growth and achieve our goal of being one of the best performing companies in the s p 500 through commodity price cycles long into the future thanks for listening and now we ll go to q a questions and answers operator thank you sir the question and answer session will be conducted electronically operator instructions and your first question will come from neal dingmann of suntrust robinson humphrey please go ahead neal dingmann suntrust robinson humphrey analyst good morning gentlemen strong quarter congrats my first question maybe bill for you could you all speak to your plans of you ve done a great job of balancing growth with shareholder return and really when you look at that you ve almost doubled now your dividend in the last year while production and drilling about 30 here over the last year or so all while oil is up only about 15 so i mean my question would be specifically if oil stays here or goes higher would you stick with the 12 to 16 oil growth plans and if so what would you do with the potential material amount of free cash flow william thomas chairman of the board chief executive officer yes thank you neal first of all i think it s really clear we said that on our first call of the year that we re not going to be shifting into a lower growth mode and we don t have specifics on 2020 oil growth but certainly you can think of the company and our 14 oil growth target this year is really on a bit on the low end and so we re really focused on high return oil growth and that s the way we believe will create the most value for our shareholders on the long term you heard i think from ezra the tremendous rates of return and the npv we re creating on each well we re drilling so that s the priority for us in the future and that s where we think we re going to continue to generate the most value in the long term neal dingmann suntrust robinson humphrey analyst very good then maybe my second question will be for billy or ezra could you just discuss particularly in the perm your pdp decline expectations i mean in the prepared remarks i think you all commented just how much better these new wells are than a year ago so i m just wondering is that true as far as how these wells are holding up or just anything you could discuss toward how you re seeing these wells after a number of months billy helms chief operating officer yes neal this is billy i think in general across all of our plays you see that as we drill longer laterals that didn t necessarily translate to directionally higher ip30 s per well but we see the performance hang in there longer you see a little bit lower decline over time and i think that s really if you look at the first quarter results that s what s driving a lot of our performance sustained improvement in all of our programs and it s a function of just the quality of the wells the better execution across the wells and the focus of the teams ezra you want to add anything or ezra yacob executive vice president exploration and production i d just highlight too that the the team s done a great job in the permian in the last year really learning a lot about the reservoir figuring out across our our acreage position which targets need to be co developed together the spacing both horizontally and vertically and when you combine that increase in well productivity with our our excellent operational execution that s why you re seeing the lower finding cost discussed in the opening remarks and the higher capital efficiency which we have great success is going to continue throughout the year neal dingmann suntrust robinson humphrey analyst thanks for all the detail guys operator the next question will be from doug leggate of bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead doug leggate bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks good morning everybody guys i wonder if i could touch on the acquisition capital and obviously it s you re not going to tell us where you re acquiring i guess but some idea as to what we can expect that pace to look like going forward was one first quarter very much a one off or should we expect some kind of sustainable level of acquisition spending as we go forward william thomas chairman of the board chief executive officer doug it your question because it s difficult to hear you was a little bit garbled so could you be a little bit more clear there doug leggate bank of america merrill lynch analyst i apologize i m on my cellphone can you hear me okay now bill william thomas chairman of the board chief executive officer yes go ahead doug leggate bank of america merrill lynch analyst so my question was on the level of acquisition capital going forward was first quarter very much a one off or should we expect acquisition capital to be something of a repeating pattern as we go forward for a period william thomas chairman of the board chief executive officer okay thank you that was that was better yeah we as you know the company we re not really focused on corporate m a s but we do occasionally look at bolt on type acquisitions and they re focused primarily in our exploration plays and these these acquisitions are very low cost and very very high potential obviously or we wouldn t be interested in doing them and they re kind of one offs and so it s not something you re going to see repeatedly over every quarter and so i m not saying we re not going to do another one this year or not we don t have any plans at this point to do any more but they re really opportunistic drilling opportunistic given and certainly are focused on very very high return low cost drilling potential doug leggate bank of america merrill lynch analyst i appreciate the answer hopefully you can still hear me my follow up is just a quick one obviously we re really pleased to see the dividend increase i m sure a lot of people would applaud that but i m curious what do you think the right payout ratio is for an e p company in other words as you get to where your longer term plans go what do you think that right percentage of your operating cash flow should be being returned to shareholders and i ll leave it there thanks william thomas chairman of the board chief executive officer well certainly i think that s operator or company dependent i don t think there s any one one answer for any company for eog specifically we re generating super high fantastic returns on every dollar we spend and so we believe our allocation on reinvesting in very very high rate premium drilling is the number one priority we also strongly believe as we ve demonstrated this quarter in strong sustainable dividend growth and we think that s the best way to give cash back to shareholders and then we re also very focused on having a pristine balance sheet and we think that s just a fundamental good business practice and it gives us an enormous advantage especially for countercyclic opportunities in the future so that s kind of our allocation and i think that s very unique to eog s business model and i think it s very sustainable for us doug leggate bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks a lot guys appreciate the answers operator the next question will be from charles meade of johnson rice please go ahead charles meade johnson rice analyst good morning bill to you and your team there i have a question about your capex trajectory over the year if you look at the way you guys have posted 1q and your guidance for 2q you have a first half is heavier than the than the back half and we saw that same pattern in 2018 so my question is is that is that a feature or a manifestation of your planning process or was that more just a coincidence with the way that 2019 2018 is shaking out billy helms chief operating officer yes charles this is billy helms so yeah our first quarter capex was about 27 of our total annual budget and in the first half if you look at our guidance we will be slightly more weighted towards the first half than we are in the second half and we have confidence that we ll be able to meet our capital and production goals for the year so i expect as we go through the year you ll see us adjust our schedule probably a slight reduction in the second half but also it s not just related to the cadence of rigs we also have infrastructure spend and leasehold spend that happens in a quarter so i think we re very what i would say is we re very confident we ll be able to make our production goals and stay within our capex that we ve outlined and it s really kind of early to provide guidance for how we ll ratio that down through the year because we have a lot of flexibility operating in multiple basins so it will fluctuate as we go through the year charles meade johnson rice analyst got it okay thank you for that and then one i guess kind of more targeted question on the delaware basin position i noticed that the your bone springs laterals are significantly shorter i think it s 5 500 lateral feet versus really 7 500 or 7 800 on other zones in that same basin can you elaborate a little bit on what may be going on there is it about the lease configuration where you re developing those bone springs or was it more a decision about the way you need to stimulate that formation ezra yacob executive vice president exploration and production yes charles this is ezra that s a great question really you picked up on it there in in the latter half of your question it really just comes down to lease configuration where shape of our drilling units are i think in general as you ve seen as we look back at our well results quarter over quarter we re trending to get longer with our laterals across all of our plays and the reason for that is that simply the cost per foot is so much less that it really increases the capital efficiency and so i d look in the future to see that bone spring getting longer as well charles meade johnson rice analyst got it thank you for that color operator the next question will be from tim rezvan of oppenheimer please go ahead tim rezvan oppenheimer analyst hi good morning all eagle ford inventory debt remains focused for investors and i noted pretty interesting comments in the release about high grading the residual 4900 non premium locations is this just a matter of sort of cheaper well costs longer laterals and the new completions or is it really more to it from a delineation or exploration point of view and kind of how high is getting that number up how high is that on your priority list this year kenneth w boedeker executive vice president exploration and production yeah tim this is ken as far as converting those non premium locations to premium we look at that several ways we look at that with trying to reduce the well cost and improve the productivity of the wells so we re always looking to being able to do that and looking at all the different areas we re actually doing several different packages and tests to improve our our conversion of non premium to premiums throughout the year and throughout our acreage position so we have a significant number of those laterals to drill this year and we have a significant number to convert in the future where we re also drilling a lot longer laterals as we go towards the west and that ll help convert some of those non premium wells to premium tim rezvan oppenheimer analyst okay so you expect to see that number maybe grind higher throughout the year kenneth w boedeker executive vice president exploration and production that s what we re working towards tim rezvan oppenheimer analyst okay thank you then my follow up your proxy came out in march and it stated that less than 90 of wells drilled in 2018 qualified as premium i was hoping to better understand what that means does that mean that well level returns didn t hit thresholds or does it mean that there was more exploratory drilling in that year and just thinking about maybe how we should think about that in 2019 given the exploratory focus thanks kenneth w boedeker executive vice president exploration and production yeah tim it means that a few of the wells that we drilled and it is a very few in the total package of wells we drilled last year were either step out wells or exploration wells in areas where we didn t maybe didn t have the infrastructure in place or we re on the learning curve in some of the spacing tests didn t quite make the 30 after tax rate return at 40 flat it doesn t mean those wells didn t or weren t really strong economics those wells are fantastic economics probably better than the probably are non premium wells are better than the average for the whole industry on returns but it was just a very few of those and that s what that meant tim rezvan oppenheimer analyst okay thanks and just to push it do you have a number on that is that 11 or is it kind of a higher number kenneth w boedeker executive vice president exploration and production i m sorry off the top of my head i don t have the number tim rezvan oppenheimer analyst okay all right thank you operator the next question will be from paul grigel of macquarie please go ahead paul grigel macquarie analyst hi good morning in the release you discussed testing additional targets in the woodford could you elaborate on what you would be seeing there and what timeframe you could see results from that portion of the program kenneth w boedeker executive vice president exploration and production yeah this is ken we re continuing to test other areas in the woodford as we get additional information on that and anything material we ll we ll release to you guys i would like to make the point that we ve really made great strides in the operational efficiency in that in the woodford play this year we ve almost dropped our our drilling costs down and met our target for the year so we do still plan to complete about 30 wells in the area this year and we re we re real pleased with the progress that we ve made paul grigel macquarie analyst okay and then earlier in the call there s a comment made as the eagle ford program matures and there s more development opportunities the expansion the eor program will occur could you elaborate on on is that by area is that a geological testing is that simply you just need to make sure that the the wells have matured and have hit a certain level just trying to understand when the eor program could see expansion throughout the eagle ford kenneth w boedeker executive vice president exploration and production yeah this is ken again we ll expand the eor as we really finish up with our primary development in those areas we ll expand that into areas that make sense based on some of the results that we ve seen already with the eor program so it s really a matter of finishing up primary development in a lot of those areas paul grigel macquarie analyst is that a certain number of years after initial development or just trying to understand when when primary development is considered finished kenneth w boedeker executive vice president exploration and production i would guess i would classify primary development as finished when we quit drilling wells in those areas and we can begin the eor process paul grigel macquarie analyst fine thank you very much operator the next question will be from leo mariani of keybanc please go ahead leo mariani keybanc analyst hey guys just wanted to follow up a little bit on the dividend increase here obviously as you you pointed out very material increase for eog wanted to get a sense as to whether or not you guys might be seeking a yield that s a little closer to kind of the 2 that the s p 500 has out there and then additionally just with respect to the dividend is there some kind of price level for example on the oil side that you guys may stress test that to or for example you say hey at 45 we need to be confident that we can manage that and still target our production growth just any color you had around that would be helpful william thomas chairman of the board chief executive officer leo yeah this is bill yes certainly the dividend increase is evaluated every quarter obviously the macro view of oil prices and our ability to sustain the dividend is a very important thing we ve never cut the dividend ever in the history of eog and we don t ever want to do that so when we make a commitment on the dividend we make a commitment and in our commitment the last two years has been as we stated we wanted to increase the dividend faster than our 19 historical average so the last two years we ve increased it 31 and so our focus on the future is to continue to do that we don t give a specific number but certainly we want to have very strong dividend group growth for a long number of years and that s a commitment that we re making to our shareholders leo mariani keybanc analyst okay that s that s good color and i just wanted to jump over to the exploration front i guess clearly you guys made a couple of bolt on acquisitions in the first quarter in the hopes of bolstering that effort but i certainly sensed a fair bit of excitement around the exploration effort this year from your comments i m supposing that you re not going to be ready to share results but just based on sort of what you re seeing out there can you qualitatively indicate whether or not you think some of this is working and might we get some announcements here in 2019 from eog on that front ezra yacob executive vice president exploration and production yes leo this is ezra thanks for the question as we discussed earlier in the year and in the opening comments like you suggested we re pretty excited about the exploration opportunities we re really focused on applying our drilling and completions techniques to higher quality unconventional reservoirs and what really drives our process is having a multi basin dataset that allows us to compare and contrast different reservoir characteristics of each of the sweet spots and in the established plays that we re in and we apply that to new ideas and areas as bill highlighted we re not just interested in adding quantity but really increasing the quality of our premium inventory and that really should continue to reduce our finding cost lower our dd a and help achieve our long term goals of double digit growth and returns and when we have a little more insight and color something a little more material we ll certainly update you guys leo mariani keybanc analyst okay that s helpful and i guess couldn t help notice the marketing sort of arrangements with the export capacity that you folks signed up here i just wanted to get a sense has eog already been exporting oil barrels internationally at this point and it certainly seems as though there is a potential big increase coming over the next couple of years just wanted to get a sense of whether or not you ve already got some relationships with international buyers out there that you re hoping to expand lance terveen senior vice president marketing yeah leo good morning this is lance thanks for the question yeah when you think about the existing business i mean we ve been very active in houston for quite some time i mean houston is really kind of in our wheelhouse especially since 2012 with a lot of our pipeline capacity that comes into the houston market but since the export ban has been lifted we ve been actively engaged there we ve got a tank position that s there as well so we ve been making spot sales for quite some time especially looking in the last year or two so we ve been active on that front i d say we re very excited too about our new capacity that s going to be starting up moving into next year you know really when you think about and you look at the balances in the us you look at supply growth you look at imports you know exports are going to be here the stay and we really want to have a very large position there and having that control at the dock we feel that s just going to give us a lot of price discovery but again it s about a portfolio approach i mean we want to protect those realizations and so moving into next year and you look we feel we re going to be very well positioned with our it s unique that we re going to have our permian and also our eagle ford that we re going to be able to show across the docks so we feel we re very unique relative to when you look at the producer group on the different qualities so we re going to be able to show to the domestic market but then also our international customers too leo mariani keybanc analyst thanks for the color operator the next question will be from jeffrey campbell of tuohy brothers investment research please go ahead jeffrey campbell tuohy brothers investment research analyst good morning i just wanted to touch base again on the various technological efforts data analysis all the stuff you are doing you called it up again and it sounded like it was perhaps getting even more and more into the daily field operations so i was wondering if you could just give us a little bit of color on that thank you billy helms chief operating officer yeah jeffrey this is billy helms i can add a little bit of color to that i think part of that goes down to our very culture of the company we are always striving to get better at what we do and the way we do that is we look at all the details and we gather lots and lots of data and we ve had these systems in place for some time and then the key part of that is delivering that data back to our teams so they can exercise good decisions on how to improve our operations and the way we just do our business in all aspects and you re seeing that manifest itself in the drilling highlights that we offered today as well as the completion highlights improvements that we re seeing so on the drilling side we re monitoring the daily rate of penetration on all of our drilling rigs and making sure our drilling times are not just keeping up with what we re doing but how do we continue to get better and so the results we re seeing today are a direct reflection of our ability to gather the data and transport that back and analyze it and deliver it to the field and have the guys making the decisions so it is part of our culture real time returns focused decision making leo mariani keybanc analyst so for example the thing that you talked about earlier today where you re coming up with new completion methods that are using diverters more effectively and you are cutting costs accordingly these kind of efforts are emanating from all this data analysis that you just talked about billy helms chief operating officer absolutely and we re using more importantly and we re using that data real time so we re actually making decisions based on the pressure rates pressures and rates we re seeing on the wells we re not only fracking but the offset wells to make decisions about how to implement our formula and so that s why the formula is not a cookie cutter formula you can apply everywhere it s tailored it s specifically designed by each well by each zone depending on the target zone and the offsets it takes an integral approach to be able to analyze that data real time and make the right decisions leo mariani keybanc analyst okay and if i could just ask a quick follow up to that just when we re thinking about it is this part of the 5 goal to get cost down or is that 5 goal more based on logistics and contracting and that sort of thing billy helms chief operating officer no that s a good question tim ph i would add to that that really none of the cost savings we re seeing to date are a factor of service cost reductions it is strictly improving efficiencies lowering our cost by doing things better as well as making better wells so we re seeing the double effect of reducing cost improving well performance and it s all directly related to our ability to analyze collect the data and analyze it real time leo mariani keybanc analyst okay great thanks i appreciate that color operator the next question will be from jeanine wai of barclays please go ahead jeanine wai barclays analyst hi good morning everyone billy helms chief operating officer good morning jeanine wai barclays analyst hi my question is on sand a sand provider recently commented that some emp s are switching back to northern white from local sand due to crushing reasons which i guess there could be production and cost implications for emp s and i know eog does a lot of its own testing and i believe you re an early mover in this area so you probably have more data than anyone on this can you discuss your thoughts on kind of this recent commentary and how much exposure you have to local sand any basin specific color you have would be really helpful too william thomas chairman of the board chief executive officer yes jeanine this is bill certainly we got a tremendous we ve got 20 years of history in horizontal shale plays and we ve used every kind of sand proppant material that s been available over the years currently we are focused on using local sand certainly in the permian that s a big cost saver for us and certainly the industry too so we re going to continue to do that and we re also i think shifting to local sand in the other play such as the eagle ford and many of the rocky plays and in oklahoma too so that s a direction that we re focused in and along with a diversion material we re making significantly better wells and lower cost wells we do have our own testing facilities we ve been engaged in capturing sand and multiple sources and we screen it and test it and we re very confident that the sand we use in every play it s kind of tailor picked for each play but we re very confident that the compressive strength and the quality of sand that we use in each play is the right mix for long term well performance jeanine wai barclays analyst okay and i think the commentary was kind of triangulating around i think maybe the eagle ford and the mid con outside of the permian and so you do use local sand in those areas as well and you re satisfied william thomas chairman of the board chief executive officer yes yes we re satisfied jeanine wai barclays analyst okay great thank you for taking my question william thomas chairman of the board chief executive officer welcome operator the next question will be from brian singer of goldman sachs please go ahead brian singer goldman sachs analyst thank you good morning william thomas chairman of the board chief executive officer hi brian brian singer goldman sachs analyst the debate one of the debates out there is whether for eog but also for industry is whether the best of the inventory in shale is drilled from either a productivity perspective or rate of return perspective and i think for eog you re more specifically pushing back on this point but the comparison of the eagle ford east versus west area so i was wondering if you could touch on two other areas the first is the permian and your outlook for the ability of efficiency and productivity gains from here to overcome movement from core to less core over time and the second is exploration i think there was a comment earlier that you expect your exploration efforts will lower the cost of a future oil production what has given you confidence that that is the case if it is truly exploratory ezra yacob executive vice president exploration and production yes brian thank you for the question this is ezra let me start with the back half of that question first on the exploration side and what we re excited about on our exploration opportunities is we feel like we ve identified multiple opportunities where we have an opportunity to apply some of the data and the techniques that we ve been learning on the eagle ford the woodford the permian and the powder we can take some of these techniques and apply them to basically a higher quality reservoir that still should be considered unconventional by nature and we think that the well productivity should be on par with some of our best wells with shallower decline basically due to the reservoir quality the other important thing obviously is as you touched on is being a first mover in these basins and being able to capture the sweet spots of each of these plays if i transition now and sorry i did this in reverse order but if i go to the permian for example i think the way to think about the permian and one reason we spent the time highlighting the progress that we ve made in the eagle ford is that every year one of the benefits of working in multiple basins is yet to combine datasets from multiple basins and those learnings as you roll them in and integrate them into the front end of both your geologic models your drilling and your completions techniques that s what allows us to improve some of what today might be considered a non core area and really improve those well productivity results and continue to drive down our cost to increase the returns of those areas so the best example i would say for the permian is really looking back at that eagle ford example and how we ve taken our western eagle ford results today and really improve them to a point where they re above and beyond what we re doing in the eastern eagle ford just a few years ago brian singer goldman sachs analyst great thank you and then my follow up is with regards to the powder river basin you highlighted that you ve made some progress on the infrastructure front can you add some more color there particularly in how big you are sizing that infrastructure and how significant you think production could be especially given the competitive profitability you ve highlighted at least as it relates to the niobrara and mowry zones on your slide 41 the turner wasn t there maybe that would be another point to touch on also billy helms chief operating officer yeah brian this is billy helms yeah the first quarter we really tested more turner and parkman zones particularly and as we build out infrastructure for the bigger development it s i think our infrastructure build will be built out in segments to keep pace with our plans for drilling in that year s program we re not going to get out ahead and build a infrastructure that s made for longer term drilling program just because of the capital efficiency that erode so the size though the scale of the infrastructure will be able to handle certainly the plan that we have in place for those areas so it ll be adequately sized but it ll be scheduled in a pace that keeps up with the current drilling plans for that area so we got off to a slow start really in the powder really due to weather we plan to ramp up activity as we go through the year and we re still very excited about the initial results we re seeing from the mowry and niobrara test and as we get more data on those certainly we ll provide more color there but we re still excited about the powder opportunities we see in front of us brian singer goldman sachs analyst great thank you operator the next question will be from ryan todd of simmons energy please go ahead ryan todd simmons energy analyst okay thanks maybe a couple of follow ups and some other things i appreciate the clarity that you ve given on the eagle ford if we look at the and the improvements that you ve seen out to the west as we look at the type curve that you carry in the eagle ford it s got a 5 300 foot lateral length with a certain level of productivity there the lateral length feels like it s clearly trending higher is it safe to say that as the lateral length increases and as the west has improved is that type curve probably conservative relative to what we should expect to see going forward kenneth w boedeker executive vice president exploration and production yeah ryan this is ken again we are really pleased with the way the wells have been reacting out there and our well productivity is meeting the expectations we do see the performance variations across the 120 mile long acreage position and as we extend our as we extend the laterals in the west we ll be seeing well productivity increase well rates and capital efficiency increase out there as well as reducing finding cost ryan todd simmons energy analyst great thanks and then maybe a follow up on some of the acquisition activity and expiration versus your core basins you ve obviously been spending money picking up acreage in some of your exploratory basins that you are very excited about i mean does this do you still see opportunities to add the positions in your core areas of operations or is the valuation outside of those basins just far more compelling at this point william thomas chairman of the board chief executive officer ryan this is bill certainly we have a very decentralized exploration effort all seven of our domestic divisions have very strong exploration staff so we are working literally every basin in the us probably not a well being drilled we don t know something about and so we re leasing in multiple places here at very low cost and we believe the prospects that we re leasing on have premium economic potential due to the rock quality as ezra talked about and so some of them are in basins that have had a lot of historical production some of them are in places where there s not really much historic production at all but they re all very high quality and the size of the prospects for working on we use an example of a couple of years ago we talked about the woodford oil play we introduced that s about 200 million barrels net to eog that s kind of on the small side so we re not looking for things smaller than that but 200 million barrels net to accompany a discovery of that type anywhere in the world is very significant so last year we announced two new plays in the powder river basin that totaled 1 9 billion barrels so that s a very large one so that s a good way to put the brackets on the size of them but the good thing is as ezra talked about we believe we can continue to organically generate significant prospect potential in the future and added a very very low cost much much lower costs than doing m as and so when we do these bolt on acquisitions there are large amounts of acreage for very very low cost and very very high potential in our mind and so we ve been generating premium inventory twice as fast as we ve been drilling it and the quality of our inventory is going up at the same time so some of the previous questions are based on is eog s inventory quality declining and i can tell you we can tell you with absolute confidence that we believe our inventory quality will continue to improve so the quality is going up and we re not having any problem replacing it much faster than we re drilling it ryan todd simmons energy analyst yes i appreciate the color bill operator the next question will be from arun jayaram of jp morgan please go ahead arun jayaram jp morgan analyst good morning bill i wanted to see if you could elaborate on your comments on 2020 i know you don t have an official growth target for 2020 but your comments this morning seem to indicate your confidence that the company could grow to a production call it greater than 14 and i just wondered maybe qualitatively what would drive you to have that level of confidence because it would be off of a larger base of production this year william thomas chairman of the board chief executive officer yes arun we have that confidence because i think of the culture of the company and the structure of the company and our ability to continue to add new plays to the system we have a chart in our ir deck i believe it s on page 11 that shows eog s existing plays and their maturity phase so most of the things that we re drilling right now still have a lot of growth opportunity and we re adding additional premium locations in each one of those plays so that s a big source of new potential and then we re working on all these emerging plays and as they come into the development mode that will keep shifting more and more activity and inventory into the growth mode of the company and the growth mode for each one of these plays are not a few years they are multi years 10 plus 15 years a growth mode for each one of these plays and then the structure of our company because it s decentralized we can execute on a large number of multiple plays at the same time with a lot of discipline so we have very expert strong staff in seven different operating divisions so we can truly execute in multiple basins and continue to reduce costs improve technology be very entrepreneurial and act quickly and make really quick crisp good high rate of return decisions on each one of the plays at the same time so the company has got a tremendous ability to continue our high return growth profile for a very very long time and i think that s quite unique in the industry arun jayaram jp morgan analyst that s great and just one question in terms of the agreements they have in place to export to expand your export capacity from 100 000 barrels to 250 000 barrels for those barrels that you are able to with that capacity how should we think about the uplift relative to wti from those types of barrels one of your peers has highlighted maybe the ability to get 60 of the brent ti spread let s call it 3 in transportation i was wondering if there may be a formula any way we could think about the uplift that you get on those barrels william thomas chairman of the board chief executive officer no arun thanks for the question we won t go into the detail on what we may or may not speculate on what we think to uplift the most important thing right is it s a portfolio approach to us i mean when we have the diversification we re going to have the capability there to sell domestically so if that s a higher realized net back for us then we can sell them domestically and as you think about our export capacity it s capacity that we can optimize so again like if you look back over time and you look at our experience our goal is to maintain our price realizations and being peer leading in price realizations so we feel that dock capacity that we have there just positions us that we have agreements in place that we can transact very quickly and we can make sales in the spot business and we can keep it on the international index like a brent indices or we can keep it at the local markets but we can take advantage of where the pricing leads us and we can move very quickly that s the way you probably need to think about that from our standpoint which is we can move quickly we have the capacity and we can also we can meet that capacity with the permian and also the delaware i think that s also very unique arun jayaram jp morgan analyst thank you so much bye bye operator and ladies and gentlemen this will conclude our question and answer session i would like to hand the conference back over to mr thomas for his closing remarks william thomas chairman of the board chief executive officer in closing we first want to say thank you to the tremendous work by everyone at eog the company is starting 2019 with our best operational performance in company history costs are coming down allowing us to deliver more oil for less money than ever before the best part of eog s culture is that we re not through getting better we re excited about where we are but we re even more excited about our future thanks for listening and thanks for your support operator thank you sir ladies and

by brandon smith when looking at the health of an economic system it is impossible to gauge growth or stability by only taking two or three indicators into account the problem is this is exactly what central banks and governments tend to do in fact governments and central banks wildly and deliberately promote certain indicators as the signals everyone should care about while ignoring a whole host of other fundamentals that do not fit their recovery narrative when these few chosen indicators don t read well either they rig the numbers in their favor the most promoted and and by extension most rigged indicators include gdp unemployment and inflation i would include stock markets to a point in this list but as i ve always said stocks are a trailing indicator and never tell us accurately when an economic crash is taking place if anything stocks are and always have been a placebo for the masses a psychological crutch meant to lull them to sleep while the crash begins other than that they have no value in determining the health of the system as a lagging indicator we will cover stocks at the end of this analysis gdp rigging is mostly a government affair as much of how gdp is calculated today includes government spending so even though the government has to steal your money through taxation in order to then spend money government spending is still counted as production this includes programs like obamacare which despite assumptions among some conservatives continues to operate today official establishment estimates of government spending as a percentage of gdp stand at around 20 more accurate estimates accounting for all expenditures show that us government spending accounts for around 35 of gdp this is an enormous fraud most of my regular readers know full well how unemployment numbers are rigged to show recovery but to summarize around 95 million working age americans who are unemployed are not counted as unemployed by the bureau of labor statistics because they have been jobless for long enough to be removed from welfare benefits roles now to be clear the bls does keep track of this statistic but they do not treat it as a measure of unemployment when reporting their stats to the public to clarify 102 million working age people counted and not counted as unemployed are jobless in the us this is almost 50 of the total 206 million working age people in the country yet the bls reports the unemployment rate at an astonishing 4 recovery indeed inflation rigging is a bit more complicated but the primary method has been for the government and the fed to simply change their methods of calculation over the past 4 decades and to exclude inflation in certain goods like food and energy from the numbers if you want to see real inflation numbers calculated the way they should be visit john williams over at shadowstats another issue that we must take into account is the federal reserve s role as a creator of financial bubbles and the destroyer of financial bubbles the fed can and does act with impunity to influence the system but they also seek to exploit certain economic indicators as a rationale for their policy decisions for example the fed s qt policies have for the past couple of years relied on positive gdp unemployment and inflation stats in the meantime the fed has all but ignored the vast array of stagflationary and deflationary warning signs which run contrary to their interest rate hikes and balance sheet cuts for at the past ten years the fed has refused to acknowledge that there is no recovery for the past two years the fed has been tightening liquidity despite the lack of recovery and even in the past four months with all the talk of the fed retreating on qt and going dovish fed bankers still claim in their public statements that the us economy is enjoying a solid recovery this creates some serious confusion as we saw this week when the jerome powell finally hinted to the public that the fed was more hawkish than it had allowed everyone to believe i think the message is clear though the fed continues to cut its balance sheet almost weekly the fed s benchmark interest rate keeps rising despite all the claims that the fed is backing off the fed is still insistent that the us is in recovery and now gdp numbers are coming in rigged to shocking highs this tells me that the fed is not backing off of tightening measures even though they have been feeding dovish rhetoric to the mainstream and alternative media but what about all the other fundamentals that are alerting us to an ongoing economic crash what about all the numbers that the fed is pretending don t exist when they say that we are enjoying a strong recovery how about the recent plunge in earnings forecasts for global companies like google parent company alphabet 3m or intel alphabet saw a 9 drop in earnings growth and the worst day for its stock since 2012 3m has reported its worst earnings forecast in a decade and is now planning to cut at least 2000 jobs intel also reported earnings expectations well below wall street estimates it smells like 2008 all over again we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us global banks such as goldman sachs and citigroup earnings have also disappointed estimates along with oil majors exxon and chevron this is a trend which is accelerating not only in earnings forecasts but across the board in terms of economic data expect the situation to get much worse as the numbers continue to roll in poor corporate earnings reports are the latest signal that we are entering or returning to a recessionary crash but other signals have been visible for at least the past year corporate debt has hit historic highs once again as companies sink into the red at levels not seen since 2007 just before the last economic disaster this problem has been mostly dismissed in the mainstream economic media because companies were still reporting healthy profits but now as we ve seen profits are staring to falter so it is likely you will be hearing a lot more about massive corporate debt levels in the coming months for now the globalists at the imf are preempting the disasterby warning about potential outcomes of corporate debt instability just as they did before the 2008 crash a little too late consumer credit card debt and household debt has hit all time highs yet retailers report a multi month plunge in sales this tells me that households are likely being forced to take on more and more debt to pay off previous debts once again this is exactly what happened just before the crash of 2008 us retail numbers continue to fall month after month and have been declining since the last quarter of 2018 despite a jump in march primarily due to higher gas prices the downward trend appears as though it will continue us auto sales in almost every category are falling and rising interest rates are at the core of the decline existing home sales continue to crumble since the end of 2018 while new homes sales finally saw a jump in march this jump however is probably due to the fact that home price growth is beginning to fall back to reality in many markets the tenuous nature of the housing market is reaffirmed in the latest numbers on mortgage applications which have now fallen to six year lowseven in the face of a recent drop in mortgage rates in the meantime us rental costs are skyrocketing and have been rising exponentially for at least the past year this is the conundrum of stagflation in play with value being lost in some goods while the prices of necessities spike and strangle consumers there are a few factors which have been artificially propping up public hopes on economic health in the us the hope that the trade war with china will soon end with a huge deal brokered by trump the hope that the fed will reverse on it s tightening policies and start cutting interest rates again and the performance of the stock market all of these things seem to be tied together in a fantastic mess of false promises first every time the trump admin injects the notion of a trade deal with china it has consistently proven false or exaggerated my position is this the trade war is an excellent distraction from the sabotage the federal reserve is initiating against the us economy as it pops the everything bubble this is why the trade war never seems to end and even if a trade deal is finally announced with china i predict it will also be a farce a fake deal which will result in no meaningful benefits to the us and one that will eventually fall apart ultimately as the current crash progresses the trade war will be blamed rather than the central bankers that created the mess in the first place second the fed will not be cutting interest rates anytime soon in fact i continue to believe the fed will hike rates again this year not that it matters because the fed s benchmark interest rate has been climbing anyway which may indicate the central bank is seeking to tighten liquidity while pretending it is remaining patient third global stocks have been propped up for the past four months by a number of factors as mentioned above but first and foremost they have been enjoying massive stimulus injections from china it is china s qe not the federal reserve or the plunge protection team which has kept global stocks alive i expected china to cut their stimulus efforts much sooner and for stocks to begin dropping back to their december lows but it appears as though they have opted to continue into may i will be covering this issue in an article soon but it is clear that china is getting diminishing returns from this qe also chinese stimulus may also be a temporary response to trade war conditions or trade talks we will see how long it lasts if the trade discussions fall apart or if a trade deal is finalized for now china is hinting that it will soon pull back on qe the bottom line is the next crash has already begun it started at the end of 2018 and is only becoming more pervasive with each passing month this is not doom and gloom or doom porn this is simply the facts on the ground while stock markets are still holding for now the rest of the system is breaking down right on schedule the question now is when will the mainstream media and the fed finally acknowledge this is happening i suspect as in 2008 they will openly admit to the danger only when it is far too late for people to prepare for it

but the overall results are clear the tories who had the most seats on the line were punished severely with less than half the councils reporting the conservative lost about 440 seats labour was also punished with the partial results labour lost near 80 seats the big winner for the liberal democrats who picked up over 300 seats and independents small parties with a clear anti brexit message also did well according to the early results many observers see even these partial results as likely adding to the pressure for the tories and labour to reach an agreement on the other hand some argue that labour was punished for not being more supportive of a second referendum or being strategically ambivalent at the same time there is speculation that after losing the conservatives parliamentary majority and now this drubbing pressure on may to leave may increase this is not good for sterling as it appears to renew the risk of leaving without an agreement separately the uk saw a better than expected service and composite pmi the service pmi bounced back from the 48 9 reading in march to 50 4 in april as it returns to expansion mode the pmi composite rose to 50 9 from 50 0 recall that it averaged 50 6 in q1 based on a few countries preliminary april cpi figures warned that the aggregate figure had upside potential it did not disappoint april headline cpi rose 1 7 from 1 4 in march which is slightly more than economists expected the core rate rose to 1 2 from 0 8 while economists expected a gain to only 1 the euro barely reacted still it should not be lost that the economic data from the eurozone the first look at q1 gdp and april inflation were stronger than expected the euro fell three days last week and is down for the third session this week the single currency bottomed last week near 1 1100 and bounced to 1 1265 in the middle of this week before hitting a wall of sellers the slippage below 1 1170 today is troublesome from a technical point of view and warns of the risk of a retest on 1 1100 there are 1 5 bln euros in options between 1 1150 and 1 1155 that will be cut today even if the us jobs data disappoint the euro may find it difficult to return above the 1 12 area as there are 2 6 bln euros struck between 1 1200 and 1 1210 that expire today sterling has drifted lower and slipped through yesterday s 1 30 low after the pmi data there is an expiring option

average is 211k while the 24 month average is 202k the 12 month average peaks in a business cycle as one would expect in this long cycle it peaked in february 2015 near 260k average hourly earnings are expected to rise by 0 3 which if it materializes would lift the year over year rate to 3 3 from 3 2 the average workweek edged up to 34 5 hours from 34 4 hours in february the workweek has moved back and forth between 34 4 and 34 5 hours since september 2017 with the fomc meeting past the quiet period ends with a bang at least eight fed officials are speaking today including clarida and williams separately a couple of hours after pledging to fight on moore candidacy was pulled it was never official trump seemed to let the markets and press do the vetting while many economists were critical of moore s economics ultimately it was his non economic work that undermined him an important consideration here is that the republicans have a three seat majority in the senate it became clear that a fourth republican senator was not going to support moore moore was the fourth candidate to the fed that was unsuccessful cain liang and goodfriend two have been successful clarida and quarles weaker gdp and a central bank espousing a softer form of neutrality weigh on the canadian dollar it gave up its earlier gains and is now a little lower on the week the us dollar s response to

first quarter results last night quarterly adjusted earnings totaled 1 4 billion or 1 48 per share up from 1 36 per share a year ago while variable investment income was lower as expected adjusted earnings per share benefited from solid volume growth across all ongoing businesses strong life and non medical health underwriting margins and group benefits continued expense discipline and the cumulative impact of capital management reflecting the strong results our quarterly adjusted return on equity was 13 2 as for notable items adjusted earnings were 1 54 per share notable items in the quarter included 0 06 per share of costs associated with our unit cost initiative which remains on track to achieve 800 million of annual pre tax margin improvement by 2020 net income was 1 3 billion or 1 40 per share up from 1 19 per share a year ago our efforts to manage the sensitivity of net income through the capital markets and narrow the gap between net income and adjusted earnings continue to show progress moving to some business highlights within the u s business segment group benefits reported very strong underwriting results for both life and non medical health coverages reversing less favorable trends in the fourth quarter of 2018 group benefits also posted record sales driven by voluntary products which we continue to see as a growth opportunity in our retirement and income solutions business while we experienced good asset growth adjusted earnings were adversely affected by lower variable investment income and investment spreads within property and casualty good homeowners underwriting and modest catastrophe losses contributed to solid adjusted earnings for our international segments asia benefited from volume growth and strong foreign currency product and a h sales in japan our latin america results included a strong contribution from there in kihei and our emea business benefited from good underwriting and volume growth these results provide further confirmation that metlife strategy is working and that we re hitting our stride on delivering consistent execution the strength of our last five quarters combined tells the same story metlife is a long term business and taking the long view is the best way to evaluate our performance we are encouraged by our first quarter results but we are even more encouraged by the last five quarters put together my job as president and ceo is to continuingly ensure that we have the right strategy in place and the right people to make that strategy a success i have made significant progress in establishing my senior leadership team following the recent appointments of among others ramy tadros as president of our u s business and marlene debel as our chief risk officer i feel confident in the team we are assembling and excited about metlife s future on strategy i believe we are on the right path while recognizing there is always room for improvement as i mentioned on our fourth quarter earnings call we are at an inflection point and i m committed to metlife s core goals of capital efficiency strong risk adjusted returns and profitable growth while we have accomplished much in these areas we still have work to do to accelerate revenue growth further optimize our business and product portfolios and approach expense discipline as a journey of continuous improvement rather than a single destination these goals informed our recent decision to move metlife holdings which contains the closed block businesses of our former u s retail segment to our finance organization this new arrangement will sharpen our focus on serving our customers and creating value for our shareholders i believe the only way to achieve sustainable success is by staying laser focused on our customers needs and expectations that is the bedrock on which metlife has built a number of great businesses here in the u s annual adjusted earnings from our market share leading u s group business have grown to more than 1 billion our average national accounts group customer has been with us for 22 years and several customers are approaching the century mark overall the business covers more than 40 million u s employees and their dependents in mexico we are the no 1 life insurer with a dominant business that serves millions of public sector workers and has made metlife part of the fabric of mexican society in japan our largest business outside the u s and our largest retail life insurance business anywhere in the world we pioneered foreign exchange products that have allowed us to grow in a mature market by meeting customers needs for better returns on their savings in china one of the world s largest and most rapidly growing insurance markets metlife has grown rapidly as well the chinese municipalities and provinces where we operate are home to more than half a billion people and account for 55 of gdp positioning us well to serve the needs of china s growing middle class businesses like these highlight metlife s underlying strength and potential but again it all starts with how we serve our customers i ve been running insurance businesses since the early 1990s and one of my core convictions is that only by creating value for customers can we create value for shareholders over the past few months i ve traveled to many of metlife s key markets outside the u s including all the countries i just mentioned our people around the world take great pride in being there for metlife s customers when they need us the most i approach metlife s challenges informed by certain guiding principles developed over a 25 year career leading insurance businesses on four continents around the world my leadership style is close to the ground and focused on winning i believe speed agility and innovation are critical to strengthening our competitive advantage metlife has reinvented itself multiple times over its 151 year history and we will look to accelerate innovation as a driver of growth i recognize that capital is precious and that our shareholders have choices about where to invest metlife s decisions on capital deployment will continue to be driven by what produces the best risk adjusted returns everything we do organic growth capital return and acquisitions will be viewed through the lens of value creation to that end we recently announced a 4 8 increase in our quarterly dividend while returning more than 900 million of capital to shareholders in the first quarter through common dividends and share repurchases on my second official day leading metlife i want you to know that i m starting this job with a real sense of urgency the entire leadership team has a strong commitment to accelerating the pace of value creation for all of our stakeholders with that i ll turn the call over to john mccallion to go through our first quarter results in greater detail john mccallion chief financial officer thank you michel and good morning i ll begin by discussing the 1q 19 supplemental slides that we released last evening along with our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement starting on page 4 this schedule provides a comparison of net income and adjusted earnings in the first quarter of 2019 in the quarter net income was 1 3 billion or 75 million lower than adjusted earnings of 1 4 billion while this will change from quarter to quarter the modest variance between net income and adjusted earnings reflects the progress we made to reduce the volatility of our business overall the results in the investment portfolio and hedging program continue to perform as expected we had one notable item in the quarter as shown on page 5 and highlighted in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement expenses related to our unit cost initiative decreased adjusted earnings by 55 million after tax or 0 06 per share adjusted earnings excluding the notable item were 1 5 billion or 1 54 per share on page 6 you can see the year over year adjusted earnings excluding notable items by segment excluding all notable items in both periods adjusted earnings were up 6 year over year and 8 on a constant currency basis on a per share basis adjusted earnings were up 15 and 18 on a constant currency basis the better results on an eps basis reflect the cumulative impact from share repurchases overall positive year over year drivers included solid volume growth favorable underwriting better expense margins and the impact from strong equity markets in the quarter these were partially offset by lower recurring interest margins and less favorable variable investment income which i will discuss in more details shortly with regards to business performance group benefits adjusted earnings were up 57 year over year the key drivers were favorable underwriting better expense margins and solid volume growth with respect to underwriting the group life mortality ratio was 85 3 our best q1 performance in over 15 years and at the low end of our annual target range of 85 to 90 favorable results were primarily due to low incidence and the mild flu season the interest adjusted benefit ratio for non medical health was 72 9 which was lower than the 75 9 in the prior year quarter and at the low end of our target range of 72 to 77 the year over year improvement in the ratio was primarily driven by continued positive trends in disability while dental utilization trends were generally in line with expectations group benefits continues to see strong momentum in its top line adjusted pfos in the quarter were up 3 and 5 excluding participating customers where pfos can fluctuate with claim experience group benefits sales in the quarter were a record up 11 versus the prior year quarter primarily due to continued strength in voluntary products combination of our brand product set customer base and distribution reach positions us to leverage the ongoing shift of voluntary benefits in a differentiated way national account sales and renewals were strong and we continue to see double digit growth in both regional and small market sales while results for group benefits will show some quarter to quarter volatility this combination of strong top and bottom line results is a testament to our compelling customer value proposition and disciplined approach to pricing retirement and income solutions or ris adjusted earnings were down 16 year on year the key drivers were less favorable investment margins partially offset by solid volume growth ris investment spreads were 96 basis points in 1q 19 down 32 basis points year over year the decline in the investment spreads were primarily due to ongoing pressure from the flatter yield curve as well as lower private equity returns in the quarter for the full year we expect ris investment spreads to trend higher with full year coming in toward the bottom half of our 2019 guidance range of 100 to 125 basis points ris adjusted pfos were up 64 year over year due to strong structured settlement sales as for pension risk transfers although we did not book any transactions in the quarter we closed on a 500 million prt deal in early april we continue to see the prt market as attractive with a strong pipeline property and casualty or p c adjusted earnings were up 1 primarily due to favorable underwriting margins and volume growth this was mostly offset by higher expenses primarily related to marketing costs pretax cat losses were 41 million in the quarter which was 17 million lower than the prior year quarter with regards to the top line p c adjusted pfos were up 2 while sales were up 12 versus 1q 18 asia adjusted earnings were up 9 and 13 on a constant currency basis primarily due to strong volume growth in the region the key drivers were higher accident and health sales and aum growth in japan as well as growth in korea and china this was partially offset by more favorable underwriting in the prior year quarter asia sales were up 9 on a constant currency basis in japan sales were up 13 primarily driven by accident and health and foreign currency products a h and fx products remain our primary focus in japan and we continue to see strong momentum in the market other asia sales were up 3 primarily driven by growth in china and india latin america adjusted earnings were down 4 and 1 on a constant currency basis the primary driver was higher expenses versus 1q 18 which benefited from a litigation reserve release this was mostly offset by the favorable impact from equity markets in our chilean and kihei as well as higher investment margins and volume growth across the region latin america adjusted pfos were up 4 on a constant currency basis driven by volume growth across the region led by afp provida in mexico this was partially offset by the cancellation of government contracts in mexico latin america sales were up 11 on a constant currency basis due to higher mexico sales emea adjusted earnings were up 6 and 23 on a constant currency basis primarily due to favorable underwriting and volume growth emea adjusted pfos were up 5 on a constant currency basis reflecting growth across the region emea sales were up 3 on a constant currency basis due to higher volumes in employee benefits in the united kingdom and credit life in turkey metlife holdings adjusted earnings excluding notable items in 1q 18 were down 13 year over year the primary drivers were lower investment margins primarily from weaker private equity returns and more favorable underwriting in the prior year quarter this was partially offset by improved expense margins and favorable equity markets in regards to equity market performance within metlife holdings retail annuities separate account returns were up 10 in the quarter which resulted in an initial positive market impact of approximately 15 million to adjusted earnings and an ongoing positive impact of approximately 5 million to adjusted earnings these were roughly in line with our sensitivity guidance corporate and other adjusted loss excluding notable items was 138 million overall the company s effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 18 7 and within our 2019 guidance of 18 to 20 now let s turn to page 7 to discuss variable investment income in more detail this chart reflects our pre tax variable investment income for the past nine quarters including 174 million earned in the first quarter you can see that variable investment income as the name implies can vary from quarter to quarter but tends to fall in proximity to our quarterly vii range of 200 to 250 million our private equity portfolio which is accounted for on a one quarter lag was clearly impacted by equity market weakness in 4q 18 although results were better than expected we continue to expect full year vii to be within our 2019 guidance range of 800 million to 1 billion now i will discuss recurring investment income our new money rate rose from 3 37 a year ago to 4 04 in 1q 19 at the same time our average roll off rate has dropped from 4 38 a year ago to 4 15 in the first quarter although the gap between new money rates and roll off rates has narrowed we would not expect parry to occur until we have a sustained u s 10 year treasury yield of roughly 3 to 3 25 in absolute dollars recurring investment income was up 4 compared to a year ago primarily due to higher asset balances which offset the roll off of higher yielding securities turning to page 8 this chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2018 as well as 1q 19 as we have stated previously our goal is to realize 800 million of pre tax profit margin improvement by 2020 this would represent an approximate 200 basis point decline in our annual direct expense ratio from the 2015 baseline year we believe the annual direct expense ratio best reflects the impact on profit margins as it captures the relationship of revenues and the expenses over which we have the most control by successfully executing on our expense commitment it will improve profit margins and provide additional capacity to fund future growth and innovation we continue to make consistent progress toward achieving our target by 2020 as the chart illustrates we have already achieved 140 basis point improvement in the annual direct expense ratio from 2015 to 2018 for 1q 19 the direct expense ratio was exceptionally strong at 12 1 this was aided by favorable items including lower interest on tax reserves and lower employee benefits related to market movements in the first quarter overall these favorable items totaled roughly 60 to 70 basis points therefore we would expect our direct expense ratio to be higher for the remainder of the year but still show improvement versus 2018 i will now discuss our cash and capital position on slide 9 cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately 3 2 billion at march 31 which is up from 3 billion at december 31 a 200 million increase in cash in the quarter reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends share repurchases payment of our common dividend and holding company expenses as we noted previously we are comfortable holding cash at the low end of our 3 to 4 billion holding company s buffer given our low risk profile and the modest amount of debt that we have maturing over the next few years including none in 2019 next i would like to provide you with an update on our capital position for our u s companies our 2018 combined naic rbc ratio was 402 which compares to our new target ratio of 360 following u s tax reform for our u s companies preliminary first quarter 2019 statutory operating earnings were approximately 1 2 billion and net earnings were approximately 1 1 billion statutory operating earnings increased by approximately 600 million from the prior year quarter primarily due to improved underwriting results lower operating expenses and lower va writer reserves these were partially offset by lower net investment margins we estimate that our total u s statutory adjusted capital was approximately 16 6 billion as of march 31 2019 down 9 compared to december 31 2018 net earnings were more than offset by dividends declared to be paid to the holding company finally the japan solvency margin ratio was 803 as of december 31 which is the latest public data overall metlife had a very strong 2018 and execution continues in 2019 driven primarily by good fundamentals solid underwriting growth in our businesses and expense discipline in addition our cash and capital position as well as our balance sheet remains strong finally we are confident that the actions we are taking will continue to drive free cash flow and create long term sustainable value and with that i will turn back to the operator for your questions questions answers operator your first question comes from the line of ryan krueger from kbw please go ahead ryan krueger kbw analyst hi thanks good morning michel could you discuss your m a philosophy and if there s any areas of particular focus that you would look to add going forward michel khalaf president and chief executive officer sure so we always look at m a opportunities that fit our strategy and are accretive over time we evaluate those opportunities on a consistent basis globally with a view on value and cash generation these deals need to earn more than their cost of capital we also evaluate m a opportunities against alternative uses of capital obviously we consider capital markets the cost of raising capital and synergies in our assessment and we will always look to achieve a healthy balance between returning cash to our shareholders and strategic m a activity that can help us accelerate our growth so hopefully this gives you an idea about our philosophy on m as and again if you re looking at strategic fit think about businesses and markets where we that are growth markets where we believe that potentially m a can help us further drive our growths those would be the businesses and markets where we will consider such deals ryan krueger kbw analyst and then just in regards to your comment on innovation i guess things like that can come at i guess a near term expense so i just want to it sounds like you re pretty committed to the 800 million expense save target but i just wanted to hear your thoughts and if there s any major areas of incremental investment that you think are required and if you can still achieve the 800 million in light of that michel khalaf president and chief executive officer so i m 100 committed to the 800 million pre tax profit margin improvement by 2020 target and we re fully on track to achieve that i think we ve done a good job over the last several years actually of repurposing some savings and reinvesting in technology and innovation and we look to continue to do that the other thing i will say here and i mentioned it in my remarks is that we are making sure that expense discipline is a muscle is part of our culture here it s embedded in everything that we do and we see this efficiency and expense discipline as a journey of continuous improvement as opposed to a single destination so we are committed to our target and we believe that we ll have opportunities to continue to invest in innovation and in our growth ryan krueger kbw analyst that s helpful appreciate it operator your next question comes from the line of andrew kligerman from credit suisse please go ahead andrew kligerman credit suisse analyst hey good morning michel you made a comment that you want to accelerate the pace of value creation and you also mentioned that you moved metlife holdings to the finance unit are there any implications there that you might be more inclined to divest of certain blocks of business in mlh notably long term care but any blocks within that michel khalaf president and chief executive officer so look with marty lippert s retirement we felt there was an opportunity to better align metlife holdings reporting with our core objectives and for me there are three core objectives for the business one is to deliver on our obligations to our policyholders two is to continue to reduce the risk and volatility of that business and three is to optimize value so we feel that having metlife holdings report to finance and to john will help us sharpen our focus on these objectives and we ve said before and i ll repeat that we will consider all options to optimize the value of the business and we don t rule anything out any transaction that we believe makes sense economically is something that we would consider andrew kligerman credit suisse analyst great and then just kind of shifting over to ris the investment yield came in at 4 52 excluding variable investment income and that sequentially was down from 4 8 so i m and i understand you had some extra cash on the balance sheet so that might have hurt it by 4 to 6 basis points but it s a pretty big drop off so i m hoping that someone can give me a little guidance on where that yield is going you also mentioned some roll off of higher yielding securities so where do you see that going over the next few quarters in the ris segment john mccallion chief financial officer morning andrew it s john i would focus on the spread itself and just for this quarter we there was a new accounting related to derivative hedging so there was a reclass between the yield and interest credited so that might just change the trend a little bit but i think i would focus a bit on the spread itself so let me talk about the spread and obviously we came in below the range we provided at the outlook call of 100 to 125 so a couple of things first the range and the sensitivities we provided i would take those as full year ranges and those can certainly deviate from any one quarter and as i mentioned in my opening remarks while q1 was below the range we still believe and expect the full year to be within the range albeit maybe the lower half of that range but there is two drivers to the q1 underperformance so first we did have a slightly higher allocation to shorter term assets during the quarter as we continue to look to shift out of certain assets that are more susceptible to a market downturn and so we see this mostly as timing and as rates declined that had about a 5 to 6 basis point impact the second thing we saw was a good portion of our sec lending business does get allocated to the segment and to the inversion of the short end of the curve relative to libor has put pressure on our sec lending margins and so if you think about where we were at the outlook call and where the treasury curve was there and libor was at that time the drop in the treasury curve has been greater than that of the three month libor and so that inversion has occurred over the last three to four months and that s put some pressure on us so overall we think certainly the first one will we think reverse itself we think of it as timing and we ll have to monitor the margin pressure and sec lending and see what happens with the inversion of the curve right now if you follow the forward rates it would imply that the relationship will improve throughout the year but obviously we know things can deviate from there andrew kligerman credit suisse analyst ok so just staying with the bottom end of 100 to 125 basis points for the going forward versus 97 this quarter john mccallion chief financial officer i would like to say bottom half andrew kligerman credit suisse analyst bottom half right right thank you operator your next question comes from the line of jimmy bhullar from jp morgan please go ahead jimmy bhullar j p morgan analyst hi good morning i had a question just on group insurance margin they were obviously a bigger source of the upside in earnings this quarter to what extent do you think it s it was just good experience this quarter versus the trend especially in the non medical business being sustainable michel khalaf president and chief executive officer let me give you a couple of quick comments and then ramy can chime in as well so if you think obviously we re pleased with our group performance in q1 and i d say this is building also on strong momentum from last year but we should keep in mind that underwriting results do fluctuate from quarter to quarter so if you think about life for example it s at the very low end of the range this quarter very much flu season was the main contributor but a few things i think related to what we discussed in the fourth quarter one is that dental utilization has normalized so it s in line with expectations in q1 as you recall that was elevated in q4 we said we didn t see signs of any trend that was confirmed in q1 and one of the things we did lower the non medical health ratio in our outlook call that was driven by the view that disability is performing well given the healthy economy the high levels of employment so we continue to see positive outcomes there but we also talked about the fact that we are seeing a business mix toward voluntary products so with lower benefit ratios and we re particularly pleased our sales results for the quarter were very strong and those were really driven by voluntary sales so that s as opposed to jumbo sales for example which is also typical in national accounts so i think this speaks to the fact that our strategy is delivering in terms of this product mix shift and we think we continue to see voluntary as an important growth opportunity i don t know ramy if you want to also add to this ramy tadros president u s business sure thank you michel good morning jimmy again just to emphasize you know that these ratios can be volatile quarter to quarter and for the course of the year i would guide you to the middle of our guidance range across both the mortality and the nonmedical benefit ratio with respect to the latter and particularly your specific question what we saw in this quarter on the nonmedical benefit ratio the ratio came at the lower end of the range as you know and that s largely driven by a combination of lower severity of claims as well as more favorable claims recoveries as michel mentioned over the medium term as our business mix shifts we expect to also be continuing some positive trends on this ratio jimmy bhullar j p morgan analyst ok that s helpful thank you operator your next question comes from the line of tom gallagher from evercore please go ahead tom gallagher evercore isi analyst good morning michel i d just be curious on what your high level thought is from the strategy standpoint when i think of steve and his legacy i think it s risk reduction cash flow optimization are there any high level issues that you would call out that you re focused on initially outside of those risk reduction or cash flow optimization michel khalaf president and chief executive officer so look i think we re on the right path in terms of core elements of our strategy and you mentioned those so capital efficiency focus on strong risk adjusted returns on strong free cash flow generation and profitable growth and i can tell you that in all my visits to our key markets i see a real focus on value creation that s now well embedded in pretty much everything we do i do feel that we re at an inflection point and while we ve accomplished much in terms of our in terms of derisking action i always believe that there s room for improvement i ve already started a review process with my team and we are going to look for opportunities one to see how we can further optimize our portfolio our products our businesses make sure that we are making we continue to make the right decisions and choices in terms of capital allocation and then how we can also accelerate revenue growth and as i mentioned earlier make sure that expense efficiency becomes is more of a journey here as opposed to a single destination so i m excited i think this is an exciting time for metlife and i think we can i m confident that we can build on the strong foundations that we already have tom gallagher evercore isi analyst ok and then just a follow up on group benefits it seems to me from what we re seeing in the industry that there s a lot more competition in voluntary benefits you re seeing lapses escalating for certain carriers it sounds like you re not seeing that and you also john i think you referenced group benefits sales up 11 which is a good outcome can you talk sort of what you re seeing there competitively are there parts of the market that are getting heated from pricing or so anyway yes any color you could give on that ramy tadros president u s business it s ramy tadros here so let me just give you some perspective on our voluntary strategy and the investments we ve been making in that space over the last number of years and they really fall in three categories the first one is we were very early to recognize as you think about the voluntary space this is not just about the traditional intermediaries and distribution channels there s a whole benefit ecosystem that includes technology firms benefit administrators communication firms and we ve built an engagement model with each of those firms across the ecosystem we ve invested in integrating our systems with them and that creates seamless interaction and ease of use for both the employers and the employees and then beyond that once we get to the employee we also have a lot of discipline in terms of driving employee engagement and education around voluntary benefits to build awareness and therefore increase the higher enrollment rates so what you re seeing here is the result of a very disciplined strategy with very focused investments that we ve made over the last few years from a competitive environment with respect to voluntary we do see some carriers enter and they do try to compete on price to drive voluntary growth i would say most of our growth that we ve seen has actually come from expanding relationships with existing customers that value our brand and service and our ability to design flexible solutions for them and then you re seeing a lot of growth precisely from those investments that i m talking about that are driving enrollment and reenrollment rates which enables growth outside of competitive bidding situations so and we re seeing very good bottom line results here and are very confident in the adequacy of our pricing in the voluntary space tom gallagher evercore isi analyst ok thanks operator your next question comes from the line of erik bass from autonomous research please go ahead erik bass autonomous research analyst hi thank you for asia can you talk about how much runway there is to continue to grow sales of u s dollar denominated products in japan and is this is the growth coming from kind of cash on the sidelines getting invested or money switching from other products and just a little bit more color there would be helpful kishore ponnavolu executive vice president and president auto and home this is kishore as we discussed at the investor day last september the low interest rate environment in japan is a great fuel for the fx margin right that s driving a lot of customer demand across all of our distribution channels with our bank channel leading the way the in terms of our position up until now we have been certainly expanding our share of the market however there are new entrants coming into that space so if you think about this year we had an 8 growth year over year which is very very strong looking forward to the second quarter that was a pretty strong performance last year so year on year for the full year i m very comfortable with the guidance for the overall asia sales of mid single digits but we re very very happy with the progress we ve made so far erik bass autonomous research analyst and then for latin america can you just provide some more color on the earnings drivers this quarter and if there s any seasonality in terms of expenses or other items we can should consider when thinking about kind of the run rate going forward oscar schmidt president of latin america sure this is oscar so let me start referring to the comparison against prior year quarter so first expenses were higher year over year primarily due to a litigation reserve release in the prior year quarter so this quarter reflects a more normal level of expenses and the second is we had a positive investment performance especially the chilean kihei which performed above last year and above expectations this year these two effects merely offset each other and finally volume business growth year over year was mid single digits it was a bit lower than usual due to the loss of some mexico federal government group cases but in line with our outlook whole discussion but now let me refer to this quarter in particular against expectations the way to look at it is that we have good results in chile provida but offset by a couple of old items first low quarterly inflation in chile actually inflation in chile in the first quarter was almost zero so that had an adverse impact the investments but in our life business in chile as investment portfolio is indexed to inflation that was the first impact related to low inflation in chile and the second one is that low inflation also has an adverse impact on taxes in chile that s because inflation impact on equity is deductible for tax purposes so we expect these two items to recover during the remainder of the year because the full year consensus in chile remains almost similar to expectations meaning that inflation that didn t happen in the first quarter will happen during the remainder of the year and finally expenses were a little higher than expected in the quarter mainly due to some accounting adjustments that impacted expenses so for the full year we still expect our earnings to be in the range we provided on the outlook call on a constant currency basis i hope this answered your question erik erik bass autonomous research analyst yes thank you operator your next question comes from the line of suneet kamath from citi please go ahead suneet kamath citi analyst thanks just wanted to start with the rbc ratio i think 402 is what you said which is above your target of 360 so would you expect i guess what i m trying to get at is what is your expectations for dividends to the holding company in the balance of the year would you expect that excess to move to holdco or be consumed by growth in the business john mccallion chief financial officer it s john i would just i wouldn t comment specifically on dividend for a particular legal entity i think we would just comment and refer back to the guidance that we ve given which is free cash flow ratio of 65 to 75 on average for the two year period i think we re still on track to meet that target suneet kamath citi analyst ok and then i guess for steve goulart on the balance sheet we have seen some derisking activities from some of the other life insurers that have reported so far so any color in terms of any changes you might be contemplating there and should we be thinking about any of the interest rate hedges rolling off either later this year or as we get into 2020 steve goulart chief investment officer it s steve regarding portfolio repositioning i think we ve talked about this on the last couple of calls and i think indicated also we would continue to look at opportunities that we thought made sense given our outlook in the market particularly in the credit market and we ve continued to do some repositioning into the first quarter mostly looking at again sectors that we think would be vulnerable in a downturn so we ve continued to lighten up our bank loan portfolio as well as lower investment grade rated corporate bonds a lot of them may be involved in m a and higher leverage and the like we think those are continue to be two vulnerable sectors in the market and so that s where most of our repositioning has taken place and then regarding interest rates hedges and rolling off again i d go back to how we think about all of our hedging policy in alm and it s always dynamic and we will continue to review at that time and make the appropriate decisions then operator your next question comes from the line of alex scott from goldman sachs please go ahead alex scott goldman sachs analyst hi thanks for taking the question first one i have is on metlife holdings i d just be interested if you had any commentary on what drove the sort of larger year over year decline in expenses if there s anything specific related to the expense plan that occurred and also on holdings could you give us a rough way to think about statutory capital back in that segment john mccallion chief financial officer it s john on the first question with regards to expenses yes i think it s just been continued focus to optimize and the efficiency of that segment we continue to focus there and a lot of the efforts that we ve been making over the years on our unit cost initiative quite a few of that is allocated toward holdings so that s just kind of the natural progress that you would expect to see regarding allocation of capital we haven t given that figure out and we ll probably keep it that way for now alex scott goldman sachs analyst ok maybe if i could have one follow up let s see my apologies i already asked that all right thank you for taking my questions operator and next question comes from the line of humphrey lee from dowling partners please go ahead humphrey lee dowling and partners analyst good morning and thank you for taking my questions just to circle back on ris john you talked about the investment spread and how it s being negatively affected by the inverted yield curve for the sec lending book i think in the other call you provided guidance in terms of sensitivity to libor but i was just wondering if you can provide some sensitivity in terms of how do we think about the impacts from the yield curve especially coming from the longer end of the curve john mccallion chief financial officer sure we did give a sense it should be the libor libor in and of itself actually performed as expected but as i said there was we didn t talk about a shift in the shape of the curve relative to libor so that inversion maybe i didn t give this number before but in the quarter it probably cost us about 3 to 4 basis points on the spread so if you roll that forward you can kind of come up with what the headwind would be if the curve did not kind of steepen at all from here humphrey lee dowling and partners analyst remind us what is the size of your sec lending book right now sitting in ris john mccallion chief financial officer we don t give that allocation out but it s a good percentage of our sec lending goes there humphrey lee dowling and partners analyst ok got it and then a follow up question related to the expenses you ve talked about this quarter you have a little bit lower than expected employee benefits and deferred comp flowing through the numbers can you give us a sense where the geography of those lower expenses are in the segments john mccallion chief financial officer they re just allocated throughout segments you can follow up with john later but it s not it s they re out there they re allocated throughout the segments i guess would be the easy answer humphrey lee dowling and partners analyst ok all right fair enough thanks operator and at this time there are no further questions mr hall please continue john hall head of investor relations great before we close i d like to turn the call over to michel for some closing remarks michel khalaf president and chief executive officer thanks john let me close by saying we are starting 2019 on

or operations however moving to slide 5 we had an excellent quarter from operationally and financially our operations team has performed exceptionally well during difficult winter conditions we delivered strong quarterly earnings growth and advanced key strategic initiatives we were ready for our customers energy needs delivering safe and reliable service when they needed at the most safety is our top priority in all we do and i m proud of how our team and our systems performed during severe weather conditions in the first quarter with our team sustaining zero injuries during the response to our customers needs our team proactively delivered the energy to keep our customers and communities safe during the record breaking cold temperatures associated with the january polar vortex at nearly 100 mile per hour winds produced by the bomb cyclone in colorado and then winter storm ulmer and it s resulting flooding in iowa and in nebraska because of our focus on safety and reliability and our investments in upgrading our infrastructure systems we reduced and in many cases we avoided outages during these severe winter conditions our proactive approach to customers and communities helped affected communities begin to recover more quickly during widespread flooding in both iowa and nebraska which was a difficult which was a difficult time of loss for many april 18 was national lineman appreciation day and we could not be more proud of our resilient employees who maintain and enhance our extensive energy systems on a daily basis these committed men and women often break the worst weather conditions head on to deliver the essential energy our customers depend upon in fact our line mechanic team currently has a perfect safety record in 2019 with zero injuries year to date i personally thank them for their commitment to safety and delivering valued service to our customers we delivered excellent earnings growth during the quarter returns on our customer focused capital investments and colder than normal weather were primary drivers we increased our 2019 guidance primarily due to the benefit of weather in the first quarter strategically we continue to refine our capital investment plan we identified an additional 246 million of customer investment opportunities and added those investments to our five year capital forecast providing further confidence in our long term growth expectations we also continued to advance regulatory proceedings we submitted new filings and made progress on key capital projects despite severe winter weather slide 6 list our specific accomplishments for the quarter starting with our electric utilities in december we announced our renewable ready program in south dakota and wyoming to provide our larger government commercial and our industrial customers a cost effective option to purchase utility scale renewable energy we are in the midst of the regulatory approval process for these voluntary tariffs and we are also seeking approval to construct a 57 million 40 megawatt corriedale wind energy project to support this program i m pleased to report we continue to received strong interests from potential customers for this program in south dakota construction continued on our 175 mile transmission line extending from rapid city south dakota to steagall in nebraska the project remains on budget and on track to place the third and final 94 mile segment in service this fall two segments that span 81 miles were previously placed in service in both july and november of last year in september last year we requested a new tariff to support the growth of blockchain in wyoming the tariff will help recruit blockchain companies to call wyoming their home delivering additional energy demand to our system following a hearing earlier this week on april 30 the wyoming commission has approved the tariff moving to the natural gas utilities in the right hand side of slides of slide 6 on february 1 we filed a rate review in colorado to consolidate the rates tariffs and services of our two gas utilities in that state our colorado gas rate review filing also seeks a new rider mechanism to recover integrity investments we received approval for the legal consolidation in last october and completed the consolidation last december we have a hearing on the consolidated rate review applications scheduled in june in march we filed applications for the legal consolidation of our two natural gas utilities in nebraska and our four natural gas utilities in wyoming similar to the process in colorado we plan to file combined rate reviews following approval and completion of the pending consolidation requests at our power generation segment we commenced construction in march on the 71 million 60 megawatt busch ranch ii wind farm near pueblo colorado when placed in service this fall the wind farm will deliver all of its renewable energy to colorado electric a black hills utility affiliate under a 25 year power purchase agreement this will fulfill the requirement of colorado electric to deliver 30 of its energy as renewable energy to customers by the year 2020 on april 29 our board declared a quarterly dividend of 0 505 per share which represents an annualized rate of 2 02 in 2019 and is our 49th consecutive annual dividend increase one of the longest track records in the utility industry and a record we are extremely proud of finally we issued approximately 280 000 shares under our at the market equity offering during the first quarter for net proceeds of approximately 20 million to recap we had a great quarter serving our customers delivering for you the shareholders and making progress on our long term customer focus utility growth strategy now i ll turn it over to rich for our financial update rich richard w kinzley senior vice president and chief financial officer all right thanks linn and good morning everyone i am having quite a chest cold so i have to step away from the microphone for a moment please bear with me but hopefully i can get through this clean i ll start on slide 8 as linn noted we delivered solid first quarter financial performance returns on investments made to benefit customers at our gas utilities and favorable weather year over year at our natural gas and electric utilities were the big drivers of the strong q1 financial results our quarterly eps as adjusted increased 6 year over year despite the dilution from 11 increased share count related to the equity unit conversion back last november of 2018 as a result of our strong first quarter we increased our 2019 eps guidance by 0 05 on each end of the range to 3 40 to 3 60 per share we also reaffirmed our 2020 eps guidance range of 3 50 to 3 80 per share the assumptions related to our earnings guidance are detailed on slides 43 and 44 in the appendix on slide 9 we reconcile gaap earnings to earnings as adjusted non gaap measure we do this to isolate special items and communicate earnings that better represent ongoing performance this slide displays the last five quarters and trailing 12 months as of march 31 2019 and 2018 in q1 2019 we had no special items we did experience special items in 2018 not reflective of our ongoing performance all of which were income tax related the first item reflected the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act throughout the year the second and larger item related to tax benefits of legal restructuring is completed in 2018 as part of an effort to simplify our legal structure in q1 and q4 last year we restructured certain entities acquired as part of the source gas acquisition the restructurings increased goodwill that is amortizable for tax purposes resulting a 49 million deferred tax benefit in the first quarter and a 23 million deferred tax benefit in the fourth quarter these items are not indicative of ongoing performance and then accordingly we reflect them on an as adjusted basis our first quarter 2019 as adjusted eps was 1 73 compared to 1 63 for the first quarter last year as linn and i already noted the earnings uplift this year was primarily driven by returns on customer investment and a colder winter heating season we estimate that winter weather last year as compared to normal positively impacted q1 2018 eps by 0 05 this year we estimate the colder weather compared to normal positively impacted q1 2019 eps by 0 12 also we expect to enjoy a lower effective tax rate this year compared to last year excluding the 2018 special items i just mentioned i will discuss this further on the next slide slide 10 is a slide we added to our investor materials last year to improve transparency related to year over year comparisons the waterfall chart illustrates the primary drivers of our positive results from q1 2018 to q1 2019 all amounts on this chart are net of income taxes i ll add more detail by segment on the next slide but overall our utilities delivered strong gross margins with an increase of over 7 in q1 2019 compared to q1 2018 total operating expenses were approximately 5 higher compared to q1 last year driven primarily by higher outside services employee costs bad debt expense and depreciation we also experienced favorability in our effective income tax rate in q1 2019 compared to the prior year our effective tax rate this year is expected to be approximately 14 compared to approximately 18 last year when excluding the prior year special items forecasted federal renewable energy production tax credits and state investment tax credits related to the busch ranch ii wind farm that as linn mentioned that we placed in service this fall as well as excess deferred tax amortization related to tax reform drive the reduction in the 2019 effective tax rate under generally accepted accounting principles related to interim tax accounting we are required to recognize a large portion of our annual forecasted 2019 tax credits and excess deferred federal income tax and amortization in q1 given we anticipate earning nearly half our annual income in the first quarter slide 11 is a new slide we ve added to our presentation combining the operating income results for all our operating segments onto one slide i ll make a few high level comments here and you can find additional details on q1 year over year changes in gross margin and operating expenses in our earnings release operating income grew year over year due to strong performance at the electric and gas utilities at our electric utilities operating income for q1 2019 improved by 2 5 million compared to q1 2018 an increase of over 6 gross margins increased by 4 8 million primarily from lower purchase power capacity charges higher off system power marketing and favorable weather partially offsetting the increase in gross margins were higher operating expenses which increased 2 3 million over q1 last year primarily due to higher outside services and employee cost at our gas utilities operating income for q1 2019 improved 7 9 million compared to q1 2018 an increase of over 8 gross margins increased 16 1 million primarily from returns on investments for customers and colder weather customer growth in our service territories and increased transport and transmission volumes also contributed to the gross margin increase partially offsetting the gross margin increase were higher operating expenses which increased by 7 million primarily from higher outside services and higher employee costs depreciation increased 1 2 million from higher rate based plant in service on the bottom of slide 11 you see our power generation and coal mining segments delivered consistent year over year q1 results both businesses continue to operate efficiently and provide excellent returns slide 12 shows our financial position through the lens of capital structure credit ratings and financial flexibility our credit ratings remain at bbb at both fitch and s p and baa2 at moody s with a stable outlook from all three agencies we remain committed to maintaining our strong investment grade credit ratings at march 31st our net debt to capitalization ratio was 57 7 a decrease of 120 basis points from year end this reduction was driven by the increase in our retained earnings through our solid first quarter earnings and 20 million of new equity issued under our at the market equity offering program as well as by strong first quarter cash flows that allowed us to reduce our short term debt from year end given we increased our 2019 capital spending forecast by 107 million since our last public capex disclosures we expect debt to total capitalization to increase slightly as 2019 progresses you ll note in our updated guidance assumptions on slides 43 and 44 in the appendix that we expect to use the atm to issue a total of 80 million to 100 million in new equity this year and 40 million to 80 million next year to help fund the increased capex program which linn is going to speak to shortly while debt to total capitalization will likely remain in the 58 to 59 range in the 2020 we continue to target a debt to total cap in the mid 50s over the long term slide 13 illustrates our dividend track record we ve grown the dividend at a faster rate the past few years demonstrating our confidence in our future earnings growth potential as we ve stated in the past our intent is to not reduce the amount of the annual dividend increase and we maintain our stated dividend payout ratio range of 50 to 60 of eps i ll turn it back to linn now for his strategic overview linden evans president and chief executive officer thank you rich moving on to slide 15 as discussed during previous calls we group our strategic goals into the four major categories profitable growth valued service better every day and great workplace our overall objective is to be best in class in everything that we do and our ready branding and messaging complements this customer focused strategy we will drive future earnings growth through our customer focus investment program to better serve our customers needs based on our capital forecast we expect to deliver long term earnings per share growth above the utility average in addition we fully expect incremental growth opportunities from generation of other larger projects we are also focused on continuing to grow our dividend we have increased our annual dividend for 49 consecutive years one of the longest track records in the industry slide 16 helps us illustrate how we think about strategic execution we are aligning our people processes our technology and our analytics around our customers needs in addition to our investment for customers to deliver safe and reliable service we are transforming our customer experience working hard to know our customers well and make it easier to do business with us we are driving growth through higher penetration adding renewable energy and creating innovative tariffs to recruit new businesses in particular are enabling the growth of data centers in our territories which fit the unique attributes of our service territory and we are investing in the safety and reliability of our electric and natural gas infrastructure systems using a disciplined programmatic integrity program slide 17 illustrates the strategic diversity of our business culture we have a mix of complementary gas and electric utilities across stable and growing midwest states the quarterly operating income chart on the left illustrates the seasonality of our earnings between electric and gas utilities our balanced mix reduces total company risk slide 18 illustrates our large electric and natural gas infrastructure systems these systems span across eight states and provide more diverse opportunities for investment more interconnections for reliability and growth and greater overall efficiency of operations for our customers slide 19 our systems require significant long term investment to meet our customers needs forecasted capital investment is focused largely on safety reliability and supporting our customers growth this capital forecast far exceeds forecasted depreciation which translates to future earnings growth this quarter as i said before we added 246 million to our five year forecast we added 107 million in 2019 58 million for 2020 and the rest is in the other years most of the increase relates to safety and integrity needs we now plan to invest 777 million in 2019 with being 2 8 billion over the five year period both of these are all time high capital forecasts for us we ve also refined our programmatic capital forecast for 2019 and expect this to be our final forecast update for this year on a going forward basis we expect to update our capital forecast in the fall and we ll disclose that forecast with third quarter earnings as noted on prior calls our capital forecast includes opportunities we re relatively certain to occur and we add capital especially in the outer years as we gain more clarity and more comfort around specific projects with the continued build out of our programmatic infrastructure replacement plans combined with growth in larger project opportunities we fully expect our actual out year capital expenditures to be greater than those in the current forecast for 2020 and beyond please see our appendix slide in this presentation for more detail of our capital investment forecasts you note on slide 30 and slide 32 that we have adjusted the annual base investment for both electric and gas utilities compared to our prior investor presentation moving on to slide 20 this slide illustrates the breakdown of our five year capital forecast note that over 90 of our forecasted investment is in our utilities and those utility and of those utility investments over 70 are recovered in a timely and efficient manner slide 21 shows the timeline around our multi state jurisdictions simplification efforts we strongly believe consolidation of the multiple entities within each state will provide us long lasting benefits for all stakeholders including our regulators this will happen through streamlined and fewer regulatory proceedings and filings we have three states in which we own multiple gas distribution utilities those are colorado nebraska and wyoming all of which are now officially under way for simplification in colorado we filed a consolidated rate review and are working through the regulatory process we expect a decision by year end in wyoming and nebraska we will file consolidated rate reviews following approval of the applications for legal consolidation and the completion of the consolidation in each state we plan to file a consolidated rate review in wyoming later in 2019 and during 2020 in nebraska slide 22 illustrates our focus on operational excellence our safety performance continue to be excellent and our reliability from 2017 through the first quarter of 2019 was simply outstanding our safety performance is on track for 2019 and we continue to report much better performance than the utility industry also we received an energy star award from the epa for outstanding efforts to improve residential energy efficiency slide 23 illustrates the results of executing our customer focused strategy and delivering strong long term total shareholder returns and then slide 24 shows our 2019 scorecard to hold ourselves accountable to you our investors we publish our major initiative scorecard each year the scorecard includes a number of key objectives including executing on capital program completing construction of three major projects that include the natural bridge pipeline the busch ranch ii wind farm and then rapid city to steagall transmission line during this quarter we checked our filing in the nebraska legal consolidation that concludes my remarks and we re happy to entertain questions questions and answers operator operator instructions your first question comes from michael weinstein with credit suisse your line is now open michael weinstein credit suisse analyst hi guys linden evans president and chief executive officer hi michael michael weinstein credit suisse analyst so my first question has to do with the increase in the safety and integrity spending this is a bit surprising given the roll forward was pretty recent is this being driven by the drive to consolidate and file rate cases at the utilities over the next year or two at the gas utilities and can we expect this kind of significant programmatic increase again in a more frequent basis going forward linden evans president and chief executive officer michael this is linn as i said in my comments we intend to try do this one time a year so we not do anymore this year we continue to refine our programmatic capital opportunities we ve got a group of engineers who have been doing that for some time they continue to understand our system dissect our system and most of what we ve added this time was due to the fact that we are starting to understand better the project scope and the timing of some of those investments that we ve been looking at for a while we ve also importantly been able to confirm the availability of things like materials and contractors that was an emphasis this particular quarter as well and then we ve got some additional customer growth that we ve identified so that s the bulk of what we ve added this particular quarter going forward we think we ll be doing this mostly in the third quarter during that earnings call unless and until we start to identify maybe larger projects as we go forward michael weinstein credit suisse analyst and we re still are you still on track i guess to announce approximately one to two major projects here that are not included in the capital forecast linden evans president and chief executive officer that s what we currently think michael yes we ve got a number of projects that we have in the pipeline if you will and as we gain confidence in those especially with regulators and the need and the necessity of those then we start to bring those forward as we gain that confidence michael weinstein credit suisse analyst as you are nearing the target mid 50s debt ratio mid 50 debt ratio you re getting pretty close to that now how are you viewing m a as a growth path going forward at this point linden evans president and chief executive officer our approach and perspective on m a hasn t changed over the last several quarters with the premiums being paid as awfully high right now we would probably better offer our shareholders put 1 in the ground a 1 in the year and earn on that and we would be paid 2 and only earn one of those is kind of how we see it we ll see what happens over time with respect to that and we think we re pretty good at it but it s not something that we re focused on and it s not part of our strategic plan right now michael weinstein credit suisse analyst okay thank you very much a nice update and i ll pass along to other people linden evans president and chief executive officer thank you very much michael operator thank you and our next question will come from line of julien dumoulin smith with bank of america your line is now open julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst hi nicely done on the capital upgrades here linden evans president and chief executive officer thank you julien how are you julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst good excellent happy friday if i can go back a little bit to michael s question a little bit can you comment a little bit more on the timing it seems perhaps unique among peer s accelerate capex especially into 2019 i know that the absolute numbers are going up was there also a shift in timeline on when these dollars and when projects are being spent to i know obviously things are a little bit fungible but sort of curious if it s not only an increase but an acceleration of other projects that you previously contemplated to linden evans president and chief executive officer good question julien not so much an acceleration no there was some acceleration i would argue or at least firmed up some that we were hopeful to spend in 19 and 20 because we were not sure about materials and contractors so that helped us firm up this year s and next year s capital more than what it was last quarter julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst got it all right excellent and could you comment a little bit more on nebraska specifically i suppose in terms of incremental opportunities out there and then also talk about just the sort of the process obviously filed this twp part effort can you talk about just what we should expect in terms of when the tariffs get collapsed and and how that kind of reconciles the process of the rate case as well as well as the capital opportunities and any future opportunities that come out of that as you think about that process the capital spend process there linden evans president and chief executive officer sure well nebraska is one of the states that we acquired with the source gas transaction so we continue to learn and evaluate what we acquired with source gas now it s three years later we have a pretty good handle on it but we continue to learn and continue to understand especially as new as we anticipate new femsa for example regulations to be passed down and how we might need to comply with those and what that investment requirement might be with respect to the consolidation our intervention period if i recall collect correctly ended last monday and so that s one checked milestone behind us with respect to the consolidation we don t expect approval until late 2019 with respect to a consolidation in november but that is under excuse me in nebraska but that s currently under way richard w kinzley senior vice president and chief financial officer and then just to add a bit to that and once approved and consolidated we would then file the consolidated rate review which would play out through to 2020 so the impact of that certainly won t come until later next year linden evans president and chief executive officer we expect to be completely wrapped up with both a consolidation and rate review by late next year julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst got it excellent and then just to clarify in brief you alluded to a new tariff i believe in wyoming around some blockchain opportunities if you can is that incremental when you think about incremental sales and i mean obviously it s shifting customers from one tariff to another also probably speaks a little bit as the leading indicator of growth is there something that s pivoting here in terms of your expectations in that state just even in the last few months curious on what you could see as a result of this tariff specifically and also potentially other capital needs that would come behind it to whether voluntary renewables or just low incremental load growth richard w kinzley senior vice president and chief financial officer yes the blockchain load would represent incremental growth to us our new load it would not be changing from one tariff to another tariff it would be new loads for us and wyoming in general as a state has worked very hard to be home state if you will for blockchain my recollection it passed about seven different statutes pieces of legislation in 2017 that allowed wyoming to be in wyoming s words on par with countries like singapore etc with respect to being advantageous to register your cryptocurrencies and your blockchain mining kind of activities within the state of wyoming and so we see this as a great opportunity for us to partner with the state local economic development with the tariffs that we have put in place there was strong interest in blockchain as you probably all might remember a couple of years ago that seems to have tempered some with some of the the cryptocurrency prices dropping but we want to make sure we re ready for that and there are we are getting phone calls and we are speaking to future potential customers with respect to blockchain in wyoming julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst so thank you very much feel better edge ph richard w kinzley senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you very much linden evans president and chief executive officer thank you julien operator thank you and our next question will come from the line of chris turner with jpmorgan your line is now open chris turner jpmorgan analyst good morning i wanted to get an update on colorado legislation i think today is the last day of the session there is a bunch of different bills out there kind of which ones do you see as the most relevant and kind of what might those mean for your customer base kind of customer bills versus other utilities in the state linden evans president and chief executive officer good morning chris and thanks for the question we re watching those very closely it s very early as you just said we have some house bills that have been passed probably the one that we re watching the closest is the co2 reduction bill that would stair step in a co2 reduction up to 90 by the year 2050 relative to the year 2005 and we understand that will be across the entire colorado economy so obviously we re watching that very closely it s very early we ve had some introductory discussions internal to black hills and so we re frankly still analyzing that and look forward to see what s ultimately passed before we start digging into a much much deeper but it would probably based on what we ve seen so far certainly have an impact upon customers likely requiring us to add more renewables storage and things of that nature in the future so much more to come and it s very early for us chris turner jpmorgan analyst okay great and then another kind of relatively high level question you have a lot of different utilities in a lot of different states how are you thinking about kind of earned roe trends over the next three years in your base plan linden evans president and chief executive officer we don t see a big change in earned roes we feel like we re treated fairly now i would say in all of our states we just came out of a rate case in arkansas for example finished that last december and we were pleased we d always like better but we were certainly pleased so we don t see a reduction in roes coming but we re going to keep an eye on that of course chris turner jpmorgan analyst okay so even as you kind of evolve through this set of rate cases and make a lot of investments we shouldn t assume that regulatory lag widens or changes or that your your actual earned roe trends lower linden evans president and chief executive officer no we manage that as best we possibly can in that circumstances yes chris turner jpmorgan analyst okay thanks a lot linden evans president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you and our next question will come from andrew weisel with scotia howard weil your line is now open andrew weisel scotia howard weil analyst hi good morning everybody question on financing so regarding the incremental capex if i compare that to the increase in your equity needs it looks like your financing it with about 50 equity this year and about 40 next year you ve been clear about expecting to continuously raise the capex so my question is should we assume something like a 50 equity ratio on all incremental dollars or would there be a point where that might change richard w kinzley senior vice president and chief financial officer this is rich i would suggest that would change as we move forward you know this year with the outsized capex spend and the next year s a pretty strong capital year too as you can see on our schedules we did kind of finance pretty close to 50 of the incremental capital we just added with incremental atm as you pointed out but again as we move beyond 2020 i would expect our ffo to debt excuse me ffo to debt debt to total capitalization to continue to improve and so at that point our cash flows would be covering the dividend and the capex pretty well and we wouldn t need as much equity unless we continue to add significantly to the capital schedule but smaller additions wouldn t require 50 equity financing i would suggest andrew weisel scotia howard weil analyst okay great then just to clarify on the dividend rich if i heard your comments right you said you don t want to reduce the amount of the increase does that mean we should expect 12 sorry 0 12 increases each year that would obviously decelerate the percentage increase but maybe that s how you get toward the midpoint of the target for the dividend payout ratio richard w kinzley senior vice president and chief financial officer yes i m not going to speak to what our board is going to approve in the future but certainly in the last two years we ve done 0 12 increases in november with our third quarter earnings release a pattern is kind of established there and i think what you just described is probably reasonably accurate we don t want to decrease the amount of the increase and certainly want to continue our track record of 49 years in a row of increasing it so i would say what you characterize is probably reasonably accurate andrew weisel scotia howard weil analyst all right thank you very much linden evans president and chief executive officer thank you andy operator thank you operator instructions our next question will come from the line of vedula murti with avon capital your line is now open vedula murti avon capital analyst good morning linden evans president and chief executive officer good morning vedula vedula murti avon capital analyst i want to look at the slide 10 here on the waterfall chart and i think you gave a discussion about but i wanted to make sure i understand with regards to tax item on the waterfall chart in slide 10 it sounded like from what you said that various tax credits and other types of things for whatever reason all tend to congregate on an accounting basis in 1q such that if we roll forward and look at waterfall charts to the rest of the year this item will not be there but if we think forward next year then simply there will be whatever the differences between this year and next year would then be reflected principally in 1q again is that correct richard w kinzley senior vice president and chief financial officer yes this is a little unusual vedula in that we re adding busch ranch ii at the end of the year which on our forecast we ve got that coming in basically late third quarter so you get four months of production tax credits there is a state investment tax credit one time that we get this year associated with that as well and that s the biggest driver of that tax item also the excess deferred income taxes that we set up back when we did tax reform at the end of 2017 are beginning to be amortized now so that s a contributor there as well in 2019 that s kind of a new item we re starting to refund those amounts to customers so reduced income taxes but reduced revenue on that particular item but those are not one time in nature this year but are kind of new this year and thus create the outsized tax impact in the first quarter going forward i wouldn t expect this to be as big barring additional renewable projects added or something like that but hopefully that answers your question vedula murti avon capital analyst how would we how would you then maybe allocate between the items that you stated that comprise this line item if in terms of the return of the excess deferred income taxes and that thing if that s an ongoing item how much would that be kind of like this item here versus production tax credits and state tax credits from having a new facility come online richard w kinzley senior vice president and chief financial officer that you can kind of glean sum up this from our earnings release the excess deferred tax item just at the gas utilities was 2 4 million in the first quarter of revenue so that would equate to a smaller amount on the tax side because you have to tax effect that the production tax credits and investment tax credit we ve not disclosed those specifically but there a pretty big chunk of the 6 7 million i d say half or a little more and there is a couple other and then there are a couple other items in there again gaap requires us to look at our expected tax rate for the full year and then based on how much money you ve earned in a given quarter which in the first quarter we ve earned about half of what we forecast for the year not quite but close we have to recognize that amount of it in the first quarter so that s why i kind of stands out here vedula murti avon capital analyst then maybe one last thing on this item how much of this would you suggest is non recurring as opposed to recurring going forward richard w kinzley senior vice president and chief financial officer well certainly the investment tax credit that we re getting in colorado when we put the project in service will not recur but the production tax credits will and the excess deferred income tax amortization will be a recurring item too we set up to about 300 million for that at the end of 2017 and that will amortize over a long period of time vedula murti avon capital analyst i mean it s a reasonable thing like maybe half of it is recurring and half not or how should should we really inaudible excuse me richard w kinzley senior vice president and chief financial officer more than half of the benefits will recur vedula murti avon capital analyst okay all right thank you very much richard w kinzley senior vice president and chief financial officer yes linden evans president and chief executive officer thank you vedula operator with no further questions i will return the call back to linn evans for closing remarks please go ahead sir linden evans president and chief executive officer thank you very much for joining us for our call today and

exploration and production ezra yacob evp exploration and production and david streit vp investor and public relations here s bill thomas william thomas chairman of the board chief executive officer thanks tim and good morning to everyone eog s goal is clear and simple be one of the best companies across all sectors in the s p 500 by realizing double digit returns and double digit organic growth through the commodity cycles our stellar first quarter performance demonstrates that we are lowering the cost of oil required to achieve that goal we are confident in our ability to continue to decouple our performance from the commodity price cycles and that our sustainable business model will consistently deliver excellent results in the future as a result the board of directors approved a 31 increase to our dividend right the annualized dividend is now 1 15 per share and represents the largest 1 increase in eog s history this is a tremendous vote of confidence in eog s future and demonstrates a strong commitment to capital discipline and returning cash to shareholders through the dividend our premium combination of higher returns and organic growth is evident in every area of the company with 2019 shaping up to be one of the best operating performances in company history well cost the operating costs are falling and well productivity is strong eog is growing all volumes at lower cost per barrel than ever before we re excited about 2019 and the outstanding operational and financial results we are delivering some of the highlights this quarter include year over year oil growth of 20 exceeding the high end of our crude oil production target capital expenditure below the low end of expectations strong year over year lease operating and transportation per unit cost reductions additional reductions in completed well cost and we secured significant crude oil export capacity increasing our ability to receive the best prices eog continues to improve unit costs capital efficiency and profitability in fact we made the same amount of net income compared to the first quarter of last year with significantly lower oil prices a remarkable achievement demonstrating eog s resiliency to low oil prices and the company s sustainable ability to continuously improve in addition to great results this year we re excited about the steps we re taking to improve future results through our organic exploration of new high quality plays our exploration focus in 15 years of experience drilling horizontal oil wells has generated mountains of proprietary data that gives us an edge in identifying new plays we have 13 years of premium oil inventory so we are squarely focused on further improving the quality of our inventory rather than just adding more quantity adding a low cost organic inventory with better rock will enable the company to grow oil at lower cost and higher margins for years to come at eog we have an unwavering commitment to creating shareholder value through our long standing business model exploration driven organic growth operational excellence technical leadership all underpinned by a distinctive culture our decentralized structure and focus on returns combined with our entrepreneurial please but never satisfied mindset continues to produce outstanding results today and is set to produce sustainable improvements in the future eog has never been in better shape and the company has never had a brighter future next step is billy to review our first quarter operational performance and outlook for the remainder of 2019 billy helms chief operating officer thanks bill before i go into the quarter results i want to be clear on this point we will not increase capex we remain confident in our 2019 plan and activity will be adjusted throughout the year to achieve our production and capital objectives now on to the first quarter our results reflect our tremendous efficiency gains that were beginning to emerge last year it materialized more fully early this year we delivered more oil producing 436 000 barrels per day exceeding our forecast to be more specific the wells completed at the end of last year are outperforming our forecast and that trend has continued into the first quarter of this year of equal importance we spent less capital than expected our capital was well below our forecast for the quarter as we are realizing the increase in efficiencies across our operations unit operating cost performance was also stellar coming in at the low end of our forecast and in the case of lease operating expense we re well below our forecast it s important to note that our strong operational execution is not related to the reduction in service cost is driven by relentless quest for continuous improvements and our attempts to focus on developing new technology all areas of our operations contributed to eog s first quarter execution and capital efficiency first our drilling teams continued to markedly improve their drilling times and performance more importantly the consistency of the improved performance can be seen across our rig fleet this is a result of two factors one we made the decision to maintain the high performing drilling teams and services that are now consistently executing our internally engineered drilling program in each of our major areas of activity we continue to achieve new record drilling times and cost and two our drilling teams continue to adopt new technology processes and specialized tools that improve both drilling performance and repeatability ideas are developed in house and deployed by partnering with service providers for example eliminating even one trip where the drill bit must be brought back to service can save up to 100 000 to capture those savings we first analyze then designed the best downhole motor to use in our bottom hole assembly and took the additional step of bringing quality assurance in house as a result of having direct control of this equipment we have observed a pronounced reduction in the number of trips while also improving the rate of penetration together reducing the trips and increasing the penetration rate is saving up to 400 000 per well if this type of innovation that helps eog continue to deliver best in class drilling performance across all of our plays second our completion teams are experimenting with new design advancements that combine both technique and use of new diverting agents this proprietary formula is noticeably improving well performance and equally important reducing completion costs well performance in these low permeability reservoirs improved due to enhanced fracture complexity completion costs are reduced due to lower material cost and faster execution allows us to complete more lateral feet per day the result is a solid improvement in our capital efficiency further testing and production time will yield more fulsome data and place specific recipes for each of our operating areas but suffice is to say that the early results are encouraging finally investments in strategic water oil and gas infrastructure along with gathering partnerships allow us to leverage our scale and our core operating areas and are having a long term sustainable impact on our operating costs particularly lease operating expenses we continued to evaluate additional high return long term impact opportunities to further reduce cost in summary we ve had a great start to 2019 our operational teams are on track to deliver on our improved capital efficiency goals average well cost across our portfolio are down about 2 5 halfway toward our goal our 5 goal for the year we ve made significant progress toward our goal to reduce per barrel finding cost these improvements will continue to drive down our dd a rate over time and along with unit operating cost improvements enable eog to achieve our return objective in low commodity price environments here s lance to provide a marketing update highlighted by recent progress to secure gulf coast export capacity lance terveen senior vp marketing analyst thanks billy eog has established marketing agreements that provide access to crude oil export markets and corpus christi and houston our capacity in corpus christi will ramp up from 100 000 barrels of oil per day in 2020 to 250 000 barrels of oil per day in 2022 we expect to sell crude oil to export markets from multiple plays including the eagle ford and delaware basin as we illustrate on slide 19 eog will control its crude volumes from the basin all the way across the dock as our agreements provide for pipeline capacity terminal tankage and dock access with the option to price our crude oil farther downstream we expand our flexibility and to sell product to domestic or international markets whichever provides the highest margins this optionality ensures strong price discovery and liquidity for eog barrels our export marketing agreements are an example of our integrated marketing strategy which is designed to achieve four objectives first is control control means capacity of our product to the point where margins are maximized second is flexibility we plan ahead to establish multiple options to deliver product to the highest netback market third is diversification we take a portfolio approach knowing the optimal netback price will move around faster than we can adjust transportation agreements fourth is duration we prefer shorter term contracts to avoid long term high cost fixed commitments this strategy is reflected in advantaged positioning of our oil takeaway in the permian basin eog controls this barrels from the wellhead to the sales point delaware basin barrels are transported out of the basin on a fit for purpose gathering system to five pipeline interconnect points which can transport the oil anywhere from cushing houston corpus christi and even midland and we have accomplished this with limited long term commitments and competitive transportation rates this strategy paid off in the first quarter despite the volatility of oil and natural gas prices in the permian eog was able to flow all of its production and realized strong prices during the quarter in aggregate eog s realized us oil price was 1 21 above wti in the first quarter and our us gas price was only 0 36 below henry hub this is a tremendous achievement and navigating a volatile market crude oil and natural gas marketing is an integral part of the eog s value creation strategy we anticipate future infrastructure needs to protect flow assurance and diversify our marketing options so that we can maximize our price realizations net of transportation costs we accomplish this by working closely with our operating teams in each of our major plays and divisions to understand the potential future development plans and by keeping a pulse on market fundamentals of each product and marketing point our proven marketing strategy has helped eog successfully navigate bottlenecks across all areas of operations including most recently in the permian basin we measure the success of our marketing efforts through our price realizations which we highlight on slide number 20 as well as the transportation costs we incur to deliver our production to market next step up is ken to review the eagle ford highlights kenneth w boedeker analyst thanks lance the eagle ford remains the workhorse asset for eog earning high returns and delivering sustainable growth while generating strong cash flow eog has been developing the eagle ford for about 10 years however less than 40 of the identified locations have been drilled last year eagle ford production grew 9 we forecast the eagle ford is capable of growing for at least 10 more years at premium rates of return while generating significant cash flow in excess of capital expenditures each year more importantly we believe the capital productivity of the eagle ford will continue to improve in the years ahead sustainable cost reduction has been a theme throughout our 10 year history developing the eagle ford even in a play that has already accumulated significant operating efficiencies we were able to reduce drilling costs by 7 and increase completed lateral feet per day by over 50 in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 2018 in fact the first quarter of 2019 was our best drilling efficiency quarter that we ve ever had in the eagle ford on our dollar per foot basis highlighting our culture of always getting better on the production side we are continuing our efforts to further optimize artificial lift and manage water production which will help us control lease operating expenses longer term drilling in our western eagle ford acreage continues to deliver strong premium returns net present value finding cost and capital efficiency our western acreage will be a crucial component of long term growth for the play and we expect it will make up the majority of our eagle ford drilling program by 2021 growing from about 40 of our program in 2019 capital efficiency in the west is caught up over time and is nearing parity with the east as illustrated on slide 39 compared to the east laterals in the west are longer and perfect drilling costs were lower so productivity and economics per well are competitive our proprietary enhanced oil recovery process in the eagle ford continues to perform a technical and commercial expectations eor is as a secondary recovery process in this play and primary development remains the main focus of our operations in 2019 the eor footprint will be expanded after a larger portion of the play has been fully developed the best days of the eagle ford are still ahead we continue to convert non premium inventory to premium status through sustainable cost reductions productivity improvements and leasehold consolidation the eagle ford is a strong growth asset for eog and we expect it to remain one for many years ahead now here s ezra to discuss the delaware basin ezra yacob executive vice president exploration and production thanks ken in the delaware basin we continue to improve on operational momentum we gained last year retaining top performing drilling rigs and completion crews toward the end of 2018 had an immediate impact on the first quarter we drilled and completed 78 gross wells across six different premium targets with just 18 rigs and 7 completion crews compared to the first quarter of 2018 we drilled and completed 42 more lateral feet however we used one less rig and one less completion crew as a result we ve made strong progress toward our full year cost reduction goals in addition we reduced drilling days by 29 transferred 99 of our water by pipe which reduces traffic and saves 2 per barrel compared to trucking source more than 70 of our water through reuse and reduce total well cost by 5 5 finally first quarter wells are outperforming our expectations and we beat our production and financial targets for the first quarter including capital expenditures the result is a first quarter development program that achieved an all in finding cost below 10 per barrel of equivalent while earning 9 million of npv per well and an average 100 direct rate of return eog is a vast industry leading 400 000 net acre position in the core of the delaware basin the rock is about one mile thick and geologically complex due to our 15 years of experience drilling horizontal oil wells we have accelerated the learning curve in this basin as a result even though the delaware basin is still early in its evolution and one of our highest growth areas this asset is already creating significant value through high return drilling low operating expense and positive cash flow just three short years since focusing on its development i ll now turn it over to tim driggers to discuss our financials and capital structure timothy driggers chief financial officer executive vice president thanks ezra eog had strong financial performance in the first quarter the company generated discretionary cash flow of 1 9 billion invested 1 7 billion in capital expenditures before acquisitions which was below the low end of our guidance and paid 128 million in dividends this left 55 million in free cash flow in addition we invested 303 million in bolt on property acquisitions located in new exploration areas as part of our debt reduction plan we expect to repay the 900 million bonds scheduled to mature on june 1 with cash on hand which as of march 31st was 1 1 billion i m happy to report moody s recognized eog is growing financial strength last month upgrading eog s credit rating to a3 with a stable outlook to quote the moody s press release announcing the upgrade the company stated the upgrade of eog s ratings into the a category recognized as the company s high capital productivity backed by operating excellence and a long life high quality asset base that will continue to underpinned the strong credit profile amid a number of oil price scenarios the a3 rating is also supported by the company s conservative financial policies last but not least we announced a dividend increase of 31 in yesterday s earnings release the indicated annual rate is now 1 15 cents per share eog has added hedges for 150 000 barrels of oil per day at an average price of 62 50 this covers about one third of our crude oil production over the remainder of 2019 for natural gas we added hedges for 250 000 mmbtu per day at an average price of 2 90 which is about 20 of our us natural gas production through october we believe the decision to lock in a portion of our crude our current crude oil and natural gas prices is prudent considering the volatility in prices and the high return on investment of our capital program at these prices i ll turn it back over to bill for closing remarks william thomas chairman of the board chief executive officer thanks tim i have a few highlights to leave you with first we re running under plan on capital and over plan on volumes and we re not raising capital second eog has tremendous momentum across all facets of the business drilling completions operating expenses marketing and exploration third we re still getting better along with continuous cost reduction and strong well performance we re optimistic our low cost organic exploration efforts this year will increase the quality of our inventory even further and lower the cost of future oil production fourth our export marketing agreements provide direct access to international markets and expand our ability to capture the best prices fifth the dividend increase shows our confidence in our sustainable business model to deliver performance through the commodity price cycles and finally our sustainable business model is driven by our culture we have an insatiable drive to continue to get better we re confident eog can deliver double digit returns and double digit growth and achieve our goal of being one of the best performing companies in the s p 500 through commodity price cycles long into the future thanks for listening and now we ll go to q a questions and answers operator thank you sir the question and answer session will be conducted electronically operator instructions and your first question will come from neal dingmann of suntrust robinson humphrey please go ahead neal dingmann suntrust robinson humphrey analyst good morning gentlemen strong quarter congrats my first question maybe bill for you could you all speak to your plans of you ve done a great job of balancing growth with shareholder return and really when you look at that you ve almost doubled now your dividend the last year while production is growing about 30 here over the last year or so and while oil is up only about 15 so i mean that question would be specifically if oil stays here or goes higher would you stick with the 12 to 16 oil growth plans and if so what would you do with the potential of material amount of free cash flow william thomas chairman of the board chief executive officer yes thank you neal first of all i think it s really clear we said that on our first call of the year that we re not going to be shifting into a lower growth mode and we don t have specifics on 2020 oil growth but certainly you can think of the company and our 14 oil growth target this year is really on a bit on the low end and so we re really focused on high return oil growth and that s the way we believe will create the most value for our shareholders on the long term you heard i think from ezra that tremendous rates of return and the npv we re creating on each well we re drilling so that s the priority for us in the future and that s where we think we re going to continue to generate the most value in the long term neal dingmann suntrust robinson humphrey analyst very good then maybe my second questions will be for billy or ezra could you just discuss particularly in the perm your pdp decline expectations i mean in the prepared remarks i think you all commented just how much better these new wells are than a year ago so i m just wondering is that true as far as how these wells are holding up or just anything you could discuss toward how you re seeing these wells after a number of months billy helms chief operating officer yes neal this is billy i think in general across all of our plays you see that as we drill longer laterals that didn t necessarily translate to directionally higher ip 30 s per well but we see the performance hang in there longer you see a little bit lot lower decline over time and i think that s really if you look at the first quarter results that s what s driving a lot of our performance sustained improvement in all of our programs and it s a function of just the quality of the wells the better execution across the wells and the focus of the teams ezra you want to add anything or ezra yacob executive vice president exploration and production i just highlight to you that the the team s done a great job in the permian in the last year really learning a lot about the reservoir figuring out across our our acreage position which targets need to be code developed together the spacing both horizontally and vertically and when you combine that increase in well productivity with our our excellent operational execution that s why you re seeing the lower finding cost discussed in the opening remarks and the higher capital efficiency which we have great successes going to continue throughout the year neal dingmann suntrust robinson humphrey analyst thanks for all the detail guys operator the next question will be from doug leggate of bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead doug leggate bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks good morning everybody guys i wondered if i could touch on the acquisition capital and obviously it s you re not going to tell us where you acquiring the gas but some idea as to what we can expect that case to look like going forward was one first quarter very much a or should we expect some kind of sustainable level of acquisition spending as we go forward billy helms chief operating officer doug it your question because it s difficult to hear you was a little bit garbled so could you be a little bit more clear there doug leggate bank of america merrill lynch analyst i apologize i m on my cellphone can you hear me now billy helms chief operating officer yes go ahead doug leggate bank of america merrill lynch analyst so my question was on the level of acquisition capital going forward was first quarter very much a one all or should we expect acquisition capital to be something of a repeating pattern as we go forward for a period billy helms chief operating officer okay thank you that was that was better yeah we as you know the company we re not really focused on corporate m a s but we do occasionally look at bolt on type acquisitions and they re focused primarily in our exploration place and these these acquisitions are very low cost and very very high potential obviously or we wouldn t be interested in doing them and they re kind of one offs and so it s not something you re going to see repeatedly over every quarter and so i m not saying we re not going to do another one this year or not we don t have any plans at this point to do any more but they re really opportunistic drilling opportunistic given and certainly our focus on very very high return low cost drilling potential doug leggate bank of america merrill lynch analyst i appreciate the answer hopefully you can stay with you i mean my follow up is just a quick one obviously really pleased to see the dividend increase i m sure a lot of people would applaud that but i m curious what do you think the right payout ratio is for e p company in other words as you get to where your longer term plans go what do you think that right percentage of your operating cash flow should be being returned to shareholders and i ll leave it there thanks billy helms chief operating officer well certainly i think that operator or company dependent i don t think there s any one run answer for any company for eog specifically we re generating super high fantastic returns on every dollar we spend and so we believe our allocation on reinvesting in very very high rate premium drilling is the number one priority we also strongly believe as we demonstrated this quarter in strong sustainable dividend growth and we think that s the best way to give cash back to shareholders and then we re also very focused on having a ezra yacob executive vice president exploration and production on having a pristine balance sheet and we think that s just a fundamental good business practice and it gives us an enormous advantage especially for countercyclic opportunities in the future so that s kind of our allocation and i think that s very unique to eog s business model and i think it s very sustainable for us doug leggate bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks a lot guys i appreciate the answers operator the next question will be from charles meade of johnson rice please go ahead charles meade johnson rice analyst good morning bill to you and your team there i have a question about your capex trajectory over the year if you look at the way you guys have posted 1q and your guidance for 2q you have a first half is heavier than the than the back half and we saw that same pattern in 2018 so my question is is that is that a feature or manifestation of your planning process or was that more just a coincidence with the way that 2019 2018 shaking up billy helms chief operating officer yes charles this is billy helms so yeah our first quarter capex was about 27 of our total annual budget and in the first half if you look at our guidance will be slightly more weighted toward the first half than we are in the second half and we have confidence that we ll be able to meet our capital and production goals for the year so i expect as we go through the year you ll see us adjust our schedule probably a slight reduction in the second half but also it s not just related to the cadence of rigs we also have infrastructure span and leasehold span that happens in a quarter so i think we re very what i would say is we re very confident we ll be able to make our production goals and stay within our capex that we ve outlined and it s really kind of early to provide guidance for how we ll ratio that down through the year because we have a lot of flexibility operating in multiple basins so it will fluctuate as we go through the year charles meade johnson rice analyst got it okay thank you for that and then one i guess kind of more targeted question on the delaware basin position i noticed that the your bone springs laterals are significantly shorter i think it s 5 500 lateral feet versus really 7 500 or 7 800 on other zones in that same basin can you elaborate a little bit on what may be going on there is it about the lease configuration where you re developing those bone springs or was it more decision about the way you need to stimulate that formation ezra yacob executive vice president exploration and production yes charles this is ezra that s a great question really you picked up on it there in in the latter half your question it really just comes down to lease configuration where shape of our drilling units are i think in general as you ve seen as we look back at our well results quarter over quarter we re trending to get longer with our laterals laterals across all of our plays and the reason for that is that simply the cost per foot is so much less that it really increases the capital efficiency and so i d look in the future to see that bone spring getting longer as well charles meade johnson rice analyst got it thank you for that color operator the next question will be from tim rezvan of oppenheimer please go ahead tim rezvan oppenheimer analyst hi good morning all eagle ford inventory debt remains focused for investors and i noted pretty interesting comments in the release about high grading the residual 4900 non premium locations is this just a matter of sort of cheaper well costs longer laterals and the new completions or is it really more to it from delineation or exploration point of view and kind of how high is getting that number up how high is that on your priority list inaudible here kenneth w boedeker analyst yeah tim this is ken as far as converting those non premium locations to premium we look at that several ways we look at that with trying to reduce the well cost and improve the productivity of the wells so we re always looking at being able to do that and looking at all the different areas we re actually doing several different packages and tests to improve our our conversion of non premium to premiums throughout the year and throughout our acreage position so we have a significant number of those laterals to drill is here and we have a significant number to convert in a future where we re also growing a lot longer laterals as we go toward the west and that ll help convert some of those non premium wells to premium tim rezvan oppenheimer analyst okay you expect to see that number maybe grant higher throughout the year kenneth w boedeker analyst that s what we re working toward tim rezvan oppenheimer analyst okay thank you then my follow up your proxy came out in march and it stated that less than 90 of wells drilled in 2018 qualified as premium i was hoping to better understand what that means does that mean that well level returns didn t hit thresholds or does it mean that there was more exploratory drilling in that year and just thinking about maybe how we should think about that in 2019 given the exploratory focus thanks kenneth w boedeker analyst yeah tim it means that a few of the wells that we drilled and it is a very few in the total package of wells we drilled last year were either step out wells or exploration wells in areas where we didn t maybe didn t have the infrastructure in place or we re on the learning curve in some of the spacing tests didn t quite make the 30 after tax rate return at 40 flat it doesn t mean those wells didn t or weren t really strong economics those wells are fantastic economics probably better than the probably our non premium wells are better than the average for the whole industry on returns but it was just a very few of those and that s what that meant tim rezvan oppenheimer analyst okay thanks and just to push it do you have a number on that is that 11 or is it kind of a higher number kenneth w boedeker analyst i m sorry off the top of my head i don t have the number tim rezvan oppenheimer analyst okay all right thank you operator the next question will be from paul grigel of macquarie please go ahead paul grigel macquarie analyst hi good morning in the release you discussed testing additional targets in the woodford could you elaborate on what you would be seeing there and what timeframe we could see results from that portion of the program kenneth w boedeker analyst yeah this is ken we re continuing to test other areas in the woodford as we get additional information on that and anything material we ll we ll release you guys i would like to make the point that we ve really made great strides in the operational efficiency in that in the woodford play this year we ve almost dropped our our drilling costs down and met our target for the year so we do still plan to complete about 30 wells in the area this year and we re we re real pleased with the progress that we ve made paul grigel macquarie analyst okay and then earlier in the call there s a comment made as the eagle ford program matures and there s more development opportunities the expansion the eor program will occur could you elaborate on on is that by area is that a geological testing is that simply you just need to make sure that the the wells have matured and have hit a certain level just trying to understand when the eor program could see expansion throughout the eagle ford kenneth w boedeker analyst yeah this is ken again we ll expand the eor as we really finish up with our primary development in those areas we ll expand that into the areas that make sense based on some of the results that we ve seen already with the eor program so it s really a matter of finishing up primary development in a lot of those areas paul grigel macquarie analyst is that a certain number of years after initial development or just trying to understand when when primary development is considered finished kenneth w boedeker analyst i would guess i would classify primary development as finished when we quit growing wells in those areas and we can begin the eor process paul grigel macquarie analyst fine thank you very much operator the next question will be from leo mariani of keybanc please go ahead leo mariani keybanc analyst hey guys just wanted to follow up a little bit on the dividend increase here obviously as you you pointed out very material increase for eog wanted to get a sense as to whether or not you guys might be seeking a yield that s a little closer to kind of the 2 that the s p 500 has out there and then additionally just with respect to the dividend is there some kind of price level for example on the oil side you guys may stress test stress test that too or for example you say hey at 45 we need to be confident that we can manage that and still target our production growth just any color you had around that be helpful william thomas chairman of the board chief executive officer leo yeah this is bill yes certainly the dividend increase is evaluated every quarter obviously the macro view of oil prices and our ability to sustain the dividend is a very important thing we ve never cut the dividend ever in the history of eog and we don t ever want to do that so when we make a commitment on the dividend we make a commitment and in our commitment the last two years has been as we stated we wanted to increase the dividend faster than our 19 historical average so the last two years we ve increased it 31 and so our focus on the future is to continue to do that we don t give a specific number but certainly we want to have very strong dividend group growth for a long number of years and that s a commitment that we re making to our shareholders leo mariani keybanc analyst okay that s that s good color and i just wanted to jump over to the exploration front i guess clearly you guys made a couple of bolt on acquisitions in the first quarter in the hopes of bolstering an effort but i certainly sensed a fair bit of excitement around the exploration effort this year from your comments i m supposing that you re not going to be ready to share results but just based on sort of what you re seeing out there can you qualitatively indicate whether or not you think some of this is working and might we get some announcements here in 2019 from eog on that front ezra yacob executive vice president exploration and production yes leo this is ezra thanks for the question as we discussed earlier in the year and in the opening comments like you suggested we re pretty excited about the exploration opportunities we re really focused on applying our drilling and completion techniques to higher quality unconventional reservoirs and what really drives our process is having a multi basin dataset that allows us to compare and contrast different reservoir characteristics of each of the sweet spot and in the established plays that we re in and we apply that to new ideas and areas as bill highlighted we re not just interested in adding quantity but really increasing the quality of our premium inventory and that really should continue to reduce our finding cost lower our dd a and help achieve our long term goals of double digit growth and returns and when we have a little more insight and color something little more material we ll certainly update you guys leo mariani keybanc analyst okay that s helpful and i guess help notice the marketing sort of arrangements with the export capacity that you folks signed up here i just wanted to get a sense has eog already been exporting oil barrels internationally at this point and it certainly seems as though there is a potential big increase coming over the next couple of years just wanted to get a sense of whether or not you ve already got some relationships there national buyers out there that you re hoping to expand lance terveen senior vp marketing analyst yeah leo good morning this is lance thanks for the question yeah when you think about the existing business i mean we ve been very active in houston for quite some time i mean houston is really kind of in our wheelhouse especially since 2012 with a lot of our pipeline capacity that comes into the houston market but since the export ban has been lifted we ve been actively engaged there we ve got a tank position that s there as well so we ve been making spot sales for quite some time especially looking in the last year or two so we ve been active on that front and so we re very excited too about our new capacity that s going to be starting up moving into next year you know really when you think about and you look at the balances in the us you look at supply growth you look at imports you know exports are going to be here the same and we really want to have a very large position there and having that control at the dock we feel that s just going to give us a lot of price discovery but again it s about a portfolio approach i mean we want to protect those realizations and so moving into next year and you look we thought we re going to be very well positioned with our it s unique that we re going to have our permian and also our eagle ford that we re going to be able to show across the docks we feel we re very unique relative to when you look at the producer group on the different qualities so we re going to be able to show to the domestic market but then also our international customers too leo mariani keybanc analyst thank you for the color operator the next question will be from jeffrey campbell of tuohy brothers investment research please go ahead jeffrey campbell tuohy brothers investment research analyst good morning i just wanted to touch base again on the various technological efforts data analysis all the stuff you are doing you called it up again and it sounded like it was perhaps getting even more more into the daily field operations so i was wondering if you just give us a little bit of color on that thank you billy helms chief operating officer yeah jeffrey this is billy helms i can add a little bit of color to that i think part of that goes down to our very culture of the company we were always striving to get better what we do and the way we do that is we look at all the details and we gather lots and lots of data and we ve had these systems in place for some time and then the key part of that is delivering that data back to our teams so they can exercise good decisions on how to improve our operations and the way we just do our business in all aspects and you re seeing that manifest itself and the drilling and the drilling highlights that we offered today as well as the completion highlights improvements that we re seeing so on the drilling side we re monitoring the daily rate of penetration on all of our drilling rigs and making sure our drilling times are not just keeping up with what we re doing but how do we continue to get better and so the results we re seeing today are direct reflection on our ability to gather the data and transport that back and analyze it and deliver it to the field and have the guys making the decisions so it is part of our culture real time returns focused decision making leo mariani keybanc analyst so for example the thing that you talked about earlier today where you re coming up with new completion methods that are using inaudible more effectively and you are cutting costs accordingly these kind of efforts are emanating from all this data analysis that you just talked about billy helms chief operating officer absolutely and we re using more importantly and we re using that data real time so we re actually making decisions based on the pressure rates pressures and rates we re seeing on the wells we re not only fracking but the offset wells to make decisions about how to implement our formula and so that s why the formula is not a cookie cutter formula you can apply everywhere it s tailored it s specifically designed by each well by each zone depending on the target zone and the offsets it takes an integral approach to be able to analyze that data real time and make the right decisions leo mariani keybanc analyst and if i could just ask a quick follow up to that when we re thinking about it is this part of the 5 goal to get cost down or is that 5 goal more based on logistics and contracting and that sort of thing billy helms chief operating officer no that s a good question tim i would add to that really none of the cost savings we re seeing to date are a factor of service cost reductions it is strictly improving efficiencies lowering our cost by doing things better as well as making better wells so we re seeing the double effect of reducing cost improving well performance and it s all directly related to our ability to analyze collect the data and analyze it real time leo mariani keybanc analyst okay great thanks i appreciate that color operator the next question will be from jeanine wai of barclays please go ahead jeanine wai barclays analyst hi good morning everyone billy helms chief operating officer good morning jeanine wai barclays analyst hi my question is on sand a sand provider recently commented that some emp s are switching back to northern lights from local sand due to succinct reasons which i guess there could be production and cost implications for emp s and i know eog does a lot of its own testing and i believe you re an early mover in this area so you probably have more data than anyone on this can you discuss your thoughts on kind of this recent commentary and how much exposure you have to local sand any base and specific color you have would be really helpful too william thomas chairman of the board chief executive officer yes jeanine this is bill certainly we got a tremendous we ve got 20 years of history in horizontal shale plays and we ve used every kind of sand proppant material that s made available over the years currently we are focused on using local sand certainly in the permian that s a big cost saver for us and certainly the industry too so we re going to continue to do that and we re also i think shifting to local sand in the other place such as the eagle ford and many of the rocky plays and in oklahoma too so that s the direction that we re focused in and along with a diversion material we re making significant lead better wells and lower cost wells we do have our own testing facilities we ve been engaged in capturing sand and multiple sources and we screen it and test it and we re very confident that the sand we use in every play it s kind of tailor picked for each play but we re very confident that the compressive strength and the quality of sand that we use in each play is the right mix for long term well performance jeanine wai barclays analyst okay and i think the commentary was kind of triangulating around i think maybe the eagle ford and the mid con outside of the permian and so you do use local sand in those areas as well and you re satisfied william thomas chairman of the board chief executive officer yes yes we re satisfied jeanine wai barclays analyst okay great thank you for taking my question william thomas chairman of the board chief executive officer welcome operator the next question will be from brian singer of goldman sachs please go ahead brian singer goldman sachs analyst thank you good morning william thomas chairman of the board chief executive officer hi brian brian singer goldman sachs analyst the debate one of the debates out there is whether for eog but also for industry is whether the best of the inventory in shale is drilled from either a productivity perspective or rate of return perspective and i think for eog or more specifically pushing back on this point but the comparison of the eagle for east versus west area i was wondering if you could touch on two other areas the first is the permian in your outlook for the ability of efficiency and productivity gains from here to overcome movement from core to less core over time and the second is exploration i think there was a comment earlier that you expect your exploration efforts will lower the cost of a future oil production what has given you confidence that is the case that it is truly exploratory ezra yacob executive vice president exploration and production yes brian thank you for the question this is ezra let me start with the with the back half of that question first on the exploration side and what we re excited about on our exploration opportunities is we feel like we ve identified multiple opportunities where we have an opportunity to apply some of the data and the techniques that we ve been learning on the eagle ford the woodford the permian and the powder we can take some of these techniques and apply them to basically a higher quality reservoir that still should be considered unconventional by nature and we think that the well productivity should be on par with some of our best wells with shallower decline basically due to the reservoir quality the other important thing obviously is as you touched on is being a first mover in these basins and being able to capture the sweet spots of each of these plays if i transition now and sorry i did this in reverse order but if i go to the permian for example i think the way to think about the permian and one reason we spent the time highlighting the progress that we ve made in the eagle ford is that every year one of the benefits of working in multiple basins is yet to combine datasets from multiple basins and those learnings as you roll them in and integrate them into the front end of both your geologic models your drilling and your completions techniques that s what allows us to improve some of what today might be considered a non core area and really improve those well productivity results and continue to drive down our cost to increase the returns of those areas so the best example i would say for the permian is really looking back at that eagle ford example and how we ve taken our western eagle ford results today and really improve them to a point where they re above and beyond what we re doing in the eastern eagle ford just a few years ago brian singer goldman sachs analyst great thank you and then my follow up is with regards to the powder river basin you highlighted that you ve made some progress on the infrastructure front can you add some more color there particularly in how big your sizing that infrastructure and how significant you think production could be especially given the competitive profitability you ve highlighted at least as it relates to the niobrara and mowry zones on your slide 41 the turner wasn t there maybe that would be another point to touch on billy helms chief operating officer yeah brian this is billy helms yeah the first quarter we really tested more turner and bakken zones particularly and as we build out infrastructure for the bigger development it s i think our infrastructure build will be build out in segments to keep pace with our plans for drilling in that years program we re not going to get out ahead and build infrastructure that s made for longer term drilling program just because of the capital capital efficiency of that erode so the size though the scale of the infrastructure will be able to handle certainly the plan that we have in place for those areas so it ll be adequately sized but it ll be scheduled in a pace that keeps up with the current growing clans for that area so we got off to a slow start really in the powder really due to weather we plan to ramp up activity as we go through the year and we re still very excited about the initial results we re seeing from the mowry and niobrara test and as we get more data on those certainly we ll provide more color there but we re still excited about the powder opportunities we see in front of us brian singer goldman sachs analyst great thank you operator the next question will be from ryan todd of simmons energy please go ahead ryan todd simmons energy analyst okay thanks maybe a couple follow ups and some other things i appreciate the clarity that you ve given on the eagle ford if we look at the and the improvements that you ve seen out to the west as we look at the type curve that you carry in the eagle ford it s got a 5 300 foot lateral length with a certain level of productivity there the lateral length feels like it s clearly trending higher is it safe to say that the lateral length increases and as the west has improved is that type curve probably conservative relative to what we should expect to see going forward kenneth w boedeker analyst yeah ryan this is ken again we are really pleased with the way the wells have been reacting out there and our well productivity is meeting the expectations we do see the performance variations across the 120 mile long acreage position and as we extend our as we extend the laterals in the west we ll be seeing well productivity increase well rates and capital efficiency increase out there as well as reducing finding cost ryan todd simmons energy analyst great thanks and then maybe a follow up on some of the acquisition activity and expiration versus your core basins you ve obviously been spending money picking up acreage in some of your inaudible basins that you are very excited about i mean does this do you still see opportunities to add the positions in your core areas of operations or is the valuation outside of those basins just far more compelling at this point william thomas chairman of the board chief executive officer ryan this bill certainly we have a very decentralized exploration effort all seven of our domestic divisions have very strong exploration staff so we are working we re working literally in every basin in the us probably not a well being drill we don t know something about and so we re leasing in multiple places here at very low cost and we believe the prospects that we re leasing on have premium economic potential due to the rock quality as ezra talked about and so some of them are in basins that have had a lot of historical production some of them are in places where there s not really much historic production at all but they re all very high quality and the size of the prospects for working on we use an example of a couple of years ago we talked about the woodford oil play we introduced that s about 200 million barrels net eog that s kind of on the small side so we re not looking for things smaller than that but 200 million barrels net to accompany a discovery of that type even in the world is very significant so last year we announced two new plays in the powder river basin that totaled 1 9 billion barrels so that s a very large one so that s a good way to put the brackets on the size of them but the good thing is as ezra talked about we believe we can continue to organically generate significant prospect potential in the future and added a very low cost much much lower costs than doing m a s and so when we do these bolt on acquisitions there are large amounts of acreage for very very low cost and very very high potential in our mind and so we ve been generating premium inventory twice as fast as we ve been drilling it and the quality of our inventory is going up at the same time so some of the previous questions are based on is eog s inventory quality declining and i can tell you we can tell you with absolute confidence that we believe our inventory quality will continue to improve so the quality is going up and we re not having any problem replacing it much faster than we re drilling it ryan todd simmons energy analyst i appreciate the color bill operator the next question will be from arun jayaram of jp morgan please go ahead arun jayaram jp morgan analyst good morning bill i wanted to see if you could elaborate on your comments on 2020 i know you don t have an official growth target for 2020 but your this morning seemed to indicate your confidence that the company could grow to a production call it greater than 14 and i just wondered maybe qualitatively what would drive you to have that level of confidence because it would be off of a larger base of production this year william thomas chairman of the board chief executive officer yes arun we have that confidence because i think of the culture of the company and the structure of the company and our ability to continue to add new plays to the system we have a chart in our ir deck i believe it s on page 11 that shows eog s existing plays and their maturity phase so most of the things that we re drilling right now still have a lot of growth opportunity and we re adding additional premium locations in each one of those play so that s a big source of new potential and then we re working all these emerging plays and as they come into the development mode that we ll keep shifting more and more activity and inventory into the growth mode of the company and in the growth mode for each one of these plays or not a few years there are multi years 10 plus 15 years a growth mode for each one of these plays and then the structure of our company because it s decentralized we can execute on a large number of multiple plays at the same time with a lot of discipline so we have very expert strong staff in seven different operating divisions so we can truly execute in multiple basins and continue to reduce costs improve technology be very entrepreneurial and act quickly and make really quick inaudible good high rate of return decisions on each one of the plays at the same time so the company has got a tremendous ability to continue our high return growth profile for a very very long time and i think that s quite unique in the industry arun jayaram jp morgan analyst that s great and just one question in terms of the agreements they have in place to export to expand your export capacity from 100 000 barrels to 250 000 barrels for those barrels that you are able to with that capacity how should we think about the uplift relative to wti from those types of barrels one of your peers has highlighted maybe the ability to get 60 of the brent ti s to inaudible 3 in transportation i was wondering if there may be a formula in any way we could think about the uplift that you get on those barrels william thomas chairman of the board chief executive officer no arun thanks for the question we won t go into the detail on what we may or may not speculate on what we think to uplift the most important thing right is it s a portfolio approach to us i mean when we have the diversification we re going to have the capability there to sell domestically so if that s a higher realized net bank for us then we can sell domestically and as you think about our export capacity it s capacity that we can optimize so again like if you look back over time you look at our experience our goal is to maintain our price realizations and being purely in price realizations so we feel that dock capacity that we have there just positions us that we have agreements in place that we can transact very quickly and we can make sales in the spot business and we can keep it on the international index like a brent index or we can keep it at the local markets but we can take advantage of where the pricing leads us so we can move very quickly that s the way you probably need to think about that from our standpoint is just we can move quickly we have the capacity and we can also we can meet that capacity with the permian and also the delaware i think that s also very unique arun jayaram jp morgan analyst thank you so much bye bye operator and ladies and gentlemen this will conclude our question and answer session i would like to hand the conference back over to mr thomas for his closing remarks william thomas chairman of the board chief executive officer in closing we first want to say thank you to the tremendous work by everyone at eog the company is starting 2019 with our best operational performance in company history costs are coming down allowing us to deliver more oil for less money than ever

source govt in new us 5bn funding negotiations the zimbabwe independent may 3 2019 a united kingdom based international financial consultancy firm icg capital and finance corps limited in partnership with five top tier united states banks has tabled a us 5 billion debt restructuring and refinancing proposal for zimbabwe it emerged this week by tinashe kairiza nyasha chingono zimbabwe saddled with an us 18 6 billion debt and cut off from accessing fresh lines of credit is struggling to repay us 2 3 billion arrears to international financial institutions ifis to unlock new funding the debt restructuring deal could help set the broke southern african country on a recovery and growth trajectory icg specialises in raising finance for private and public sector development projects and procuring credit for sovereign governments the london headquartered consultancy firm also deals with financing energy and infrastructure projects across the world icg says it is currently in the process of arranging financing packages for the following projects loans up to us 1 billion for governments of countries in eastern europe infrastructure project based on crude oil guarantee in africa us 200 million gas fired power plant in west africa and us 100 million gas fired power plant in eastern europe harare s re engagement drive with multilateral lenders gained momentum in 2017 when president emmerson mnangagwa dramatically ascended to power through a millitary coup that toppled long time ruler robert mugabe during mugabe s 37 year rule zimbabwe was isolated from ifis for failing to honour its debt obligations however mnangagwa s ascendancy riding on the wave of popular support and promises to embrace bold political and economic reforms revived the interest of ifis which have been engaging with harare to find a lasting solution to extinguish its gargantuan debt stock treasury sources this week told the zimbabwe independent that in 2017 a team from icg led by michael minsky first met with government officials including former finance minister patrick chinamasa and reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz governor john mangudya where they tabled the proposed deal to settle harare s huge debt stock that has haunted the economy for the past two decades the investment consultancy firm also expressed commitment to mobilise fresh lines of credit for harare mangudya told the independent this week that he is not aware of icg s proposed debt restructuring deal i am not aware of that arrangement please do let me know of the terms of the deal if you find out mangudya said however treasury sources said discussions around the deal gathered momentum after the first engagement in 2017 shortly after the coup an icg delegation also visited the country in january this year to engage authorities on the us 5 billion proposal icg capital leading the consortium and as the lead arranger first made contact with authorities in harare in 2017 where they tabled the debt restructuring deal while presenting solid commitments to fund key investment projects a source in treasury said earlier this year in january icg capital also pitched the proposal to treasury sources privy to harare s debt settlement strategy told the independent that icg acting as the lead arranger of the tabled proposal roped in a consortium of top private us banks and initially expressed commitment to mobilise us 5 billion to help zimbabwe settle its debt obligations the consultancy firm treasury sources say also pledged to fund key agriculture projects in the country on a joint venture basis since independence in 1980 zimbabwe has pivoted its economic growth thrust on agriculture though mugabe s chaotic agrarian reforms in 2000 decimated the sector the first offer was first given in 2017 during former finance minister patrick chinamasa s time the team came back early this year and pitched to treasury and reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz it has remained in constant contact in between meetings the ministry of finance was meant to give feedback to the president on their recommendation due diligence was to be conducted on the consortium which tabled the offer that was done but officials have been slow to respond the banks involved are some of the us s top hitters a source close to the arrangement told the independent this week under the proposed us 5 billion debt restructuring and refinancing deal harare would instantly draw down us 500 million from the facility upon endorsing the arrangement sources said the sources added that the deal could not be derailed by the united states government which slapped sanctions on zimbabwe for gross human rights abuse and the collapse of the rule of law since icg capital and the consortium of banks involved were privately owned entities not linked to government washington slapped sanctions on harare in 2001 under the zimbabwe democracy economic recovery act zidera virtually cutting off the country from accessing fresh lines of credit from the international monetary fund imf world bank wb the london and paris club and the african development bank afdb the us wields enormous voting rights in key multilateral lending institutions which have barred zimbabwe from borrowing leaving the country in desperate need of a bailout package to revive its fragile economy no one wants to give zimbabwe money the world bank international monetary fund european investment bank london club paris club will not refinance us anytime soon washington will block any moves by those institutions to either give debt finance or refinance zimbabwe courtesy of zidera another source said the proposed offer cannot be blocked by zidera since it is a private financial entities driven deal the same way general electric wants to partly finance the batoka hydro electric venture icg capital chief executive officer david gabe had not responded to questions sent to him on the deal at the time of going to print under the proposed arrangement icg capital together with the us banks expressed commitment to mobilise resources for compensating white farmers who lost their land when mugabe embarked on chaotic agrarian reforms in 2000 mnangagwa s administration has however acknowledged the importance of compensating white farmers who lost their farms during the violent land seizures in 2000 an estimated us 7 billion is required to compensate the white farmers but harare s cash strapped government has pledged to redistribute land to the affected farmers as compensation compensating the white farmers is perceived as key towards zimbabwe s thrust to re engage with the west if government acknowledges the farmers compensation debt it will be housed under the debt restructuring deal so compensation for white farmers is dealt with decisively an insider privy to the arrangement said if zimbabwe pays the compensation the country will have demonstrated its seriousness on upholding property rights that will be a major milestone towards easing zidera under the proposed deal 90 of zimbabwe s sovereign debt would be written off while the principal us 5 billion amount would attract a 7 interest rate payable over the next 10 to 15 years upon approval of the deal if the deal sails through the source said icg and its partners will also inject foreign direct investment towards financing agriculture value chains on a joint venture basis the us 5 billion financial package will be paid back at the end of tenure 10 15 years ninety percent of the sovereign debt will be written off that will result in favourable sovereign credit re rating and reduce overall country risk upon approval of the deal us 500 million will immediately be released to zimbabwe the source said however sources said harare authorities are hesitant on giving the deal the greenlight though zimbabwe is in desperate need of fresh lines of credit seen as key towards setting the country s faltering economy on a firm recovery and growth trajectory efforts to get a comment from finance minister mthuli ncube on the terms of the debt restructuring and refinancing deal were fruitless as he was said to be out of the country at the time of going to press he had not responded to questions sent to him finance ministry permanent secretary george guvamatanga would neither respond to questions sent to him nor answer his mobile phone this year zimbabwe has managed to settle only us 195 million to local debtors which constitutes about 2 of the country s us 9 9 billion domestic debt while the southern african country has not taken significant strides to repay the us 8 1 billion foreign debt zimbabwe is currently implementing the imf staff monitored programme smp pivoted around a raft of measures meant to restore macro economic stability and fiscal discipline among other objectives although the smp does not have funding as part of the deal it helps restore stability and confidence needed to open new lines of credit and loans
ice earnings call for the period ending march 31 2019 intercontinental exchange inc ice 0 86 q1 2019 earnings call 8 30 a m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks operator good day and welcome to the intercontinental exchange first quarter 2019 earnings conference call and webcast operator instructions please note that this event is being recorded i would now like to turn the conference over to mr warren gardiner vice president of investor relations please go ahead sir warren gardiner vice president of investor relations good morning

of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements please refer to our 2018 form 10 k in our earnings supplement we refer to certain non gaap measures including adjusted income eps operating income operating margin expenses effective tax rate free cash flow and ebitda we believe our non gaap measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance you ll find a reconciliation to the equivalent gaap terms in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful as well as how management uses these measures in our form 10 q when used on this call net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction based expenses and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share please see the explanatory notes on the second page of the earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain terms also with us on the call are jeff sprecher chairman and ceo scott hill chief financial officer and ben jackson our president i ll now turn the call over to scott scott hill chief financial officer thanks warren good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today i ll begin on slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our first quarter performance ice s consolidated first quarter net revenues totaled 1 3 billion up 5 year over year on a constant currency basis trading and clearing net revenues grew 5 and data revenues increased 6 each on a constant currency basis this strong revenue performance helped delivered the second best quarter of earnings per share and free cash flow in our company s history first quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled 528 million including a roughly 7 million nonrecurring benefit in comp expense adjusted for that we would have been at the low end of our guidance range at around 535 million second quarter adjusted expenses are expected to increase to be between 537 million and 547 million largely driven by the full quarter impact of annual merit increases and equity grants we didn t expect the subsequent quarter to increase sequentially by about 3 million to 5 million reflecting increased technology investments and spend related to bakkt incorporating all of those dynamics we are now lowering our full year adjusted expense guidance to a range of 2 15 billion to 2 18 billion i ll pause here to note that in the first quarter we recognized 19 million of nonoperating income related to a true up for occ s 2018 results additionally unlike last year we did not receive a dividend from euroclear in the first quarter we do however expect the dividend of around 20 million in the fourth quarter a 40 increase from the dividend received in the first quarter of 2018 shifting to capital return we deployed over 95 of our free cash flow to dividends that once again are increasing by double digits and share repurchases of note the 440 million distributed via share buybacks in the first quarter included an additional 100 million we opportunistically spent to repurchase shares at an average price of 75 during the month of march the nearly 600 million in total capital that we returned during the first quarter has only been surpassed by the second quarter of last year when we similarly deployed an additional 160 million to repurchase shares we remain committed to strong capital returns a dividend that grows as we do and opportunistic repurchases even as we continue to make key strategic growth investments now let s move to slide 5 where i ll provide additional color on the performance of our trading and clearing business first quarter revenues were up 3 year over year or 5 on a constant currency basis in our energy markets average daily volume was down 12 versus the prior year as trading in the u s natural gas markets and the henry hub in particular suffered from lower levels of price volatility participation in the brent and gasoil markets was negatively impacted by a combination of various geopolitical uncertainties and supply demand dynamics as you will note though the volume declines were almost entirely offset by an 11 improvement in our average rate per contract the improved rpc reflects strong volume growth in our european natural gas business where adv increased 42 in the quarter as well as our emissions business where volumes were up 35 that strong performance continued in april and more importantly overall energy open interest continues to grow and is up 3 versus the end of 2018 in our financial futures markets while interest volumes were impacted by brexit and an certain european economic backdrop msci volumes improved by 9 year over year importantly while interest rate volumes have been somewhat muted april to date open interest continues to trend higher up 11 year over year as of the end of april moving to cash equities volumes increased 9 year over year in the first quarter and market share improved to roughly 25 wrapping up with our fixed income and credit business revenues totaled 87 million in the quarter this compared to 56 million last year and includes the addition of tmc and mers both of which were acquired in the second half of 2018 turning next to slide 6 i ll discuss our data and listing segment starting with listings revenues of 111 million were up 2 year over year while the u s government shutdown delayed ipo activity to the end of january the nyse helped raised over 2 5 billion of ipo proceeds during the quarter in addition the second quarter is off to a strong start with year to date proceeds raised now in excess of 5 billion including the pinterest ipo in april both uber and slack have also recently announced their choice of the nyse as their listing partner moving to data on a constant currency basis data services revenues grew 6 year over year to a record 546 million in pricing and analytics revenues increased 6 over the prior year the automation of fixed income workflows and the growth in passive strategy is continuing to drive increased demand for our valued pricing services both realtime and end in the day as well as our reference data and our index offerings exchange data and feeds revenues grew 8 year over year driven by growth in the number of customers using our futures data and improve market share at the nyse which determines the revenue we receive from the shared take plan and finally desktops and connectivity revenue was up 3 versus last year connectivity services related to our futures exchanges generated solid growth benefiting from the aforementioned increase in our customer base mitigating the strength connectivity revenues related to the nyse were roughly flat as we continue to roll out our pillar technology which we expect will improve efficiency while reducing industry costs we believe the momentum in data revenue growth will continue in the second quarter with revenues expected to increase sequentially to a range of between 550 million and 555 million our confidence is supported by an annual subscription value that was 6 higher than a year ago entering the quarter 2019 is off to a great start the resiliency of the business model we have constructed is evident in our ability to deliver the second best earnings and cash generation quarter in our company s history despite a challenging backdrop for industry trading volumes i ll be happy to take your questions during q a but for now we ll turn the call over to jeff jeff sprecher chairman and chief executive officer thank you scott and good morning to everyone on the call i ll begin on slide 7 our first quarter performance highlights the value of the organic and inorganic initiatives that have undertaken over the last year we ve been engaged in a deliberate evolution to add growing subscription based revenues and to increase our addressable market by expanding our asset class coverage despite softer trading volumes across our industry in the first quarter and as a result of this evolution we grew revenue earnings per share and free cash flow and we returned nearly 600 million in capital to our shareholders the second most in any quarter in our history 10 years ago we were largely a commodities trading venue at the time roughly 85 of our revenue was transaction based today half of our business is recurring revenue in nature and spans a diverse set of asset classes asset classes that we think are well positioned to continue to grow at roughly 30 of our business commodities markets still remain an important component of our growth profile we offer a full spectrum of risk management tools that are critical to the daily hedging and trading needs of global energy and agricultural commodity market participants global benchmark contract such as brent crude oil gasoil sugar and european natural gas to name a few anchor what is the industry s most diverse commodity complex our financial markets business is home to futures on global interest rates and equity indices such as the msci index complex where we recently launched a suite of new indices as we partner to expand the range of risk management tools offered to our customer base in our cash equities business the new york stock exchange stands as the leading provider of listing and trading services we are the listing venue of choice for the world s largest and most sophisticated companies and as the deepest liquidity pool for equities on the planet the nyse provides customers with a state of the art technology platform helping to reduce volatility as well as reducing their trading costs in our fixed income business an asset class that now represent about 1 4 of our revenue with the leading goal provider of our valued pricing and reference data our pricing and reference data business is also the foundation for our index business and for our comprehensive suite of pre trade and post trade analytics this suite of data services together with its institutional customer connectivity is highly complementary to ice bonds execution venues that offer our customers choice across execution protocols including auction click to trade and rfq conventions demand for automation in the fixed income markets is accelerating and whether it s through initiatives such as our etf hub or new data products such as realtime pricing curves best execution analytics or indices our platform of fixed income assets is uniquely positioned to capture this growth trend similarly the u s residential mortgage market is experiencing an analog to digital conversion it s an evolution that we ve seen before and much like in other asset classes we re providing products services and key infrastructure aimed at facilitating that transformation digital mortgage solutions are gaining traction the electronic mortgage notes or e notes are an important step toward a fully electronic mortgage ecosystem and in the first quarter alone more e notes were registered on mers than in all quarters of 2018 combined e notes can bring meaningful efficiency gains to the industry by shortening closing time improving quality control and helping to reduce friction and with e notes representing less than 1 of the outstanding mortgages today the opportunity for future growth is substantial turning now to slide 8 as you may have seen last night we announced the acquisition of simplifile simplifile is the leading provider of electronic recording services to the mortgage industry helping to streamline the real estate transaction process it operates one of the largest mortgage networks connecting originators settlement agents servicers and counties it s a network that s been constructed over 2 decades and includes transaction recording counties that together represent 80 of the u s population with the electronification of the mortgage industry in its early innings of transformation the number of eligible documents that could record digitally is 4x the size of what simplifile currently handles when combined into ice mortgage services we will be better positioned to address the increasing demand for digital mortgage solutions helping the mortgage industry reduce cost and making the closing process simpler faster and more transparent turning now to slide 9 we remain committed to balancing our growth today with ensuring that the groundwork is laid for growth tomorrow an example of this is our effort to support the development of an institutional market for digital assets based on feedback from institutional investors seeking a way to participate in this nascent asset class we re building out key infrastructure starting with a custody platform secure custody of private keys on bakkt will feature the high level of cybersecurity oversight that protects our global markets coupled to the regulatory structure of a qualified custodian for which bakkt has now applied earlier this week bakkt announced that it acquired the digital asset custody company to further scale its capabilities and also announced that it is working with bny mellon to enhance its physical security and geographic diversity of custody bakkt is building a strong team including senior leadership with experience from ice paypal vantiv worldpay coinbase and google wallet and bakkt remains focused on launching physical delivery futures on our ice futures u s exchange to enable trusted pricing within the digital asset ecosystem and to facilitate institutional adoption in summary we re excited about the addressable market that we have in front of us and while our business is certainly larger and more diverse than it was only 10 years ago we re still guided by a management team that operates in sync and we are growth focused our integrated platform enables us to drive efficiencies across our technology and our operations while still significantly investing for future growth which is clear in our operating margins of nearly 60 and our footprint provides us with unique foundation to drive growth while continuing to create value for shareholders so i d like to thank our customers for their business and their trust in the quarter and i want to thank all of my colleagues for their efforts that contributed to another very strong quarter for ice with that i ll now turn the call back to our moderator sherry to conduct the question and answer session and that will last until 9 30 eastern time questions and answers operator operator instructions the first question is from mr michael carrier of bank of america please go ahead michael carrier bank of america analyst all right thanks and good morning thanks for taking the question just the first question some of that fixed income business you guys have done well on the data side i think on the trading the team s a bit more competitive with some of the incumbent platforms out there so how are you thinking or strategically how are you differentiating between the other platforms that are already in the market in order to win over the next few years ben jackson president thanks michael this is ben jackson and i think jeff captured it in the comments that he was making in his opening script there and that the key differentiator that we have is the scale and size of our fixed income business when you look at it as a vertical and it represents now 1 4 of our revenues across our entire revenue base so think about a 1 3 billion business and if you look at the cornerstone of that 1 3 billion business and in that is really our data businesses the data businesses that we ve established pricing reference data index and analytics capabilities that we ve provided to customers for more than 3 decades data businesses and data services are very hard to establish with customers you have to have a long track record of a trust for them to trust that you as a benchmark price that they re going to reference takes a long time to establish the credibility in our relationship and it s those institutional relationships that we have solidified over multiple decades that really is our differentiator that we re going to leverage as it comes into execution for our execution platforms themselves we ve seen similar performance to what you ve seen from the other platforms that have recently announced we had strong performance in corporates in u s corporates we ve seen trade sizes increase we have seen a little bit of relative weakness in municipals as the spread between municipals and treasuries has narrowed and treasuries have come into favor but we have seen treasuries perform very strong at our platform so net net our platforms what we ve done in q1 is we have fully integrated our ice bonds business to now execute as one business we ve restructured the organization rationalize and take some cost out and now have a single vision to leverage the institutional relationships that we ve established over multiple decades so that s really what you see as our differentiator operator the next question is from rich repetto of sandler o neill rich repetto sandler o neill analyst first thanks for slide 7 jeff it s guided it s been an experience watching the company expand over the years so anyway my question is on what you ve schooled us on scott the annual subscriber value for market data and went up nicely but again you talk about this what we re working on right now is 2020 revenue for market data and i guess the questions i know you ve accelerated the growth from the low single digits to the 4 to 6 now but as you go forward is there anything as you add this annual subscriber values is there any momentum to anything to point that you can grow it faster than the upgrade you have right now and is it still coming from the same sort of buckets that you talked about when you a couple of years ago when you first gave some guidance on the growth there scott hill chief financial officer thanks for the question rich and i do think the asc is a good metric to focus on because it is forward looking as i proved last year it doesn t give perfect forecast but it s directionally very indicative i think the key thing you see not just in asp but in the growth trends we ve established our compound growth rate since 2015 through the end of 2018 was just under 6 every year on average this quarter we grew 6 that s the third quarter in a row that we put up 6 and if you look at our guidance for the second quarter we re again going to be kind of in that 5 to 6 range with midpoint being around right around 5 5 so it s a growth trend that s been consistently delivered and asv indicates that it can continue and it can continue because of some of the things that we ve talked about in the script there are a lot of tailwinds in the fixed income space there s a move from active to passive management there s a movie that ben spent a lot of time talking about toward bond etfs which if you look at it well the equity eps is a much smaller space but one where everybody is pointing to a strong future and so i think in the fixed income area and that s largely our pricing and analytics business which we ve grown 6 7 ever quarter for the last 4 or 5 quarters it s really those trends that have driven it and continue to drive it i think if you then look at the exchange data and the connectivity piece again i go back to the remarks i made we continue to see more customers wanting our data and connecting to our platform and so our connectivity services related to futures exchanges was up solidly again this quarter our futures exchange data was up again this quarter and that goes back to the nature of the commodities business the futures business that we offer we offer a global set of interest rates that are subject to european economic and european central bank dynamics and federal reserve dynamic we offer commodities and energy space that most comprehensive global oil market the most comprehensive global natural gas market the most comprehensive global ag market and we continue to see commercial customers who are managing their price risk exposures in our market and that drives a demand for connectivity and for exchange data and so again i would suggest to you you ve been seeing that in the growth results we put up i think it s definitely reflected in our first quarter and second quarter guidance and i see i think you see in the asv which indicates that those trends continue rich repetto sandler o neill analyst okay thanks a lot operator the next question is from mr patrick o shaughnessy of raymond james please go ahead patrick o shaughnessy raymond james analyst yes good morning jeff good morning scott to follow up on the first question on your fixed income business is there any quantification you can provide regarding customer growth or average trade size and kind of metrics that you can provide to us that would indicate that you are progressing along your goals ben jackson president thanks patrick i think the as i mentioned we ve seen relative performance to what you ve seen from the other platforms this past quarter with corporates being strong and municipals in particular seeing some relative weakness if you look at our platforms we do have a bit of a tilt in our mix toward municipals so we did see that impact the businesses to some degree but all that said trends that we ve seen and as we re leveraging the rest of our businesses to really move into the institutional space some of the metrics that i ve said in prior calls that we continue to see this trending very positive is the development of our rfq capabilities to move into the institutional space and rfq represents close to 20 of our trading volumes on a day in and day out basis we continue to see and continue to develop that and continue to see customers utilizing that we have on our platform on any given day over 10 000 securities that have prices of 250 up on either side so that is some real indicator that central limit order book trading in fixed income is starting to develop and we look forward to continuing to provide customers choice on central order book trading options through our click to trade protocol in addition to our rfq capabilities that we have built out on the back of a long standing capability that we ve had in all of our futures markets and being able to provide that protocol as well so it s those 2 pieces and leveraging the institutional relationships that we have across our business that we believe well positions us to continue to change the mix of assets they re trading our platforms and also increasing trade sizes patrick o shaughnessy raymond james analyst great that s helpful thank you operator the next question is from dan fannon of jefferies please go ahead dan fannon jefferies analyst thanks i guess one more on fixed income just to make sure that we re thinking about what your goals are i guess what is the kind of right way to gauge success is it because we don t really have market share we re not getting this clean data yet is it aggregate revenues or i guess what just kind of holds you accountable in terms of that success what should we think about as a goal post as we think about the remainder of this year or even further jeff sprecher chairman and chief executive officer it s a good question this is jeff it s complicated for us because we don t run our businesses the way we recorded them on that chart in other words we have an integrated management team who are running all those businesses together and culminating them on common technology platforms where we can do it in common sales and marketing efforts but if you step back the goal post that we set internally with senior management i referenced in my prepared remarks that 10 years ago we were a very different company we were sitting here around 10 years ago thinking wow there s going to be an analog to digital conversion in fixed income how do we participate and we were pretty knowledgeable we are very knowledgeable about markets this management team has been together a long time and our team had a lot of international cross border experience and we decided to go right for the high value part of the business the high value part of the businesses in mature markets is not the execution and i can tell you a very mature new york stock exchange has 12 other exchange competitors and 5 more that are rumored to be signing up and some estimate as many as 50 different venues where you can execute trades on u s equities the high value part of the business is getting those institutional relationships getting your data your connectivity your higher value products onto people s systems it s very hard when you re running a fund to change your benchmarks to change your underlying data as people consume information that is crippling through organizations and becomes institutionalized so in looking at fixed income market and the difficulty that if we all had in our industry on how to digitize that we decided to start with where we thought the higher value part is so you ve seen growth scott talked about asv and we talked about our company as a data company and how that is performing the reality is what you re really seeing there is those fixed income trends against a very very weak market for commodities and equities and other asset classes in the quarter and so it s why we decided to try to better show you how the business operates we ll take it away that other metrics that we can put out we don t run the business that way so it s hard we don t have those metrics at our fingertips i ll just make one other point which is 10 years ago we weren t in the interest rate business and we had very formidable exchange competitors like cme and deutsche borse and lse and at that time nyse euronext that had very strong interest rate franchise so what did we do we looked and said the nascent part of the market where there s no analog to digital conversion yet is mortgage that s the interest rate market that we should go after and so you re starting to see some of the decisions that we made 10 years ago play out and it s why we spent little bit of time talking about bakkt and digital assets i don t know where that company will go none of us do but we have the luxury in this company of being have an entrepreneurial team and the ability to make investments that are very strategic and still maintain our operating margins given the technology footprint that we have so anyway that s the overarching theme here we ll take away specific metric interest and see if we can come up with something dan fannon jefferies analyst great thank you operator the next question is from mr jeremy campbell of barclays please go ahead jeremy campbell barclays analyst hey thanks jeff just piggybacking on that mortgage commentary there i mean now with mers and simply simplifile can you just provide some color how ice mortgage services fits within the existing kind of mortgage technology infrastructure so for instance i think of like black knight that has something like 80 of mortgage services on their technology platform with also a large origination technology platform is something like that a partner for ice mortgage services a competitor or just an entirely different sphere of influence jeff sprecher chairman and chief executive officer it s very good question so when we bought mers mers really was is a company that registers if you will paper based mortgages it gives every u s mortgage mortgage identification number all the min number mortgage identification number and that s all that s for basic paper based income system what we did is over 2 years we built the digital ecosystem and we worked with fannie and freddie to hook that digital ecosystem to them as an end point and we started with these enotes that we mentioned which is essentially the mortgage it was the loan documents can we get the industry to digitize the essential loan document and send that to fannie and freddie now with and to each other to the extent they want to now we are going to have simplifile which says ok i can send that same mortgage to be recorded at the closing so we re starting to build the back end of endpoints if you will there are a lot of companies out there that have digitized the front end there s a very competitive market when you arrive go to get a mortgage today we may be on a digital platform or we may be talking to somebody in an office that is actually typing into a digital platform that s a highly competitive space and those and well worn in the industry itself to sort of start the time to figure out how to automate the front end we would hope that that we re going to have an open api on this network that we re building we re hoping that those people will plug in what they re doing onto our network so that those essential digital documents can be codified and recorded there are literally hundreds of documents that exist in the world that go into a mortgage your mortgage provider will ask for your tax returns they want to see 1099 they wanted you to go after various forms that are somewhat unique to them they want past appointment history they may do a credit search all of that stuff is if there is an industry that s trying to organize that as you mentioned and it s in various states of way but largely in today s world that all gets printed out into paper documents and put in boxes and store it somewhere and there s so many different fields that are entered into on those forms because they re not that standardized there are acronyms and conventions and things that are hard for people to translate to bring that whole file together and so what we ve done is said let s start with the nugget the essential core which is the actual note itself and then allow we ll build some of it and will have this network built where others can plug into it and let s try to get the entire industry standardizing around our network if you will which will be the essential way to close the transaction jeremy campbell barclays analyst great thank you operator the next question is from mr kyle voigt of kbw please go ahead sir kyle voigt kbw analyst hi good morning maybe to switch gears to the trading business i know you re seeing some really good growth in global oil and other energy products but brent is still in the large features product by revenue and we ve seen some soft open interest throughout the past 2 years there just wondering if you can talk about why you think we haven t been seeing some of the same type of more historical growth rates in brent at least over the past 2 years and if there s anything in the horizon that could reaccelerate those growth rates ben jackson president kyle it s ben thanks for the question and yes we have seen what we view as a temporary pullback in open interest in volumes in brent and i think what you can point to is a lot of this happened in particular in the last 2 3 weeks you can point to a lot of very unforeseen events that have recently happened things such as removal of waivers against iran oil sanctions new bands being implemented on venezuelan oil and now the potential for contagion in russian oil all of this has led to a pretty uncertain environment for traders and while you ll hear us as an exchange operator and others point to times of volatility being great for volumes what s not great for volumes is complete uncertainty and an area where there is a complete unforeseen event that happens which tend to see and what we ve seen over time is the traders will go into a risk off mode and take a step back assess the situation and try to form a view on directionally where the market is going and we think that s what we re seeing in brent itself but you touched on an area that we re seeing that we are seeing growth and that s made up of significant amount of the pull of that recent temporary pullback and that s in that global oil complex and when you think about what is that global oil complex you ve got a whole suite of products that basically hang off of brent the gasoil and our wti business so these are products that are very precise basis locations for people to hedge risk at a point of consumption or a point of production in north america in the middle east in europe and across asia you see complementary spread in differential contracts between brent and gasoil and these contracts you also see refined products spreads so a barrel of oil versus refined products that come off of it oftentimes called crack spreads we ve seen significant growth in this part of the complex with open interest up 6 year over year and volumes up 18 year over year so when you combine this whole complex as one global oil business with over 500 contracts that have been developed with our commercial traders at the core you see a complex that s priced 2 3 of the world s oil it has led and continues to lead in open interest market share and has gained market share over the past year and that s a global complex that includes both futures options and all of our oil products together so we re going to begin to work with our commercial customers customer base to build that out kyle voigt kbw analyst got it thank you operator the next question is from alex blostein of goldman sachs please go ahead alex blostein goldman sachs analyst hey guys good morning and i ll follow up around the mortgage business can you guys update us on the i guess the revenues and expense contribution from the simplifile business that you bought i think the press release just mentioned strong track record of revenues revenue growth and profitability just trying to pencil out what that is and then jeff definitely helpful to summary of kind of what mers is and kind of what it does but again maybe update us on what the revenue there stands today and i guess bigger picture how does this business ultimately get a leverage ice s data and trading segments or is that meant to be really almost kind of like a stand alone part of what you guys do scott hill chief financial officer thanks for the question i m going to take the numbers part and then i ll hand it over to jeff for the important stuff so just quickly just in terms of the numbers simplifile we literally just signed it yesterday and as we mentioned on the press release we don t anticipate it closing until the third quarter what we will do as we typically have is once we ve closed it we ll update our guidance and give you the expense and the revenue associated with it what i can tell you is that when i give the expense update particularly if it s only in the fourth quarter i m hoping we could contain it in our current guidance and it ll be more than offset by revenue because it is a profitable business so more to come on that once we get the deal closed and as we said in the press release that that will be sometime in the third quarter we anticipate in terms of the mers revenue we actually had a strong first quarter the business tends to correlate a little bit or i guess it s a negative correlation with interest rates and so with them having moved a little bit higher as we move through last year is a little bit of concern it might impact that business but as it stabilized the first quarter was actually relatively strong on a pro forma basis well above 20 million of revenue we re up double digits year over year and so you ll recall that we gave you guidance i think of revenues 17 million to 19 million in the fourth quarter and we actually did a little better than 20 million in the first quarter and as i think i mentioned on that call is against the relatively low expense base so high incremental margin like a lot of the other businesses that we operate with that i ll hand it to jeff to talk about how it fits jeff sprecher chairman and chief executive officer well you re somewhat foreshadowing the ideas that we have here on data and analytics once a mortgage has been digitized and the information around it has been standardized so that it s searchable and can be run through analytics platforms fannie and freddie theoretically ought to be able to more quickly get to an underwrite decision that would speed up that process speed up funds flow and closing and as fannie and freddie layoff risk in the market as they do today they will allow the third party that are going to undertake that risk to be able to do more research on the portfolio of mortgages that would be in there so we do view that the data component of mortgage will become more interesting and valuable and will help drive down cost and speed up closing times mers when we acquired it was essentially a consortium and a membership organization with 5 000 members it has data policies within that the industry agreed to essentially we ve in taking control of the business we ve asked many of the companies that have been involved on the board of directors to stay on the board so we have representatives from the gses from large banks and what have you and really the reason that we ask them to stay on is to continue to contribute exactly to the dialogue that i just mentioned which is what is the information that the industry wants and needs how do we deal with pii information as we digitize things and make information more accessible what are the levels of information that the market needs versus the need to be kept proprietary thinking about the expansion of this business globally and into other asset classes of lending how does it meet the european standards and what have you so those are all tbd future conversations that we started honestly when we first got involved in the business and there ll be a natural by product that i think of digitization and standardization in this industry alex blostein goldman sachs analyst great thanks very much operator the next question is from mr brian bedell of deutsche bank please go ahead sir brian bedell deutsche bank analyst great thanks very much i want to stay on the mers topic i think jeff you jeff or scott you mentioned about 1 of outstanding mortgages right now are electronically documented through the enotes system can you help us think about the run rate path or the revenue growth path over the long term is it most is it entirely dependent on new originations or is there a path to convert existing mortgage documents that don t have any activity to them electronically in terms of bringing up that mortgage and then maybe just how many enotes actually did you register in 1q i know it was more than all of 18 altogether jeff sprecher chairman and chief executive officer i m going to start with the second part of your question 19 000 enotes in q1 is still a very small when you think of it in the context of the u s mortgage industry is still nascent but you ve seen what s going on underneath that is the early adopters people that are anxious to become more digital have embraced this idea and are moving quickly to try to build it into their workflow there s a broad cross section of people in the mortgage industry that are talking to us or looking at the api or figuring out how to build it into their current workflow and it s not unlike any analog to digital transition that you ve witness in other asset classes so what you see are early adaptors are getting in there quickly as they get in there and start to experience cost savings and ability to serve their customers better it s driving competition so we are very encouraged by the early results even though it s a low number the revenue model is simply we charge to you to it s a list essentially enote on our platform and simplifile charges to registered enote and the more that that can all be put into one workflow to make it easy for the lender and mortgage underwriters you can imagine that the pace of increase as for existing documents there are a number of companies out there that are exploring how to go back and digitize existing mortgages there s a lot of error rate in dealing with boxes of paper mortgages that exist in warehouses when there is a change of servicing rights when there is a foreclosure and one of the things that simplifile and mers has been working on over the last decade is changing local law and what have you so that the golden record if you will can be digital that the original mortgage you can may recall during the last financial crisis people showed up with global sign mortgages in courts and many judges rejected them and as a result mers the entity that was helping to find and produce those mortgages on behalf of the original lenders and so moving to electronic system with the golden record which is much like what s done in many other asset classes that can be respected by the courts will essentially be a reason that all these legacy mortgages will be scanned and put in that system and i mean like i had of the meeting i actually had a meeting on this topic yesterday with a third party who wanted to talk about how they can plug in the mers if they were to offer those kind of services brian bedell deutsche bank analyst so do you anticipate being able to get a bulk transfers of existing mortgages without any activity so no refi or no foreclosure or no new mortgage just go into some record keepers and be able to do a giant bulk transfer of those existing paperback you meant into enotes jeff sprecher chairman and chief executive officer potentially the problem is that those records are not standardized and you need essentially not just the ability to scan but you need essentially artificial intelligence or rules based engine that on a document that says somebody is named robert and another document has him down as bobby but that s the same person and where people have made errors in writing social security numbers down and all this other stuff you can get pretty quickly into chaos so the people that are and there are people looking at this are trying to figure out is their ability to scan those create an indelible record that will be respected by the courts and in foreclosures and store that record point it at mers and the enote and allow the marketplace itself to better transfer potentially those mortgages between one another particularly servicing rights which happens quite often brian bedell deutsche bank analyst okay great thank you so much for the color operator there s a follow up question from mr rich repetto of sandler o neill please go ahead sir rich repetto sandler o neill analyst yes hi just a question for ben on the fixed income side when you re back in to the revenue it looks like for tmc and bondpoint it looks like revenue went down quarter to quarter and i know you mentioned ben some softness in the muni market but it did look like from trace volumes that there was a record volume in 1q so just trying to understand the actual revenue from the fixed income on the trading side ben jackson president yes and rich i tried to hit that on the comments i made earlier where a lot of it had to do with a mix so the municipal space and our platforms compared to the others that you see out there tend to be more tilted toward the municipal space and the muni space has had a rough go at it lately again given that spreads between treasuries and munis has narrowed and treasuries have come into favor so what we have seen is that treasuries have picked up the treasuries tend to be at a lower price point price per transaction so what we do see is that with the efforts that we have under way and that i ve talked about on prior calls with the etf hub initiative and the build out of our rfq we are continuing to advance those efforts and with etf hub on schedule to be released later this year we see that the initiatives like that as well as the connection that we re building across the institutional businesses that we have we ll continue to change that mix as well as increase average trade size that we ll see on the platform rich repetto sandler o neill analyst got it thank you operator it s a follow up question from mr patrick o shaughnessy of raymond james please go ahead sir patrick o shaughnessy raymond james analyst hey great thank you so bakkt has obviously had some pretty well publicized delays since you announced the initiative how do you think the market opportunity for bakkt and how that s changed since you relaunched the effort jeff sprecher chairman and chief executive officer well to be completely transparent with you it s really been helpful that the cryptocurrency industry sort of went into what they call a winter that took some of the heat off of the timetable to launch there s been a and secondly we ve actually been looked at a number of different companies and acquired a company earlier this week that wouldn t have been available to us had this market been really hot because valuations were really hot so i see this kind of maturation that s going on where for example the people the blockchain engineers that we acquired through our recent acquisition became really interested if you will in affiliating with a larger more corporate if you will effort to move this to move the industry forward there s a lot of interest still in this market it s not when we talk about institutions the institutions have are regulated banks are regulated the regulators are trying to get their arms around this asset class and how to regulate it that s and we want to be a regulated venue which is why it s taken a while but that said you can t really get into the true institutional markets that we serve without being highly regulated and highly trusted and so the juices worth the squeeze in terms of it the way and it s going well now there were a lot of things that had to get sorted out over jurisdiction and custody and how these what will happen in a bankruptcy and those kinds of issues that in my mind need to be resolved before there s going to be wide adoption of the asset class and we ve been at the forefront of solving those and building the solutions for those and we re very very close now to finalizing all of that so once we re sure this sort of downturn in the value of these assets allowed us to attract some really great people and gave legislators regulators the time to think about in particular in the united states how to deal with this asset class patrick o shaughnessy raymond james analyst thank you operator the next question is from mr chris allen of compass point please go ahead chris allen compass point analyst good morning guys i wanted to ask a follow up on the muni market in general where does that market stand in terms of electronification particularly in the institutional side what are the impediments if there are any right now and how do you see that kind of evolving moving forward ben jackson president thanks chris yes so the municipal space it is far behind where even u s corporates are so if you look at estimates of the u s corporate market in terms of how much is electronic being 20 to 25 but clearly moving more and more electronic the municipal space is further behind where our estimates are call it 10 to 12 of it are electronic we are seeing that continue to move more electronic we re beneficiary of that obviously but the municipal space structurally has been tough for the point that i brought up before with the spreads between municipals and treasuries coming down but also if you just look at muni issuance if you look back 2 years ago it s significantly higher than where it is now now it s starting to just rebound at this point and as new issuance starts to come around we should see some benefit in the secondary trading on that and it takes a while to get behaviors to change from the analog type of transaction but it s early days but we are starting to see that move as well chris allen compass point analyst has the banks taking any steps toward electronic through new munis ben jackson president similar to corporates the dialogues that we re having with banks is that they start at certain trade sizes and started small trade sizes and looking to electronify that and then over time as they get more and more comfortable with it they ll move up in move up that threshold in terms of what s the minimum size that they no longer want a phone involved in that transaction they want to build more algorithms into pricing those trades more electronic execution in pricing those trades and municipals just a few years behind where corporates are chris allen compass point analyst thanks guys operator the next question is a follow up from michael carrier of bank of america please go ahead sameer murukutla bank of america analyst hey guys this is actually sameer murukutla mike had to jump off but a quick question related to your thought process around acquisition especially in the fixed income space or maybe can you give an update on how you think about the return in accretion goals meaning historically it s been a focus but given some of the structural growth in certain areas would you sacrifice those goals if you think the structural growth make up for it over a longer period jeff sprecher chairman and chief executive officer i guess the operant part of your question for me is longer period we try to be very disciplined about the return on invested capital we feel like we can pay a premium for a business if we can put it on our platform and quickly grow it or digitize it so and also integrate the business so that if we look generally out 3 years we want to start to see very high returns on invested capital we give ourselves we tend to give ourselves 3 years to integrate a business and honestly internally we try to drive ourselves to 2 and so we want to see very positive results mathematically coming out of that we i m smiling because we built 1 billion revenue business in fixed income i think without a lot of people realizing what we were doing because we really didn t talk about it in that way and we were able to acquire key parts of that business at valuations that were incredibly low relative to where people are valuing fixed income assets today i m not sure that the market has recognized that it s partly why we decided to pull the curtain back a little on this call and give you more color on what we look like today and so i don t know now that that sort of the curtains now that the wizard is visible i m not sure that we re going to be able to continue to find interesting assets that deliver on the metrics that i just tried to describe but we re always looking scott hill chief financial officer i think the only thing i would add to that as you ve heard us talk about our acquisition how does it fit our strategy how does it enable our growth how quickly can we integrate it how many synergies can we generate what s the return on the investment you ve seldom heard us say the word accretion because of the end of the day you can financially engineer accretion you can t financially engineer returns and if the deal done fits strategically we are not likely to be able to get those returns and so that we showed you the model a couple of summers ago and it was the case before we showed it to you it is the case now that it s about strategic fit it s about growth and its about returns those are the things that matter and it s one of the reasons you see our return on invested capital now back at 9 when our weighted average cost of capital is only 6 because we do focus on creating economic value sameer murukutla bank of america analyst thanks for the color jeff sprecher chairman and chief executive officer thank you warren gardiner vice president of investor relations well it s 9 30 i think we ll wrap up oh i m sorry sherry were you going to wrap it up for me jeff sprecher chairman and chief executive officer thank you currently i was more anxious to get off the call but thank you all it was a great quarter and we ll look forward to reporting our next quarter

however moving to slide 5 we had an excellent quarter from operationally and financially our operations team has performed exceptionally well during difficult winter conditions we delivered strong quarterly earnings growth and advanced key strategic initiatives we were ready for our customers energy needs delivering safe and reliable service when they needed at the most safety is our top priority in all we do and i m proud of how our team and our systems performed during severe weather conditions in the first quarter with our team sustaining zero injuries during the response to our customers needs our team proactively delivered the energy to keep our customers and communities safe during the record breaking cold temperatures associated with the january polar vortex at nearly 100 mile per hour winds produced by the bomb cyclone in colorado and then winter storm ulmer and it s resulting flooding in iowa and in nebraska because of our focus on safety and reliability and our investments in upgrading our infrastructure systems we reduced and in many cases we avoided outages during these severe winter conditions our proactive approach to customers and communities helped affected communities begin to recover more quickly during widespread flooding in both iowa and nebraska which was a difficult which was a difficult time of loss for many april 18 was national lineman appreciation day and we could not be more proud of our resilient employees who maintain and enhance our extensive energy systems on a daily basis these committed men and women often break the worst weather conditions head on to deliver the essential energy our customers depend upon in fact our line mechanic team currently has a perfect safety record in 2019 with zero injuries year to date i personally thank them for their commitment to safety and delivering valued service to our customers we delivered excellent earnings growth during the quarter returns on our customer focused capital investments and colder than normal weather were primary drivers we increased our 2019 guidance primarily due to the benefit of weather in the first quarter strategically we continue to refine our capital investment plan we identified an additional 246 million of customer investment opportunities and added those investments to our five year capital forecast providing further confidence in our long term growth expectations we also continued to advance regulatory proceedings we submitted new filings and made progress on key capital projects despite severe winter weather slide 6 list our specific accomplishments for the quarter starting with our electric utilities in december we announced our renewable ready program in south dakota and wyoming to provide our larger government commercial and our industrial customers a cost effective option to purchase utility scale renewable energy we are in the midst of the regulatory approval process for these voluntary tariffs and we are also seeking approval to construct a 57 million 40 megawatt corriedale wind energy project to support this program i m pleased to report we continue to received strong interests from potential customers for this program in south dakota construction continued on our 175 mile transmission line extending from rapid city south dakota to steagall in nebraska the project remains on budget and on track to place the third and final 94 mile segment in service this fall two segments that span 81 miles were previously placed in service in both july and november of last year in september last year we requested a new tariff to support the growth of blockchain in wyoming the tariff will help recruit blockchain companies to call wyoming their home delivering additional energy demand to our system following a hearing earlier this week on april 30 the wyoming commission has approved the tariff moving to the natural gas utilities in the right hand side of slides of slide 6 on february 1 we filed a rate review in colorado to consolidate the rates tariffs and services of our two gas utilities in that state our colorado gas rate review filing also seeks a new rider mechanism to recover integrity investments we received approval for the legal consolidation in last october and completed the consolidation last december we have a hearing on the consolidated rate review applications scheduled in june in march we filed applications for the legal consolidation of our two natural gas utilities in nebraska and our four natural gas utilities in wyoming similar to the process in colorado we plan to file combined rate reviews following approval and completion of the pending consolidation requests at our power generation segment we commenced construction in march on the 71 million 60 megawatt busch ranch ii wind farm near pueblo colorado when placed in service this fall the wind farm will deliver all of its renewable energy to colorado electric a black hills utility affiliate under a 25 year power purchase agreement this will fulfill the requirement of colorado electric to deliver 30 of its energy as renewable energy to customers by the year 2020 on april 29 our board declared a quarterly dividend of 0 505 per share which represents an annualized rate of 2 02 in 2019 and is our 49th consecutive annual dividend increase one of the longest track records in the utility industry and a record we are extremely proud of finally we issued approximately 280 000 shares under our at the market equity offering during the first quarter for net proceeds of approximately 20 million to recap we had a great quarter serving our customers delivering for you the shareholders and making progress on our long term customer focus utility growth strategy now i ll turn it over to rich for our financial update rich richard w kinzley senior vice president and chief financial officer all right thanks linn and good morning everyone i am having quite a chest cold so i have to step away from the microphone for a moment please bear with me but hopefully i can get through this clean i ll start on slide 8 as linn noted we delivered solid first quarter financial performance returns on investments made to benefit customers at our gas utilities and favorable weather year over year at our natural gas and electric utilities were the big drivers of the strong q1 financial results our quarterly eps as adjusted increased 6 year over year despite the dilution from 11 increased share count related to the equity unit conversion back last november of 2018 as a result of our strong first quarter we increased our 2019 eps guidance by 0 05 on each end of the range to 3 40 to 3 60 per share we also reaffirmed our 2020 eps guidance range of 3 50 to 3 80 per share the assumptions related to our earnings guidance are detailed on slides 43 and 44 in the appendix on slide 9 we reconcile gaap earnings to earnings as adjusted non gaap measure we do this to isolate special items and communicate earnings that better represent ongoing performance this slide displays the last five quarters and trailing 12 months as of march 31 2019 and 2018 in q1 2019 we had no special items we did experience special items in 2018 not reflective of our ongoing performance all of which were income tax related the first item reflected the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act throughout the year the second and larger item related to tax benefits of legal restructuring is completed in 2018 as part of an effort to simplify our legal structure in q1 and q4 last year we restructured certain entities acquired as part of the source gas acquisition the restructurings increased goodwill that is amortizable for tax purposes resulting a 49 million deferred tax benefit in the first quarter and a 23 million deferred tax benefit in the fourth quarter these items are not indicative of ongoing performance and then accordingly we reflect them on an as adjusted basis our first quarter 2019 as adjusted eps was 1 73 compared to 1 63 for the first quarter last year as linn and i already noted the earnings uplift this year was primarily driven by returns on customer investment and a colder winter heating season we estimate that winter weather last year as compared to normal positively impacted q1 2018 eps by 0 05 this year we estimate the colder weather compared to normal positively impacted q1 2019 eps by 0 12 also we expect to enjoy a lower effective tax rate this year compared to last year excluding the 2018 special items i just mentioned i will discuss this further on the next slide slide 10 is a slide we added to our investor materials last year to improve transparency related to year over year comparisons the waterfall chart illustrates the primary drivers of our positive results from q1 2018 to q1 2019 all amounts on this chart are net of income taxes i ll add more detail by segment on the next slide but overall our utilities delivered strong gross margins with an increase of over 7 in q1 2019 compared to q1 2018 total operating expenses were approximately 5 higher compared to q1 last year driven primarily by higher outside services employee costs bad debt expense and depreciation we also experienced favorability in our effective income tax rate in q1 2019 compared to the prior year our effective tax rate this year is expected to be approximately 14 compared to approximately 18 last year when excluding the prior year special items forecasted federal renewable energy production tax credits and state investment tax credits related to the busch ranch ii wind farm that as linn mentioned that we placed in service this fall as well as excess deferred tax amortization related to tax reform drive the reduction in the 2019 effective tax rate under generally accepted accounting principles related to interim tax accounting we are required to recognize a large portion of our annual forecasted 2019 tax credits and excess deferred federal income tax and amortization in q1 given we anticipate earning nearly half our annual income in the first quarter slide 11 is a new slide we ve added to our presentation combining the operating income results for all our operating segments onto one slide i ll make a few high level comments here and you can find additional details on q1 year over year changes in gross margin and operating expenses in our earnings release operating income grew year over year due to strong performance at the electric and gas utilities at our electric utilities operating income for q1 2019 improved by 2 5 million compared to q1 2018 an increase of over 6 gross margins increased by 4 8 million primarily from lower purchase power capacity charges higher off system power marketing and favorable weather partially offsetting the increase in gross margins were higher operating expenses which increased 2 3 million over q1 last year primarily due to higher outside services and employee cost at our gas utilities operating income for q1 2019 improved 7 9 million compared to q1 2018 an increase of over 8 gross margins increased 16 1 million primarily from returns on investments for customers and colder weather customer growth in our service territories and increased transport and transmission volumes also contributed to the gross margin increase partially offsetting the gross margin increase were higher operating expenses which increased by 7 million primarily from higher outside services and higher employee costs depreciation increased 1 2 million from higher rate based plant in service on the bottom of slide 11 you see our power generation and coal mining segments delivered consistent year over year q1 results both businesses continue to operate efficiently and provide excellent returns slide 12 shows our financial position through the lens of capital structure credit ratings and financial flexibility our credit ratings remain at bbb at both fitch and s p and baa2 at moody s with a stable outlook from all three agencies we remain committed to maintaining our strong investment grade credit ratings at march 31st our net debt to capitalization ratio was 57 7 a decrease of 120 basis points from year end this reduction was driven by the increase in our retained earnings through our solid first quarter earnings and 20 million of new equity issued under our at the market equity offering program as well as by strong first quarter cash flows that allowed us to reduce our short term debt from year end given we increased our 2019 capital spending forecast by 107 million since our last public capex disclosures we expect debt to total capitalization to increase slightly as 2019 progresses you ll note in our updated guidance assumptions on slides 43 and 44 in the appendix that we expect to use the atm to issue a total of 80 million to 100 million in new equity this year and 40 million to 80 million next year to help fund the increased capex program which linn is going to speak to shortly while debt to total capitalization will likely remain in the 58 to 59 range in the 2020 we continue to target a debt to total cap in the mid 50s over the long term slide 13 illustrates our dividend track record we ve grown the dividend at a faster rate the past few years demonstrating our confidence in our future earnings growth potential as we ve stated in the past our intent is to not reduce the amount of the annual dividend increase and we maintain our stated dividend payout ratio range of 50 to 60 of eps i ll turn it back to linn now for his strategic overview linden evans president and chief executive officer thank you rich moving on to slide 15 as discussed during previous calls we group our strategic goals into the four major categories profitable growth valued service better every day and great workplace our overall objective is to be best in class in everything that we do and our ready branding and messaging complements this customer focused strategy we will drive future earnings growth through our customer focus investment program to better serve our customers needs based on our capital forecast we expect to deliver long term earnings per share growth above the utility average in addition we fully expect incremental growth opportunities from generation of other larger projects we are also focused on continuing to grow our dividend we have increased our annual dividend for 49 consecutive years one of the longest track records in the industry slide 16 helps us illustrate how we think about strategic execution we are aligning our people processes our technology and our analytics around our customers needs in addition to our investment for customers to deliver safe and reliable service we are transforming our customer experience working hard to know our customers well and make it easier to do business with us we are driving growth through higher penetration adding renewable energy and creating innovative tariffs to recruit new businesses in particular are enabling the growth of data centers in our territories which fit the unique attributes of our service territory and we are investing in the safety and reliability of our electric and natural gas infrastructure systems using a disciplined programmatic integrity program slide 17 illustrates the strategic diversity of our business culture we have a mix of complementary gas and electric utilities across stable and growing midwest states the quarterly operating income chart on the left illustrates the seasonality of our earnings between electric and gas utilities our balanced mix reduces total company risk slide 18 illustrates our large electric and natural gas infrastructure systems these systems span across eight states and provide more diverse opportunities for investment more interconnections for reliability and growth and greater overall efficiency of operations for our customers slide 19 our systems require significant long term investment to meet our customers needs forecasted capital investment is focused largely on safety reliability and supporting our customers growth this capital forecast far exceeds forecasted depreciation which translates to future earnings growth this quarter as i said before we added 246 million to our five year forecast we added 107 million in 2019 58 million for 2020 and the rest is in the other years most of the increase relates to safety and integrity needs we now plan to invest 777 million in 2019 with being 2 8 billion over the five year period both of these are all time high capital forecasts for us we ve also refined our programmatic capital forecast for 2019 and expect this to be our final forecast update for this year on a going forward basis we expect to update our capital forecast in the fall and we ll disclose that forecast with third quarter earnings as noted on prior calls our capital forecast includes opportunities we re relatively certain to occur and we add capital especially in the outer years as we gain more clarity and more comfort around specific projects with the continued build out of our programmatic infrastructure replacement plans combined with growth in larger project opportunities we fully expect our actual out year capital expenditures to be greater than those in the current forecast for 2020 and beyond please see our appendix slide in this presentation for more detail of our capital investment forecasts you note on slide 30 and slide 32 that we have adjusted the annual base investment for both electric and gas utilities compared to our prior investor presentation moving on to slide 20 this slide illustrates the breakdown of our five year capital forecast note that over 90 of our forecasted investment is in our utilities and those utility and of those utility investments over 70 are recovered in a timely and efficient manner slide 21 shows the timeline around our multi state jurisdictions simplification efforts we strongly believe consolidation of the multiple entities within each state will provide us long lasting benefits for all stakeholders including our regulators this will happen through streamlined and fewer regulatory proceedings and filings we have three states in which we own multiple gas distribution utilities those are colorado nebraska and wyoming all of which are now officially under way for simplification in colorado we filed a consolidated rate review and are working through the regulatory process we expect a decision by year end in wyoming and nebraska we will file consolidated rate reviews following approval of the applications for legal consolidation and the completion of the consolidation in each state we plan to file a consolidated rate review in wyoming later in 2019 and during 2020 in nebraska slide 22 illustrates our focus on operational excellence our safety performance continue to be excellent and our reliability from 2017 through the first quarter of 2019 was simply outstanding our safety performance is on track for 2019 and we continue to report much better performance than the utility industry also we received an energy star award from the epa for outstanding efforts to improve residential energy efficiency slide 23 illustrates the results of executing our customer focused strategy and delivering strong long term total shareholder returns and then slide 24 shows our 2019 scorecard to hold ourselves accountable to you our investors we publish our major initiative scorecard each year the scorecard includes a number of key objectives including executing on capital program completing construction of three major projects that include the natural bridge pipeline the busch ranch ii wind farm and then rapid city to steagall transmission line during this quarter we checked our filing in the nebraska legal consolidation that concludes my remarks and we re happy to entertain questions questions and answers operator operator instructions your first question comes from michael weinstein with credit suisse your line is now open michael weinstein credit suisse analyst hi guys linden evans president and chief executive officer hi michael michael weinstein credit suisse analyst so my first question has to do with the increase in the safety and integrity spending this is a bit surprising given the roll forward was pretty recent is this being driven by the drive to consolidate and file rate cases at the utilities over the next year or two at the gas utilities and can we expect this kind of significant programmatic increase again in a more frequent basis going forward linden evans president and chief executive officer michael this is linn as i said in my comments we intend to try do this one time a year so we not do anymore this year we continue to refine our programmatic capital opportunities we ve got a group of engineers who have been doing that for some time they continue to understand our system dissect our system and most of what we ve added this time was due to the fact that we are starting to understand better the project scope and the timing of some of those investments that we ve been looking at for a while we ve also importantly been able to confirm the availability of things like materials and contractors that was an emphasis this particular quarter as well and then we ve got some additional customer growth that we ve identified so that s the bulk of what we ve added this particular quarter going forward we think we ll be doing this mostly in the third quarter during that earnings call unless and until we start to identify maybe larger projects as we go forward michael weinstein credit suisse analyst and we re still are you still on track i guess to announce approximately one to two major projects here that are not included in the capital forecast linden evans president and chief executive officer that s what we currently think michael yes we ve got a number of projects that we have in the pipeline if you will and as we gain confidence in those especially with regulators and the need and the necessity of those then we start to bring those forward as we gain that confidence michael weinstein credit suisse analyst as you are nearing the target mid 50s debt ratio mid 50 debt ratio you re getting pretty close to that now how are you viewing m a as a growth path going forward at this point linden evans president and chief executive officer our approach and perspective on m a hasn t changed over the last several quarters with the premiums being paid as awfully high right now we would probably better offer our shareholders put 1 in the ground a 1 in the year and earn on that and we would be paid 2 and only earn one of those is kind of how we see it we ll see what happens over time with respect to that and we think we re pretty good at it but it s not something that we re focused on and it s not part of our strategic plan right now michael weinstein credit suisse analyst okay thank you very much a nice update and i ll pass along to other people linden evans president and chief executive officer thank you very much michael operator thank you and our next question will come from line of julien dumoulin smith with bank of america your line is now open julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst hi nicely done on the capital upgrades here linden evans president and chief executive officer thank you julien how are you julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst good excellent happy friday if i can go back a little bit to michael s question a little bit can you comment a little bit more on the timing it seems perhaps unique among peer s accelerate capex especially into 2019 i know that the absolute numbers are going up was there also a shift in timeline on when these dollars and when projects are being spent to i know obviously things are a little bit fungible but sort of curious if it s not only an increase but an acceleration of other projects that you previously contemplated to linden evans president and chief executive officer good question julien not so much an acceleration no there was some acceleration i would argue or at least firmed up some that we were hopeful to spend in 19 and 20 because we were not sure about materials and contractors so that helped us firm up this year s and next year s capital more than what it was last quarter julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst got it all right excellent and could you comment a little bit more on nebraska specifically i suppose in terms of incremental opportunities out there and then also talk about just the sort of the process obviously filed this twp part effort can you talk about just what we should expect in terms of when the tariffs get collapsed and and how that kind of reconciles the process of the rate case as well as well as the capital opportunities and any future opportunities that come out of that as you think about that process the capital spend process there linden evans president and chief executive officer sure well nebraska is one of the states that we acquired with the source gas transaction so we continue to learn and evaluate what we acquired with source gas now it s three years later we have a pretty good handle on it but we continue to learn and continue to understand especially as new as we anticipate new femsa for example regulations to be passed down and how we might need to comply with those and what that investment requirement might be with respect to the consolidation our intervention period if i recall collect correctly ended last monday and so that s one checked milestone behind us with respect to the consolidation we don t expect approval until late 2019 with respect to a consolidation in november but that is under excuse me in nebraska but that s currently under way richard w kinzley senior vice president and chief financial officer and then just to add a bit to that and once approved and consolidated we would then file the consolidated rate review which would play out through to 2020 so the impact of that certainly won t come until later next year linden evans president and chief executive officer we expect to be completely wrapped up with both a consolidation and rate review by late next year julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst got it excellent and then just to clarify in brief you alluded to a new tariff i believe in wyoming around some blockchain opportunities if you can is that incremental when you think about incremental sales and i mean obviously it s shifting customers from one tariff to another also probably speaks a little bit as the leading indicator of growth is there something that s pivoting here in terms of your expectations in that state just even in the last few months curious on what you could see as a result of this tariff specifically and also potentially other capital needs that would come behind it to whether voluntary renewables or just low incremental load growth richard w kinzley senior vice president and chief financial officer yes the blockchain load would represent incremental growth to us our new load it would not be changing from one tariff to another tariff it would be new loads for us and wyoming in general as a state has worked very hard to be home state if you will for blockchain my recollection it passed about seven different statutes pieces of legislation in 2017 that allowed wyoming to be in wyoming s words on par with countries like singapore etc with respect to being advantageous to register your cryptocurrencies and your blockchain mining kind of activities within the state of wyoming and so we see this as a great opportunity for us to partner with the state local economic development with the tariffs that we have put in place there was strong interest in blockchain as you probably all might remember a couple of years ago that seems to have tempered some with some of the the cryptocurrency prices dropping but we want to make sure we re ready for that and there are we are getting phone calls and we are speaking to future potential customers with respect to blockchain in wyoming julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst so thank you very much feel better edge ph richard w kinzley senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you very much linden evans president and chief executive officer thank you julien operator thank you and our next question will come from the line of chris turner with jpmorgan your line is now open chris turner jpmorgan analyst good morning i wanted to get an update on colorado legislation i think today is the last day of the session there is a bunch of different bills out there kind of which ones do you see as the most relevant and kind of what might those mean for your customer base kind of customer bills versus other utilities in the state linden evans president and chief executive officer good morning chris and thanks for the question we re watching those very closely it s very early as you just said we have some house bills that have been passed probably the one that we re watching the closest is the co2 reduction bill that would stair step in a co2 reduction up to 90 by the year 2050 relative to the year 2005 and we understand that will be across the entire colorado economy so obviously we re watching that very closely it s very early we ve had some introductory discussions internal to black hills and so we re frankly still analyzing that and look forward to see what s ultimately passed before we start digging into a much much deeper but it would probably based on what we ve seen so far certainly have an impact upon customers likely requiring us to add more renewables storage and things of that nature in the future so much more to come and it s very early for us chris turner jpmorgan analyst okay great and then another kind of relatively high level question you have a lot of different utilities in a lot of different states how are you thinking about kind of earned roe trends over the next three years in your base plan linden evans president and chief executive officer we don t see a big change in earned roes we feel like we re treated fairly now i would say in all of our states we just came out of a rate case in arkansas for example finished that last december and we were pleased we d always like better but we were certainly pleased so we don t see a reduction in roes coming but we re going to keep an eye on that of course chris turner jpmorgan analyst okay so even as you kind of evolve through this set of rate cases and make a lot of investments we shouldn t assume that regulatory lag widens or changes or that your your actual earned roe trends lower linden evans president and chief executive officer no we manage that as best we possibly can in that circumstances yes chris turner jpmorgan analyst okay thanks a lot linden evans president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you and our next question will come from andrew weisel with scotia howard weil your line is now open andrew weisel scotia howard weil analyst hi good morning everybody question on financing so regarding the incremental capex if i compare that to the increase in your equity needs it looks like your financing it with about 50 equity this year and about 40 next year you ve been clear about expecting to continuously raise the capex so my question is should we assume something like a 50 equity ratio on all incremental dollars or would there be a point where that might change richard w kinzley senior vice president and chief financial officer this is rich i would suggest that would change as we move forward you know this year with the outsized capex spend and the next year s a pretty strong capital year too as you can see on our schedules we did kind of finance pretty close to 50 of the incremental capital we just added with incremental atm as you pointed out but again as we move beyond 2020 i would expect our ffo to debt excuse me ffo to debt debt to total capitalization to continue to improve and so at that point our cash flows would be covering the dividend and the capex pretty well and we wouldn t need as much equity unless we continue to add significantly to the capital schedule but smaller additions wouldn t require 50 equity financing i would suggest andrew weisel scotia howard weil analyst okay great then just to clarify on the dividend rich if i heard your comments right you said you don t want to reduce the amount of the increase does that mean we should expect 12 sorry 0 12 increases each year that would obviously decelerate the percentage increase but maybe that s how you get toward the midpoint of the target for the dividend payout ratio richard w kinzley senior vice president and chief financial officer yes i m not going to speak to what our board is going to approve in the future but certainly in the last two years we ve done 0 12 increases in november with our third quarter earnings release a pattern is kind of established there and i think what you just described is probably reasonably accurate we don t want to decrease the amount of the increase and certainly want to continue our track record of 49 years in a row of increasing it so i would say what you characterize is probably reasonably accurate andrew weisel scotia howard weil analyst all right thank you very much linden evans president and chief executive officer thank you andy operator thank you operator instructions our next question will come from the line of vedula murti with avon capital your line is now open vedula murti avon capital analyst good morning linden evans president and chief executive officer good morning vedula vedula murti avon capital analyst i want to look at the slide 10 here on the waterfall chart and i think you gave a discussion about but i wanted to make sure i understand with regards to tax item on the waterfall chart in slide 10 it sounded like from what you said that various tax credits and other types of things for whatever reason all tend to congregate on an accounting basis in 1q such that if we roll forward and look at waterfall charts to the rest of the year this item will not be there but if we think forward next year then simply there will be whatever the differences between this year and next year would then be reflected principally in 1q again is that correct richard w kinzley senior vice president and chief financial officer yes this is a little unusual vedula in that we re adding busch ranch ii at the end of the year which on our forecast we ve got that coming in basically late third quarter so you get four months of production tax credits there is a state investment tax credit one time that we get this year associated with that as well and that s the biggest driver of that tax item also the excess deferred income taxes that we set up back when we did tax reform at the end of 2017 are beginning to be amortized now so that s a contributor there as well in 2019 that s kind of a new item we re starting to refund those amounts to customers so reduced income taxes but reduced revenue on that particular item but those are not one time in nature this year but are kind of new this year and thus create the outsized tax impact in the first quarter going forward i wouldn t expect this to be as big barring additional renewable projects added or something like that but hopefully that answers your question vedula murti avon capital analyst how would we how would you then maybe allocate between the items that you stated that comprise this line item if in terms of the return of the excess deferred income taxes and that thing if that s an ongoing item how much would that be kind of like this item here versus production tax credits and state tax credits from having a new facility come online richard w kinzley senior vice president and chief financial officer that you can kind of glean sum up this from our earnings release the excess deferred tax item just at the gas utilities was 2 4 million in the first quarter of revenue so that would equate to a smaller amount on the tax side because you have to tax effect that the production tax credits and investment tax credit we ve not disclosed those specifically but there a pretty big chunk of the 6 7 million i d say half or a little more and there is a couple other and then there are a couple other items in there again gaap requires us to look at our expected tax rate for the full year and then based on how much money you ve earned in a given quarter which in the first quarter we ve earned about half of what we forecast for the year not quite but close we have to recognize that amount of it in the first quarter so that s why i kind of stands out here vedula murti avon capital analyst then maybe one last thing on this item how much of this would you suggest is non recurring as opposed to recurring going forward richard w kinzley senior vice president and chief financial officer well certainly the investment tax credit that we re getting in colorado when we put the project in service will not recur but the production tax credits will and the excess deferred income tax amortization will be a recurring item too we set up to about 300 million for that at the end of 2017 and that will amortize over a long period of time vedula murti avon capital analyst i mean it s a reasonable thing like maybe half of it is recurring and half not or how should should we really inaudible excuse me richard w kinzley senior vice president and chief financial officer more than half of the benefits will recur vedula murti avon capital analyst okay all right thank you very much richard w kinzley senior vice president and chief financial officer yes linden evans president and chief executive officer thank you vedula operator with no further questions i will return the call back to linn evans for closing remarks please go ahead sir linden evans president and chief executive officer thank you very much for joining us for our call today and thank you for your interest in black hills and have a great rest of

new york cnn business if the chasm between the trump administration and monetary policy norms wasn t already apparent friday offered the strongest example yet the us labor department announced that the economy had added 263 000 jobs in april and that the unemployment rate had fallen to its lowest level in nearly 50 years an hour and a half later vice president mike pence and national economic council director larry kudlow simultaneously appeared on television to deliver this message the federal reserve needs to lower interest rates this might be a time for us to consider about lowering interest rates pence told cnbc and kudlow told bloomberg that s our position we think low unemployment can work in tandem with rate cuts why a rate cut now would be crazy the trump administration has been banging this drum for months as the stock market tanked and cracks in the economy began to appear in the final months of 2018 a rate cut didn t seem so outlandish premature perhaps but not out of the realm of possibility but many of those cracks have since disappeared the us economy grew at a robust annual rate of 3 2 in the first quarter blowing past economists expectations even as consumer spending slowed the unemployment rate is at 3 6 these are not numbers that have been traditionally associated with cutting rates they re numbers that usually suggest the fed should hold or perhaps even raise rates the fed has several tools at its disposal to speed up or slow down the economy its most prominent and important tool is its interest rate setting mechanism which influences lending rates across the country when it lowers rates lending becomes cheaper increasing the flow of money but inflation can become a problem when it raises rates lending gets more expensive which can slow down the economy but it generally lowers inflation why would the fed want to slow the economy down when it grows too fast the economy could be in danger of overheating which could drive inflation too high people and companies might take on too much debt which could make a recession more severe and come sooner than it otherwise would have bubbles can form in the stock market or other asset classes deflation bogeyman the trump administration argues that inflation is not a concern and it s largely correct core inflation fell to 1 4 in the first quarter well short of the central bank s 2 target in an interview with cnn s poppy harlow white house chief economist kevin hassett on friday declined to say that the fed should lower rates but he expressed concern that inflation could fall even further or prices could even begin to fall a disastrous economic situation called deflation there is this risk we could import deflation and that s something that i think i know that my friends at the fed are watching closely that we watch closely as well he said but fed chair jerome powell said it s too soon to declare victory over inflation when asked about inflation during a press conference wednesday he said the dip is transient noting inflation ran pretty close to 2 for most of 2018 at the moment we don t see a strong case for moving in either direction he said if the fed were to cut rates now it wouldn t technically be unprecedented the fed made precautionary rate cuts outside of recessions in 1995 and 1998 but growth was slowing then it s accelerating now with a very tight labor market and growth far above its peers most economists say the united states simply does not need stimulus cutting rates now would also take away weapons in the fed s arsenal in the event of an economic downturn when the fed typically cuts rates right now interest rates are only at 2 5 which doesn t leave much room for rate cuts even more outlandish that s why the trump administration s calls for rate cuts are so outside of the norms but the white house isn t only calling for rate cuts they re calling for gigantic ones kudlow has supported an emergency half percentage point cut stephen moore who president donald trump had eyed for a vacancy on the fed s board echoed the idea of a half point cut moore this week removed himself from consideration but trump said he had asked him to work with him toward future economic growth trump outdid both kudlow and moore this week and said he wanted a whole point cut the last time the fed cut rates that much was december 2008 in midst of the the deepest financial crisis since the great depression the central bank slashed rates from 1 to essentially zero at the end of 2008 it had never done anything like that before china is adding great stimulus to its economy while at the same time keeping interest rates low our federal reserve has incessantly lifted interest rates even though inflation is very low and instituted a very big dose of quantitative tightening we have the potential to go donald j trump realdonaldtrump april 30 2019 up like a rocket if we did some lowering of rates like one point and some quantitative easing yes we are doing very well at 3 2 gdp but with our wonderfully low inflation we could be setting major records at the same time make our national debt start to look small donald j trump realdonaldtrump april 30 2019 the administration has also suggested but not directly called for limiting the fed s power it might be time for us to consider that again the fact that the fed looks at full employment and monetary policy and inflation pence told cnbc friday and instead by just looking at inflation you would make clear there s no inflation happening here the economy is roaring pence said he has not spoken to president trump about that idea and kudlow said the administration is not considering imposing any new rules on the fed it looks like us they re focused on inflation rates larry kudlow told the media outside

million loss of 0 05 per unit compared to net income of 209 million 0 42 per unit in the prior year net income for the period benefited from higher earnings across the majority of our operations and contributions from capital expenditures and new investments made in the past 12 months the prior year results included a gain of 209 million net of tax recorded in the comparative period relating to the sale of our chilean electricity transmission business our business generated ffo of 351 million for the quarter or 0 88 of ffo per unit representing a 4 increase over the prior year results for the quarter reflect strong performance by each one of our operating segments delivering organic growth in excess of our annual target range of 6 9 current period results also benefited from contributions from recently acquired businesses partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange brookfield infrastructure had a strong start to 2019 delivering 10 organic growth we also invested 430 million into two previously announced transactions and progressed the integration of recently acquired assets said sam pollock chief executive officer of brookfield infrastructure as we advance a number of asset sales we will seek to replicate our recent capital recycling success to create further long term unitholder value segment performance the utilities segment contributed ffo of 137 million compared to 169 million in the prior year underlying performance was strong as our operating groups were able to grow results by 5 on a same store basis over the prior year this was predominantly driven by inflationary increases to our rate base combined with another strong quarter at our u k regulated distribution business these positive contributions were offset by us having less capital invested following the sale of our chilean electricity transmission business in march of last year higher interest expense associated with a financing completed at our brazilian regulated gas transmission operation and a 9 million impact from foreign exchange ffo from our transport segment was 139 million for the quarter in line with prior year results the segment benefited from organic growth of 6 driven by higher tariff and traffic levels across our global toll road portfolio strong volumes at our container terminals and higher revenues at our australian rail operations these positive contributions were partially offset by the previously announced sale of a 33 interest in our chilean toll road operation that closed in february and the expiry of one of the state concessions at our brazilian toll road business ffo for this segment was also reduced by 4 million as a result of foreign exchange primarily the result of a decline in the brazilian real the energy segment contributed ffo of 107 million which represents a 62 improvement from the prior year this step change increase is attributable to organic growth and contributions from two recently acquired north american businesses our north american natural gas transmission business delivered another strong quarter generating ffo that was 23 higher versus the prior year results for this business are benefiting from robust demand for transport services and contributions from the first phase of its gulf coast expansion project at our gas storage operations ffo was 43 above last year as the business earned higher spreads related to cold weather conditions ffo for the data infrastructure segment was 28 million up from 19 million last year recent investments in our global data center portfolio contributed ffo of 7 million for the quarter ffo from our french telecommunications infrastructure business grew by 13 due to inflationary increases and new points of presence added to our tower

the 2018 first quarter our fee building gross margin for the 2019 first quarter was 0 4 million versus 1 1 million in the prior year period the reduction in fee building margin was largely the result

believe the ratio of net debt to capital is a relevant financial measure for investors to understand the leverage employed in our operations and as an indicator of our ability to obtain financing we believe that by deducting our cash from our debt we provide a measure of our indebtedness that takes into account our cash liquidity we believe this provides useful information as the ratio of debt to

turkey s relationship with europe and with the west more generally is rooted in several factors relations are affected by the domestic politics in all countries concerned while conflicts at turkey s borders have implications for the country s security and for migration flows toward the eu economic and financial ties ankara s intensified links with russia and iran and turkey s rule of law also have significant consequences despite growing divergences between turkey and its traditional western allies neither side can afford for political economic and security relations to deteriorate beyond a certain point this is especially true of the eu turkey economic relationship where trade foreign direct investment and technology transfers play important roles both ways the rest of 2019 will be full of testing moments for all the critical components of the relationship it is up to both sides to renew the search for realistic avenues for constructive cooperation marc pierini pierini is a senior fellow at carnegie europe where his research focuses on developments in the middle east and turkey from a european perspective more marcpierini1 turkey s current situation turkey s present situation can be assessed in five dimensions economics domestic politics foreign policy defense policy and the rule of law together these strands paint a challenging picture that leaves europe and turkey with limited options for how to respond the economic backdrop the turkish economy has entered a contractionary period after a decade of uninterrupted growth the policy the government chooses in response will determine the severity and duration of the recession the economic slowdown is due to rising structural vulnerabilities exposed by a buildup of private sector debt on the back of cheap global liquidity the country s private credit to gdp ratio reached 70 percent by the end of 2018 a decade ago it was 27 percent this trend illustrates the consequences of the growth model pursued by the turkish authorities which was based on a domestic lending boom a more sustainable option would have been to focus on productivity enhancing reforms to decrease turkey s reliance on foreign savings turkey now faces a serious problem of corporate debt overhang a situation in which firms debt is so great that they cannot easily borrow more which negatively affects domestic investment and consumption on top of this accumulated debt the economy suffers from problems of currency mismatch and resource misallocation more than half of the corporate debt is denominated in foreign currency leading to an open foreign exchange position defined as the foreign exchange owed by turkish companies to international financial investors of more than 200 billion or 25 percent of turkey s gdp many corporations have had balance sheet problems and are facing financing difficulties as a result of the currency shock in summer 2018 when the turkish lira depreciated by 40 percent against major currencies in addition the foreign funding turkey has received over the years has been increasingly allocated to non foreign exchange earning sectors of the economy like real estate and construction the latter industry now accounts for nearly 10 percent of turkey s national income a level witnessed in spain before its construction led economic crisis ankara s policy response will need to incorporate a large scale debt restructuring scheme to alleviate the burden on corporate balance sheets this will be a complex operation that can be done effectively only with international financial assistance that is why a deal with the international monetary fund imf is becoming increasingly necessary the more turkish policymakers procrastinate in devising financing and implementing a large scale corporate debt adjustment program the more difficult it will be for the turkish economy to return to a growth trajectory as an additional objective turkish policymakers will have to change their growth paradigm away from capital deepening which necessarily raises financial liabilities at home to a model driven by increases in productivity this goal will require a structural transformation of the current economic approach with consequences for the country s political economy it will also need an improvement in turkey s investment climate which will in turn require enhanced rule of law the domestic political backdrop turkey has reached the end of a particularly heavy electoral schedule the country has been through three national elections a constitutional referendum and a presidential election since 2015 in the meantime turkey has transitioned from a parliamentary to a presidential system with recep tayyip erdoğan elected as the country s first executive president local elections were held on march 31 2019 but no further votes are scheduled until 2023 the local elections created a political shock as the ruling justice and development party akp lost hold of turkey s major metropolitan areas including the capital ankara and istanbul where the party has challenged the vote count this result was due primarily to the country s ongoing economic slowdown which undermines support for the government but it was also because the normally ineffective turkish opposition had created a political alliance led by the main opposition republican people s party chp and the center right good party that seriously challenged the akp s dominance in some of turkey s big cities the fact that the pro kurdish peoples democratic party hdp decided not to nominate candidates in some of these constituencies was also a boon for the opposition alliance the outcome of the local elections is set to embolden the opposition which now controls cities that represent 65 percent of turkey s gdp the potential for economic rent distribution linked to seizing major local authorities will also benefit the opposition financially as a result the outcome can be seen as the start of a rebalancing of turkey s political landscape at the same time erdoğan and his ruling political alliance remain the dominant forces in turkey s domestic politics having received a slim majority of the popular vote nationwide after the elections erdoğan can now operate without the pressure of an electoral calendar for the foreseeable future in theory this political backdrop should create a favorable environment for turkey to finally address its democratic backtracking and enhance the rule of law a core motivation for doing so would be that improving the rule of law can assuage ongoing economic difficulties the same argument can be made in relation to the kurdish problem higher rule of law standards would help appease turkey s kurdish minority but the akp s alliance with the conservative nationalist movement party mhp creates an ever present hindrance to such reforms in this context the turkish leadership keeps putting pressure on the hdp saying that the kurdish origin party is no different from the kurdistan workers party pkk a terrorist entity erdoğan and the akp need the alliance with the mhp to retain their majority in turkey s parliament but if for some reason that alliance came to an end and an imf agreement could trigger such a fission then new political realignments would become necessary foreign policy on foreign policy the fact that the ruling akp has entered an alliance with the mhp has prompted the country s leadership to harden its anti western narrative mostly against the united states and to a lesser extent against the eu this partnership has also diminished the probability of an agreement on a comprehensive settlement for the divided island of cyprus the most significant foreign policy developments have been on syria based on the belief that the syrian kurdish people s protection units ypg are an extension of turkey s own kurdish insurgency the pkk ankara has made the protection of its borders and the creation of buffer zones on the syrian side central elements of its policy this resulted in the intervention by the turkish armed forces and the turkish backed free syrian army to seize control of the jarablus area north of aleppo in 2016 and of the kurdish ruled district of afrin in 2018 the fates of the kurdish governed town of manbij and of the kobane and jazira districts all in northern syria have become the center of a lasting dispute with the united states which is leading the coalition fight against the so called islamic state with the help of the ypg and french forces the abrupt decision by u s president donald trump on december 19 2018 to withdraw u s troops from northeast syria has provided ankara with both a victory in principle and a fresh military challenge aside from the slow and incomplete implementation of the u s withdrawal turkey faces another quandary both moscow and tehran continue to support efforts by the regime of syrian president bashar al assad to recapture all land within syria s borders this over time will inevitably mean the complete withdrawal of turkish troops from syria beyond ankara s recurrent threats to launch a cross border operation targeting the part of syria northeast of the euphrates river where the ypg is based difficult discussions on an international agreement to protect the turkey syria border will continue to dominate turkey s foreign policy agenda the economy however may produce shifts in turkey s foreign policy the challenging economic environment will force ankara to become less confrontational with its partners in the west that will be the case especially if a deal with the imf becomes inevitable ultimately the large financing needs of the turkish economy heightened by an acute economic downturn can be sourced only from western savings an improbable but significant alternative could have been for turkey to turn to china for its financing needs turkish finance minister berat albayrak was in beijing in july 2018 the likelihood of this scenario has dwindled however as turkey has recently become more vocal on china s human rights violations in its autonomous xinjang territory defense policy currently turkey s defense policy debates are dominated by the s 400 dilemma this combined with a series of knock on effects means that the western view of turkey s defense policy is of a growing divergence from the country s commitments to nato one of the major disagreements between turkey and the united states relates to ankara s ongoing willingness to acquire from russia the s 400 strategic weapons system to boost its air defense capabilities the delivery of the first battery is expected in july 2019 but the united states has declared that such an acquisition which would effectively lead to the introduction of a russian made missile system and associated russian military personnel at the heart of one of the largest nato air forces would trigger sanctions against turkey under the countering america s adversaries through sanctions act that act provides for the imposition of sanctions on third parties that make significant transactions with companies linked to russia s military industry in addition washington has warned that such a transaction with moscow would affect the delivery of the f 35 fighter jets turkey has ordered from the united states the u s fear is not only that the s 400 would obtain critical information about the stealth characteristics of the f 35 but also and more importantly that it could hack the f 35 s communications platform endangering the security of the f 35 fleet around the world washington has therefore proposed an alternative package to turkey including the u s made patriot missile system the official rhetoric in ankara is that turkey will seek to procure both systems but in reality turkey is compelled to choose between the russian and the u s equipment from washington s perspective these are two mutually exclusive options unless ankara changes its acquisition plans a move that is difficult to envisage given that good relations with russia have become critical for turkey at the very least for achieving its aims in syria the outcome would be another turkey u s escalation and a major blow to the north atlantic alliance furthermore the u s congress could also halt the participation of turkey s military industry in the production of components for the f 35 the onset of the 2020 u s presidential election campaign toward the end of this year could be a further destabilizing factor the rule of law the view in european capitals is that ankara has distanced itself from the eu s democratic norms to such a degree that progress on turkey s eu accession bid is no longer realistic the june 2018 eu council conclusions stated clearly the concern in europe over the continuing and deeply worrying backsliding on the rule of law and on fundamental rights including the freedom of expression and the deterioration of the independence and functioning of the judiciary the accession process is neither alive nor formally dead because it is up to turkey to fulfill the conditions that the two sides have agreed are the basic requirements for accession the eu s view on the rule of law is unlikely to soften much after two recent developments first an indictment dated march 4 accused sixteen civil society figures of organizing mass protests in 2013 as part of an international conspiracy the request that the defendants receive sentences of aggravated life imprisonment has made their upcoming trial look like a politically motivated operation second the local elections on march 31 were marked by deviations from democratic rule the campaign was unfair the akp mhp coalition did not admit defeat in istanbul and victories by some hdp candidates were declared invalid the european parliament approved a resolution on march 13 recommending that the commission and the council of the european union in accordance with the negotiating framework formally suspend the accession negotiations with turkey one of the negative consequences of turkey s backsliding on the rule of law is that the eu council has extended the freeze on accession talks to the modernization of the eu turkey customs union apart from politics on the eu side turkey s rule of law situation linked to unconventional economic policies and the concentration of economic power in the hands of the president has created a distinct malaise in turkish and european business circles however it remains clear that the twenty three year old customs union has allowed a massive transformation of turkey s manufacturing industry the agreement has equally benefited eu industrialists by providing them with efficient and profitable production platforms especially in the automotive industry more generally the eu remains an indispensable partner for turkey in the fields of trade foreign direct investment and technology transfers this interdependence works both ways options for the european union the eu s policy on turkey is conditioned by the union s principled approach to the rule of law and by the lingering memory of heavy turkish interference in the domestic politics mostly of germany and the netherlands in 2017 ahead of turkey s constitutional referendum in april that year turkish ministers wanted to launch campaigns aimed at turks living in those countries berlin and the hague refused and as a result they faced extreme criticism from ankara the impact of the aggressive language used then at the highest level has never been erased and attempts to improve critical bilateral relationships such as the turkish presidential visit to france in january 2018 and state visit to germany in september 2018 have yielded no tangible benefits the european appetite for photo opportunities at summits and high level visits has dwindled and a policy of containment currently prevails in several european countries more broadly the evolution of the eu s political landscape has resulted in greater euroskeptic and turcoskeptic forces which does not bode well for a rapid improvement in the eu turkey relationship the fundamental difficulty in shaping the eu policy response to turkey involves designing a novel framework that balances a transactional approach with rules based engagement the risk is that in the absence of a positive dynamic on accession the relationship will become purely transactional that is already the case in many collaborative policy areas such as the 2016 refugee package under which the eu provides syrian refugees and their host communities in turkey with 6 billion 6 8 billion of aid or foreign policy dialogue given the absence of credible signals from ankara on a return to the rule of law in 2019 it is clear that a degree of transactionalism will inevitably be part of the future turkey eu relationship but the challenge will be whether ankara and brussels can still nurture some rules based order four areas of potential cooperation stand out the customs union counterterrorism visa liberalization and economic and political dialogue modernize the customs union at present the most realistic option for the rules based component of this relationship is the modernization of the eu turkey customs union with new technologies and vast increases in trade in services there is a need to upgrade this trade deal which was concluded more than two decades ago its modernization must involve not only the expansion of its scope to services and possibly agriculture but also horizontal areas such as the monitoring of state aid and more importantly a more functional dispute settlement mechanism the latter is important to resolve the ever larger number of disagreements over the functioning of the regime the key issue is whether turkey is willing to advance with modernizing the customs union despite the significant impact this could have on the country s political economy the aim to renew the customs union seems to have gained traction among both political and business circles in turkey upgrading the arrangement would certainly introduce a more rules based form of economic governance in contrast to the current erosion of institutional rule it would also introduce much needed transparency and fair competition provisions to enhance overall governance in short the modernization of the customs union is much more important for its indirect impact on turkey s governance than for its direct commercial effects the eu has yet to decide whether negotiations on deepening the customs union can start the european commission submitted a negotiations mandate to the council in december 2016 but so far the council has refused to approve the mandate on account of turkey s democratic backtracking as justified as this principled position is it is unclear what is formally required from turkey for the eu council to give the go ahead for the start of the negotiations a practical option would be for the eu to specify how a return to a decent level of the rule of law would help unblock the negotiations on a modernized customs union cooperate on counterterrorism despite differences in the two sides priorities it is likely that counterterrorism cooperation with turkey will remain high on the agendas of concerned eu member governments and the eu itself this is because despite a drastic weakening of the islamic state s military strength and land control the islamist insurgency is still active in syria and importantly includes among its members several hundred jihadists with eu passports some of these militants are in the custody of the ypg with the islamic state s recent territorial losses these eu citizens and other jihadists will likely try to head back to the eu via turkey they represent a threat to both turkey and their countries of origin a situation that warrants tighter cooperation yet while the eu priority is to fight the islamic state in syria requiring cooperation with the ypg and turkey ankara s chief aim is to combat the ypg on a different matter it is unlikely that european governments will consider ankara s hunt for presumed turkish members of the movement of self exiled turkish preacher fethullah gülen to be counterterrorism rather europeans see this as the continuation of a domestic feud between two former political allies liberalize visa rules in theory liberalizing visa regulations for turkish citizens traveling to eu countries should be one of the most beneficial improvements in the eu turkey relationship however such liberalization is based on rules including the conduct of turkey s antiterrorism policy for the time being no agreement seems possible on reforming turkey s antiterror law yet progress has been achieved on the more technical aspects of this complex negotiation such as turkey s introduction of biometric passports foster economic and political dialogues a number of eu turkey dialogues have made a modest beginning these have been in the fields of economic policy transportation energy and foreign policy with the objective of exchanging views and positions on more issues and projects of common interest these dialogues will probably continue or expand later in 2019 however their real significance is contingent on improvements in the rule of law in turkey and on significant convergence between ankara and brussels on foreign policy conclusion difficulties abound in the eu turkey relationship in the coming months domestic politics on both sides and the international environment will probably not help much the possibility of a complete standstill in the eu turkey relationship should not be underestimated if turkey squarely refuses to improve its rule of law situation for the sake of revamping the eu turkey customs union this would be a major reason for eu political circles to prolong the standstill ankara s artificial narrative to the effect that turkey has fulfilled all the criteria for accession does not help politically in addition political trends in several eu countries are not favorable to turkey as the campaign for the may 2019 european parliament elections is illustrating yet a sustained deterioration of the political economic and security relationship will run counter to both turkey s and the eu s interests even if populist and anti european statements continue to emerge from turkey s ruling parties the joint long term interests of turkey and the eu should prevail over short term political gains in both camps all stakeholders should therefore pursue with determination the search for realistic prospects for positive developments carnegie europe is grateful to the stiftung mercator for its generous support of this publication
by pete dolack may 03 2019 information clearing house telling you that donald trump lied or that the one percent continue to succeed in their incessant class warfare ranks in the astonishment department with being told the sun rose in the east this morning do we really need more evidence necessary or not more evidence continues to be delivered the latest delivery comes courtesy of the institute on taxation and economic policy which has found that 60 of the largest corporations in the united states paid no income taxes for 2018 despite earning a composite 79 billion in net income worse these companies actually received 4 3 billion in tax rebates had these companies paid taxes at the newly reduced corporate tax rate of 21 percent these companies would have paid 16 4 billion in taxes so we have a difference of more than 20 billion quite a nice return on their lobbying expenses and donations to the trump campaign heading the list is none other than amazon run by the world s richest person and recently extracting billions of dollars in subsidies in a sweepstakes in which cities across the united states competed to give away the most money amazon racked up 11 billion in profits last year and not only paid no taxes but received a rebate of 129 million a total of 26 companies including chevron delta air lines duke energy general motors molson coors and prudential financial reported net income of more than 1 billion while paying no taxes president trump claimed that his massive tax cuts for corporations would directly result in the average united states household getting an annual increase of 4 000 in wages that magical figure came from his own council of economic advisers which further claimed that the 4 000 was a conservative estimate the council went on to claim that the average u s household might see a raise of 9 000 tired of the lies and non stop propaganda get our free daily newsletter the web site factcheck org noting that the council never said how it arrived at these magical figures used old fashioned math to reveal the lack of reality here the site s analysis of the purported 9 000 raise concluded that would amount to a 1 1 trillion annual income gain from simply reducing a corporate tax burden that is currently only 297 billion still waiting for that extra 4 000 in your paycheck aren t you don t hold your breath wages actually fell two percent adjusted for inflation from december 2017 to december 2018 reports the economic policy institute but it would have been fruitless to wait for the promised largesse the communications workers of america made a gallant effort to get commitments for corporations to pass on the tax savings to their workers to no avail the center for public integrity reports corporations balked at saying tax cuts would lead to higher wages because they didn t want to be bound to a promise to increase pay a lobbyist for the companies said when the white house s council of economic advisers predicted hat a 20 percent corporate rate would hike average annual household income by 4 000 the communications workers of america a 700 000 member union asked eight major corporations to pledge to hike worker wages by 4 000 if they got the tax cut the companies didn t respond that shows you the difficulty they have and not only in messaging but also why people don t like them said one lobbyist who asked to remain anonymous so as to be able to speak freely this sort of class warfare is not new wages around the world have fallen far below productivity gains over the past three decades pay inequality has reached gigantic proportions and corporations have showered speculators with so much money that in some recent years the total of money paid to them in dividends and stock buybacks exceeded net income the trump administration however has intensified these trends worldwide financiers pocketed an astounding us 1 37 trillion in dividends for 2018 a total that has nearly doubled in less than a decade and is predicted to be even bigger in 2019 stock buybacks in the u s alone accounted for another 1 1 trillion last year putting their chief executive officer colleagues to shame the top 25 earners among hedge fund managers paid themselves a composite 15 4 billion in 2017 with four of them raking in more than 1 billion each in contrast six percent of the tax cuts given to corporations went to employees in increased wages and in bonuses while more than half went directly to stock holders the costs of poverty this ever mounting inequality has real costs for example almost 13 million children in the united states 20 percent of the country s children live in poverty the children s defense fund pulls no punches in assessing the cost of that poverty when we let millions of children grow up poor without basic necessities like food housing and health care we deny them equal opportunities to succeed in life and rob our nation of their future contributions poverty decreases a child s chances of graduating from high school and increases her chances of becoming a poor adult it makes her more likely to suffer illnesses and get caught in the criminal justice system beyond its human costs child poverty has huge economic costs our nation loses about 700 billion a year due to lost productivity and increased health and crime costs stemming from child poverty don t hold your breath waiting for the trump administration to address any of these problems far from the magic fountains of money pouring into your paycheck and reductions to the federal budget deficit the country s accumulated debt is rising fast the congressional budget office estimates an additional 1 9 trillion will be added to the u s government s budget deficit over the next 10 years thanks to a drastic decrease in corporate tax payments for the first six months of fiscal year 2019 which began with october 2018 corporate tax payments to the federal government declined 11 billion a fall of 13 percent compared to a year earlier according to the center for public integrity

earnings before interest finance costs income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda is considered a non gaap measure which may not be comparable with similar non gaap measures used by other entities adjusted ebitda is a non gaap measure please refer to the full reconciliation of these items in the adjusted ebitda section recurring revenue is comprised of revenue from the service and rental product lines which are typically contracted and extend into the future while the contracts are subject to cancellation or have varying lengths the company does not believe these characteristics preclude them from being considered recurring in nature engineered systems bookings and backlog are considered non gaap measures that do not have standardized meanings as prescribed by gaap and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures used by other entities the first quarter of 2019 benefitted from our record backlog at december 31 2018 with strong revenue and gross margin realized from projects secured in the second half of 2018 said j blair goertzen enerflex s president and chief executive officer in addition to our success with engineered systems we also saw improvements in both the service and rental product lines attributable to the company s strategy to increase recurring revenue despite lower bookings activity in this quarter the company s backlog remains strong at well over 1 billion and we continue to see a healthy bid pipeline for engineered systems enerflex will continue to monitor project and industry risks and activities across our diversified operations however with our backlog and an increasing demand for natural gas our near term outlook remains positive quarterly overview enerflex generated revenue of 485 million an increase of 99 million over the prior year driven by improved results across all product lines particularly engineered systems revenue which increased by 75 million on strength in the usa segment gross margin was 89 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 65 million in the same period of 2018 higher gross margin was the result of increased revenue and improved gross margin percentage the improved gross margin percentage is due to the realization of higher margin projects included in opening backlog and the continued contributions of the service and rental product lines partially offset by higher estimated costs to complete certain projects and write down of equipment in the row segment the prior year margins were negatively impacted by margin erosion and project delays ebit for the quarter was 33 million which represents an increase of 14 million over the comparative period this improvement is the result of higher gross margins partially offset by increased sg a costs on higher compensation resulting from mark to market impacts on share based compensation increased profit share on improved operational results and higher headcount recorded bookings of 118 million for three months ended march 31 2019 a decrease of 183 million from the same period last year based on the aggressive delivery windows for new prospects and the record level of backlog that enerflex had at the end of 2018 the company s ability to respond to some north american projects with delivery times that met the client s needs was limited by the company s fabrication and supply chain capacity the company has also seen delays in the timing of customer project approvals and a corresponding reduction in the conversion of opportunities which has impacted bookings during the first quarter and could impact bookings over the balance of the year the movement in exchange rates resulted in a decrease of 21 million on foreign currency denominated bookings during the first quarter of 2019 compared to a 12 million increase in the comparable period resulting in a 33 million period over period decrease backlog of 1 194 million decreased from 1 421 million at december 31 2018 due to engineered systems revenue recognized in the period outpacing bookings as well as unfavourable foreign exchange impacts on foreign currency denominated backlog the balance at march 31 2019 provides visibility for engineered systems revenue through 2019 and early 2020 the company invested 24 million in rental assets largely in the usa continuing the organic expansion of the usa contract compression fleet additionally the previously announced expansion of our houston fabrication facility is progressing on schedule with additional capacity to be fully operational in the second quarter of 2019 in march 2019 the company collected the 40 million u s dollars owing from oman oil company exploration and production llc oocep concluding this arbitration the amounts received from oocep were immediately used to repay debt the company repaid 95 million of debt in the quarter resulting in a bank adjusted net debt to ebitda ratio of 0 2 1 compared to a maximum ratio of 3 1 subsequent to march 31 2019 enerflex declared a quarterly dividend of 0 105 per share payable on july 4 2019 to shareholders of record on may 16 2019 first quarter results summary engineered systems revenue increased due to execution of the work from the company s record december 31 2018 backlog particularly in the usa segment service revenues have grown in all segments as a result of higher activity levels particularly in the usa and australia rental revenues increased due to the contributions of the contract compression fleet in the usa and build own operate maintain boom revenues in colombia gross margins increased due to higher revenue and improved gross margin percentage while sg a costs increased due to higher compensation costs partially offset by positive foreign exchange impacts first quarter segmented results usa usa segment revenue was 293 million an increase of 101 million from the same period in 2018 engineered systems revenue improved as a result of the realization of strong bookings seen in prior quarters and continued progress of certain large projects as well as the impact of the stronger u s dollar in 2019 versus the comparative period service revenues increased on higher

america ebit decreased by 1 million due to lower revenues for the segment and higher sg a costs partially offset by improved gross margin performance in the quarter when compared to the prior year gross margin for the quarter was negatively impacted by higher estimated costs to complete certain projects and write down of equipment while the first quarter of 2018 included some margin erosion and project delays for a large project sg a costs have increased from the prior year due to increased compensation on a larger workforce and mark to market impacts on share based compensation partially

weaker bookings seen in the first half of 2018 partially offset by higher service revenue due to increased parts sales ebit increased by 3 million due to higher gross margin on improved project margins while sg a costs were consistent with the comparable period in 2018 outlook the company s products and services remain dependent on strength and stability in commodity prices stability and improvement in commodity prices are required to allow customers to continue to increase investment which should translate to further demand for the company s products and services record bookings and backlog in the second half of 2018 provide visibility for engineered systems revenue through 2019 and early 2020 however enerflex has experienced lower bookings activity in the first quarter of 2019 as the company s ability to respond to some north american projects with delivery times that met the client s needs was limited by the company s fabrication and supply chain capacity we have also seen delays in the timing of customer project approvals and a corresponding reduction in the conversion of opportunities which impacted bookings during the first quarter and could impact bookings over the balance of the year the company expects quarterly bookings for the remainder of 2019 to trend closer to historical activity bidding activity for engineered systems remains strong particularly in the usa and the company continues to see interest for rentals and boom solutions in the usa and row segments enerflex s financial performance continues to benefit from strategic decisions to diversify product offerings for engineered systems to focus on increasing the recurring revenue streams derived from new and existing long term boom rental and service contracts and to develop a geographically diversified business in the near term enerflex has a positive outlook supported by continued strength in our backlog and high enquiry levels across all regions in the longer term the company continues to monitor the impacts of volatility in realized commodity prices political uncertainty and egress issues in the permian as well as the lack of consistent access to market causing unpredictable pricing differentials in canada while recent liquefied natural gas lng project approval has offered some future relief to the canadian gas industry management still expects activity in canada to be largely subdued through 2019 enerflex continues to assess the effects of these contributing factors and the corresponding impact on our customers activity levels which will drive the demand for the

justin s note the left has a new obsession modern monetary theory mmt mmt is an economic theory which essentially argues that the u s government wouldn t need to collect taxes or borrow money to finance spending it could simply print more money if necessary now this concept isn t new it s been around for decades but its popularity has skyrocketed thanks to endorsements from democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders and congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez aoc the new rising star of the democratic party this new breed of socialist democrats has embraced mmt because it would make all their crazy ideas possible the national debt deficits and inflation concerns would no longer stand in the way of projects like the green new deal or universal healthcare housing education in short mmt would give the government a green light to spend money even more recklessly than it does now that s a problem right on the money casey doug best price 7 46 buy new 13 68 as of 07 45 utc details so i got doug casey on the phone to discuss this matter at length justin doug what do you make of modern monetary theory would this economic framework help or hurt the u s economy doug mmt centers around the notion that the economy in general and money in particular should be the creatures of the state it s not a new idea the meme has been around in one form or another since at least the days of marx mmt basically posits that the wise and incorruptible solons in government should create as much currency as they think is needed spend it in areas they like and solve any problems that occur with more laws and regulations it s nothing new just a more radical version of the economic fascism that s dominated the u s since at least the days of the new deal it s just another name for an old and very stupid set of economic ideas by stupid i mean showing an inability to predict the indirect and delayed consequences of actions politicians are now talking about the supposed benefits of mmt pseudo economists are doing their abstruse and incomprehensible mathematical computations about how it might affect the economy the public will easily be convinced they ll get something for nothing but what we should be talking about here is moral principle it s not a question of whether mmt will work or not work it won t it will work about as well as the economic policies of venezuela and zimbabwe or argentina where i am at the moment these schemes have never worked in all of history they result in a vastly lower standard of living along with social strife mmt is about radically increased government control the argument shouldn t be over whether mmt will work or not the argument should be about whether it s moral and proper for people in the government whether elected or appointed to print money to change the economy into something that suits them better justin it s obvious that you find mmt like other interventionist economic theories to be immoral why is that doug money represents the hours of your life that you spent earning it that s the basic principle here it represents concentrated life all the things you want to have and do for yourself and provide for others in the future when these people destroy the value of money they re destroying part of your life inflation isn t caused by greedy butchers bakers and gasoline makers it s caused by an excess of purchasing media mmt will give the state total control of its quantity and quality if the government increases the money supply by say 10 times general prices will go up by 10 times the value of your dollar savings will drop 90 perhaps most americans won t care because they have no savings just debt in any event some people will get hold of a lot more of that 10x increase than others and they ll get hold of it earlier before prices really take off who inevitably cronies look absolutely every government intrusion into the economy whether it s taxes or regulations or inflation always benefits the people in and around the government and damages society as a whole but they re sold to the voters to the hoi polloi to the head count as something that will put them on easy street which is a lie of course but that s not what the argument should be about the average guy doesn t understand economics he doesn t think he feels furthermore nobody talks about whether cockamamie ideas like mmt are morally right or wrong instead they have pointless and ridiculous arguments about whether it works or not well it doesn t work but that s a distraction this matter is essentially a moral question not a technical question does somebody in government have a right to determine your economic destiny or not the fact that alexandria ocasio cortez an ambitious terminally ignorant morally crippled 29 year old puerto rican bartender is setting the tone for this whole discussion tells you how degraded the u s has become it s well on its way to turning into a giant welfare and police state but as you know i always look on the bright side which is that if you give yourself a little psychological distance this is all a comedy aoc the donald bolton bernie sanders pocahontas hillary kamala etc etc they re all dangerous megalomaniacs but the chimpanzees listen to them choose teams hang on to their every word support them and are easily incited to hoot and pant at each other the american public is going to get exactly what it deserves i have no sympathy for them or about as much as i would have had for the romans in the fifth century when the empire was collapsing justin doug you re correct to point out that aoc has endorsed mmt stephanie kelton bernie sanders economic advisor during his last presidential run is also a proponent of mmt so this idea is gaining traction with democrats of course neither the white house nor congress dictates monetary policy that s the fed s job and current fed chair jerome powell has already come out and called mmt wrong former treasury secretary larry summers also recently called mmt grotesque that said what are the chances mmt or some version of it gets implemented doug interesting it may be the first thing summers has ever been right about in his whole life as for powell he s a non entity a lifelong bureaucrat plucked from obscurity for god knows what reason by the donald trump has bizarrely bad judgment in the people he surrounds himself with from that silly woman who was on the apprentice with him to his lawyer cohen to jared and ivanka bolton it s like he goes out to the highways and the byways to round up the lame the halt and the philosophically blind regardless of his rhetoric he s very partial to warmongers and deep state types but back to mmt the chances of mmt being implemented are extremely high it will almost certainly happen at least after the next election for several reasons one the government is now running a deficit of roughly 100 billion a month that will soon be 200 billion they ll be desperate for more revenue which mmt will give them second with demographics the youth and non white voters as they are the democrats will get a lot more traction in 2020 third the u s will be in the midst of a gigantic crisis it will be blamed on trump regardless of how much of it s his fault there are a number of other reasons the democrats will win but that s a subject for another conversation they re going to try every cockamamie idea they can to keep the ball rolling lots more controls of all types more debt more inflation mmt is just going to be part of it i don t doubt they ll try for a constitutional convention it s going to be a desperate situation ending in a catastrophe not in the distant future but the near future we re on the cusp of the greater depression i know i ve been saying this for years but the idea of america has gradually degraded since about the time of teddy roosevelt and the original progressives then faster with world war i faster yet with the new deal faster yet with world war ii the great society the nixon devaluation the reagan deficits the war on drugs the war on terror the only good news and it s super good news is that science and technology have advanced as well that s maintained the general standard of living unfortunately the state always gets first dibs on tech developments and uses them against society this long term trend is now going hyperbolic the next big example of this is the social credit system being implemented in china and soon everywhere else it s a pity that philosophy and morality have meanwhile only advanced at a snail s pace in fact they ve been going backward it s a very dangerous situation when we re talking about nuclear and even more advanced weapons the bottom line you can practically plan your life around their grasping the straw of mmt justin doug i know you object to mmt on moral grounds but let s face it most people don t see monetary policy this way they believe the fed should play a role in guiding the economy whether it s through setting interest rates or adjusting the money supply could you tell me why mmt would be better or worse than the current economic framework that the fed employs doug yes abolish the fed and the system of fractional reserve banking reduce the size of the u s government by about 90 default on the national debt so that future generations of americans aren t made into serfs there are a number of things but the chances of a change in the long term trend at this point are approximately zero put it this way the chances are slim and none and slim s out of town justin doug proponents of mmt say it would work because of the u s dollar s status as the world s reserve currency basically they argue that the u s borrows in its own currency therefore it can t go bankrupt because it can just print more dollars when it needs to what s wrong with this thinking doug the u s dollar isn t going to remain king forever it s in the process of being dethroned as we speak the chinese the russians and basically every other major economic power on the planet want to get rid of dollars they realize dollars are the unbacked liability of a bankrupt government even at this point they don t like having to use the dollar every time that they want to transfer assets they don t like the fact that everything they buy and sell in dollars has to be cleared through new york and is monitored by the u s government their enemy they understand how foolish it is to keep sending real goods to the u s in return for paper dollars printed in unlimited amounts totally incorrect volu doug casey best price 1 48 buy new 8 85 as of 02 30 utc details i suspect the rest of the world believe it or not is going back to gold simply because a trustworthy money is needed they don t trust each other s currencies any more than the dollar at this point the question from a practical point of view is what should you do with your money you should own a lot of physical gold and silver keep a lot of it outside your home country at some point within the lifetime of most people reading this right now the dollar will lose all its value it s really serious of course i ve been predicting gloom and doom for many years it s happened in slow motion not an instantaneous catastrophe we ll see what happens as we enter the trailing edge of the storm likely later this year justin

a central bank s words have power three of them whatever it takes calmed the euro area s debt panic in 2012 another few the federal reserve mulling a step down in our pace of purchases started the taper tantrum that upset emerging markets in 2013 listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element what is left unsaid can also be powerful after its interest rate meeting on april 25th turkey s central bank failed to repeat eight words that had been included in each of its seven previous statements if needed further monetary tightening will be delivered the omission cast doubt on its commitment to fight inflation which was almost 20 in the year to march in response the lira fell by more than 1 against the dollar it has fallen by 11 this year the mishap was an uncomfortable reminder of last summer s currency turmoil when the central bank browbeaten by recep tayyip erdogan turkey s president failed to raise interest rates swiftly enough to prevent a collapse in the currency but the parallels should not obscure what has changed in the interim turkey s economy is better balanced now than it was then in september the central bank reasserted itself increasing interest rates to 24 where they have stayed since the combination of tighter money and a cheaper currency curbed import spending and encouraged exports as a result turkey s current account deficit has narrowed far more swiftly than even the government had envisaged although its import bill is hardly the only claim on its foreign earnings its banks and firms must also service heavy external debts the lira was relatively stable from december to february local elections in march were supposed to bring a similar stability to politics concluding a maddening cycle in which turks marched to the polls seven times in five years instead the weeks before and since have done the opposite unsettling both turkey s politics and the markets mr erdogan s party which lost in most of the country s big cities has so far refused to accept its narrow defeat in the istanbul mayoral contest citing alleged irregularities it has asked for a new vote that would trigger yet more political turmoil which could bring protesters onto the streets and send foreign capital running for the exit investors distinguish clearly between countries that do and do not have free and peaceful elections says ibrahim turhan a former chair of the istanbul stock exchange no one would like to see turkey in the second group in the month before the elections mr erdogan encouraged state banks to increase the amount they lent at cheap rates banks also came under pressure to lower lira deposit rates making other currencies more attractive by comparison turkish residents now hold over half of their deposits in dollars and other hard currencies none of this has helped the lira on march 21st the central bank revealed it had burned through 6 3bn over 18 of its net reserves in a fortnight presumably in an undeclared effort to prop up the lira after the news spooked investors the government squeezed the offshore lira market making it harder for foreign speculators to borrow the currency in order to sell it but the squeeze also posed a problem for turkey s banks points out brad setser of the council on foreign relations an american think tank because they depend on lira funding in the overseas market to ease their discomfort the authorities made it easier for banks to swap their dollars for lira from the central bank that had the effect of temporarily bolstering the central bank s dollar reserves until the currencies are swapped back again as the financial markets cottoned on to what was happening investors began to distrust the central bank s weekly reserves figures was it trying to mislead investors probably not as required by imf standards it duly reported the swaps in its monthly reserves statement which is published with a 30 day lag and in a press conference on april 30th it explained the source of its sudden dollar infusion but although it clarified why its reserves had abruptly gone up it did not reveal why they had suddenly gone down in the weeks before judging by the financial markets reaction the conference did little to bolster investors faith in the lira the words of central banks can be powerful but although they choose what to say markets decide what to hear

usd jpy remained in range in a rough week that included the fed and the nfp fed speakers and inflation data stand out the technical picture is more balanced for the pair and experts in the poll see sideways movement in the short term what just happened not so dovish fed the us dollar was on the back foot early in the week but the federal reserve turned things in favor of the greenback the fed s preferred measure of inflation core pce disappointed with a deceleration to 1 6 yoy together with a fall in the ism manufacturing pmi and its inflation component markets expected the fed to highlight low inflation and a hint of an upcoming rate cut however the fed and its chair jerome powell preached patience once again the central bank is no hurry to raise interest rates but it found many reasons to be cheerful from a booming labor market through encouraging growth figures to an uptick in global growth most importantly powell described low inflation as transitory expressing confidence that it will rise back to target the greenback shot higher and gradually extended its gains the currency was also buoyed by expectations for elevated gains in employment stemming from a robust increase of 275k in the adp nfp the indicative figure from adp was largely correct the official non farm payrolls came out at 263k an impressive increase in positions wage growth came out a bit below expectations with 0 2 mom and 3 2 yoy limiting the us dollar s gains nevertheless it is more than good enough for the fed see nfp quick analysis the fed was right and the usd can continue climbing the us sino trade talks continued with further high level discussions both sides remain optimistic and seem ready to make concessions some media outlets suggested an agreement will come as early as the upcoming week but it will probably make more time movements related to the japanese yen played second fiddle with no substantial japanese figures on the docket the worsening political crisis in venezuela had a small positive impact on oil prices and a negligible effect on the safe haven japanese yen us events cpi in focus the upcoming week is not as busy but ends with the fresh inflation figures powell s assertion that low inflation in the first quarter was transitory will come to a test with the consumer price index numbers for april the first month of q2 expectations stand at a small acceleration in the critical core cpi yoy number from 2 to 2 1 headline cpi is also projected to hit 2 1 yoy deviations in monthly numbers will come to the spotlight if the yearly numbers hit expectations producer prices released on thursday will serve as a warm up to the cpi data fed officials are scheduled to speak during the week and may provide their insights on the recent decision and the inflow of data here are the top us events as they appear on the forex calendar japan trade talks and the boj s minutes the japanese yen will continue moving mostly on the market sentiment and the main theme is trade negotiations between robert lighthizer and steven mnuchin on the american side and liu he on the chinese one continue the prevailing optimism needs to turn into substance with a deal or at a minimum a summit between the presidents the yen may be sold off on a breakthrough and could gain if talks turn sour turning to events in the land of the rising sun the bank of japan s meeting minutes stand out early in the week the document will likely reflect the boj s quixotic struggle to push inflation higher reflected in its ultra loose monetary policy here are the events lined up in japan usd jpy technical analysis dollar yen continues trading within the narrowing limits of the wedge thick black lines on the chart the currency pair will eventually need to decide if it breaks above the

emi nakamura a uc berkeley economist is this year s recipient of the prestigious john bates clark medal widely viewed as second only in prestige to the nobel prize in economic sciences the annual award announced by the american economic association is given to an american economist under age 40 who is judged to have made the most significant contribution to economic thought and knowledge she is the fourth woman to win the medal since its inception in 1947 learning she d won the award was an amazing moment quite overwhelming says nakamura 38 a chancellor s professor of economics at berkeley who joined the faculty last summer at a celebration for her this week alan auerbach chair of the department of economics reminded colleagues of what he d predicted for her when she first arrived on campus i told her berkeley would be a very productive place for her and look what s happened he quipped we timed it very well in addition to receiving the john bates clark medal nakamura was elected last month to the american academy of arts and sciences and was chosen last december by the economist as one of the decade s eight best young economists new methods for big questions nakamura says her work seeks to expand the types of data and empirical methods used in macroeconomics to answer big questions like what causes recessions and to measure the effects of monetary and fiscal policy on the economy for obvious reasons we don t get to run actual experiments in macroeconomics by say raising and lowering interest rates to measure their effects on the economy she explains but it is increasingly possible to study the microdata that underlie widely used macroeconomic statistics such as inflation and the gross domestic product which opens up the possibility of using methods that couldn t be used in macroeconomics before auerbach says nakamura uses very detailed data sets looking beneath the hood a lot more looking under a microscope at a low level of aggregations at individual firms and individual products and that requires a lot more work than just taking data from the bureau of economic analysis and analyzing it an important idea in economics says nakamura is to use natural experiments to study the effects of economic policy one of her most influential papers shows the effects of fiscal stimulus using data on u s military build ups and drawdowns in different states she found that an extra dollar of spending increases output by 1 50 in its announcement the american economic association noted that this paper provides an excellent example of work that combines non structural empirical work with careful model based analysis economics professor benjamin hermalin vice provost for the faculty says emi s work on price setting has had a major effect on our understanding and ongoing study of why prices are inflexible in the short run and the consequences thereof for the economy her work on monetary policy is of great importance to thinking about the role of central banks in the economy and her work on fiscal policy has provided some of the most convincing analyses to date on the effects of fiscal policy on the economy additionally says hermalin nakamura s prize definitely spills over to the economics department and will make berkeley more attractive to potential graduate students and other economists we wish to recruit she s also bringing her new approach to macroeconomic research into the classroom currently nakamura is teaching a graduate course in empirical macroeconomic methods and running a lunchtime seminar where ph d students can present their dissertation research in an informal setting next fall she ll be teaching a large undergraduate course for economics majors about the theory and the empirics of macroeconomic policy a leader in an increasingly data intensive field much of nakamura s research is on monetary policy s effect on the economy her most highly cited work studies price rigidity the fact that prices often remain unchanged for long periods of time as opposed to responding to macroeconomic developments most macroeconomists think this is at the core of why monetary policy affects the economy nakamura says recently she constructed new data on price behavior going back to the double digit inflation era of the 1970s to study how price adjustment differed in that era she found that prices became substantially more responsive as inflation rose another strand of nakamura s work on monetary policy makes use of minute by minute data to assess the effects of monetary policy zooming in on what happens precisely at the time of the fed announcement allows us to isolate the effects of the fed announcement itself from the economic forces that caused the fed to lower interest rates she says isolating the effect of monetary policy from its cause is the central empirical challenge facing researchers trying to measure these effects she found that the federal reserve affects the economy not only through the conventional channel of making borrowing more expensive but through the unconventional channel of making people more or less optimistic about the economic environment nakamura s co author on much of her work is jón steinsson also a chancellor s professor of economics at berkeley at 42 steinsson was not eligible for the john bates clark medal he and nakamura are married and have two small children jón and i are both celebrating this award says nakamura which is clearly an award for our joint research with the field of economics becoming more data intensive she says i see this award not only as a recognition of the specific work we have done but also as a recognition of the growth of applied research in macroeconomics using new sources of data and empirical methods and combining them with macroeconomic models nakamura is the third current faculty member in the economics department to win the john bates clark medal david card won in 1995 and emmanuel saez in 2009

million loss of 0 05 per unit compared to net income of 209 million 0 42 per unit in the prior year net income for the period benefited from higher earnings across the majority of our operations and contributions from capital expenditures and new investments made in the past 12 months the prior year results included a gain of 209 million net of tax recorded in the comparative period relating to the sale of our chilean electricity transmission business our business generated ffo of 351 million for the quarter or 0 88 of ffo per unit representing a 4 increase over the prior year results for the quarter reflect strong performance by each one of our operating segments delivering organic growth in excess of our annual target range of 6 9 current period results also benefited from contributions from recently acquired businesses partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange brookfield infrastructure had a strong start to 2019 delivering 10 organic growth we also invested 430 million into two previously announced transactions and progressed the integration of recently acquired assets said sam pollock chief executive officer of brookfield infrastructure as we advance a number of asset sales we will seek to replicate our recent capital recycling success to create further long term unitholder value segment performance the utilities segment contributed ffo of 137 million compared to 169 million in the prior year underlying performance was strong as our operating groups were able to grow results by 5 on a same store basis over the prior year this was predominantly driven by inflationary increases to our rate base combined with another strong quarter at our u k regulated distribution business these positive contributions were offset by us having less capital invested following the sale of our chilean electricity transmission business in march of last year higher interest expense associated with a financing completed at our brazilian regulated gas transmission operation and a 9 million impact from foreign exchange ffo from our transport segment was 139 million for the quarter in line with prior year results the segment benefited from organic growth of 6 driven by higher tariff and traffic levels across our global toll road portfolio strong volumes at our container terminals and higher revenues at our australian rail operations these positive contributions were partially offset by the previously announced sale of a 33 interest in our chilean toll road operation that closed in february and the expiry of one of the state concessions at our brazilian toll road business ffo for this segment was also reduced by 4 million as a result of foreign exchange primarily the result of a decline in the brazilian real the energy segment contributed ffo of 107 million which represents a 62 improvement from the prior year this step change increase is attributable to organic growth and contributions from two recently acquired north american businesses our north american natural gas transmission business delivered another strong quarter generating ffo that was 23 higher versus the prior year results for this business are benefiting from robust demand for transport services and contributions from the first phase of its gulf coast expansion project at our gas storage operations ffo was 43 above last year as the business earned higher spreads related to cold weather conditions ffo for the data infrastructure segment was 28 million up from 19 million last year recent investments in our global data center portfolio contributed ffo of 7 million for the quarter ffo from our french telecommunications infrastructure business grew by 13 due to inflationary increases and new points of presence added to our tower

million loss of 0 05 per unit compared to net income of 209 million 0 42 per unit in the prior year net income for the period benefited from higher earnings across the majority of our operations and contributions from capital expenditures and new investments made in the past 12 months the prior year results included a gain of 209 million net of tax recorded in the comparative period relating to the sale of our chilean electricity transmission business our business generated ffo of 351 million for the quarter or 0 88 of ffo per unit representing a 4 increase over the prior year results for the quarter reflect strong performance by each one of our operating segments delivering organic growth in excess of our annual target range of 6 9 current period results also benefited from contributions from recently acquired businesses partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange brookfield infrastructure had a strong start to 2019 delivering 10 organic growth we also invested 430 million into two previously announced transactions and progressed the integration of recently acquired assets said sam pollock chief executive officer of brookfield infrastructure as we advance a number of asset sales we will seek to replicate our recent capital recycling success to create further long term unitholder value segment performance the utilities segment contributed ffo of 137 million compared to 169 million in the prior year underlying performance was strong as our operating groups were able to grow results by 5 on a same store basis over the prior year this was predominantly driven by inflationary increases to our rate base combined with another strong quarter at our u k regulated distribution business these positive contributions were offset by us having less capital invested following the sale of our chilean electricity transmission business in march of last year higher interest expense associated with a financing completed at our brazilian regulated gas transmission operation and a 9 million impact from foreign exchange ffo from our transport segment was 139 million for the quarter in line with prior year results the segment benefited from organic growth of 6 driven by higher tariff and traffic levels across our global toll road portfolio strong volumes at our container terminals and higher revenues at our australian rail operations these positive contributions were partially offset by the previously announced sale of a 33 interest in our chilean toll road operation that closed in february and the expiry of one of the state concessions at our brazilian toll road business ffo for this segment was also reduced by 4 million as a result of foreign exchange primarily the result of a decline in the brazilian real the energy segment contributed ffo of 107 million which represents a 62 improvement from the prior year this step change increase is attributable to organic growth and contributions from two recently acquired north american businesses our north american natural gas transmission business delivered another strong quarter generating ffo that was 23 higher versus the prior year results for this business are benefiting from robust demand for transport services and contributions from the first phase of its gulf coast expansion project at our gas storage operations ffo was 43 above last year as the business earned higher spreads related to cold weather conditions ffo for the data infrastructure segment was 28 million up from 19 million last year recent investments in our global data center portfolio contributed ffo of 7 million for the quarter ffo from our french telecommunications infrastructure business grew by 13 due to inflationary increases and new points of presence added to our tower

smooth transition this is especially bitter sweet for me as linda and i have been a team since she began her tenure as cfo in early may 2014 when i moved from the cfo position to ceo but her family is growing and in addition to her two beautiful grandsons you met in a presentation at our investor day last december her son and daughter in law in california are expecting her first granddaughter in

8 cagr our annual dividend have increased at 10 1 cagr and our stock price has risen from 46 22 on may 1 2014 to 107 10 at yesterday s closing i m reminded of an executive team meeting in 2014 when we ask each person for his or her top aspirational goals for american water literally linda said for our stock to go over 100 per share linda we did it linda also oversaw the raising of 4 4 billion of financing capital over the past five years she rebuilt our tax and risk management functions with industry leading talent and she has led significant improvements in our supply chain processes she also designed and developed the financial strategy and planning organization and she has recently set a digital finance within her organization one of the first in the utility industry she has also

she takes the cfo rank from linda on july 1 she s actually here in the room with us today linda would you like to say a few words linda sullivan chief financial officer yes and thank you susan for your very kind words and your inspirational leadership i have learned more from you in the last five years than in my entire career and i thank you immensely my husband and i took the road less traveled when we moved from california to new jersey five years ago and being part of the american water team turned out to be the best career decision of my life and i would not trade this experience for anything in the world and to our analysts and investors i want you to know that one of my favorite things to do is to meet with you and discuss the american water story and listen to your insights and views you were truly the grand teachers and thought leaders of our industry it has been an absolute pleasure learning from all of you so now after 30 years in the utility industry this decision to retire is the hardest career decision i have made and at the same time the easiest personal decision for me and my family it s hard because i love everything about american water the leadership team my colleagues my team the board and our collective ability to do what we say we re going to do i believe american water is the best run utility in the nation and with our announcement today bringing susan hardwick on board i am confident it will continue to be just that personally this is an easy decision for me my coast to coast family is rapidly expanding with two grandsons and a granddaughter due in june and i m fortunate in this stage of life to be able to follow that strong pull of my heart and it s really hard to explain the way grandchildren make you feel but there is a song lyric and it s by andy grammar that s sums it up pretty well it says i think i finally found my hallelujah so i also love the work i do on several boards and am eager to spend more time pursuing that passion plus my bucket size is approaching the size of a novel and my husband tom and i look forward to living those dreams i would like to thank the leadership team and board for being so understanding and gracious about my decisions and working with me through a strong succession plan i m thrilled to have susan hardwick join the team she will bring tremendous value to american water susan story president and chief executive officer thanks linda as always linda will cover our financial results in just a few minutes unfortunately our coo walter lynch is in arkansas due to the passing of his father in law alex street many of you know that walter is a west point graduate and an army veteran and mr street also served our country in the army at 80 years old he was still a practicing attorney after more than 50 years we applaud his life commitment to his family and the values we hold dear at american water integrity service and unwavering commitment to his community and country so now moving onto our first quarter results the employees of american water delivered solid performance and further strengthened our low risk and predictable growth story our first quarter 2019 adjusted earnings per share were up 3 4 compared to the first quarter of 2018 as a reminder we had an extraordinary first quarter of 2018 with a 13 5 eps increase from the previous year primarily due to the impact of finalizing both the pennsylvania and the missouri general rate cases in 2018 which linda will discuss in more detail while american water does not give quarterly guidance our first quarter results were 0 01 ahead of plan for the quarter given our performance year to date we are affirming our 2019 adjusted eps guidance of 3 54 to 3 64 per share as well as affirming guidance to the top half of our 7 to 10 eps compound annual growth rate through 2023 also consistent with our previous dividend guidance on april 17 our board of directors increased our quarterly cash dividend payment from 0 455 to 0 50 per share a 9 9 increase the company has increased its dividend every year since our ipo in april of 2008 with consistent annual increases of around 10 per year since 2013 the foundation for our earnings growth continues to be the capital investment we make in our regulated operations so that we can provide clean safe and reliable service we invested 337 million total this quarter with a majority for infrastructure improvements in our regulated businesses we minimized the customer bill impacts of these investments through a continued focus on controlling o m cost these cost savings are driven by optimizing capital spend through value engineering and volume procurement constructive regulatory mechanisms and deploying technology developed with input from both our employees and our customers i ll talk more on the next slide about our continuing progress on regulated acquisitions and their contributions to our long term growth story earnings were up year over year in our market based businesses this was due primarily to growth customer contracts from homeowner services of note we have a very successful new partnerships with philadelphia where we have added more than 100 000 contracts since we launched the partnership in october of 2018 that type of growth would not be possible without our exceptional customer service and our combined homeowner services has an a rating from the better business bureau our military services group added the wright patterson air force base contract in 2018 and we begin full operations at fort leonard wood army base yesterday may 1 we still expect to see decisions by the department of defense on up to three military base awards for which we are competing this year turning to slide 8 let s talk more about growth across our regulated footprints we have closed on five acquisitions in four different states so far in 2019 three of these were water systems in kentucky indiana and missouri and two were wastewater acquisitions in kentucky and pennsylvania these closed acquisitions resulted in 4 700 new customer connections and they join more than 3 000 customer connections we added through organic growth in the first quarter we also look forward to adding another 61 500 customer connections through signed agreements in nine states most of which we expect to close in 2019 this includes our most recent agreement to acquire east pasadena water company in california adding 2 900 new connections just as a reminder typically a customer connection or meter represents on average 2 5 to 3 people based on the specific state at american water we believe that all people should have clean and safe water at affordable prices regardless of where they live or their socioeconomic status these new agreements reflect our commitment to provide water and wastewater solutions to communities across the united states moving to slide 9 customers remain at the center of every decision we make today and into the future this means smart investments balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment as we make these critical investments to maintain reliable service we must also ensure affordability for our customers we do this by putting a laser focus on both o m efficiency as well as capital investment efficiency this is why our 31 5 o m efficiency goal by 2023 is so important as a reminder this ratio represents how many cents of o m we spend for every dollar of revenue meaning we want more dollars to go to investment so we can make our system safer stronger and more reliable our employees live in the communities we serve and they re committed to serving their neighbors and families with the best quality of water and water services at affordable prices let me give you just one example of how we re driving further efficiencies we are finding that due to a growing national shortage of trucking personnel the prices of materials and equipment are rising and scheduling has become more challenging so we developed a supply chain strategy to continue to diversify and optimize our suppliers and their willingness to locate closer distribution points so their states operations are more cost effective when we roll these savings into other cost efficiencies we get by leveraging our large size and purchasing power we will save approximately 33 million a year just on the purchases of meters hydrants valves and pipes slide 10 summarizes many points i just covered again we re affirming our 2019 eps guidance range of 3 54 to 3 64 as well as affirming guidance to the top half of our 7 to 10 eps compound annual growth through 2023 we are off to a good start this year and we look forward to continuing to deliver stable and predictable results and with that i ll turn it over to linda for her comments linda sullivan chief financial officer thank you susan i ll start on slide 12 we had a solid first quarter of 2019 especially compared to a very strong first quarter 2018 gaap earnings were 0 62 per share an increase of 0 03 compared to the first quarter last year included in gaap earnings was a favorable adjustment of 4 million or 0 01 per share to reflect a reduction in the settlement liability related to the freedom industries chemical spill this reduction is based on our latest determination of the final claims costs in total our share of the original 126 million freedom industries related settlement has been reduced to 19 million through insurance recoveries and lower claims excluding this benefit first quarter earnings were up 3 4 which came in 0 01 above our plan our strong market based earnings offset partially by timing items in the regulated business in parent other highlights include achieving a consolidated adjusted return on equity of 10 for the 12 month period ended first quarter 2019 executing on our capital investment strategy by investing 337 million during the quarter and adding 36 million in annualized new authorized revenue since the beginning of this year turning to slide 13 let me provide more detail on our first quarter adjusted earnings results i ll start on the left hand side of this page as you can see we had a very strong first quarter of 2018 up 13 5 over first quarter 2017 on settlement of both the pennsylvania and missouri general rate cases last year first quarter 2019 increased 3 4 on a quarter over quarter basis which reflects some timing impacts that i will discuss in more detail as i cover each business let me start with our regulated businesses which were up 0 01 per share revenue was up 0 08 in total and included increases from authorized rate cases infrastructure mechanisms and acquisitions these increases were partially offset by lower demand and a 0 02 benefit in the first quarter of last year as our missouri general rate case did not begin to adjust customer rates for the lower federal income tax rate until may 28 2018 lastly i should note we did not see any material impact from weather during the first quarter of 2019 next we had higher o m expense of 0 01 per share from something we are very proud of for finalization of our union negotiated national benefits agreement last year we now include our 17 national unions in our annual performance plans this puts our 7 100 employees on the same annual performance plan where the annual payout is based on company performance tied to the goals you see in our proxy statement so from our ceo to the front line our goals are aligned we believe this investment in our employees will further enable us to meet our o m efficiency goals allowing us to reduce the customer bill impact at our critically needed infrastructure investments depreciation and interest expense were each up 0 03 per share to support investment growth our market based businesses had a strong quarter up 0 04 or 57 with homeowner services up 0 03 from the acquisition of pivotal and new customer additions military services was up a 0 01 from the addition of wright patterson air force base and an increase in capital work at vandenberg lastly the parent decreased 0 03 from three separate items each 0 01 per share first we had higher interest expense to support growth next we had a tax adjustment that was favorable in 2018 and we also had 0 01 of expense timing turning to slide 14 i will provide an update on our regulatory proceedings we settled two rate cases in the first quarter of 2019 in west virginia and maryland and implemented our three year rate increase under our four year plan in new york effective april 1 in west virginia we received approval of our of an annualized revenue increase of 19 million an roe of 9 75 and an increased equity ratio to a 48 4 the case was driven by 200 million of infrastructure investment since our last rate case in 2016 additionally the distribution system improvement charge was reset to provide for additional investment this surcharge will be offset by the amortization of deferred tax savings under the tax cuts and jobs act in maryland we received approval of an annualized revenue increase of over 1 million an estimated roe of 9 9 and an equity ratio of 48 7 the case was driven by 18 million of investments since 2015 during that time the company constructed a new 90 million gallon reservoir and intake near bel air maryland this new reservoir is now in service and provides a long term safe and reliable water supply and economic opportunity in that region we also have three pending rate cases in indiana virginia and kentucky and filed our preliminary application for our california general rate case in indiana we reached an agreement on the with the major parties on our rate case if approved the new rates will reflect a revenue increase of 7 5 million 17 5 million over two steps an roe of 9 8 and an equity ratio of 53 4 the settlement shows that at the end of the 2020 future test year indiana american water will have invested over 500 million in infrastructure upgrades since its last rate case in 2015 regarding the tax cuts and jobs act indiana american water already reduced its customer rates by 4 4 on august 1 2018 and the agreement includes credit for the period before august 1 to be spread to customers over 12 months starting in may 2020 a final order is expected by mid 2019 moving to virginia we implemented interim water and wastewater rates on may 1 the general rate case requested an overall increase of 5 million driven by approximately 98 million in infrastructure upgrades since april of 2017 the final rate order could take several months in kentucky our general rate case requested nearly 20 million in additional annualized revenues and was driven by more than 100 million in capital investment since the last rate case in 2016 and yesterday california american water filed a preliminary application for its 2021 through 2023 general rate case that includes a first year revenue increase of 23 9 million followed by annual step increases that would support 200 million of infrastructure projects california is also awaiting a decision on its step increase for 2019 turning to slide 15 today we are affirming our 2019 adjusted earnings guidance range of 3 54 to 3 64 per share this excludes the 0 01 favorable impact from the reduction of the liability associated with our freedom industries related settlement which is included in our 2019 gaap earnings guidance range included in our annual guidance range are several variables with the most significant potential variable being the impact of weather and as a reminder we consider plus or minus 0 06 of weather to be normal weather variability included in our earnings guidance range with the largest weather impact typically occurring in the summer months or third quarter of each year on a long term basis we are affirming our 2019 to 2023 long term eps guidance in the top half of our 7 to 10 compound annual growth range anchored off 2017 adjusted earnings turning to slide 16 let me discuss our balance sheet as we look at our cash flow impact from tax reform originally we expected lower cash flow of about 500 million from 2018 through 2022 this has improved by 120 million following the pivotal acquisition you can see that the estimated impact is largest in 2020 when we expect to become a cash taxpayer but then declines quickly as rate base grows and becomes positive by 2022 also as we continue to refine our estimates we are now forecasting becoming a cash taxpayer in the second half of 2020 versus our prior estimate at a full year in 2020 now the actual impact will be largely dependent upon the outcome of our regulatory proceedings regarding tax reform also i am pleased to report that our 2018 debt to capitalization ratio came in better than expected at 59 in 2018 further showing our balance sheet strength and cash flow management incorporating the better 2018 results into our five year plan we have lowered our expected long term debt to cap levels by a full percentage point to a range of 61 to 62 by 2023 and i should note that debt to cap ratio includes both long term and short term debt in terms of credit ratings earlier this year moody s downgraded american water from aaa to baa1 with a stable outlook although disappointing we expect the expect to be minimum and as you know in the second quarter of 2018 s p reaffirmed our a credit rating with a stable outlook in summary we continue to have a very strong balance sheet and we do not see the need to issue new equity with our current five year plan under normal operating conditions turning to slide 17 we are committed to continue to deliver customer and shareholder value with our announced increase in dividends of 9 9 our five year compound annual growth rate in dividends is 10 1 and we have now have had consistent annual dividend increases since 2013 looking forward we expect to grow our dividend at the top end of our 7 to 10 eps growth range subject to board approval and we continue our targeted dividend payout ratio of 50 to 60 of earnings our total company adjusted return on equity is holding steady at 10 for the 12 months period ended march 31 our weighted average authorized return on equity across our regulated footprint remains at about 9 8 and we have consistently delivered strong total shareholder returns far outpacing the uty index and s p 500 over the one three and five year periods through this disciplined financial management customers and shareholders may be confident that american water will continue to deliver value with that i ll turn it back over to susan susan story president and chief executive officer thanks linda we never forget at american water that at the end of every waterpipe there is a family depending on the safety of the water they give their children that at every fire hydrant life depends on the water being there at the right pressure that at every wastewater plant we are a shield between our customers and disease we re very proud to announce our most recent award from the water research foundation to continue research on legionella while legionella is primarily an issue in customer owned plumbing and not even on our side of the meter we think it s critical that we further educate and protect our customers for contaminants that could impact their water quality as a reminder we ve had an r d group at american water since 1981 and our newest research grant is one of over 100 we ve received on topics ranging from emerging contaminants to water recycling and reuse to ground breaking water technologies we know that employees customers and investors are seeking to align themselves with and invest in companies that are actively committed to the betterment of society our planet and our communities we believe that successful financial performance follows doing these things as part of our purpose driven values culture i was fortunate to be asked to participate on the panel at the recent s p global esg evaluation launch the key topics at the launch were esg risk quantification developing more standardized esg measures and improving timeliness of reporting s p as well as moody s have indicated that esg measures will be an important input into evaluation of risk to overall financial performance capability of companies and their subsequent credit ratings we re committed to bringing even more transparency in giving you the esg information that you want but the wide ranging and nonstandardized measurements today create inconsistency in reporting and comparisons timeliness of data is a big issue as many of the rankings and ratings we ve seen recently are based on data from as far back as 2016 and don t reflect progress that many companies have made over the past few years we ve engaged a leading esg consulting firm and they ve recently completed a materiality assessment for us this effort included detailed interviews with and data research from investors credit rating analysts regulators customers elected officials environmental and esg activists and our own board members and employees we will use that input to provide more complete and timely information that is most important to the stakeholders we serve and we look forward to your continuing feedback in closing i mentioned earlier about the professional accomplishments of linda sullivan over the past five years but i would be remorse if would didn t end on something even more important for personal influence and impacts on the heart and soul of who we are as a company linda has the highest integrity she s smart quick and strategic and she s always asking how can we get better she cares deeply about our employees our customers our communities and our shareholders she s been a cfo that i depend on everyday to do the fundamentals very best and to look beyond the horizon to what s next week she treats every single person with respect and dignity i can honestly say that i have learned something from her every day she is my colleague my hero and my friend and i will miss her tremendously for those of you who know her well you understand that this last slide linda loves three things very much her family american water and corvettes so many of you will see linda susan and me with ed and ralph over the next two months on investor visits and while linda s not returning until august 1 this will be her last earnings call and in and out of things to come i will share with you another first for american water we are one of only three s p 500 companies with a female ceo and cfo team and on july 1 we will have the distinction as the only company for both women even have the same first name just another way we re trying to make things easy for you so with that we re happy to take your questions questions answers operator our first question comes from agnieszka storozynski with macquarie research please go ahead agnieszka storozynski macquarie research analyst linda congratulations i m very happy for you and we will live vicariously for your travels linda sullivan chief financial officer thank you so much angie agnieszka storozynski macquarie research analyst thank you so i wanted to ask about california about the recent acquisitions i mean i was a little bit surprised i always thought that most of the municipal m as is going to come from the northeast but some of those are not even m a but could you talk a little bit more about this susan story president and chief executive officer sure angie and thank you for the question so this is what we call as you know a tuck in and in california there is significant interest from the public utility commission to help the stress systems throughout the state we saw that at the cost of capital hearings in some of the discussions that resulted in the increase in our cost of capital our plan that we guide to is basically assuming that all of our acquisitions are these smaller tuck ins and you will have larger systems of course as you said and if you look at our history of acquisitions more have been in the northeast and in midwest this was a an opportunistic acquisition we re pleased to have these folks on board is a roll in to service area of where we already are and again we have in the past several months seen for us anyway constructive outcomes at the california puc including the approval of the monterey desalination facility as part of the water supply project as well as the last general rate case outcome linda sullivan chief financial officer and angie if i can add to that in our cost of capital decision as susan mentioned we did have a lot of conversations about investments in california and it s really important to note that although our roe decreased to 9 2 in that proceeding our equity ratio increased from 53 to 55 4 agnieszka storozynski macquarie research analyst great and just one last question about new jersey is there any progress on the implementation of this new jersey water quality accountability act meaning as far as it relates to municipal m a susan story president and chief executive officer yes that s a great question angie so many of you know that the first step in implementation was that water providers in the state of new jersey were going to have to certify to certain parts of those regulations that is happening though as the regulations are currently still being developed by the dep in new jersey to be rolled out further so we were the first to certify for us it was more business as usual so we are just now starting to see some of the certifications coming in it s our understanding that there may be one or two i think a university that may be looking at consolidating those type of certifications and looking where different systems stand in the state so it s in the early stages the regulations are still being promulgated and we look forward to in continued roll out over the next probably 6 to 12 months operator our next question comes from richard verdi with coker palmer please go ahead richard verdi coker and palmer analyst and before i asked my question i just wanted to say linda i wish you all the best in your retirement congratulations and that i really appreciate all the time that you gave me from what i would pester you for to do a conference call with investors with me or to go on a road to visit investors so i appreciated all that time i wanted to say that and make sure you knew that and i wish you all the best in your retirement congratulations on a well deserved retirement still i m sure linda sullivan chief financial officer rich thank you so much and it was my pleasure to have those discussions with you richard verdi coker and palmer analyst thank you very much so just kind of i m pretty clear on everything for the quarter just kind of i guess more of a high level question last month we sold a new jersey department of environmental protection announced that it has plan to set standards for the pfos contamination and they re much more strict than the epa s guidelines and it appears other states are going to implement similar standard as well so i was just kind of hoping maybe you could discuss a little bit about how that could impact the company on a regulated side in terms of the acquisition front and then on in terms of what it could mean to cost to the companies since it ll it s going to need to deal with the stricter standards as well and then on top of that how it could also impact the company in terms of the military business because driver of this contamination is caused by the fire extinguisher firm foam used on this military bases everyday when they are running their drills and so i would think that that would be something with this pfos contamination could be an impetus to see more of those military bases pursue o m contracts with the likes of american water so i just wondered if you could give us some high level color on how this pfos contamination could impact the company susan story president and chief executive officer rich thank you for this this is probably one of the largest emerging issues that will need to be addressed across the country those from states that are doing their own limits p5 as well as epa actually yesterday came out from what most people don t understand while the epa has a recommended maximum contaminant level there really isn t a regulation it is not actually a regulated chemical what it is is they re recommending not to have over certain limits but they don t have the force of regulation behind it the epa came out yesterday i read and basically said they are going to do it they are looking at the levels that they were using for maximum contaminant levels that weren t regulated of 70 parts per trillion new jersey as you mentioned has come in with a much lower i believe 13 parts per trillion to your point about the company i mentioned it s interesting you asked this question because i mentioned in my final remarks about the role of our r d group we ve been doing research on these perfluorinated chemicals for decades and in fact and i ll talk about military first then i ll come back to the regulated business we have actually already been working on a couple or three of our military basis to actually treat p5 we have mobile units where we can actually do on site decontamination and for example at picatinny arsenal in new jersey we ve done tremendous work already with a couple of wells there that we serve it we believe from the military installation standpoint it s actually a competitive advantage for us we have treated two levels that are at or below what the new jersey requirements are we know how to do that so this is a serious situation and if you want to get a nice four five page premier for those are there who want to know the national institute of environmental health services has a wonderful three or four page premier because some people use pfos pfoas they re all part of group of pfcs called perfluorinated chemicals and they are all man made materials and the issue comes in is that they are as you said firefighting foam teflon it comes from even stainmaster things that repel grease and water and it s been used for decades and so what is happened is as it gets into the water source of the environment that it just stays and it s consumed by humans it just doesn t get released from the body for years and years and that s where the concern is coming so this is a very serious issue we applaud all of the different states as well as the epa for making this a priority we actually see this is a very good thing we are very supportive of all of the actions being taken on the pfcs and our different states and we really want to be part of being a solutions provider for those and see it as a strength given all the research and actual deployment we ve done on how to decontaminate these out of water supplies operator our next question comes from jonathan reeder with wells fargo please go ahead jonathan reeder wells fargo analyst i wanted to echo everyone else s remarks linda congrats on the retirement decision i know you re going to continue to have fun through the rest of your life as you have been while at american water works and i think i understand how it s an easy personal decision for you to make then last point i thought when susan was saying for the first time in american water works history and have just been talking about corvette i thought she was going to say there was a new corvette waiting for you in the parking lot maybe they don t like you that much i don t know linda sullivan chief financial officer i was hoping that too jonathan but it didn t happen jonathan reeder wells fargo analyst it is ok yes so anyway susan i just want to ask you in light of the recent rate case outcome how do you think about west virginia in terms of inner core state for you i know in some previous rate cases there there were challenging outcomes plus kind of a the freedom of end was treated feeding less than kind of equitable to you guys so i was just wondering how do you view west virginia today susan story president and chief executive officer so west virginia first of all for those who ve never been there it s a beautiful state and we have been in west virginia since the 1880s and the last two rate cases outcomes we ve had including a settlement i mean this was a settlement reach without parties we re very constructive because in west virginia there is a realization maybe as much as any other state about the importance of clean water and safe water and it s not just an issue for american water the public providers of water there and wastewater services see this same thing so we have some wonderful employees in west virginia we have some outstanding customers in west virginia and we re are very excited that there is a growing realization from all of the parties the stakeholders as well as the regulatory commission about the importance of investment for the future to ensure that that state can continue to grow economically and have a safe water wastewater and fire protection system for its citizens linda sullivan chief financial officer and jonathan i ll add to that as well as you know west virginia now has a decent mechanism as well for continuing investment in the state and as part of our settlement of the rate case they authorized a 9 75 roe which is the same that we had in the last case but they also increased the equity ratio from 45 84 to 48 4 so really showing that the need for attracting capital to the state jonathan reeder wells fargo analyst all right good stuff glad things are improving there for sure linda did you quantify what the weather impact the headwind was in q1 19 then i mean i know it s huge and not overly sensitive but linda sullivan chief financial officer yes we did not have any really at all weather impact in the first quarter jonathan reeder wells fargo analyst ok i thought i had heard you say that that was a bit of a headwind sorry about that and then i also kind of missed what you said was driving the expected 1 improvement from your prior forecast in the 2023 debt to total cap ratio going to 61 to 62 what were the drivers there linda sullivan chief financial officer so it was really kind of refining our estimates our actual came in much better than we thought for 2018 and we also had had a very very strong focus on cash flow management susan story president and chief executive officer and that s the last question and we thank you all for participating in our call today please note that we value you as our investor owners and as a financial analyst who researched our company for the benefit of your clients and their futures

smooth transition this is especially bitter sweet for me as linda and i have been a team since she began her tenure as cfo in early may 2014 when i moved from the cfo position to ceo but her family is growing and in addition to her two beautiful grandsons you met in a presentation at our investor day last december her son and daughter in law in california are expecting her first granddaughter in

she takes the cfo rank from linda on july 1 she s actually here in the room with us today linda would you like to say a few words linda sullivan chief financial officer yes and thank you susan for your very kind words and your inspirational leadership i have learned more from you in the last five years than in my entire career and i thank you immensely my husband and i took the road less traveled when we moved from california to new jersey five years ago and being part of the american water team turned out to be the best career decision of my life and i would not trade this experience for anything in the world and to our analysts and investors i want you to know that one of my favorite things to do is to meet with you and discuss the american water story and listen to your insights and views you were truly the grand teachers and thought leaders of our industry it has been an absolute pleasure learning from all of you so now after 30 years in the utility industry this decision to retire is the hardest career decision i have made and at the same time the easiest personal decision for me and my family it s hard because i love everything about american water the leadership team my colleagues my team the board and our collective ability to do what we say we re going to do i believe american water is the best run utility in the nation and with our announcement today bringing susan hardwick on board i am confident it will continue to be just that personally this is an easy decision for me my coast to coast family is rapidly expanding with two grandsons and a granddaughter due in june and i m fortunate in this stage of life to be able to follow that strong pull of my heart and it s really hard to explain the way grandchildren make you feel but there is a song lyric and it s by andy grammar that s sums it up pretty well it says i think i finally found my hallelujah so i also love the work i do on several boards and am eager to spend more time pursuing that passion plus my bucket size is approaching the size of a novel and my husband tom and i look forward to living those dreams i would like to thank the leadership team and board for being so understanding and gracious about my decisions and working with me through a strong succession plan i m thrilled to have susan hardwick join the team she will bring tremendous value to american water susan story president and chief executive officer thanks linda as always linda will cover our financial results in just a few minutes unfortunately our coo walter lynch is in arkansas due to the passing of his father in law alex street many of you know that walter is a west point graduate and an army veteran and mr street also served our country in the army at 80 years old he was still a practicing attorney after more than 50 years we applaud his life commitment to his family and the values we hold dear at american water integrity service and unwavering commitment to his community and country so now moving onto our first quarter results the employees of american water delivered solid performance and further strengthened our low risk and predictable growth story our first quarter 2019 adjusted earnings per share were up 3 4 compared to the first quarter of 2018 as a reminder we had an extraordinary first quarter of 2018 with a 13 5 eps increase from the previous year primarily due to the impact of finalizing both the pennsylvania and the missouri general rate cases in 2018 which linda will discuss in more detail while american water does not give quarterly guidance our first quarter results were 0 01 ahead of plan for the quarter given our performance year to date we are affirming our 2019 adjusted eps guidance of 3 54 to 3 64 per share as well as affirming guidance to the top half of our 7 to 10 eps compound annual growth rate through 2023 also consistent with our previous dividend guidance on april 17 our board of directors increased our quarterly cash dividend payment from 0 455 to 0 50 per share a 9 9 increase the company has increased its dividend every year since our ipo in april of 2008 with consistent annual increases of around 10 per year since 2013 the foundation for our earnings growth continues to be the capital investment we make in our regulated operations so that we can provide clean safe and reliable service we invested 337 million total this quarter with a majority for infrastructure improvements in our regulated businesses we minimized the customer bill impacts of these investments through a continued focus on controlling o m cost these cost savings are driven by optimizing capital spend through value engineering and volume procurement constructive regulatory mechanisms and deploying technology developed with input from both our employees and our customers i ll talk more on the next slide about our continuing progress on regulated acquisitions and their contributions to our long term growth story earnings were up year over year in our market based businesses this was due primarily to growth customer contracts from homeowner services of note we have a very successful new partnerships with philadelphia where we have added more than 100 000 contracts since we launched the partnership in october of 2018 that type of growth would not be possible without our exceptional customer service and our combined homeowner services has an a rating from the better business bureau our military services group added the wright patterson air force base contract in 2018 and we begin full operations at fort leonard wood army base yesterday may 1 we still expect to see decisions by the department of defense on up to three military base awards for which we are competing this year turning to slide 8 let s talk more about growth across our regulated footprints we have closed on five acquisitions in four different states so far in 2019 three of these were water systems in kentucky indiana and missouri and two were wastewater acquisitions in kentucky and pennsylvania these closed acquisitions resulted in 4 700 new customer connections and they join more than 3 000 customer connections we added through organic growth in the first quarter we also look forward to adding another 61 500 customer connections through signed agreements in nine states most of which we expect to close in 2019 this includes our most recent agreement to acquire east pasadena water company in california adding 2 900 new connections just as a reminder typically a customer connection or meter represents on average 2 5 to 3 people based on the specific state at american water we believe that all people should have clean and safe water at affordable prices regardless of where they live or their socioeconomic status these new agreements reflect our commitment to provide water and wastewater solutions to communities across the united states moving to slide 9 customers remain at the center of every decision we make today and into the future this means smart investments balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment as we make these critical investments to maintain reliable service we must also ensure affordability for our customers we do this by putting a laser focus on both o m efficiency as well as capital investment efficiency this is why our 31 5 o m efficiency goal by 2023 is so important as a reminder this ratio represents how many cents of o m we spend for every dollar of revenue meaning we want more dollars to go to investment so we can make our system safer stronger and more reliable our employees live in the communities we serve and they re committed to serving their neighbors and families with the best quality of water and water services at affordable prices let me give you just one example of how we re driving further efficiencies we are finding that due to a growing national shortage of trucking personnel the prices of materials and equipment are rising and scheduling has become more challenging so we developed a supply chain strategy to continue to diversify and optimize our suppliers and their willingness to locate closer distribution points so their states operations are more cost effective when we roll these savings into other cost efficiencies we get by leveraging our large size and purchasing power we will save approximately 33 million a year just on the purchases of meters hydrants valves and pipes slide 10 summarizes many points i just covered again we re affirming our 2019 eps guidance range of 3 54 to 3 64 as well as affirming guidance to the top half of our 7 to 10 eps compound annual growth through 2023 we are off to a good start this year and we look forward to continuing to deliver stable and predictable results and with that i ll turn it over to linda for her comments linda sullivan chief financial officer thank you susan i ll start on slide 12 we had a solid first quarter of 2019 especially compared to a very strong first quarter 2018 gaap earnings were 0 62 per share an increase of 0 03 compared to the first quarter last year included in gaap earnings was a favorable adjustment of 4 million or 0 01 per share to reflect a reduction in the settlement liability related to the freedom industries chemical spill this reduction is based on our latest determination of the final claims costs in total our share of the original 126 million freedom industries related settlement has been reduced to 19 million through insurance recoveries and lower claims excluding this benefit first quarter earnings were up 3 4 which came in 0 01 above our plan our strong market based earnings offset partially by timing items in the regulated business in parent other highlights include achieving a consolidated adjusted return on equity of 10 for the 12 month period ended first quarter 2019 executing on our capital investment strategy by investing 337 million during the quarter and adding 36 million in annualized new authorized revenue since the beginning of this year turning to slide 13 let me provide more detail on our first quarter adjusted earnings results i ll start on the left hand side of this page as you can see we had a very strong first quarter of 2018 up 13 5 over first quarter 2017 on settlement of both the pennsylvania and missouri general rate cases last year first quarter 2019 increased 3 4 on a quarter over quarter basis which reflects some timing impacts that i will discuss in more detail as i cover each business let me start with our regulated businesses which were up 0 01 per share revenue was up 0 08 in total and included increases from authorized rate cases infrastructure mechanisms and acquisitions these increases were partially offset by lower demand and a 0 02 benefit in the first quarter of last year as our missouri general rate case did not begin to adjust customer rates for the lower federal income tax rate until may 28 2018 lastly i should note we did not see any material impact from weather during the first quarter of 2019 next we had higher o m expense of 0 01 per share from something we are very proud of for finalization of our union negotiated national benefits agreement last year we now include our 17 national unions in our annual performance plans this puts our 7 100 employees on the same annual performance plan where the annual payout is based on company performance tied to the goals you see in our proxy statement so from our ceo to the front line our goals are aligned we believe this investment in our employees will further enable us to meet our o m efficiency goals allowing us to reduce the customer bill impact at our critically needed infrastructure investments depreciation and interest expense were each up 0 03 per share to support investment growth our market based businesses had a strong quarter up 0 04 or 57 with homeowner services up 0 03 from the acquisition of pivotal and new customer additions military services was up a 0 01 from the addition of wright patterson air force base and an increase in capital work at vandenberg lastly the parent decreased 0 03 from three separate items each 0 01 per share first we had higher interest expense to support growth next we had a tax adjustment that was favorable in 2018 and we also had 0 01 of expense timing turning to slide 14 i will provide an update on our regulatory proceedings we settled two rate cases in the first quarter of 2019 in west virginia and maryland and implemented our three year rate increase under our four year plan in new york effective april 1 in west virginia we received approval of our of an annualized revenue increase of 19 million an roe of 9 75 and an increased equity ratio to a 48 4 the case was driven by 200 million of infrastructure investment since our last rate case in 2016 additionally the distribution system improvement charge was reset to provide for additional investment this surcharge will be offset by the amortization of deferred tax savings under the tax cuts and jobs act in maryland we received approval of an annualized revenue increase of over 1 million an estimated roe of 9 9 and an equity ratio of 48 7 the case was driven by 18 million of investments since 2015 during that time the company constructed a new 90 million gallon reservoir and intake near bel air maryland this new reservoir is now in service and provides a long term safe and reliable water supply and economic opportunity in that region we also have three pending rate cases in indiana virginia and kentucky and filed our preliminary application for our california general rate case in indiana we reached an agreement on the with the major parties on our rate case if approved the new rates will reflect a revenue increase of 7 5 million 17 5 million over two steps an roe of 9 8 and an equity ratio of 53 4 the settlement shows that at the end of the 2020 future test year indiana american water will have invested over 500 million in infrastructure upgrades since its last rate case in 2015 regarding the tax cuts and jobs act indiana american water already reduced its customer rates by 4 4 on august 1 2018 and the agreement includes credit for the period before august 1 to be spread to customers over 12 months starting in may 2020 a final order is expected by mid 2019 moving to virginia we implemented interim water and wastewater rates on may 1 the general rate case requested an overall increase of 5 million driven by approximately 98 million in infrastructure upgrades since april of 2017 the final rate order could take several months in kentucky our general rate case requested nearly 20 million in additional annualized revenues and was driven by more than 100 million in capital investment since the last rate case in 2016 and yesterday california american water filed a preliminary application for its 2021 through 2023 general rate case that includes a first year revenue increase of 23 9 million followed by annual step increases that would support 200 million of infrastructure projects california is also awaiting a decision on its step increase for 2019 turning to slide 15 today we are affirming our 2019 adjusted earnings guidance range of 3 54 to 3 64 per share this excludes the 0 01 favorable impact from the reduction of the liability associated with our freedom industries related settlement which is included in our 2019 gaap earnings guidance range included in our annual guidance range are several variables with the most significant potential variable being the impact of weather and as a reminder we consider plus or minus 0 06 of weather to be normal weather variability included in our earnings guidance range with the largest weather impact typically occurring in the summer months or third quarter of each year on a long term basis we are affirming our 2019 to 2023 long term eps guidance in the top half of our 7 to 10 compound annual growth range anchored off 2017 adjusted earnings turning to slide 16 let me discuss our balance sheet as we look at our cash flow impact from tax reform originally we expected lower cash flow of about 500 million from 2018 through 2022 this has improved by 120 million following the pivotal acquisition you can see that the estimated impact is largest in 2020 when we expect to become a cash taxpayer but then declines quickly as rate base grows and becomes positive by 2022 also as we continue to refine our estimates we are now forecasting becoming a cash taxpayer in the second half of 2020 versus our prior estimate at a full year in 2020 now the actual impact will be largely dependent upon the outcome of our regulatory proceedings regarding tax reform also i am pleased to report that our 2018 debt to capitalization ratio came in better than expected at 59 in 2018 further showing our balance sheet strength and cash flow management incorporating the better 2018 results into our five year plan we have lowered our expected long term debt to cap levels by a full percentage point to a range of 61 to 62 by 2023 and i should note that debt to cap ratio includes both long term and short term debt in terms of credit ratings earlier this year moody s downgraded american water from aaa to baa1 with a stable outlook although disappointing we expect the expect to be minimum and as you know in the second quarter of 2018 s p reaffirmed our a credit rating with a stable outlook in summary we continue to have a very strong balance sheet and we do not see the need to issue new equity with our current five year plan under normal operating conditions turning to slide 17 we are committed to continue to deliver customer and shareholder value with our announced increase in dividends of 9 9 our five year compound annual growth rate in dividends is 10 1 and we have now have had consistent annual dividend increases since 2013 looking forward we expect to grow our dividend at the top end of our 7 to 10 eps growth range subject to board approval and we continue our targeted dividend payout ratio of 50 to 60 of earnings our total company adjusted return on equity is holding steady at 10 for the 12 months period ended march 31 our weighted average authorized return on equity across our regulated footprint remains at about 9 8 and we have consistently delivered strong total shareholder returns far outpacing the uty index and s p 500 over the one three and five year periods through this disciplined financial management customers and shareholders may be confident that american water will continue to deliver value with that i ll turn it back over to susan susan story president and chief executive officer thanks linda we never forget at american water that at the end of every waterpipe there is a family depending on the safety of the water they give their children that at every fire hydrant life depends on the water being there at the right pressure that at every wastewater plant we are a shield between our customers and disease we re very proud to announce our most recent award from the water research foundation to continue research on legionella while legionella is primarily an issue in customer owned plumbing and not even on our side of the meter we think it s critical that we further educate and protect our customers for contaminants that could impact their water quality as a reminder we ve had an r d group at american water since 1981 and our newest research grant is one of over 100 we ve received on topics ranging from emerging contaminants to water recycling and reuse to ground breaking water technologies we know that employees customers and investors are seeking to align themselves with and invest in companies that are actively committed to the betterment of society our planet and our communities we believe that successful financial performance follows doing these things as part of our purpose driven values culture i was fortunate to be asked to participate on the panel at the recent s p global esg evaluation launch the key topics at the launch were esg risk quantification developing more standardized esg measures and improving timeliness of reporting s p as well as moody s have indicated that esg measures will be an important input into evaluation of risk to overall financial performance capability of companies and their subsequent credit ratings we re committed to bringing even more transparency in giving you the esg information that you want but the wide ranging and nonstandardized measurements today create inconsistency in reporting and comparisons timeliness of data is a big issue as many of the rankings and ratings we ve seen recently are based on data from as far back as 2016 and don t reflect progress that many companies have made over the past few years we ve engaged a leading esg consulting firm and they ve recently completed a materiality assessment for us this effort included detailed interviews with and data research from investors credit rating analysts regulators customers elected officials environmental and esg activists and our own board members and employees we will use that input to provide more complete and timely information that is most important to the stakeholders we serve and we look forward to your continuing feedback in closing i mentioned earlier about the professional accomplishments of linda sullivan over the past five years but i would be remorse if would didn t end on something even more important for personal influence and impacts on the heart and soul of who we are as a company linda has the highest integrity she s smart quick and strategic and she s always asking how can we get better she cares deeply about our employees our customers our communities and our shareholders she s been a cfo that i depend on everyday to do the fundamentals very best and to look beyond the horizon to what s next week she treats every single person with respect and dignity i can honestly say that i have learned something from her every day she is my colleague my hero and my friend and i will miss her tremendously for those of you who know her well you understand that this last slide linda loves three things very much her family american water and corvettes so many of you will see linda susan and me with ed and ralph over the next two months on investor visits and while linda s not returning until august 1 this will be her last earnings call and in and out of things to come i will share with you another first for american water we are one of only three s p 500 companies with a female ceo and cfo team and on july 1 we will have the distinction as the only company for both women even have the same first name just another way we re trying to make things easy for you so with that we re happy to take your questions questions answers operator our first question comes from agnieszka storozynski with macquarie research please go ahead agnieszka storozynski macquarie research analyst linda congratulations i m very happy for you and we will live vicariously for your travels linda sullivan chief financial officer thank you so much angie agnieszka storozynski macquarie research analyst thank you so i wanted to ask about california about the recent acquisitions i mean i was a little bit surprised i always thought that most of the municipal m as is going to come from the northeast but some of those are not even m a but could you talk a little bit more about this susan story president and chief executive officer sure angie and thank you for the question so this is what we call as you know a tuck in and in california there is significant interest from the public utility commission to help the stress systems throughout the state we saw that at the cost of capital hearings in some of the discussions that resulted in the increase in our cost of capital our plan that we guide to is basically assuming that all of our acquisitions are these smaller tuck ins and you will have larger systems of course as you said and if you look at our history of acquisitions more have been in the northeast and in midwest this was a an opportunistic acquisition we re pleased to have these folks on board is a roll in to service area of where we already are and again we have in the past several months seen for us anyway constructive outcomes at the california puc including the approval of the monterey desalination facility as part of the water supply project as well as the last general rate case outcome linda sullivan chief financial officer and angie if i can add to that in our cost of capital decision as susan mentioned we did have a lot of conversations about investments in california and it s really important to note that although our roe decreased to 9 2 in that proceeding our equity ratio increased from 53 to 55 4 agnieszka storozynski macquarie research analyst great and just one last question about new jersey is there any progress on the implementation of this new jersey water quality accountability act meaning as far as it relates to municipal m a susan story president and chief executive officer yes that s a great question angie so many of you know that the first step in implementation was that water providers in the state of new jersey were going to have to certify to certain parts of those regulations that is happening though as the regulations are currently still being developed by the dep in new jersey to be rolled out further so we were the first to certify for us it was more business as usual so we are just now starting to see some of the certifications coming in it s our understanding that there may be one or two i think a university that may be looking at consolidating those type of certifications and looking where different systems stand in the state so it s in the early stages the regulations are still being promulgated and we look forward to in continued roll out over the next probably 6 to 12 months operator our next question comes from richard verdi with coker palmer please go ahead richard verdi coker and palmer analyst and before i asked my question i just wanted to say linda i wish you all the best in your retirement congratulations and that i really appreciate all the time that you gave me from what i would pester you for to do a conference call with investors with me or to go on a road to visit investors so i appreciated all that time i wanted to say that and make sure you knew that and i wish you all the best in your retirement congratulations on a well deserved retirement still i m sure linda sullivan chief financial officer rich thank you so much and it was my pleasure to have those discussions with you richard verdi coker and palmer analyst thank you very much so just kind of i m pretty clear on everything for the quarter just kind of i guess more of a high level question last month we sold a new jersey department of environmental protection announced that it has plan to set standards for the pfos contamination and they re much more strict than the epa s guidelines and it appears other states are going to implement similar standard as well so i was just kind of hoping maybe you could discuss a little bit about how that could impact the company on a regulated side in terms of the acquisition front and then on in terms of what it could mean to cost to the companies since it ll it s going to need to deal with the stricter standards as well and then on top of that how it could also impact the company in terms of the military business because driver of this contamination is caused by the fire extinguisher firm foam used on this military bases everyday when they are running their drills and so i would think that that would be something with this pfos contamination could be an impetus to see more of those military bases pursue o m contracts with the likes of american water so i just wondered if you could give us some high level color on how this pfos contamination could impact the company susan story president and chief executive officer rich thank you for this this is probably one of the largest emerging issues that will need to be addressed across the country those from states that are doing their own limits p5 as well as epa actually yesterday came out from what most people don t understand while the epa has a recommended maximum contaminant level there really isn t a regulation it is not actually a regulated chemical what it is is they re recommending not to have over certain limits but they don t have the force of regulation behind it the epa came out yesterday i read and basically said they are going to do it they are looking at the levels that they were using for maximum contaminant levels that weren t regulated of 70 parts per trillion new jersey as you mentioned has come in with a much lower i believe 13 parts per trillion to your point about the company i mentioned it s interesting you asked this question because i mentioned in my final remarks about the role of our r d group we ve been doing research on these perfluorinated chemicals for decades and in fact and i ll talk about military first then i ll come back to the regulated business we have actually already been working on a couple or three of our military basis to actually treat p5 we have mobile units where we can actually do on site decontamination and for example at picatinny arsenal in new jersey we ve done tremendous work already with a couple of wells there that we serve it we believe from the military installation standpoint it s actually a competitive advantage for us we have treated two levels that are at or below what the new jersey requirements are we know how to do that so this is a serious situation and if you want to get a nice four five page premier for those are there who want to know the national institute of environmental health services has a wonderful three or four page premier because some people use pfos pfoas they re all part of group of pfcs called perfluorinated chemicals and they are all man made materials and the issue comes in is that they are as you said firefighting foam teflon it comes from even stainmaster things that repel grease and water and it s been used for decades and so what is happened is as it gets into the water source of the environment that it just stays and it s consumed by humans it just doesn t get released from the body for years and years and that s where the concern is coming so this is a very serious issue we applaud all of the different states as well as the epa for making this a priority we actually see this is a very good thing we are very supportive of all of the actions being taken on the pfcs and our different states and we really want to be part of being a solutions provider for those and see it as a strength given all the research and actual deployment we ve done on how to decontaminate these out of water supplies operator our next question comes from jonathan reeder with wells fargo please go ahead jonathan reeder wells fargo analyst i wanted to echo everyone else s remarks linda congrats on the retirement decision i know you re going to continue to have fun through the rest of your life as you have been while at american water works and i think i understand how it s an easy personal decision for you to make then last point i thought when susan was saying for the first time in american water works history and have just been talking about corvette i thought she was going to say there was a new corvette waiting for you in the parking lot maybe they don t like you that much i don t know linda sullivan chief financial officer i was hoping that too jonathan but it didn t happen jonathan reeder wells fargo analyst it is ok yes so anyway susan i just want to ask you in light of the recent rate case outcome how do you think about west virginia in terms of inner core state for you i know in some previous rate cases there there were challenging outcomes plus kind of a the freedom of end was treated feeding less than kind of equitable to you guys so i was just wondering how do you view west virginia today susan story president and chief executive officer so west virginia first of all for those who ve never been there it s a beautiful state and we have been in west virginia since the 1880s and the last two rate cases outcomes we ve had including a settlement i mean this was a settlement reach without parties we re very constructive because in west virginia there is a realization maybe as much as any other state about the importance of clean water and safe water and it s not just an issue for american water the public providers of water there and wastewater services see this same thing so we have some wonderful employees in west virginia we have some outstanding customers in west virginia and we re are very excited that there is a growing realization from all of the parties the stakeholders as well as the regulatory commission about the importance of investment for the future to ensure that that state can continue to grow economically and have a safe water wastewater and fire protection system for its citizens linda sullivan chief financial officer and jonathan i ll add to that as well as you know west virginia now has a decent mechanism as well for continuing investment in the state and as part of our settlement of the rate case they authorized a 9 75 roe which is the same that we had in the last case but they also increased the equity ratio from 45 84 to 48 4 so really showing that the need for attracting capital to the state jonathan reeder wells fargo analyst all right good stuff glad things are improving there for sure linda did you quantify what the weather impact the headwind was in q1 19 then i mean i know it s huge and not overly sensitive but linda sullivan chief financial officer yes we did not have any really at all weather impact in the first quarter jonathan reeder wells fargo analyst ok i thought i had heard you say that that was a bit of a headwind sorry about that and then i also kind of missed what you said was driving the expected 1 improvement from your prior forecast in the 2023 debt to total cap ratio going to 61 to 62 what were the drivers there linda sullivan chief financial officer so it was really kind of refining our estimates our actual came in much better than we thought for 2018 and we also had had a very very strong focus on cash flow management susan story president and chief executive officer and that s the last question and we thank you all for participating in our call today please note that we value you as our investor owners and as a financial analyst who researched our company for the benefit of your clients and their futures we also want to be open and transparent in all of our discussions and dealings with all of you so that you can have confidence in your decisions around our company and investments in our stock if we have not been able to address your question or you have additional questions please call ed and ralph and they will be happy to help you may also see in the next few weeks or months the newest member of our investor relations team abbey barksdale who is our new investor relations esg manager i d like to remind everyone that our annual shareholders meeting will take place a week from tomorrow friday may 10 thanks again for listening operator duration 45 minutes call participants ed vallejo vice president of investor relations susan story president and chief executive officer linda sullivan

us job growth surged in april and the unemployment rate dropped to a more than 49 year low of 3 6 percent pointing to sustained strength in economic activity even as last year s massive fiscal stimulus fades the labor department s closely watched monthly employment report on may 3 however showed steady wage gains last month consistent with moderate inflation story continues below

was broadly supportive of the federal reserve s decision on wednesday to keep interest rates unchanged and signal little desire to adjust monetary policy anytime soon fed chair jerome powell described the economy and job growth as a bit stronger than we anticipated and inflation somewhat weaker employment gains are strong enough to dispel any immediate concerns over the health of the economy while wage gains are not strong enough to force the federal reserve s hand to tighten the policy stance said harm bandholz chief us economist at unicredit research in new york nonfarm payrolls increased by 263 000 jobs last month amid gains in hiring nearly across all sectors the economy created 16 000 more jobs in february and march than previously reported economists polled by reuters had forecast

growth is not strong enough to drive up inflation it is seen sufficient to underpin economic growth as the stimulus from last year s 1 5 trillion tax cut wanes the economy grew at a 3 2 percent

first quarter results net sales were 1 4 billion up 10 compared to the same period last year comparable store sales increased 1 4 driven by strong results in deli grocery frozen and meat offsetting some produce availability challenges that we had during the quarter and cycling the strong cough and cold season from the prior year for the quarter we experienced cost inflation predominantly driven by adverse weather conditions causing periods of significant spikes in the cost of certain produce items that we were not able to fully pass through in retail pricing on the non perishable side of the business we started to see some pass through of the cost increases that we experienced in late q4 and into the first half of q1 while produce remains an important traffic driver increasingly our customers are viewing sprouts as a full shop healthy grocery store during the first quarter we opened eight new stores bringing our total to 321 stores in 19 states we continue to look forward to bringing our unique model of healthy living for less to two new states new jersey and louisiana this june our recent store vintages continue to open very strongly in both new and existing markets resulting in a new store productivity in the low 80s a reflection of our growing brand strength that is resonating across the country as we outlined back in february our 2019 strategic priorities reinforce a strong foundation in people process and technology with a focus of building upon our points of differentiation and enhancing our in store and out of store customer experience let me briefly touch on the progress of a few of these key initiatives we continue to build upon our momentum of providing consumers with healthy products and meal solutions that are on trend convenient fresh and at great prices this is particularly evident in our new prototype stores which are performing very strongly driven by enhanced customer experience in deli and meat and seafood during the second quarter three new stores will be opened in this new prototype format we continue to expand our selection of sprouts brand private label products that taste great are made with quality ingredients and at a great price private label now accounts for nearly 14 of our revenue today and continues to significantly outpace our overall company net sales and comp growth we will continue to introduce new staple trending and unique products this year along with increased in store digital and social media messaging to drive further trial engagement and loyalty among our customers on the customer engagement front one of our key goals is to continue to enhance and further differentiate our guest experience we are gaining deeper customer insights that will allow us to personalize our guests experiences with relevant messaging content and offers our focus is to seamlessly integrate a mutually supportive digital and in store experience that will lead to greater loyalty advocacy and share of spend in addition we are expanding our digital channels and increasing our reach and customer impact to further meet the needs of our guests we now offer delivery in every market where we have a store presence home delivery continues to grow up over 60 in the first quarter as consumers look to sprouts as a trusted reliable partner for added convenience in their busy lives we have expanded our testing of click and collect and are now offering this service in a number of stores in six markets we will continue to test and learn to ensure we are seamlessly engaging with our customers regardless of how they choose to shop on the technology side we have continued with the rollout of fresh item management and are on track to complete the implementation of production planning by the end of the third quarter this year the system is allowing us to optimize production of the right items at the right time resulting in better in stock position and driving incremental sales also we recently implemented workday financials which will streamline our finance processes integrate with our operational systems and provide timely actionable financial information throughout the store network i also want to acknowledge our dedicated team members both in the store and at the support office who are the brand advocates that continue to drive customer engagement sales and authority in the natural and organic space we remain focused on serving our guests and helping them on their healthy living journey as you may have seen we recently published our annual sustainability report we are pleased with the progress we have made over the past few years in 2018 we deepened our commitment to the environment with programs that fight hunger and reduce waste we donated 27 million pounds of food to local food banks the equivalent of 23 million meals we diverted 35 million pounds of food to animal feed and compost facilities and recycled 91 million pounds of cardboard we are focused on procuring innovative healthy products that are grown and sourced responsibly in 2018 we made great advancements in sourcing sustainable seafood with now almost 100 of sprouts fresh and frozen seafood sourced from responsibly managed fisheries our goal of bringing positive change to our nation s health goes beyond the food we sell since 2015 the sprouts healthy communities foundation has contributed 7 million to local non profit partners that create school nutrition education and farming programs and deliver lifesaving prenatal nutrition to at risk mothers among others last year we supported more than 130 non profit partners that provided critical funding to health and wellness programs that empower children to live healthier lives we look forward to building upon these sustainability initiatives and improving the health and wellness programs in the communities we serve now i d like to review some details of our first quarter results and then review our guidance for 2019 for the first quarter gross profit increased by 9 to 484 million and our gross margin rate decreased by 30 basis points to 34 3 compared to the same period last year this de leverage was primarily due to cost inflation in certain items that were not fully reflected in retail prices due to the competitive environment in addition to changes in product mix sg a increased 11 to 375 million or 26 5 of sales compared to 26 3 in the same period last year excluding the 35 basis points impact from the adoption of the new lease accounting standard sg a leveraged 15 basis points this leverage reflects lower unemployment tax for california team members compared to last year and lower stock and bonus compensation expenses predominantly related to the open ceo position in addition due to some delayed store openings that we discussed on our last call we received rent credits which also reduced our sg a spend for the quarter these were partially offset by higher spend related to our wage investments for the first quarter our depreciation and amortization costs increased 13 to 29 million or 2 1 of sales an increase of 10 basis points compared to the same period last year adjusted ebitda increased 3 in the first quarter to 110 million and adjusted ebitda margin decreased 50 basis points including the non cash impact from the new lease accounting standard adopted for fiscal 2019 for comparability if the first quarter of 2018 results reflected the same lease accounting impact ebitda would have increased 8 and ebitda margin would have decreased by 15 basis points net income for the first quarter was 56 million and diluted earnings per share was 0 46 compared to 0 50 in the same period last year the eps decrease of 0 04 is primarily driven by cycling a lower effective tax rate in 2018 and the adoption of the new lease accounting standard partially offset by higher sales and fewer shares outstanding due to our share repurchase program as you may recall the first quarter of 2018 benefited from the exercise of expiring pre ipo options which substantially reduced our effective tax rate to 9 8 a benefit of 0 08 per share as compared to 24 4 tax rate during the first quarter of 2019 and as a reminder the lease accounting standard change will result in a net incremental expense of 0 04 per share for fiscal 2019 or 0 01 a quarter shifting to the balance sheet and liquidity we continue to utilize our strong operating cash flow from operations 113 million in the first quarter to support our unit growth and sales initiatives we invested 24 million in capital expenditures net of landlord reimbursement primarily for new stores we ended the quarter with 20 million in cash and cash equivalents 500 million borrowed on our 700 million revolving credit facility 106 million available under our current share repurchase authorizations and a net debt to ebitda ratio of 1 5 times consistent with our capital allocation strategy we continued returning capital to shareholders in the first quarter repurchasing 4 9 million shares for a total investment of 112 million quarter to date through april 29 we have repurchased an additional 2 4 million shares of common stock for a total year to date investment of 163 million now let me turn to 2019 guidance we are increasing the bottom end of our earnings per share range to 0 18 from 0 16 to reflect the stronger first quarter results the top end of our eps range of 1 24 per share remains the same we expect net sales growth to be between 9 and 10 5 driven by strong new store growth and full year comp sales growth in the range of 1 5 to 3 reflecting first quarter results we now expect full year comps to be toward the lower end of the comp sales range we are on target to open approximately 28 new stores we expect a normalized tax rate of approximately 26 or slightly lower and we continue to expect our capex spend to be in the range of 170 million to 175 million net of landlord reimbursement a few additional items to note on the full year 2019 guidance as a reminder our store pipeline for 2019 will be more back end loaded than 2018 we plan to open eight stores in q2 with the majority of the remaining stores to be opened in the third quarter we expect gross margins to be slightly down year over year reflecting first quarter results and the competitive environment as well as higher transportation costs associated with more new stores in new markets partially offset by improvements in promotion and pricing optimization we expect sg a to deleverage by 55 to 60 basis points for the full year which includes the 35 basis points impact related to the adoption of the new lease accounting standards our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged first unit growth second investments in the business and third returning capital to our shareholders as for share repurchases we continue to expect our net debt to ebitda ratio to be in the range of approximately 1 2 to 1 5 times which excludes operating leases consistent with past practices in closing we are pleased with our financial performance and are confident that the investments we are making this year will continue to strengthen our business our strong free cash flow and healthy new store productivity position us well for continued growth and long term shareholder value creation with that we d like to open up the call for questions operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from rupesh parikh of oppenheimer your line is now open rupesh parikh oppenheimer analyst good morning and thanks for taking my questions so brad to start out so you just mentioned that comps you expect to be at the lower end of the full year for the full year so just curious what s driving comps to the lower end bradley s lukow interim co chief executive officer and chief financial officer yeah good morning rupesh reflecting on the first quarter we ve had some availability issues we talked to on the february call with regards to produce because of the heavy rains that we saw in california we saw some pretty significant what i d call hyper inflation in a number of product produce categories that really restricted our ability to get out quantities at a reasonable cost and that also reduced our ability to promote and therefore we had a little bit lower sales than we would have expected in produce as a result so it s really just reflective of the q1 produce situation as well into the early parts of q2 we ve seen some continued weather from a rains perspective in california and some cold weather out of mexico which has had some negative impact on availability in a number of produce items rupesh parikh oppenheimer analyst okay great and then on the competitive front so it sounds like your gross margin guidance before was flat now you re expecting it to be down slightly so just curious what you re seeing right now from a competitive standpoint bradley s lukow interim co chief executive officer and chief financial officer yeah competition remains pretty much in line with the last quarter it s a competitive environment what we saw on the non perishable side of the business starting in late q4 of last year and into the first half of q1 is a lot of the pent up cost increases started flowing through from suppliers driven by freight increases obviously there s a short squeeze typically when those cost increases come through relative to when they get pass through on shelf we are starting to see a lot of those cost increases now flow through to the shelf but because of the short squeeze you take a bit of a margin hit in the short term so that would be really our modest change from expecting to be approximately flat on gross margin which we said in february to now just being slightly deleveraged for the full year is our current expectation rupesh parikh oppenheimer analyst okay great thank you i ll pass along bradley s lukow interim co chief executive officer and chief financial officer you re welcome operator thank you and our next question comes from judah frommer of credit suisse your line is now open judah frommer credit suisse analyst hi thanks for taking the question maybe just a follow up on the drivers of gross margin there and the competition you mentioned is the retail pricing from the competitive landscape impact is that largely focused on produce or are you seeing that in non produce as well and would you say that the produce competition is fully tied to availability or is there more going on there as lower cost providers look to compete in that category bradley s lukow interim co chief executive officer and chief financial officer i think typically on produce items when there s changes in cost you see that retail prices get reflected fairly shortly thereafter particularly with commodity type items i would say that just from an overall competitive landscape point of view the front page ad remains competitive and certain markets are more competitive than others but again offsetting that on the non perishable side of the business we re starting to see a lot of pass through on the cost increases that came through through the end of the first half of the quarter judah frommer credit suisse analyst okay great and then maybe just going to the comp and then kind of the gaap to total sales you missed the consensus comp by a little bit but the total sales number looked fine which like you ve been telegraphing is due to new stores being more productive than they have been historically can you help us with the balance of comps and new store productivity going forward and any color you can give us on maybe comps by vintage or historical banners anything you can help us there bradley s lukow interim co chief executive officer and chief financial officer sure you re correct as we ve been talking about for the last number of quarters we continue to see terrific new store openings in particular in the new markets that we re expanding into which is important from our perspective because this year is a real meaningful change in terms of the percentage of stores opening up in new markets historically two thirds of our stores in any given year opened up in our existing markets sort of texas west this year 55 of our new stores the 28 stores that will open are opening up in new markets some of our largest grand opening week and openings in the new markets this year are the top in company history so we re very excited about what s happening for the at the consumer adoption of the sprouts farmers market brand across the us operator thank you and our next question comes from vincent sinisi of morgan stanley your line is now open michael kessler morgan stanley analyst hi guys this is actually michael kessler on for vinny here thanks for taking our question so just wanted to ask more on the expenses side so of course you guys have pretty solid expense control this quarter given investments you guys have been making so i was just wondering if you can maybe walk us through where you re at at this point as far as what you ve already done how much is left to be accomplished and maybe what the cadence of those investments are going to look like as we move through the year bradley s lukow interim co chief executive officer and chief financial officer yeah good morning as we pointed out in our guidance update there s no change to the sg a expectation for the year as we pointed out in our release and our remarks we did have some benefit in the first quarter as a result of the california food reduction of the expense from that point of view also we had a benefit of stock based compensation in the first quarter that would continue into the second quarter but reverse later in the back half of the year as well one of the offsets in the first quarter as everyone should be aware we lapped the 10 million incremental wage investments that we started at the beginning of the second quarter last year so that actually was a headwind of 25 basis points in the first quarter we now lapped that at the beginning of the second quarter from a strategic investment point of view as we pointed out in february we re on track to deliver on our fresh item management rollout across all the fresh departments that ll happen by the end of the third quarter so you ve got more of those rollout costs and inaudible costs coming through in q2 and q3 as well as we mentioned today we just launched our workday financials system that s up and live and we have q2 to q4 we ll have ongoing strategic investments in connection with our marketing and connected customer digital loyalty project so we still expect to be and again if you park the non cash impact of the lease accounting change which is 35 basis points hit to the p l we still expect to be 20 to 25 basis points deleveraged primarily related to the strategic investments as well as lapping that last year increase in wages michael kessler morgan stanley analyst great awesome that s very helpful and then just a quick follow up on the e commerce side you mentioned delivery up 60 in 1q i guess where given now that we re moving a little more into getting kind of across the entire the market that you guys operate in with delivery any kind of updates on what you re seeing with the results any new learnings from the rollout as we kind of move into a little more maturity here bradley s lukow interim co chief executive officer and chief financial officer sure we ve had tremendous success rolling out home delivery now across all of our markets and it was really only in this last quarter late in the last quarter that we rolled out into the southeast we re seeing pretty significant customer adoption i think from our perspective and based on our years of history with home delivery what really matters most in terms of how consumers make decisions around who to buy from is the quality of the product the consistency of making sure what the order is what gets delivered and ultimately it s the brand and the sprouts brand which is all about fresh is really resonating with customers so we see a continued increase in average weekly sales on home delivery by the end of this year it s going to be 1 75 to 2 of our total sales basket size it s 2 5 times that of the store and so our real focus is around there s going to be this continued shift of our consumer purchasing from both in the store and out of the store and we re up over 60 year over year on home delivery sales in the first quarter that will just continue our entire focus is really no longer just a focus around what happens in the store it s how do we engage with that consumer where and how they want to engage with us in the store out of a store digitally and we re focused entirely on maximizing share of wallet as we pointed out before the home delivery basket not only is significantly larger but the margin mix to us is much stronger relative to the mix of products that are being ordered online and even though we have the same prices online as we do in the store and some of our competitors do not the ad penetration on the home delivery orders is meaningfully below that of the store because it s really about a convenience factor from a consumer standpoint so overall i think kudos to the team that are leading the home delivery operation within sprouts and certainly the operators and the team members in the store are making it happen resulting in sprouts continuing to have the highest customer service rating on the instacart platform michael kessler morgan stanley analyst got it great all right thanks so much bradley s lukow interim co chief executive officer and chief financial officer you re welcome operator thank you and our next question comes from chuck grom of gordon haskett your line is now open john park gordon haskett analyst good morning this is actually john park on for chuck i mean i guess we obviously don t know what your internal expectation was here for the quarter but seemed to beat the street by 0 05 and then there s all the share repurchase that you guys have done seem to add another 0 04 to 0 05 of earnings this year of earnings this year but yet you only kind of raised the low end of your eps guidance by 0 01 so kind of what else has kind of changed here for more than not to flow through bradley s lukow interim co chief executive officer and chief financial officer yeah i ll just to clarify that we ve increased the bottom end of our guidance range by 0 02 the previous bottom range was 1 16 it s now to 1 18 and i think if you do the math on the amount of shares that we ve bought back the annualized impact is an incremental 0 02 operator thank you and our next question comes from scott mushkin of wolfe research your line is now open scott mushkin wolfe research analyst hey guys thanks for taking my questions and before i get there just our thoughts and prayers are with jim and hope hope he s ok second thing i would ask is i don t know we talked about it a little bit brad but if we could look at those sg a better sg as can we quantify some of those as one time or look at them some of those at one time and if we could what would you put that number at bradley s lukow interim co chief executive officer and chief financial officer yeah so first of all jim would have liked to have been here today he s had some health issues that he s taking care of at this time and he is of course anxiously looking forward to his return and so everyone in the company is certainly just focused on making sure he deals with his health and executing on our priorities for the year without any interruption as we pointed out scott in our earnings release and in our remarks the california food was a benefit because last year in the first quarter we were still paying that payroll tax and stock based comp was also a winner year over year those two items are roughly 20 basis points about a 10 bps each that benefited the first quarter the california food will be if you think about q2 q3 would be nominal and then it would reverse in q4 because we took the benefit in the fourth quarter when california got out of their deficit position with the fed so part of that is definitely timing in the first quarter the occupancy benefit that we had in the first quarter for some rent credits was expected in our full year but it came in a little bit earlier than we anticipated so all told those benefits were about 30 basis points now recall because we didn t lap the incremental wage investment until the beginning q2 that was a headwind embedded in our numbers in q1 of 25 basis points that goes away in q2 because we lap that operator thank you and our next question comes from paul trussell of deutsche bank your line is now open paul trussell deutsche bank analyst good morning just maybe taking a step back you had a few timing issues as you ve mentioned maybe just help us better understand the impact in 1q from cycling a strong cold flu season a year ago how we should think about the easter shift maybe impact to comps and margins from the produce availability issues and just any kind of updated thoughts on inflation for the year bradley s lukow interim co chief executive officer and chief financial officer sure cough cold flu from 2018 was probably the strongest season in recent memory if not ever so that had a pretty meaningful effect because of course the whole vitamins area of the business is typically strongest at the beginning of the year where people want to live healthier after the holiday season so that was a pretty big headwind in the first quarter and certainly the produce availability challenges because of the weather had a meaningful impact on our ability to a get quality product and b promote because of the some of the veg items cost inflation were in the 40 plus range in terms of cost increase and it s always challenging one to be able to promote when you can t get the good quality and if the cost is a lot higher you got to pass some of that along so definitely headwinds in q1 from an inflation standpoint we were overall inflationary on cost in the first quarter that was really driven by produce and meat we were seeing inflation from beef where exports are pretty significant so supply is tight herds are tight and we anticipate that continuing through the second quarter so our line of sight at this point in time we d expect the full year on a cost basis to be maybe 1 inflationary paul trussell deutsche bank analyst got it and then a big topic of conversation last quarter whether were headwinds that come from all the initiatives and investments being made whether it is in the rollout of the fresh item management or some of your technology and delivery initiatives and you kind of spoke about at least your current line of sight was a return to the double digit algorithm as we approach that kind of second half of 2020 just given we ve got one more quarter in the books any change to that thought process bradley s lukow interim co chief executive officer and chief financial officer no there s no change at all we sat back as a management team as we do every year last summer and really looked at what do we need to do to continue to drive our points of differentiation with our customer and how do we implement core infrastructure systems that are going to allow us to grow and scale efficiently and we certainly are pleased with what we ve executed to date and our plans remain intact to deliver on all these strategic initiatives this year we re extremely happy with the team that s rolling out the fresh item management that s critical for us we re starting to see some early wins and really it s about the customer and the work that we re going to do for the balance of the year building out our digital platform and strategy and loyalty i think that really positions us well to take it to the next level from a customer engagement point of view and so given the dollars that we re spending and obviously a significant increase this year when we think about 2020 and beyond obviously projects this year roll off some new ones roll on and that s why we re still feeling confident that we return to that double digit eps growth operator thank you and our next question comes from ken goldman of j p morgan your line is now open ken goldman j p morgan analyst hi i hate to ask this when jim s on medical leave and please pass along our well wishes but i just wanted a little more of a complete update if we could on the board s process in identifying a permanent head because it s been over five months since amin resigned that s a pretty long time for any company to operate without a fixed leader and brad you re now doing the job that three people used to right ceo cfo and coo i don t know that jim jim is just on temporary leave but how much bandwidth do you personally have to keep this going as is you re running a pretty large company i m sure this is taking up a lot of your time bradley s lukow interim co chief executive officer and chief financial officer thanks for the questions ken first of all i ll just stay with regards to the ceo permanent ceo search as you know these searches can typically take six to nine months as you point out inaudible the board has highly engaged the search committee in moving through to the conclusion of the search they re deep into it and we ll hopefully have something to share in the not too distant future look jim and i have worked together for three years and we have a very close relationship great working relationship and we haven t missed a beat since the end of last november where you got a deep management team they re executing on our strategic initiatives and yes well in this interim short period while jim s away his direct reports are now reporting in to me but if we think about the merch side of the business dave mcglinchey who s absolutely solid with over 20 years of experience in grocery and i ve been working actually closely with him for the last year he s been with us for two years he and the team are executing and running the business dan sanders who heads up our operations has decades of experience at senior levels running operations and has been with us for almost four years and as we pointed out i think over the last couple of calls dan s been really successful in bringing in some very seasoned svps of operations who have been running now for both the last year operations in the east and the west and as you know i took over real estate responsibilities as part of the planned development back in august september of last year and i ve run real estate in my past life for five six years so it s not about one person it never is the company has been focused over the last 24 plus months of building the bench and bringing in great talent and the fact is that we re now approaching a 6 billion company that has been pretty important and enabling us to attract top talent to the company so we re feeling very solid as a management team that we re continuing to execute yes we re busy but we wouldn t have it any other way ken goldman j p morgan analyst all right thank you for that that is very helpful i just wanted to sort of state though i ve been like many people on this call i ve been doing this a long time i cannot recall when it s taken nine months for a company to find a permanent ceo i just don t understand why the board wouldn t have a backup plan in place a sort of what happens if the ceo gets hit by a bus plan as they like to say so it s not really a question it s much of a statement but it just feels like a very long time to me for a big company so i ll let it go thank you bradley s lukow interim co chief executive officer and chief financial officer thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from robbie ohmes of bank of america merrill lynch your line is now open robert ohmes bank of america merrill lynch analyst oh hey brad thanks for taking my question hey brad at the beginning of the call i think you mentioned something about becoming more of a full grocery shop and kind of referencing it around produce historically being a good traffic driver for you i know it wasn t as helpful this quarter because of the lack of availability but could you maybe go a little deeper into that how the how sprouts is changing from its strategy which used to be probably a lot more heavily dependent on being the cheapest place in town to get produce and how you re going to keep how does that conversion work as you become more of a full grocery shop are you i understand adding the delis and everything are you changing items a lot or are you out adding more household supplies maybe a little more detail on that and then semi but not totally related to this with the new store the new markets that you re going into the comp coming in a little bit lighter at the low end for the year can you remind us how new stores coming into the comp base are contributing to the comps right now versus history thanks bradley s lukow interim co chief executive officer and chief financial officer sure thanks robbie i would say that over the last 2 5 years as we ve really focused on aligning our offering with what consumer trends are moving toward has been very helpful with regards to the deli area of the business we ve introduced a lot of newer items that are on trend and healthy and that s a real point of differentiation for us you can go to any supermarket and get something that you can pick up and eat that s convenient but there s a huge difference between what many other retailers offer and what sprouts offer and we re all about natural organic healthy ingredients at very good prices and that s exactly what our consumer research is telling us particularly in the deli area recent consumer research has come back and saying they the customer certainly enjoys our fresh offering in the deli area and in particular the fact that they can trust the ingredients that are contained within the products we brought on a fantastic chef in our business now probably 2 5 years ago who has deep global experience in creating fantastic items that are on trend with protein and different salads that are clean ingredient set merchandised beautifully and can execute that at store level and that s absolutely resonating with our customers and we re seeing continued sales growth and in fact our sales growth one of the top categories in the first quarter continue to be our deli i would say on the private label side the team has been built out over the last couple of years and expanded significantly because we see the size of the opportunity and for us we re now at 14 penetration we ve been growing at 150 basis points of penetration a year we now are at about 21 penetration about 21 penetration in grocery frozen and dairy it s approaching 20 and our go to market strategy is so significantly different it s all about taste it s all about clean ingredients set non gmo organic better for you ingredients fantastic taste and packaging and not only is our growth in the 20 plus range and comping double digits in private label consistently it s not about just introducing skus and that s driving the sales growth it s really more so the consumer adoption and more items in the basket and we continue to see baskets with private label in it that are 50 larger than our overall basket size so that we see a lot of tailwinds there we re at 14 pen now we see that going to 16 to 18 which obviously comes at a slightly better margin as well and i would just add that the new prototype store that we ve introduced we have five stores now six stores in place there ll be eight total incremental new format stores this year and then beyond 2019 every new store that we open is in this new prototype which is all about the customer experience particularly around deli and meat and seafood it s more of a theater with all the service from within a rectangular island within the store and production has been moved back in house the consumer feedback that we ve received on this new proto has been fantastic and the incremental sales that we re seeing in meat and seafood deli and in fact bakery have been very promising and positive and in fact exceeding our expectations so i know it s a bit of a long answer but there s a number of factors that are giving us a lot of confidence around we re not just a specialty grocer this is really about a natural organic fresh full grocery shop operator thank you and our next question comes from edward kelly of wells fargo your line is now open edward kelly wells fargo analyst hi guys good morning thanks for taking my call bradley s lukow interim co chief executive officer and chief financial officer good morning edward kelly wells fargo analyst my question so i want to start just on comps in q2 have you seen any improvement in trends so far in q2 i mean the tone on the call doesn t sound like it but we are cycling out of the flu issue we had the easter shifts into april any color you can help us with there bradley s lukow interim co chief executive officer and chief financial officer yeah good morning ed as we pointed out in our earlier on the call we are still seeing some challenges on the produce supply availability because of the combination of cold weather out of mexico and continued rains in california have hurt our availability now offsetting that in terms of our view for later in the quarter and into the summer and into the summer fruit is setting up to be a very solid season as compared to last year in particular cherries look to be a much better crop this year so that will be more helpful to the summer months edward kelly wells fargo analyst so to that point and this is kind of my other question here is that if we think about guidance for comp for the full year now being at the lower end of of the range i mean in order to get there i mean we kind of seem like we have to take down the back half too and i don t have you at this point comping by more than i don t know 2 or so now in the back half despite assuming sort of like a normal produce environment i guess is that fair how should we think about that i mean to me it s kind of a low number for you at this point so i m just kind of especially now we re talking 1 inflation for the year bradley s lukow interim co chief executive officer and chief financial officer yes so a couple of things number one our original guidance we gave a broad range at the beginning of the year just from the context of it s so difficult to project what happens with inflation deflation on the produce given an average six week growing season so we specifically called that out in february and we re aiming toward the midpoint of the range of 2 2 2 3 at the beginning of the year and then we had obviously had a challenge in the first quarter with availability which impacted our ability to promote and drive traffic into the store and that resulted in the lower comp in the first quarter and with some slight continuation in produce availability in the second quarter when we look out for the full year we re going to be below the midpoint of our previous range so somewhere in between the low end of the range and slightly higher as it relates to inflation in our specific comments it s not that all the cost inflation can be immediately passed through and so that obviously has some compression on top line as well as margin and so we re just looking at how that s going to play out over the next quarter or two as i did point out on the non perishable side we are now starting to see most people pass through the lion s share of those cost increases but that was more a headwind in the first quarter and slightly into the second quarter but that s starting to come through in shelf pricing operator thank you and our next question comes from mark carden of ubs your line is now open mark carden ubs analyst good morning thanks a lot for taking my questions so building on some of the earlier competition questions there have been a lot of headlines about one of your larger natural organic competitors getting more aggressive on price i know you guys have historically said that your core customer is a bit different but have you faced any more pressure any more pressure this time around and if it s not whole foods then where s the competition coming from thanks bradley s lukow interim co chief executive officer and chief financial officer sure thanks mark yeah while we don t specifically comment on any one given competitor i would say though we are pricing from an overall basket standpoint regardless the department is still meaningfully lower and our core customer is middle america and it s a different demographic and we have not seen any changes in trends when we look back over previous price moves and current price moves and also we locate our stores much closer to where our core customers reside as opposed to a high street destination center so for those two reasons we re really we re in a different space and not seeing any changes regardless of what competitors are out there doing there s no question fresh is an area of focus for everyone in the industry i mean that s the good news is that natural and organic is still projected to grow 6 plus percent top line over the next couple of years and with 60 of what we sell being anchored on fresh and natural we re in the sweet space and we see more and more of our customers as i pointed out on a previous question really being focused on expanding their shop with us across all the categories in the store as we are very much on trend in terms of where the customers are going so look it is a competitive market we have seen not across the board but typically you see some increased heat on front page ads in various markets and they tend to cycle market to market but that s being offset and balanced by the fact that on the non perishable side of the business cost increases related to freight are starting to get pass through on shelf so it s a bit of a balance mark carden ubs analyst great and then on the perishable side of the business how did the tightness in produce compare to last year s first quarter was this impactful on aggregate and is this something we should just consider to be simply normal in the first quarter due to weather thanks bradley s lukow interim co chief executive officer and chief financial officer yeah it was more impactful in the first quarter of this year and as we pointed out in the past the shoulder seasons if you will from sort of november through february are the most challenging to be able to predict because that time of the year much more significant component of produce items are being sourced from offshore outside of the us and you can have a number of challenges including tie ups at borders so it s more so it s more a difficult period of time to try and predict in that time of the year but as we think through the summer months here and as i pointed out looking like a better growing season certainly on the fruit side of the business in produce operator thank you and our next question comes from chris mandeville of jefferies your line is now open chris mandeville jefferies analyst hey good morning just one question for me so brad in the markets where fresh item management has already been rolled out how are the associates taking to the new system and i think you had mentioned a little bit earlier in the call that you re seeing some early wins is there anything you can quantify there in terms of improvement in shrink or out of thoughts bradley s lukow interim co chief executive officer and chief financial officer yeah thanks chris we re actually implementing the system we re rolling it out not by geography but really by department and we re now in bakery and meat and parts of deli and i think the most fundamental learning is that sort of late last year we identified that we needed to augment our training program in terms of making the new system and how to use it stick better and we re seeing much greater success rolling that out this year with this system i think the greatest challenge was to convince long standing team members that you need to trust the system to be honest with you that is the biggest challenge because everyone is in the habit of how to order and how to determine production quantities but the biggest learning and high is well when i rely on the system it actually works and so there s two ways you can go at fresh item management in terms of sequencing how you re rolling it out one is to optimize sales the second is to optimize shrink we ve taken i think the right approaches to optimize sales first and getting the production quantities set at the right levels so that we re not leaving sales on the table and then once you optimize sales you can go back and look at sku productivity and identify items where you can pull back on to enhance and improve the shrink situation so overall we re seeing nice wins as it relates to increasing sales in our stores and we have implemented computer assisted ordering for certain areas of the store like the back wall of produce we re seeing much better in stock positions some of the items in the deli are hanging meats and cheese is now on computer assisted ordering and we ve got production planning now in the rotisserie chicken area of the deli which we ve seen some probably the most meaningful step up in sales and productivity so it s going according to plan and we re very pleased with how we ve retooled the rollout and the training and it s sticking operator thank you and our next question comes from karen short of barclays your line is now open karen short barclays analyst hi thanks just a couple of clarifications for me so you ve obviously given cost inflation at the 1 level but can you maybe just clarify what you think retail inflation will be looking like for the full year and i mean i ask that in the context of your comp guidance because obviously comp guidance has not been increased and you ve given us an explanation as to why but inflation guidance has increased bradley s lukow interim co chief executive officer and chief financial officer yeah good morning karen certainly we ve seen a competitive marketplace with increased focus on fresh and produce and the situation in the first quarter of availability challenges any time you have significant inflation to the extent that we saw on a number of commodity important items you can t pass that through so you see a pretty significant difference between cost and retail inflation on those items and because that has continued into the first part of the second quarter that s really driven our view on comp sales for the full year karen short barclays analyst okay and then i guess maybe just on the competitive landscape in general i m still not totally clear are you saying that it remains competitive but it hasn t gotten worse because it kind of does sound like you re trying to indicate maybe it has gotten a little bit more aggressive can you just clarify bradley s lukow interim co chief executive officer and chief financial officer yeah i think in certain markets it has gotten more aggressive on front page ads but it s being offset to some extent by less aggressiveness as everyone seems to now be more than willing to pass through cost increases that quite frankly everyone s absorbed from late q4 right through the first half of q1 before any meaningful pass through so it s a bit of a bifurcation between on shelf versus on hand operator thank you and our next question comes from john heinbockel of guggenheim securities your line is now open john heinbockel guggenheim securities analyst so brad if you think about mature stores is it fair to think that they re probably comping 0 to 1 not just this quarter but i m thinking kind of looked out the last year and a half and maybe going forward 0 to 1 and then is that fair and then when you think about home delivery and fresh item management is it possible to move the dial on that maybe 100 bps that much and then the third part would be if not right if you think about your the level at which you need to leverage expenses if we re really looking 0 to 1 can you get the expense trajectory down to where you can leverage at 1 or bit below bradley s lukow interim co chief executive officer and chief financial officer sure thanks john look the identical stores that are the strongest performing in terms of store ebitda they are also the stores that are taking the lion s share of the cannibalization so we always look at the health of the business on a ex cannibalization basis and when you add back the cannibalization they re performing stronger than you suggested and so that s point number one as it relates to home delivery really our entire approach with regards to e com is more holistic in terms of wanting to engage with the customer however and wherever they want to engage and that s how we re building out our digital strategy and loyalty strategy from a leverage standpoint how do you leverage on a total company basis we do need a comp of around 3 but the identical stores which is the lion s share of the stores leverage at a significantly lower level of sales growth than that really again if we think about the entire full year 2019 our guidance has not changed with regards to roughly 20 to 25 basis points of de leverage all coming from the sg a line is really related to lapping through the first quarter the incremental wage investment as well as the strategic initiatives that we re executing on this year and only slight de leverage on the gross margin line operator thank you and that concludes our question and answer session for today i d like to turn the conference back over to brad lukow for closing comments bradley s lukow interim co chief executive officer and chief financial officer i would just like to thank everyone for joining us on the call today and we look forward to speaking and seeing with a number of you in the weeks to come thank you operator ladies and gentlemen thank

it is an honor and a privilege to participate once again in this annual hoover institution monetary policy conference the topic of this year s conference strategies for monetary policy is especially timely as you know the federal reserve system is conducting a review of the strategy tools and communication practices we deploy to pursue our dual mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability in this review we expect to benefit from the insights and perspectives that are presented today as well as those offered at other conferences devoted to this topic as we assess possible practical ways in which we might refine our existing monetary policy framework to better achieve our dual mandate goals on a sustained basis my talk today will not however be devoted to a broad review of the fed s monetary policy framework that process is ongoing and i would not want to prejudge the outcome but it will instead focus on some of the important ways in which economic models and financial market signals help me think about conducting monetary policy in practice after a career of thinking about it in theory 1 the role of monetary policy let me set the scene with a very brief and certainly selective review of the evolution over the past several decades of professional thinking about monetary policy i will begin with milton friedman s landmark 1967 american economic association presidential address the role of monetary policy 2 this article is of course most famous for its message that there is no long run exploitable tradeoff between inflation and unemployment and in this paper friedman introduced the concept of the natural rate of unemployment which today we call u 3 what is less widely appreciated is that friedman s article also contains a concise but insightful discussion of wicksell s natural rate of interest r in today s terminology the real interest rate consistent with price stability but while u and r provide key reference points in friedman s framework for assessing how far an economy may be from its long run equilibrium in labor and financial markets they play absolutely no role in the monetary policy rule he advocates his well known k percent rule that central banks should aim for and deliver a constant rate of growth of a monetary aggregate this simple rule he believed could deliver long run price stability without requiring the central bank to take a stand on model or estimate either r or u although he acknowledged that shocks would push u away from u and implicitly r away from r friedman felt the role of monetary policy was to operate with a simple quantity rule that did not itself introduce potential instability into the process by which an economy on its own would converge to u and r 4 in friedman s policy framework u and r are economic destinations not policy rule inputs of course i do not need to elaborate for this audience that the history of k percent rules is that they were rarely tried and when they were tried in the 1970s and the 1980s they were found to work much better in theory than in practice 5 velocity relationships proved to be empirically unstable and there was often only a very loose connection between the growth rate of the monetary base which the central bank could control and the growth rate of the broader monetary aggregates which are more tightly linked to economic activity moreover the macroeconomic priority in the 1980s in the united states the united kingdom and other major countries was to do whatever it takes to break the back of inflation and to restore the credibility squandered by central banks that had been unable or unwilling to provide a nominal anchor after the collapse of the bretton woods system by the early 1990s the back of inflation had been broken thank you paul volcker conditions for price stability had been achieved thank you alan greenspan and the time was right for something to fill the vacuum in central bank practice left by the realization that monetary aggregate targeting was not in practice a workable monetary policy framework although it was mostly unspoken there was a growing sense at the time that a simple systematic framework for central bank practice was needed to ensure that the hard won gains from breaking the back of inflation were not given away by short sighted discretionary monetary experiments that were poorly executed such as had been the case in the 1970s policy rate rules that vacuum of course was filled by john taylor in his classic 1993 paper discretion vs policy rules in practice again for this audience i will not need to remind you of the enormous impact this single paper had not only on the field of monetary economics but also and more importantly on the practice of monetary policy for our purposes today i will note that the crucial insight of john s paper was that whereas a central bank could pick the k in a k percent rule on its own without any reference to the underlying parameters of the economy including r and u a well designed rule for setting a short term interest rate as a policy instrument should john argued respect several requirements 6 first the rule should anchor the nominal policy rate at a level equal to the sum of its estimate of the neutral real interest rate r and the inflation target second to achieve this nominal anchor the central bank should be prepared to raise the nominal policy rate by more than one for one when inflation exceeds target the taylor principle and third the central bank should lean against the wind when output or via an okun s law relationship the unemployment rate deviates from its estimate of potential u in other words whereas in friedman s k percent policy rule u and r are destinations irrelevant to the choice of k in the taylor rule and most subsequent taylor type rules u and r are necessary inputs as woodford 2003 demonstrates theoretically the first two requirements for a taylor type rule are necessary for it to be consistent with the objective of price stability the third requirement that monetary policy lean against the wind in response to an output or unemployment gap not only contributes to the objective of price stability but is also obviously desirable from the perspective of a central bank like the fed that has a dual mandate the taylor approach to instrument rule specification has been found to produce good macroeconomic outcomes across a wide range of macroeconomic models moreover in a broad class of both closed and open economy dynamic stochastic general equilibrium or dsge models taylor type rules can be shown to be optimal given the underlying micro foundations of these models in original formulations of taylor type rules r was treated as constant and set equal to 2 percent and potential output was set equal to the congressional budget office cbo estimates of potential output or in specifications using the unemployment rate as the activity variable u was set equal to the cbo s estimate of the natural unemployment rate these assumptions were reasonable at the time and i myself wrote a number of papers with coauthors in the years before the global financial crisis that incorporated them 7 a dive into data dependence fast forward to today at each federal open market committee fomc meeting my colleagues and i consult potential policy rate paths implied by a number of policy rules as we assess what adjustments if any may be required for the stance of monetary policy to achieve and maintain our dual mandate objectives 8 a presentation and discussion of several of these rules has been included in the semiannual monetary policy report to the congress since july 2017 9 one thing i have come to appreciate is that as i assess the benefits and costs of alternative policy scenarios based on a set of policy rules and economic projections it is important to recognize up front that key inputs to this assessment including u and r are unobservable and must be inferred from data via models 10 i would now like to discuss how i incorporate such considerations into thinking about how to choose among monetary policy alternatives a monetary policy strategy must find a way to combine incoming data and a model of the economy with a healthy dose of judgment and humility to formulate and then communicate a path for the policy rate most consistent with the central bank s objectives there are two distinct ways in which i think that the path for the federal funds rate should be data dependent 11 monetary policy should be data dependent in the sense that incoming data reveal at any point in time where the economy is relative to the ultimate objectives of price stability and maximum employment this information on where the economy is relative to the goals of monetary policy is an important input into interest rate feedback rules after all they have to feed back on something data dependence in this sense is well understood as it is of the type implied by a large family of policy rules including taylor type rules discussed earlier in which the parameters of the economy needed to formulate such rules are taken as known but of course key parameters needed to formulate such rules including u and r are unknown as a result in the real world monetary policy should be and in the united states i believe is data dependent in a second sense policymakers should and do study incoming data and use models to extract signals that enable them to update and improve estimates of r and u as indicated in the summary of economic projections fomc participants have over the past seven years repeatedly revised down their estimates of both u and r as unemployment fell and real interest rates remained well below prior estimates of neutral without the rise in inflation those earlier estimates would have predicted figures 1 and 2 and these revisions to u and r appeared to have had an important influence on the path for the policy rate actually implemented in recent years one could interpret any changes in the conduct of policy as a shift in the central bank s reaction function but in my view when such changes result from revised estimates of u or r they merely reflect an updating of an existing reaction function in addition to u and r another important input into any monetary policy assessment is the state of inflation expectations since the late 1990s inflation expectations appear to have been stable and are often said to be well anchored however inflation expectations are not directly observable they must be inferred from models other macroeconomic information market prices and surveys longer term inflation expectations that are anchored materially above or below the 2 percent inflation objective present a risk to price stability for this reason policymakers should and do study incoming data to extract signals that can be used to update and improve estimates of expected inflation in many theoretical rational expectations models expected inflation is anchored at the target level by assumption from a risk management perspective it makes sense i believe to regularly test this assumption against empirical evidence financial markets and monetary policy extracting signal from noise because the true model of the economy is unknown either because the structure is unknown or because the parameters of a known structure are evolving i believe policymakers should consult a number and variety of sources of information about neutral real interest rates and expected inflation to name just two key macroeconomic variables because macroeconomic models of r and long term inflation expectations are potentially misspecified seeking out other sources of information that are not derived from the same models can be especially useful to be sure financial market signals are inevitably noisy and day to day movements in asset prices are unlikely to tell us much about the cyclical or structural position of the economy 12 however persistent shifts in financial market conditions can be informative and signals derived from financial market data along with surveys of households firms and market participants data as well as outside forecasts can be an important complement to estimates obtained from historically estimated and calibrated macroeconomic models 13 interest rate futures and interest rate swaps markets provide one source of high frequency information about the path and destination for the federal funds rate expected by market participants figure 3 interest rate option markets under certain assumptions can offer insights about the entire ex ante probability distribution of policy rate outcomes for calendar dates near or far into the future figure 4 and indeed when one reads that a future policy decision by the fed or any central bank is fully priced in this is usually based on a straight read of futures and options prices but these signals from interest rate derivatives markets are only a pure measure of the expected policy rate path under the assumption of a zero risk premium for this reason it is useful to compare policy rate paths derived from market prices with the path obtained from surveys of market participants which while subject to measurement error should not be contaminated with a term premium market and survey based estimates of the policy rate path are often highly correlated but when there is a divergence between the path or destination for the policy rate implied by the surveys and a straight read of interest rate derivatives prices i place at least as much weight on the survey evidence for example derived from the surveys of primary dealers and market participants conducted by the federal reserve bank of new york as i do on the estimates obtained from market prices figure 3 the treasury yield curve can provide another source of information about the expected path and ultimate longer run destination of the policy rate but again the yield curve like the interest rate futures strip reflects not only expectations of the path of short term interest rates but also liquidity and term premium factors thus to extract signal about policy from noise in the yield curve a term structure model is required but different term structure models can and do produce different estimates of the expected path for policy and thus the term premium moreover fluctuations in the term premium on u s treasury yields are driven in part by a significant global factor which complicates efforts to treat the slope of the yield curve as a sufficient statistic for the expected path of u s monetary policy clarida 2018c again here surveys of market participants can provide useful information for example about the expected average federal funds rate over the next 10 years which provides an alternative way to identify the term premium component in the u s treasury curve quotes from the treasury inflation protected securities tips market can provide valuable information about two key inputs to monetary policy analysis long run r and expected inflation 14 direct reads of tips spot rates and forward rates are signals of the levels of real interest rates that investors expect at various horizons and they can be used to complement model based estimates of r in addition tips market data together with nominal treasury yields can be used to construct measures of breakeven inflation or inflation compensation that provide a noisy signal of market expectations of future inflation but again a straight read of breakeven inflation needs to be augmented with a model to filter out the liquidity and risk premium components that place a wedge between inflation compensation and expected inflation as is the case with the yield curve and interest rate futures it is useful to compare estimates of expected inflation derived from breakeven inflation data with estimates of expected inflation obtained from surveys for example the expected inflation over the next 5 to 10 years from the university of michigan surveys of consumers figure 5 market and survey based estimates of expected inflation are correlated but again when there is a divergence between the two i place at least as much weight on the survey evidence as on the market derived estimates the examples i have mentioned illustrate the important point that in practice there is not typically a clean distinction between model based and market based inference of key economic variables such as r and expected inflation the reason is that market prices reflect not only market expectations but also risk and liquidity premiums that need to be filtered out to recover the object of interest for example expected inflation or long run r this filtering almost always requires a model of some sort so even market based estimates of key inputs to monetary policy are to some extent model dependent implications for monetary policy let me now draw together some implications of the approach to models markets and monetary policy i have laid out in these remarks macroeconomic models are of course an essential tool for monetary policy analysis but the structure of the economy evolves and the policy framework must be and i believe at the federal reserve is nimble enough to respect this evolution while financial market signals can and sometimes do provide a reality check on the predictions of a model gone astray market prices are at best noisy signals of the macroeconomic variables of interest and the process of filtering out the noise itself requires a model and good judgment survey estimates of the long run destination for key monetary policy inputs can and at the fed do complement the predictions from macro models and market prices figure 6 15 yes the fed s job would be much easier if the real world of 2019 satisfied the requirements to run friedman s k percent policy rule but it does not and has not for at least 50 years and our policy framework must and does reflect this reality this reality includes the fact that the u s economy is in a very good place the unemployment rate is at a 50 year low real wages are rising in line with productivity inflationary pressures are muted and expected inflation is stable moreover the federal funds rate is now in the range of estimates of its longer run neutral level and the unemployment rate is not far below many estimates of u plugging these estimates into a 1993 taylor rule produces a federal funds rate very close to our current target range for the policy rate 16 so with the economy operating at or very close to the fed s dual mandate objectives and with the policy rate in the range of fomc participants estimates of neutral we can i believe afford to be data dependent in both senses of the term as i have discussed as we assess what if any further adjustments in our policy stance might be required to maintain our dual mandate objectives of maximum employment and price

roughly the same time phelps 1967 derived similar results using a formal economic model return to text 4 another consideration motivating friedman s choice of rule was his concern that a more active monetary policy strategy might be difficult to formulate because of the long and variable lags in the effect of monetary policy a term he had coined in friedman 1948 p 254 return to text 5 see clarida galí and gertler 1999 result 10 p 1687 monetary targeting was adopted to a limited degree by the federal reserve and other central banks in the 1970s and 1980s but it did not endure even during the period from 1979 to 1982 when the federal open market committee was most focused on monetary aggregates policymakers were still concerned with interest rates in the setting of policy and ultimate objectives for the output gap and inflation figured as criteria for policy decisions see for example taylor 1995 1999 clarida 1999 and clarida galí and gertler 2000 in addition poole 1970 and woodford 2003 are key references on the theoretical criticisms of monetary targeting return to text 6 on the specification and properties of the taylor rule see especially taylor 1993 1999 as well as clarida galí and gertler 1999 2000 and woodford 2003 another key study of simple interest rate rules was henderson and mckibbin 1993 it should be noted that a taylor type rule is an instrument rule for achieving the inflation objective that enters the rule in practice it is one way to implement a flexible inflation targeting regime see bernanke and others 1999 and svensson 1997 1999 for important contributions on the considerations involved in specifying an inflation targeting monetary policy strategy return to text 7 see for example clarida galí and gertler 1999 2000 return to text 8 for the

text 11 see clarida 2018a 2018b return to text 12 uncertainty regarding r u and long term inflation expectations is not the only source of uncertainty that has implications for monetary policy edge laubach and williams 2005 show how the duration of a productivity shock can affect even the direction of the best monetary policy response erceg and others 2018 find that even in conditions of substantial output gap uncertainty and uncertainty about the slope of the phillips curve a notable response to the estimated output gap in a taylor type rule is generally beneficial and eusepi and preston 2018 show that replacing model consistent expectations with forms of adaptive learning means that some but not all of the key results regarding best conduct in monetary policy under full information carry through return to text 13 like many others i believe that monetary policy should respond to financial market fluctuations when they have material implications for our outlook for employment and inflation but monetary policy should not generally target asset prices themselves the federal reserve uses survey data and conducts surveys of its own on a range of macroeconomic and financial conditions among the surveys the fed conducts are the senior loan officer opinion survey on bank lending practices and the senior credit officer opinion survey on dealer financing terms in addition the staff at the federal reserve board uses disaggregated and high frequency data to estimate the state of the economy in real time such data include disaggregated labor market data from adp and data on expenditures from credit card transactions return to text 14 well before the launch of the tips market friedman 1984 stressed the benefits to monetary policy analysis that would arise from the availability of market based estimates of longer term inflation expectations and he contrasted that situation with the one then prevailing in which it was difficult to ascertain the real yields implied by the market s longer term nominal yields in a similar vein campbell and clarida 1987 p 105 observed also in the pre tips era that it is hard to measure expected long term inflation rates

chief financial officer yes and thank you susan for your very kind words and your inspirational leadership i have learned more from you in the last five years than in my entire career and i thank you immensely my husband and i took the road less traveled when we moved from california to new jersey five years ago and being part of the american water team turned out to be the best career decision of my life and i would not trade this experience for anything in the world and to our analysts and investors i want you to know that one of my favorite things to do is to meet with you and discuss the american water story and listen to your insights and views you were truly the grand teachers and thought leaders of our industry it has been an absolute pleasure learning from all of you so now after 30 years in the utility industry this decision to retire is the hardest career decision i have made and at the same time the easiest personal decision for me and my family it s hard because i love everything about american water the leadership team my colleagues my team the board and our collective ability to do what we say we re going to do i believe american water is the best run utility in the nation and with our announcement today bringing susan hardwick on board i am confident it will continue to be just that personally this is an easy decision for me advertisement advertisement my coast to coast family is rapidly expanding with two grandsons and a granddaughter due in june and i m fortunate in this stage of life to be able to follow that strong pull of my heart and it s really hard to explain the way grandchildren make you feel but there is a song lyric and it s by andy grammar that s sums it up pretty well it says i think i finally found my hallelujah so i also love the work i do on several boards and am eager to spend more time pursuing that passion plus my bucket size is approaching the size of a novel and my husband tom and i look forward to living those dreams i would like to thank the leadership team and board for being so understanding and gracious about my decisions and working with me through a strong succession plan i m thrilled to have susan hardwick join the team she will bring tremendous value to american water susan story president and chief executive officer thanks linda as always linda will cover our financial results in just a few minutes unfortunately our coo walter lynch is in arkansas due to the passing of his father in law alex street many of you know that walter is a west point graduate and an army veteran and mr advertisement advertisement street also served our country in the army at 80 years old he was still a practicing attorney after more than 50 years we applaud his life commitment to his family and the values we hold dear at american water integrity service and unwavering commitment to his community and country so now moving onto our first quarter results the employees of american water delivered solid performance and further strengthened our low risk and predictable growth story our first quarter 2019 adjusted earnings per share were up 3 4 compared to the first quarter of 2018 as a reminder we had an extraordinary first quarter of 2018 with a 13 5 eps increase from the previous year primarily due to the impact of finalizing both the pennsylvania and the missouri general rate cases in 2018 which linda will discuss in more detail while american water does not give quarterly guidance our first quarter results were 0 01 ahead of plan for the quarter given our performance year to date we are affirming our 2019 adjusted eps guidance of 3 54 to 3 64 per share as well as affirming guidance to the top half of our 7 to 10 eps compound annual growth rate through 2023 also consistent with our previous dividend guidance on april 17 our board of directors increased our quarterly cash dividend payment from 0 455 to 0 50 per share a 9 9 increase the company has increased its dividend every year since our ipo in april of 2008 with consistent annual increases of around 10 per year since 2013 the foundation for our earnings growth continues to be the capital investment we make in our regulated operations so that we can provide clean safe and reliable service we invested 337 million total this quarter with a majority for infrastructure improvements in our regulated businesses we minimized the customer bill impacts of these investments through a continued focus on controlling o m cost these cost savings are driven by optimizing capital spend through value engineering and volume procurement constructive regulatory mechanisms and deploying technology developed with input from both our employees and our customers i ll talk more on the next slide about our continuing progress on regulated acquisitions and their contributions to our long term growth story advertisement advertisement earnings were up year over year in our market based businesses this was due primarily to growth customer contracts from homeowner services of note we have a very successful new partnerships with philadelphia where we have added more than 100 000 contracts since we launched the partnership in october of 2018 that type of growth would not be possible without our exceptional customer service and our combined homeowner services has an a rating from the better business bureau our military services group added the wright patterson air force base contract in 2018 and we begin full operations at fort leonard wood army base yesterday may 1 we still expect to see decisions by the department of defense on up to three military base awards for which we are competing this year turning to slide 8 let s talk more about growth across our regulated footprints we have closed on five acquisitions in four different states so far in 2019 three of these were water systems in kentucky indiana and missouri and two were wastewater acquisitions in kentucky and pennsylvania these closed acquisitions resulted in 4 700 new customer connections and they join more than 3 000 customer connections we added through organic growth in the first quarter we also look forward to adding another 61 500 customer connections through signed agreements in nine states most of which we expect to close in 2019 this includes our most recent agreement to acquire east pasadena water company in california adding 2 900 new connections just as a reminder typically a customer connection or meter represents on average 2 5 to 3 people based on the specific state at american water we believe that all people should have clean and safe water at affordable prices regardless of where they live or their socioeconomic status advertisement advertisement these new agreements reflect our commitment to provide water and wastewater solutions to communities across the united states moving to slide 9 customers remain at the center of every decision we make today and into the future this means smart investments balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment as we make these critical investments to maintain reliable service we must also ensure affordability for our customers we do this by putting a laser focus on both o m efficiency as well as capital investment efficiency this is why our 31 5 o m efficiency goal by 2023 is so important as a reminder this ratio represents how many cents of o m we spend for every dollar of revenue meaning we want more dollars to go to investment so we can make our system safer stronger and more reliable our employees live in the communities we serve and they re committed to serving their neighbors and families with the best quality of water and water services at affordable prices let me give you just one example of how we re driving further efficiencies we are finding that due to a growing national shortage of trucking personnel the prices of materials and equipment are rising and scheduling has become more challenging so we developed a supply chain strategy to continue to diversify and optimize our suppliers and their willingness to locate closer distribution points so their states operations are more cost effective when we roll these savings into other cost efficiencies we get by leveraging our large size and purchasing power we will save approximately 33 million a year just on the purchases of meters hydrants valves and pipes slide 10 summarizes many points i just covered again we re affirming our 2019 eps guidance range of 3 54 to 3 64 as well as affirming guidance to the top half of our 7 to 10 eps compound annual growth through 2023 we are off to a good start this year and we look forward to continuing to deliver stable and predictable results and with that i ll turn it over to linda for her comments linda sullivan chief financial officer thank you susan i ll start on slide 12 we had a solid first quarter of 2019 especially compared to a very strong first quarter 2018 gaap earnings were 0 62 per share an increase of 0 03 compared to the first quarter last year included in gaap earnings was a favorable adjustment of 4 million or 0 01 per share to reflect a reduction in the settlement liability related to the freedom industries chemical spill this reduction is based on our latest determination of the final claims costs in total our share of the original 126 million freedom industries related settlement has been reduced to 19 million through insurance recoveries and lower claims excluding this benefit first quarter earnings were up 3 4 which came in 0 01 above our plan our strong market based earnings offset partially by timing items in the regulated business in parent other highlights include achieving a consolidated adjusted return on equity of 10 for the 12 month period ended first quarter 2019 executing on our capital investment strategy by investing 337 million during the quarter and adding 36 million in annualized new authorized revenue since the beginning of this year turning to slide 13 let me provide more detail on our first quarter adjusted earnings results i ll start on the left hand side of this page as you can see we had a very strong first quarter of 2018 up 13 5 over first quarter 2017 on settlement of both the pennsylvania and missouri general rate cases last year first quarter 2019 increased 3 4 on a quarter over quarter basis which reflects some timing impacts that i will discuss in more detail as i cover each business let me start with our regulated businesses which were up 0 01 per share revenue was up 0 08 in total and included increases from authorized rate cases infrastructure mechanisms and acquisitions these increases were partially offset by lower demand and a 0 02 benefit in the first quarter of last year as our missouri general rate case did not begin to adjust customer rates for the lower federal income tax rate until may 28 2018 lastly i should note we did not see any material impact from weather during the first quarter of 2019 next we had higher o m expense of 0 01 per share from something we are very proud of for finalization of our union negotiated national benefits agreement last year we now include our 17 national unions in our annual performance plans this puts our 7 100 employees on the same annual performance plan where the annual payout is based on company performance tied to the goals you see in our proxy statement so from our ceo to the front line our goals are aligned we believe this investment in our employees will further enable us to meet our o m efficiency goals allowing us to reduce the customer bill impact at our critically needed infrastructure investments depreciation and interest expense were each up 0 03 per share to support investment growth our market based businesses had a strong quarter up 0 04 or 57 with homeowner services up 0 03 from the acquisition of pivotal and new customer additions military services was up a 0 01 from the addition of wright patterson air force base and an increase in capital work at vandenberg lastly the parent decreased 0 03 from three separate items each 0 01 per share first we had higher interest expense to support growth next we had a tax adjustment that was favorable in 2018 and we also had 0 01 of expense timing turning to slide 14 i will provide an update on our regulatory proceedings we settled two rate cases in the first quarter of 2019 in west virginia and maryland and implemented our three year rate increase under our four year plan in new york effective april 1 in west virginia we received approval of our of an annualized revenue increase of 19 million an roe of 9 75 and an increased equity ratio to a 48 4 the case was driven by 200 million of infrastructure investment since our last rate case in 2016 additionally the distribution system improvement charge was reset to provide for additional investment this surcharge will be offset by the amortization of deferred tax savings under the tax cuts and jobs act in maryland we received approval of an annualized revenue increase of over 1 million an estimated roe of 9 9 and an equity ratio of 48 7 the case was driven by 18 million of investments since 2015 during that time the company constructed a new 90 million gallon reservoir and intake near bel air maryland this new reservoir is now in service and provides a long term safe and reliable water supply and economic opportunity in that region we also have three pending rate cases in indiana virginia and kentucky and filed our preliminary application for our california general rate case in indiana we reached an agreement on the with the major parties on our rate case if approved the new rates will reflect a revenue increase of 7 5 million 17 5 million over two steps an roe of 9 8 and an equity ratio of 53 4 the settlement shows that at the end of the 2020 future test year indiana american water will have invested over 500 million in infrastructure upgrades since its last rate case in 2015 regarding the tax cuts and jobs act indiana american water already reduced its customer rates by 4 4 on august 1 2018 and the agreement includes credit for the period before august 1 to be spread to customers over 12 months starting in may 2020 a final order is expected by mid 2019 moving to virginia we implemented interim water and wastewater rates on may 1 the general rate case requested an overall increase of 5 million driven by approximately 98 million in infrastructure upgrades since april of 2017 the final rate order could take several months in kentucky our general rate case requested nearly 20 million in additional annualized revenues and was driven by more than 100 million in capital investment since the last rate case in 2016 and yesterday california american water filed a preliminary application for its 2021 through 2023 general rate case that includes a first year revenue increase of 23 9 million followed by annual step increases that would support 200 million of infrastructure projects california is also awaiting a decision on its step increase for 2019 turning to slide 15 today we are affirming our 2019 adjusted earnings guidance range of 3 54 to 3 64 per share this excludes the 0 01 favorable impact from the reduction of the liability associated with our freedom industries related settlement which is included in our 2019 gaap earnings guidance range included in our annual guidance range are several variables with the most significant potential variable being the impact of weather and as a reminder we consider plus or minus 0 06 of weather to be normal weather variability included in our earnings guidance range with the largest weather impact typically occurring in the summer months or third quarter of each year on a long term basis we are affirming our 2019 to 2023 long term eps guidance in the top half of our 7 to 10 compound annual growth range anchored off 2017 adjusted earnings turning to slide 16 let me discuss our balance sheet as we look at our cash flow impact from tax reform originally we expected lower cash flow of about 500 million from 2018 through 2022 this has improved by 120 million following the pivotal acquisition you can see that the estimated impact is largest in 2020 when we expect to become a cash taxpayer but then declines quickly as rate base grows and becomes positive by 2022 also as we continue to refine our estimates we are now forecasting becoming a cash taxpayer in the second half of 2020 versus our prior estimate at a full year in 2020 now the actual impact will be largely dependent upon the outcome of our regulatory proceedings regarding tax reform also i am pleased to report that our 2018 debt to capitalization ratio came in better than expected at 59 in 2018 further showing our balance sheet strength and cash flow management incorporating the better 2018 results into our five year plan we have lowered our expected long term debt to cap levels by a full percentage point to a range of 61 to 62 by 2023 and i should note that debt to cap ratio includes both long term and short term debt in terms of credit ratings earlier this year moody s downgraded american water from aaa to baa1 with a stable outlook although disappointing we expect the expect to be minimum and as you know in the second quarter of 2018 s p reaffirmed our a credit rating with a stable outlook in summary we continue to have a very strong balance sheet and we do not see the need to issue new equity with our current five year plan under normal operating conditions turning to slide 17 we are committed to continue to deliver customer and shareholder value with our announced increase in dividends of 9 9 our five year compound annual growth rate in dividends is 10 1 and we have now have had consistent annual dividend increases since 2013 looking forward we expect to grow our dividend at the top end of our 7 to 10 eps growth range subject to board approval and we continue our targeted dividend payout ratio of 50 to 60 of earnings our total company adjusted return on equity is holding steady at 10 for the 12 months period ended march 31 our weighted average authorized return on equity across our regulated footprint remains at about 9 8 and we have consistently delivered strong total shareholder returns far outpacing the uty index and s p 500 over the one three and five year periods through this disciplined financial management customers and shareholders may be confident that american water will continue to deliver value with that i ll turn it back over to susan susan story president and chief executive officer thanks linda we never forget at american water that at the end of every waterpipe there is a family depending on the safety of the water they give their children that at every fire hydrant life depends on the water being there at the right pressure that at every wastewater plant we are a shield between our customers and disease we re very proud to announce our most recent award from the water research foundation to continue research on legionella while legionella is primarily an issue in customer owned plumbing and not even on our side of the meter we think it s critical that we further educate and protect our customers for contaminants that could impact their water quality as a reminder we ve had an r d group at american water since 1981 and our newest research grant is one of over 100 we ve received on topics ranging from emerging contaminants to water recycling and reuse to ground breaking water technologies we know that employees customers and investors are seeking to align themselves with and invest in companies that are actively committed to the betterment of society our planet and our communities we believe that successful financial performance follows doing these things as part of our purpose driven values culture i was fortunate to be asked to participate on the panel at the recent s p global esg evaluation launch the key topics at the launch were esg risk quantification developing more standardized esg measures and improving timeliness of reporting s p as well as moody s have indicated that esg measures will be an important input into evaluation of risk to overall financial performance capability of companies and their subsequent credit ratings we re committed to bringing even more transparency in giving you the esg information that you want but the wide ranging and nonstandardized measurements today create inconsistency in reporting and comparisons timeliness of data is a big issue as many of the rankings and ratings we ve seen recently are based on data from as far back as 2016 and don t reflect progress that many companies have made over the past few years we ve engaged a leading esg consulting firm and they ve recently completed a materiality assessment for us this effort included detailed interviews with and data research from investors credit rating analysts regulators customers elected officials environmental and esg activists and our own board members and employees we will use that input to provide more complete and timely information that is most important to the stakeholders we serve and we look forward to your continuing feedback in closing i mentioned earlier about the professional accomplishments of linda sullivan over the past five years but i would be remorse if would didn t end on something even more important for personal influence and impacts on the heart and soul of who we are as a company linda has the highest integrity she s smart quick and strategic and she s always asking how can we get better she cares deeply about our employees our customers our communities and our shareholders she s been a cfo that i depend on everyday to do the fundamentals very best and to look beyond the horizon to what s next week she treats every single person with respect and dignity i can honestly say that i have learned something from her every day she is my colleague my hero and my friend and i will miss her tremendously for those of you who know her well you understand that this last slide linda loves three things very much her family american water and corvettes so many of you will see linda susan and me with ed and ralph over the next two months on investor visits and while linda s not returning until august 1 this will be her last earnings call and in and out of things to come i will share with you another first for american water we are one of only three s p 500 companies with a female ceo and cfo team and on july 1 we will have the distinction as the only company for both women even have the same first name just another way we re trying to make things easy for you so with that we re happy to take your questions questions answers operator our first question comes from agnieszka storozynski with macquarie research please go ahead agnieszka storozynski macquarie research analyst linda congratulations i m very happy for you and we will live vicariously for your travels linda sullivan chief financial officer thank you so much angie agnieszka storozynski macquarie research analyst thank you so i wanted to ask about california about the recent acquisitions i mean i was a little bit surprised i always thought that most of the municipal m as is going to come from the northeast but some of those are not even m a but could you talk a little bit more about this susan story president and chief executive officer sure angie and thank you for the question so this is what we call as you know a tuck in and in california there is significant interest from the public utility commission to help the stress systems throughout the state we saw that at the cost of capital hearings in some of the discussions that resulted in the increase in our cost of capital our plan that we guide to is basically assuming that all of our acquisitions are these smaller tuck ins and you will have larger systems of course as you said and if you look at our history of acquisitions more have been in the northeast and in midwest this was a an opportunistic acquisition we re pleased to have these folks on board is a roll in to service area of where we already are and again we have in the past several months seen for us anyway constructive outcomes at the california puc including the approval of the monterey desalination facility as part of the water supply project as well as the last general rate case outcome linda sullivan chief financial officer and angie if i can add to that in our cost of capital decision as susan mentioned we did have a lot of conversations about investments in california and it s really important to note that although our roe decreased to 9 2 in that proceeding our equity ratio increased from 53 to 55 4 agnieszka storozynski macquarie research analyst great and just one last question about new jersey is there any progress on the implementation of this new jersey water quality accountability act meaning as far as it relates to municipal m a susan story president and chief executive officer yes that s a great question angie so many of you know that the first step in implementation was that water providers in the state of new jersey were going to have to certify to certain parts of those regulations that is happening though as the regulations are currently still being developed by the dep in new jersey to be rolled out further so we were the first to certify for us it was more business as usual so we are just now starting to see some of the certifications coming in it s our understanding that there may be one or two i think a university that may be looking at consolidating those type of certifications and looking where different systems stand in the state so it s in the early stages the regulations are still being promulgated and we look forward to in continued roll out over the next probably 6 to 12 months operator our next question comes from richard verdi with coker palmer please go ahead richard verdi coker and palmer analyst and before i asked my question i just wanted to say linda i wish you all the best in your retirement congratulations and that i really appreciate all the time that you gave me from what i would pester you for to do a conference call with investors with me or to go on a road to visit investors so i appreciated all that time i wanted to say that and make sure you knew that and i wish you all the best in your retirement congratulations on a well deserved retirement still i m sure linda sullivan chief financial officer rich thank you so much and it was my pleasure to have those discussions with you richard verdi coker and palmer analyst thank you very much so just kind of i m pretty clear on everything for the quarter just kind of i guess more of a high level question last month we sold a new jersey department of environmental protection announced that it has plan to set standards for the pfos contamination and they re much more strict than the epa s guidelines and it appears other states are going to implement similar standard as well so i was just kind of hoping maybe you could discuss a little bit about how that could impact the company on a regulated side in terms of the acquisition front and then on in terms of what it could mean to cost to the companies since it ll it s going to need to deal with the stricter standards as well and then on top of that how it could also impact the company in terms of the military business because driver of this contamination is caused by the fire extinguisher firm foam used on this military bases everyday when they are running their drills and so i would think that that would be something with this pfos contamination could be an impetus to see more of those military bases pursue o m contracts with the likes of american water so i just wondered if you could give us some high level color on how this pfos contamination could impact the company susan story president and chief executive officer rich thank you for this this is probably one of the largest emerging issues that will need to be addressed across the country those from states that are doing their own limits p5 as well as epa actually yesterday came out from what most people don t understand while the epa has a recommended maximum contaminant level there really isn t a regulation it is not actually a regulated chemical what it is is they re recommending not to have over certain limits but they don t have the force of regulation behind it the epa came out yesterday i read and basically said they are going to do it they are looking at the levels that they were using for maximum contaminant levels that weren t regulated of 70 parts per trillion new jersey as you mentioned has come in with a much lower i believe 13 parts per trillion to your point about the company i mentioned it s interesting you asked this question because i mentioned in my final remarks about the role of our r d group we ve been doing research on these perfluorinated chemicals for decades and in fact and i ll talk about military first then i ll come back to the regulated business we have actually already been working on a couple or three of our military basis to actually treat p5 we have mobile units where we can actually do on site decontamination and for example at picatinny arsenal in new jersey we ve done tremendous work already with a couple of wells there that we serve it we believe from the military installation standpoint it s actually a competitive advantage for us we have treated two levels that are at or below what the new jersey requirements are we know how to do that so this is a serious situation and if you want to get a nice four five page premier for those are there who want to know the national institute of environmental health services has a wonderful three or four page premier because some people use pfos pfoas they re all part of group of pfcs called perfluorinated chemicals and they are all man made materials and the issue comes in is that they are as you said firefighting foam teflon it comes from even stainmaster things that repel grease and water and it s been used for decades and so what is happened is as it gets into the water source of the environment that it just stays and it s consumed by humans it just doesn t get released from the body for years and years and that s where the concern is coming so this is a very serious issue we applaud all of the different states as well as the epa for making this a priority we actually see this is a very good thing we are very supportive of all of the actions being taken on the pfcs and our different states and we really want to be part of being a solutions provider for those and see it as a strength given all the research and actual deployment we ve done on how to decontaminate these out of water supplies operator our next question comes from jonathan reeder with wells fargo please go ahead jonathan reeder wells fargo analyst i wanted to echo everyone else s remarks linda congrats on the retirement decision i know you re going to continue to have fun through the rest of your life as you have been while at american water works and i think i understand how it s an easy personal decision for you to make then last point i thought when susan was saying for the first time in american water works history and have just been talking about corvette i thought she was going to say there was a new corvette waiting for you in the parking lot maybe they don t like you that much i don t know linda sullivan chief financial officer i was hoping that too jonathan but it didn t happen jonathan reeder wells fargo analyst it is ok yes so anyway susan i just want to ask you in light of the recent rate case outcome how do you think about west virginia in terms of inner core state for you i know in some previous rate cases there there were challenging outcomes plus kind of a the freedom of end was treated feeding less than kind of equitable to you guys so i was just wondering how do you view west virginia today susan story president and chief executive officer so west virginia first of all for those who ve never been there it s a beautiful state and we have been in west virginia since the 1880s and the last two rate cases outcomes we ve had including a settlement i mean this was a settlement reach without parties we re very constructive because in west virginia there is a realization maybe as much as any other state about the importance of clean water and safe water and it s not just an issue for american water the public providers of water there and wastewater services see this same thing so we have some wonderful employees in west virginia we have some outstanding customers in west virginia and we re are very excited that there is a growing realization from all of the parties the stakeholders as well as the regulatory commission about the importance of investment for the future to ensure that that state can continue to grow economically and have a safe water wastewater and fire protection system for its citizens linda sullivan chief financial officer and jonathan i ll add to that as well as you know west virginia now has a decent mechanism as well for continuing investment in the state and as

to turn the call over to paul paul g reitz president and chief executive officer thanks todd good morning and appreciate everybody joining the call let s jump right into our business and q1 our first quarter was not the start to the year we had planned compared to our expectations number of factors impacting our business really across the board there first major factor impacting north america right now is the weather conditions we have seen early season flooding in the parts of the western farming area followed by late snow across much of the midwest earlier this week a levee broke in downtown davenport iowa this clearly highlights the extent of this issue at the time if you look at it all major ag states are reporting that planting is behind 5 year averages in fact illinois which is the second largest corn producing state is at approximately 10 corn planted versus a normal pace of 43 by late april i realized most folks on this call spend their days on the inside looking out but tough weather conditions in the spring hit farmers really hard has an almost immediate impact on our aftermarket business as farmers are going to be spending money when they can t get into their fields and they are really looking to start pushing out some of those expenses and purchases as long as they can overall our north american sales relatively flat however we did implement pricing related incentives targeted at certain products to combat these weather conditions and the resulting slower pace of sales based on all nearly all metrics pointing to pent up demand in ag sector along with our own internal knowledge and the external customer information we re receiving we d expected higher sales to start this year and had built up the necessary trained staff ready to work along with some inventory to meet this forecasted uptick in demand we believe implementing these targeted sales incentives was the right decision in these particular circumstances but those actions did weigh on our q1 margins to the tune of about 1 5 in our north american aftermarket tire business now on a broader perspective the global ag sector continued to be hampered by lower commodity prices driven by the ongoing trade concerns the unsettled brexit issue the big global issues that are on everybody s mind in the media outlets however farmers seem to be the collateral damage of that ongoing china us trade dispute the result is that all these factors including the weather pushed farmer sentiment lower on a global basis as they have seen the foreseeable incomes take a hit now i m going to switch to a positive note considering the weather conditions that are ramping across the midwest in the us our lsw is the ideal solution for farmers that need to get into their fields in these tough conditions and we do continue to see our lsw sales perform well to the tune of over 40 growth in this quarter also as farmers have been late to plant this season or this spring that means they have a tight window in the fall to deal with for harvest we believe this sets us up very well to continue to see the increased demand for our lsw products in the back half of this year there is also a couple of other factors impacting q1 worth mentioning first the strong dollar continues to impact many multinational companies however for titan the negative foreign currency impacts from europe and brazil in particular this quarter is significant for us as a smaller global company it is significant and that represented the tune of about 25 million of negative or i should say negative impact of 25 million in sales and approximately 2 5 million in lost gross margin without the impact of fx our sales would have grown over 2 this period i ll let david dive further in his comments and he will also touch on the short term impact we experienced this period from some north america tighter inventory costs changing gears the titan team has done a good job implementing changes over the past few years to build a stronger foundation and that is evidenced in the improvements you ve seen in our operating results with adjusted ebitda more than doubling over the past couple of years also our company has a long history of successfully handling situations like this when unexpected changes occur in our end markets we recently celebrated our 25th year on the new york stock exchange and there aren t many companies operating in cyclical industries like ours that have accomplished that fact the titan management team has demonstrated in the recent past our ability to make effective and timely decisions as market conditions change we ve already taken actions in many of our business units to adjust to the first quarter being softer than we expected as discussed in prior calls we ve also implemented the 80 20 program for north american tire we re in the process of implementing that in north america wheel we are pleased with the results we are seeing with this program in our tire business and believe that had a positive impact with us being able to keep sales stable in north america in this tougher than expected market the one market that is different to what i just mentioned is russia as we ve seen their financial markets all but freeze up making capital a precious commodity our strategy has been in russia to protect our premium pricing on products within the cis region while also introducing sufficient sales incentives to protect volume we are now seeing the dealer shelves are full sales incentives have less of an impact on volume than desired we will adjust our strategy accordingly in the short term to this factor but the longer term opportunity in russia is to improve our product mix from being roughly 95 aftermarket and highly localized in the cis region to have more oem sales and export related sales coming out of our titan russia operation we re working hard toward making that happen we have improvements that have been implemented there we re pleased with the recent progress and we got to continue to march forward to again make that shift in our sales mix happen there we went into this year expecting good growth out of the gate that didn t happen as i said earlier the titan team is experienced in managing through these changing conditions we ve already taken actions we will continue to do more if needed while the first quarter didn t reach our expectations we believe that end markets are being hit by some soft some shorter term impacts and that the fundamentals haven t shifted to the point that we need to update our 2019 guidance i d now like to turn the call over to david david a martin senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks paul and good morning to everybody on the call i ll go through some of the important points for our first quarter 2019 performance but also spend a little bit of time talking through some of the key issues that we are managing as we progress through the next few months net sales for the first quarter of 2019 were 410 million representing a decline of 3 5 from the prior year net sales were up on a reported basis by 47 million or 13 from the fourth quarter of 2018 it s also important to note on a constant currency basis revenues would have been up roughly 10 million from the first quarter 2018 or 2 3 the currency impact of 25 million or 5 8 was felt most in latin america and europe our itm undercarriage business performed well notwithstanding some customer directed deferrals to the second quarter that impacted the quarter in sales and profits the north american sales were reasonably flat year over year while the start of the year was slow and it only picked up toward the end of the quarter our biggest sales challenges came in russia europe and latin america our sales volume on a consolidated basis were lower about 3 5 from last year with the largest declines being in russia and europe due to market headwinds and agriculture we re able to pick of sales from increased price mix in the quarter by 5 8 resulting principally from the overall rise in raw material costs over the course of last year our challenges were not so much in sales but market headwinds and other temporal issues with gross margins through parts of the business globally the reported gross profit for the first quarter was 45 3 million versus 59 6 million in the first quarter of 2018 and our gross margin for the first quarter of 2019 was 11 versus 14 last year first the impact of currency devaluation on gross profit was approximately 2 5 million versus the prior year there were a number of larger impacts that were described in the earnings release that i ll spend a minute to delineate first the north american tire business had challenges getting out of the gate early as paul talked about and we pushed through the focused sales incentives in an effort to stimulate demand which translated into sales late in the quarter we also had a short term impact of higher cost of the inventories being sold into the market from production from the fourth quarter 2018 when we had much lower production levels and higher unit costs this is largely behind us now the combined impact of these items was approximately 4 million on gross profit for the quarter second our latin american business has continued to experience headwinds in particular in the argentinian and the colombian markets which hurt export sales from our plant in brazil in addition light truck tire sales saw some decline year over year the combined impact of these headwinds was approximately 3 million on gross profit finally we continue to have challenges in russia and europe in the ag markets which not only impacted sales and gross profit but also caused margin decline due to production inefficiencies that was approximately 3 million in gross profit decline from last year on a combined basis paul talked about this earlier but given the significant volatility that we ve seen in our markets we are and have been taking necessary actions to counteract these headwinds we re taking costs out of the operations globally where necessary and we ll manage the spend moving forward however many of these actions were not able to help us recover the first quarter profitability unfortunately we believe we are building sufficient recovery plans to facilitate profit improvements through the course of the year to get us back on track now i ll spend a few minutes on segment performance our agricultural segment net sales were 192 million down 1 3 on a year over year basis but would have been up 4 if not for the negative currency impact volume in the segment was down 2 5 while favorable price mix added 7 to segment net sales ag sales in north america were up 5 due primarily to oem sales russian ag sales were down 26 due to continued market challenges dealer inventory levels have remained at very high levels for several quarters and no amount of incentives have been able to make a dent at this point south american ag sales were down 10 mainly due to the currency impacts but would have been up without regard to that european ag sales have also lagged the prior year by 22 with the combined a combination of the negative currency impacts that we saw in the quarter and volume declines as the market has become more challenging our agricultural segment gross profit for the first quarter was 22 million down from 30 million in the comparable prior year period with a portion of this coming from lower currencies as well the impact of the north american higher costed inventories and incentive programs had the biggest impact to profitability in the quarter followed by the headwinds felt in russia europe and south america year over year margins declined over 390 basis points to 11 5 again driven by these all these factors i just talked about continuing on to our earthmoving construction segment it experienced a decrease in sales of 12 million or 6 4 to 177 million on a constant currency basis net sales would have decreased less than 1 for the quarter volume was down by 4 while positive price mix was 3 and negative currency impact in the segment by 5 5 itm s undercarriage business experienced a small decline in volume during the quarter which was attributable to certain customer directed deferrals of shipments into the second quarter we saw slight gains in volume in europe and south america in the emc segment as those markets remain solid gross profit within the earthmoving construction segment for the first quarter was 18 million which represented a decline of a little over 4 million from a year ago the biggest driver of the decline related to the north american tire margins along with tighter margins and itm due to delays on shipping higher margin products into the second quarter now to wrap up the consumer segment consumer segment s first quarter net sales were roughly 42 million decreasing only slightly when compared to the last year on a constant currency basis net sales would have been up 6 7 volume declined by 5 while we gained some favorable price mix of nearly 12 there was a significant fx drag in this quarter with a negative impact of 8 from the prior year with the biggest impact felt in latin america the segment s gross profit for the first quarter was 5 million which represented which was down 7 million from a year ago we had very very strong margins the first quarter last year gross margins were 11 9 which was decline of almost 500 basis points over the same period last year which was reflective of lower sales volume in certain areas and the impact of fixed cost absorption in latin america particularly on light utility truck sales volume now turning to our operating expenses sg a and r d expenses for the first quarter were 38 5 million which is higher than what we saw in the fourth quarter as well as the first quarter last year this was an increase of 1 million from last year in the first quarter and as a percentage of net sales sg a and r d was 9 4 compared to 8 8 in the comparable prior period some of this is due to the sales decline but we did have increases in spend relating to information technology investments that we re making with our oracle cloud erp upgrades tax expense for the quarter was 1 9 million in the quarter on the pre tax basis income of 2 9 million which appears to be unusual with the proportion of our losses coming in tax jurisdictions where we have significant cumulative operating losses we re not able to take the current year tax benefit we ve talked about this in prior calls but that causes an unusual outcome particularly in the quarter for the full year of 2019 i would still anticipate our tax rate to fall between 25 and 30 given our expectation for the year of in the mix of pre tax income and the various tax jurisdictions the final item to note in the first quarter performance discussion relates to the redemption value adjustment of little lower 800 000 which decreased from the prior year q1 of 2 3 million all this adjustment related to the impact of the current period continuation of the oep put option the rdif portion of the put option has either been satisfied or determined and there was no ongoing impact from the redeemable non controlling interest in the russian operation related to rdif now i d like to move over to our financial condition and highlight a few balance sheet liquidity and capital items working capital grew in the first quarter again but at a much lower rate than what we saw in the first quarter last year as sales ramped up our receivables were the key driver of the growth as our sales were more compressed toward the end of the quarter in fact nearly 40 of our sales for the quarter were in the month of march total ar increased 53 million during the first quarter from the fourth quarter and were on par with balances that we had at the end of the first quarter last year our ending inventory at the end of march grew by 17 million from the end of the year this growth came in two principal areas of the business our north american wheel operations and our undercarriage business we built up inventory in the wheel business as we continue to ramp up production after significant challenges that we faced from the start up of our new oracle cloud erp system in the fourth quarter we fully expect to see inventory levels taper in the next several months as we continue to catch up on production as it relates to the itm undercarriage business we have experienced dramatic growth in the business over the course of last year and as we discussed in prior quarters we did experience some customer deferrals on orders into the coming quarter these orders are fully committed by customers but some shipments have been shifted out of the first quarter while we experienced growth in working capital once again this quarter we are making strides in key areas of the business in our focused efforts to increase capabilities to reduce lead times and to forecast production demand better for our plants capital expenditures for the first quarter were 9 5 million versus little under 8 million in 2018 in the first quarter we are in line with expectations for capital spending this year which will be in the range of 40 million to 50 million again we are targeting areas that can deliver the highest returns through increased plant efficiency and cost reductions while remaining prudent on timing due to the other cash needs in the business now let s go through where we stand on the debt side of things our combined current and long term debt totaled 499 million at the end of the quarter which increased primarily due to the line of credit borrowing to settle the rdif option in march of 25 million current maturities due within one year totaled 66 million significant portion of these current maturities relate to local overdraft and working capital facilities which are generally considered on demand for reporting purposes but are expected to roll over without the use of cash during the year all of the increase in the quarter in short term borrowings related to these overdraft facilities in various countries our debt primarily consists of 400 million senior secured notes which will mature in 2023 our cash balance declined by 13 million this quarter to 68 million as we ramped up sales in the fourth quarter of 18 to the first quarter of 2019 this was anticipated and we expect to see a turnaround throughout the year as we trim working capital and ar and inventory through our improved focus and the natural seasonality in the business it should be noted that in the first quarter of 2018 we experienced a much more significant decline in cash after a similar ramp up in sales we have adequate cash on the global scale to manage the operations of the business on a daily basis we also have the capacity to tap into our foreign bank loans and overdraft facilities from time to time to handle various working capital fluctuations for our international business as we have over the course of last years our sales volumes have increased our us based abl line has been in place for some time and for the first time we utilized it to handle the rdif put option obligation of 25 million in the first quarter of 2019 the limit on the credit facility is at 75 million today but as we have discussed in the past there is an accordion feature on the facility for us to upsize the facility to as much as 150 million with the appropriate and customary bank approvals we maintained a healthy relationship with our banking partners and have been working with them to increase the size of the facility to meet the potential obligations of the company relating to the put option as we disclosed in the release this week the board of directors authorized management to proceed with upsizing of the facility from the current level to 125 million within the next few weeks we expect to execute this increase in the facility and each of our banking partners have already confirmed their increased commitments as we stated in the past with our anticipated cash flow trends throughout the year and our other potential cash flow events through sales of non core assets that i described last quarter coupled with this current and enhanced borrowing capacity we maintained healthy liquidity to manage into the future and to continue to invest to grow the business appropriately now i d like to turn the call back over to paul for a few more comments before we get into any questions you might have paul g reitz president and chief executive officer thanks david i ve got a couple of quick closing comments first regarding the titan russia put option we continue to have discussions pertaining to the put but nothing has been finalized yet as david just stated we have sufficient capital and credit availability to settle the put without impacting the plans for titan in late february we announced that we are evaluating strategic alternatives with respect to itm our undercarriage business this decision was not driven by the situation with the put option as may have been interpreted during our prior earnings call based on my response to a particular question itm is a well managed business that we ve been successful and making investments to spur a strong growth over the past few years we ve talked about that extensively itm would benefit from further investments or acquisitions to build upon these successes however we also believe that our wheel and tire businesses that have formed the backbone of titan for many years have a strong future as well that would benefit from further investments or acquisitions to grow these businesses our current capital structure would have challenges in being able to do that for wheel tire and undercarriage basically all the business units of this company so based on that in early 2019 itm ceo and myself started gathering information regarding itm s potential valuation as a stand alone enterprise and indication were that itm would be valued significantly higher than the bid we received in 2016 i then decided with the matter worthy for further discussion with our board and then as we disclosed in february the board approved titan to engage your capital as financial advisors to carry out further evaluation on itm where we sit today with the itm process is that we ve made positive progress and we continue to move through the process toward a potential public listing ultimately the board will convene at appropriate time to analyze the situation and all pertinent information to make the best decision for our shareholders with that brandon i d like to now turn the call over to questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions our first question comes from steve volkmann with jefferies steve volkmann jefferies analyst so a couple of topics to kick it off just first if we can kind of go back to the liquidity discussion i just want to make sure i kind of have the pieces right here you have roughly 68 million in cash at quarter end i think how much do you need to sort of run the company on a daily basis david a martin senior vice president and chief financial officer we re certainly in the range of being able to do it we manage this cash level throughout the first quarter it s always i think our expectation that we ll continue to liquidate inventory and be able to operate at low higher level than what we have been but we can still operate the company anywhere in the range of let s call it 60 million to 80 million steve volkmann jefferies analyst okay and then that was kind of my follow on i m sorry if i missed it but do you expect to be cash positive this year david a martin senior vice president and chief financial officer based on our current estimates and so forth that will certainly be our expectation toward the end of the year it won t necessarily happen in the first half of the year but as we progress through the year we believe we ll get to a full year expectation of positive cash flow steve volkmann jefferies analyst okay and then on the revolver i think right now you have availability in the 40 million range but you re going to add another 50 million so that gives us kind of 90 million there right david a martin senior vice president and chief financial officer that s right steve volkmann jefferies analyst and then last quarter i think we talked about some kind of non core assets other than itm that you were thinking about as having some market value that would bring cash in is that still the case and where do we stand with that david a martin senior vice president and chief financial officer yes there s a variety of different things that we re looking at all of which can happen within the 3 month to 4 month period and so we re continuing to progress down that path steve volkmann jefferies analyst if i remember correctly i think we re talking what 30 million or 40 million of potential there david a martin senior vice president and chief financial officer i believe i said 30 million to 50 million but yes steve volkmann jefferies analyst okay and so you re still feeling good about that david a martin senior vice president and chief financial officer i still feel like we some of the timing may push a little bit but all the things that we described last quarter and may perhaps maybe a few other opportunities continue to present themselves so yes steve volkmann jefferies analyst okay great and then on sort of the outflow side you have not yet paid the 25 million to the russian deal yet is that correct david a martin senior vice president and chief financial officer yes you mean under the stock settlement part of the settlement steve volkmann jefferies analyst right and you have to pay 25 million for david a martin senior vice president and chief financial officer yes we paid the 25 million in cash we used borrowings for that on the line and the stock has not been issued yet we re still awaiting final regulatory approval for the issuance of the stock steve volkmann jefferies analyst got it so cash has been paid stock not yet david a martin senior vice president and chief financial officer correct steve volkmann jefferies analyst and then on the second put do we have any update to what s happening there paul g reitz president and chief executive officer yes we continue to have discussions as david has highlighted the board in our press release highlighted that our board has authorized upsizing the abl giving us sufficient capital and availability to handle the put when those discussions do reach a conclusion steve volkmann jefferies analyst okay all right thanks and then just quickly on the margins side to switch gears a little bit it sounds like a fair amount of the margin pressures you had in the quarter were kind of short term i think but do we expect the incentives in the market to continue going forward or was that kind of a one quarter thing david a martin senior vice president and chief financial officer i think the biggest portion of those incentives would probably push sales in the first quarter but that is an ongoing program so there could be some additional amounts in the second quarter as well the to answer your question about most of the issues being short term a lot of them particularly the largest ones in the quarter were what i would consider short term particularly with the inventory in north america tire steve volkmann jefferies analyst is it a leap too far to say that the gross margins should be flat to up each quarter going forward or we re not ready to say that yet david a martin senior vice president and chief financial officer well i don t to make quarterly is a tough thing to always predict as you know we had pretty a lot of volatility this quarter but if you go back to our original guidance for the year is that the expectation we would have some marginal improvements in margin year over year so inherently we re we believe we can continue to drive margins better as we move forward steve volkmann jefferies analyst okay and then just a big picture and i ll pass it on there s been some discussions in the press here about some impending settlement with china and maybe having some fairly positive impact on various ag exports possibly and i guess i m just trying to get a sense of how you think the incremental margins can look if we actually start to see some improvement at some point finally in these end markets i mean what should we be thinking about in terms of kind of operating leverage if we actually can get some reasonable growth here paul g reitz president and chief executive officer yes i think we demonstrated in the past when our business gets operating leverage going and we get the volume through our plants that our contribution margins are fairly good like you said we need a catalyst though to make that happen and as we were preparing for this year and really putting our plans in place near the tail end of 18 we certainly build up a well trained staff that was looking at some growth going into the first part of this year and then like you said the unsettled trade issues and then you throw the weather on top of it has pushed that back so while sales were flat we certainly have trained staff that are ready to go to work so i think to answer your question the incremental margins would be in that range of the mid 20 like we ve demonstrated in the past when we get the volume running through our plants operator our next question comes from komal patel with goldman sachs komal patel goldman sachs analyst just a follow on from the earlier question what s the upsizing of the credit facility does that imply the oep settlement would more like be settled in cash at this point or it s not fair for us to draw that conclusion david a martin senior vice president and chief financial officer it s not fair to draw that conclusion we obviously as a management team we want to be prepared for whatever settlement occurs and so i want to maintain the right amount of flexibility in the business to run effectively and to manage that potential obligation komal patel goldman sachs analyst okay got it that s fair and then just second maybe you could provide a little more color on the cadence through the quarter you had mentioned better performance in march what were some of the signs that you re seeing and then also just kind of your take on april and did the positive momentum from march continue i know there s some tough weather in april as well so just some thoughts there david a martin senior vice president and chief financial officer yes obviously there s a fewer working days and production days in april but the trends are still fairly positive march was a strong month for us and so i believe as we progress through the quarter particularly in some of the areas that we saw some weakness we believe we can get back on track komal patel goldman sachs analyst got it and then you mentioned some contracts were deferred into the second quarter is there a way to quantify how large of a deferral that was and is there anything to call out on canceled orders david a martin senior vice president and chief financial officer no canceled orders it s just the timing is for delivery was pushed out a decent amount i would say that looking at it on our profitability standpoint it was about 1 5 million impact to us this quarter komal patel goldman sachs analyst got it that s helpful and then last one for me i guess maybe can you just touch on the 25 million share repurchase program that was announced in march i guess how should we be thinking about it obviously 1q was weaker than expected and the stock is opening lower this morning but then again you re kind of increasing your credit facility so is it fair to be using the program right now or how you kind of balance the factors that are in motion here david a martin senior vice president and chief financial officer certainly the board is going to take take into account where the stock price is at relative to where it s been trading and obviously our internal cash flow among other factors but we want to be responsive and ready to support the stock appropriately at the right levels so this program isn t intended to be a just a one quarter thing it s over time and we re going to manage it appropriately and do what we feel is the best use for our cash operator our next question comes from joe mondillo with sidoti company joe mondillo sidoti company analyst so you guys reported on march 7th your fourth quarter numbers so you were pretty well into the first quarter so i m just curious when you reported and gave the guidance there in march you must have had a pretty good picture of what the first quarter was sort of looking like and so i m just curious now that we have the results and you see everything and you re maintaining the guidance what was sort of surprise whether it was positive or negative and just given these gross margins that we see in the first quarter it s sort of insinuating you for maintaining the guidance that you are going to make up a lot of whatever was a negative surprise in the first quarter later in the year and i m just wondering where that comes from david a martin senior vice president and chief financial officer yes as we progressed through the first quarter we obviously have seen the weakness that we saw in january and february and we thought we could actually probably even have a better march than we actually did and there were some certainly some margin hits that we took in the quarter that ultimately presented themselves as we got to the end of the quarter versus early part of the quarter and as we looked at the rest of the year is that we if you look at each of the factors that presented themselves there is certainly opportunity for us to recover certainly we re going to need some cooperation in the weather category as well as the ag markets themselves but given what we see right now at the moment we certainly believe we can produce the activity to be able to recover our margins and obviously our profitability so we have to obviously going to watch it very very carefully as we progress and update everybody as we get through the year but joe mondillo sidoti company analyst okay and the sales incentive that you called out this is an ongoing program like you mentioned i think on a quarterly basis did you quantify sort of i guess there is an abnormal amount of sales incentive in the first quarter because i m assuming that there was some sort of sales incentive in the first quarter last year so was there an abnormally large amount and if so can you quantify how much that was paul g reitz president and chief executive officer joe it wasn t the sales incentives were abnormal we definitely have planned it and where that came from is looking at our strategic plans for north america related to aftermarkets were to introduce these sales incentives in the first quarter now with that we expected that to drive growth what ended up happening instead is the sales remained relatively stable and so we didn t get the volume and the additional margin that we expected from the incentives so it s not like it was a unknown cause that we didn t expect it s just we didn t get the growth that we expected to go along with it again due to the weather events and it really did the weighing of purchases from farmers at this time joe mondillo sidoti company analyst okay and just in terms of i guess sort of related to my initial my first question could you talk about some factors that we see that are going to improve whether it s price cost i m assuming maybe you get back to maybe better volumes which leverages costs and could you just talk about some of the factors that are going to maybe drive better margin compared to these the margins that we saw in the first quarter david a martin senior vice president and chief financial officer if we talk about north american tire expectation is that we ll have stronger production which is obviously going to lead to we get very good incremental margins when we hit a certain production level the cost of the inventory that we experienced in q1 is obviously largely behind us at this point and the what we look at in terms of our standard cost of materials the actual raw material prices are a little bit lower than what we had in our plan and so we certainly expect to see some incremental margin coming through on that now it comes over the course of the year this doesn t happen all in one quarter but right now based on where raw material prices are it s certainly favorable if you look across other parts of the business some of these things were deferrals and certainly pushing to later in the year volume is obviously going to be the critical factor for our ability to drive sales and then ultimately the higher margins joe mondillo sidoti company analyst okay and then what about sort of mix oe sales versus aftermarket in the first quarter what were the trends sort of like as we go into may david a martin senior vice president and chief financial officer if you look at oe oes obviously it trended higher in terms of the mix versus the aftermarket was fairly flat while we had expected increases in activity during the quarter and as we progress through the year i think we ll get a better balance joe mondillo sidoti company analyst okay and on the earthmoving construction side of the business the volumes continue to sort of surprise me considering what caterpillar is talking about and you guys mentioned itm has been strong and the mining sector overall seems to be very strong what s going on with the volumes that you ve seen over the last two quarters relative to what seems to be a pretty positive market paul g reitz president and chief executive officer well our international exposure certainly has not helped with the fact that currencies have impacted our overall volume but this quarter was much more about the fact that we had some deferrals of revenues or sales into the next quarter i think if not for that we would have seen an upmarket joe mondillo sidoti company analyst okay so we should expect positive trends starting in the second quarter then if that s the case david a martin senior vice president and chief financial officer certainly yes if we don t continue to see any deferrals out of the quarter i think the expectation was that we would see some incremental growth yes joe mondillo sidoti company analyst okay and then just on the working capital and i ll jump back in the queue inventory increased 55 million last year due to the strong demand that you re seeing if we re sort of seeing we re obviously trending to slightly negative here but if we re seeing slightly positive say for the year it seems like you have opportunity to what are you expecting for working capital or the contribution to cash i guess what i m asking david a martin senior vice president and chief financial officer as i stated earlier the expectation is that we re going to get be stronger in terms of our planning cycles to be able to trim the inventory the amount of days that we have in inventory i mean the big growth in working capital this quarter was really on ar so that s a timing thing with the majority of our billings happening at the end of the quarter so i d expect as we progress through year and you have see more normal if you will trends in the market then we should be able to manage our working capital to drive cash flow i think overall this is more of a longer term project but obviously as we continue to make appropriate changes in our planning schedules across the business we should be able to reduce the number of days that was required for inventory and but there s going to be pockets of the business that are going to be better than others given the mix between oe and aftermarket so i do expect to see some improvement as we go through the year operator our next question comes from larry de maria with william blair larry de maria william blair analyst you guys obviously talked a bit about itm i just want to understand what the message is is the most likely scenario a public spend as opposed to cash generating sale at this point is that right or am i thinking about that wrong paul g reitz president and chief executive officer no i think that s right the financial advisors that we ve hired engaged clearly they ll look at both potential outlets and whatever drives the highest valuation but as part of the process that we re going through right now a public offering is part of that larry de maria william blair analyst and that will be like a tax free spent to shareholders david a martin senior vice president and chief financial officer well obviously we re the shareholder today larry de maria william blair analyst okay right just put the company into the equity to the shareholders on the call okay can you understand the help us understand the revenue and ebitda size of itm then since this may have come out paul g reitz president and chief executive officer yes i mean at this point i think we ve given some general indications about the performance of itm that we ve been pretty clear with that over the last couple of years it s been successful the business has been growing but at this time it just gets primarily folded into our earthmoving construction segment very high percentage of it falls directly in that segment with a much smaller percent that goes into ag but at this point larry that s all we can disclose larry de maria william blair analyst okay and then oe versus aftermarkets sounds like obviously oe production was up and obviously markets were little bit different oe versus aftermarket given the weather especially have you changed your production plans moving forward as we ve gone through the first quarter and some hiccups obviously with the weather and farmer sentiment so how do you think about oe versus end aftermarket production moving forward through the rest of the year have we maybe tweaked that down paul g reitz president and chief executive officer well i think through the rest of the year it depends of the timing of when you re looking at it i think what david said we saw march coming very strong looking to see that continuing to april clearly as you look at things right now the weather is tough or i was talking to our legal counsel who drove last night from chicago where we re at to our plant in bryan and you re just looking at water everywhere so i think right now larry that s a tough question to answer as we kind of see where the rest of the spring goes how the planting cycle takes place but fundamental that we believe in and we continue to hear from our customers whether it s oe or aftermarket is that there s a lot of pent up demand in the system we do believe that it s a timing issue versus a structural issue and at this point we re going to have to kind of wait and see how the first the rest of the first half of the year plays out but i do believe that it leads into a good looking second half of the year especially with the advantages titan has with our lsw products the growth we saw in the first quarter was tremendous and i continue and i believe that will continue on a very strong pace as these wet conditions are absolutely perfect for what titan can deliver to our end users to help them with these tough conditions so again we all see the oem forecast for the rest of the year i mean we saw some reports yesterday and i think that s all fairly accurate but again i think the aftermarket and weather is kind of wildcard that we re watching closely but again i do think that s more timing than it is structural larry de maria william blair analyst okay so maybe i ll put it another way the oes are correct me if i m wrong not communicating to you any material change in production plans for you to expect paul g reitz president and chief executive officer no not anything different than what s been reported publicly larry de maria william blair analyst okay and then when it comes to lsw pool which you guys called out again today is that mostly in the i m assuming it s aftermarket level or are you getting some traction in the oe level at all too paul g reitz president and chief executive officer good improvements at the oe level i think that s been a nice movement in trend that we ve seen here over recent months it is primarily in aftermarket products like you stated and i think for us what being great about being an aftermarket product is that they ve done a tremendous job of handling the changeovers if a farmer has a standard product already on their equipment they ve done a great job of getting the standard assembly wheel tires taken off absorbed into the marketplace and really getting them upgraded to lsws once you get them upgraded to lsws we feel that the stickiness of that sale is really favorable so but we are to answer your question larry we are seeing some good trends in the oes we definitely want to get the oe market going on lsw it s a different type of sale i mean they have different things that they look at when they re putting an option on to a new piece of equipment versus what we are selling through the distribution channel and working directly more with the end users operator our next question comes from alex blanton with clear harbor asset management alex blanton clear harbor asset management analyst first do you have a slide deck with us i didn t see one on the website david a martin senior vice president and chief financial officer alex we have not prepared slides in the past or today alex blanton clear harbor asset management analyst okay all right lsw what percentage of your aftermarket is that now paul g reitz president and chief executive officer at this point alex we aren t disclosing that i guess for a number of different reasons and part of it is definitely competitive we have a strength with our lsw products and competitively it s not something that we are disclosing them to the market but we are trying to give you enough color on illustrating what the growth rates have been but at this point alex for competitive reasons we just can t talk any further what the exact number is alex blanton clear harbor asset management analyst okay and the deferrals into the second quarter of the itm how much was that and why didn t it happen and why would it continue you mentioned there s a possibility and there might be some further deferrals but what s the reason for it david a martin senior vice president and chief financial officer i m not seeing any indication that there are any it s just they were just pushing out their expectation for their own equipment deliveries alex blanton clear harbor asset management analyst so it had to do with the oe oe equipment deliveries david a martin senior vice president and chief financial officer i believe it s a combination there s probably some aftermarket on that too alex blanton clear harbor asset management analyst well is there a possibility with inventory they had too much in inventory and they reduced their inventory of it david a martin senior vice president and chief financial officer they were obviously fairly these orders were firm and they just pushed out the timing of their expectation for us needing to get into their plans to be able to put it on alex blanton clear harbor asset management analyst well i understand that but why did that happen that s what i m asking why did that happen why did they need to do that david a martin senior vice president and chief financial officer i mean it was just some just some timing at the end of the quarter is really all it was alex blanton clear harbor asset management analyst i understand that but why was it different why did it change from expectations why did they push it out paul g reitz president and chief executive officer yes i think at this point alex i think david s offered a lot of much information as we can about the situation i mean there is david a martin senior vice president and chief financial officer customers make decisions about timing from one month to the next alex blanton clear harbor asset management analyst okay you don t know why they did that david a martin senior vice president and chief financial officer there is a variety of different reasons alex blanton clear harbor asset management analyst the discounts that you mentioned the sales incentives did you tell us how much that was paul g reitz president and chief executive officer we cited about what 1 million 1 5 million david a martin senior vice president and chief financial officer that was about that was profit and tax in the quarter alex blanton clear harbor asset management analyst okay this weather how is it affecting the oe deliveries that you are supplying in other words you do a lot of dealer tires and wheels now they normally build up a lot of dealer inventory in the first quarter that they usually they build up a lot of inventory in the first quarter in total in preparation for the selling season now what is that buildup today this year versus what normally is is there a difference and how is that affecting you paul g reitz president and chief executive officer well i think at this point there hasn t been enough market intelligence out there to specify exactly what the dealer inventory levels are i had some recent meetings with our oem customers and yes there is a an issue at the whether that is impacting some timing of these orders of these potential shipments but i think if you look at one of the oems that reported yesterday they re still holding to their outlook for the full year and so you look at it as a timing issue driven by the weather versus kind of a structural foundational issue that is is just lost demand alex blanton clear harbor asset management analyst which oem reported paul g reitz president and chief executive officer agco reported yesterday alex blanton clear harbor asset management analyst agco ok you mentioned that you re trying to improve your oem sales in russia what is that going to take who is your competition there what you have to do in russia to get more oem sales paul g reitz president and chief executive officer it goes to the basic premise of getting that goodyear made product out of the russian plant that can be put not just on the oem equipment that s being manufactured in russia but also could be used as export into other western european markets and areas that would be suitable for a goodyear branded product and so what my discussions have been there are a number of factors built in russia by large oems that import their tires from other markets primarily europe and there is a desire to have local content as most countries do there is a desire to have local content and so what we re working toward alex is being able to provide it from our russian plant so we have a number of changes that have been implemented on the compounding side to address that a number of changes that have been implemented with equipment some of it new some of it coming a lot of it coming from the us we have our us teams working with their russian counterparts and again the goal is that we would be able to put if we re going to put the goodyear brand on it it naturally has to be of the highest quality to support that premium label and really that s what we re looking to achieve and when we do we think there is a good market for us again both with oems and for export sales into other regions alex blanton clear harbor asset management analyst well the oems in russia must be short of foreign currency why wouldn t it be to their advantage to source locally rather than be exporting tires i mean important tires from europe that doesn t make a lot of sense paul g reitz president and chief executive officer that s what we re trying to do that s exactly right alex that s what we re trying to do we need to get the goodyear brand on it and again that means we achieve a certain level of quality which we are working hard to do that but when we achieve that level and put the goodyear brand on it then exactly what we said is we believe what can happen where the local market will start taking the goodyear tires made right of our titan russia plant alex blanton clear harbor asset management analyst yes that makes a lot of sense so it s a quality issue that they feel that their quality coming from europe has been good but if you can match it you get the sales is that right paul g reitz president and chief executive officer you got it alex that s exactly right alex blanton clear harbor asset management analyst okay let me see here this guidance that you mentioned you re not changing you didn t mention what it was david a martin senior vice president and chief financial officer i don t have everything in front of me here alex but we stated our guidance on march 7th for the full year okay we can go back and get that for you alex blanton clear harbor asset management analyst march 7th you had a release david a martin senior vice president and chief financial officer yes when we did our fourth quarter earnings announcement alex blanton clear harbor asset management analyst okay so whatever was in there has not changed okay david a martin senior vice president and chief financial officer it hasn t changed alex blanton clear harbor asset management analyst okay all right paul g reitz president and chief executive officer yes todd can help you with that alex if you want to talk with him offline operator our final question is a follow up from joe mondillo with sidoti company joe mondillo sidoti company analyst just two quick follow ups i know we re pretty late in the call here first question hopefully a short answer just i noticed in the q you had you highlighted that your goodyear licensing agreement in latin america expires in june of this year i assume that is usually just recontracted or is there any risk to that at all paul g reitz president and chief executive officer the licensing agreement for the bias truck tires we produce there so it s not just so everybody is clear it s not related to the global farm licensing agreement that we have with goodyear that s under an automatic renewal process so this one specifically we ve again it s for the bias truck tires out of latin america only we ve begun those discussions with goodyear i don t want to goodyear like i don t want to put words in goodyear s mouth but our relationship is strong with them and i see it as extremely low risk and of anything detrimental to titan happening from that joe mondillo sidoti company analyst okay thanks for clearing that up and then lastly your 80 20 restructuring you guys have talked about that over the last 18 months but i think there is still a lot more work to be done and i m surprised that hasn t come up really on this call could you talk about where we re at in terms of everything that you re focusing on and sort of give us maybe an update on sort of how we think about timing of all the improvements that you re going to be making over the next year or more paul g reitz president and chief executive officer yes with 80 20 on tire part of the strategic targeted incentives that we re putting in place we re able to do that because of 80 20 and what we ve learned and garnered through that process as david has been talking about extensively working capital is a top priority and 80 20 is designed and will be helping us with that but part of the rollout of 80 20 you go through the steps you get it introduced but it does take time for your customers to make the changes you can t exactly tell your customers on day one these products are gone forever just live with it so all our sales reps are working extensively with our customers to adopt the 80 20 premise i would say almost universally it s been well accepted people are clearly behind it it makes it streamlines their supply chain and their processes but it takes time for them to rollout the old inventory and start bringing in the new but the process is moving along well at tire and again i think what we ve learned and what we ve garnered from it has been tremendous and it helps us in more ways than just obvious of getting rid of 20 of the products i mean it s helping us make strategic decisions it s helping us with working capital and it s going to help us with our plant staffing as well as we move forward but i think the big one for us though that we re just getting into is going to be on the wheel side we re working with the oems and if you look at a wheel plant joe i know you ve had a chance to do that to set up on a wheel line is extensive and what you go through on a changeover and the tooling to manufacture a wheel as we streamline that operation and make our runs more efficient i think we re going to see a very nice pickup in wheel almost immediately when we do that so what we re doing right now with wheel is going through the process of the analysis getting our plans put in place we ll update you more as we move through the year but i m really excited about what it could do to the efficiency of how we operate our wheel plants operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to mr reitz for any closing remarks paul g reitz president and chief executive officer

u s job growth surged in april and the unemployment rate dropped to a more than 49 year low of 3 6 per cent pointing to sustained strength in economic activity even as last year s massive fiscal stimulus fades the labor department s closely watched monthly employment report on friday however showed steady wage gains last month consistent with moderate inflation the decline in the unemployment rate to the lowest level since december 1969 was because people left the labour force suggesting some slack in the jobs market remains the report was broadly supportive of the federal reserve s decision on wednesday to keep interest rates unchanged and signal little desire to adjust monetary policy anytime soon fed chair jerome powell described the economy and job growth as a bit stronger than we anticipated and inflation somewhat weaker employment gains are strong enough to dispel any immediate concerns over the health of the economy while wage gains are not strong enough to force the fed s hand to tighten the policy stance said harm bandholz chief u s economist at unicredit research in new york nonfarm payrolls increased by 263 000 jobs last month amid gains in hiring nearly across all sectors the economy created 16 000 more jobs in february and march than previously reported economists polled by reuters had forecast nonfarm payrolls rising by 185 000 jobs last month the
