article 3 months old commodities feb 01 2019 richard rick mills ahead of the herd as a general rule the most successful man in life is the man who has the best information gold markets were rocking on tuesday lifted by a basket of factors that included poor stock market performance earlier in the week slow growth in china weak earnings reports and expectations the us federal reserve would strike a dovish tone at its two day meeting starting on tuesday afternoon the fed raised interest rates four times in 2018 but some officials have signaled they are not expecting to continue raising rates this year as the us economy faces a number of pressures including the ongoing trade war with china the us government shutdown part 2 and waning consumer and business confidence indeed the doves were firmly in control on tuesday as spot gold rocketed past 1 300 an ounce to close at 1 311 66 in new york a 7 month high strength in the precious metal was buoyed by rising us china tensions after the justice department charged chinese tech company huawei and its chief financial officer earlier arrested and held in vancouver with fraud thus escalating trade tensions that have been ongoing for almost a year with billions in import tariffs levied from either side the us dollar index which typically moves in the opposite direction of gold was near a two month low tuesday at ahead of the herd we love gold and promising junior gold companies because gold holds its value through time owning gold is a way to preserve wealth against paper currencies which are subject to inflationary pressures and over time lose their value in the us there was an increase in inflation for every decade except the depression when prices shrunk nearly 20 between 1860 and 2015 the dollar experienced 2 6 inflation every year meaning that us 1 in 1860 was equivalent to 27 80 in 2015 this also means that prices in 2015 were 2 828 higher than they were in 1860 gold investors love nothing more than a war economic crisis or any type of geopolitical instability to watch the value of their bullion grow heightened global tensions such as terrorist attacks border skirmishes or civil wars scare investors into putting their funds into safe havens like gold and stable high yield sovereign debt geopolitical tensions also drive more government spending eg on arms which brings inflation leading investors to look at precious metals as a place to park their money short term we also like gold because gold companies and explore cos are finding less of it all the easiest gold to mine has been found including gold found near surface and in underground veins we are now facing peak gold where gold production from here on will keep falling the experts agree the industry is seeing a significant slowdown in the number of large deposits being discovered it used to be that major gold miners were looking at 5 million ounce projects to buy and develop now they d be happy with a million ozs in the ground with gold production falling combined with a lack of large gold deposits that could move the market you have the setup for a continued rise in the gold price irrespective of what happens to investment demand for gold or gold jewelry affectionately known as the fear trade and the love trade taking a run through the headlines we find everything is in place for a big run up in gold the us dollar was on the rise last year causing gold to fall but this year the dollar is struggling weighed down in part by the us federal reserve s signal that it may stop raising interest rates and unwinding its balance sheet put in place to keep tightening monetary policy the central bank since october 2017 has been decreasing the size of its 4 5 trillion debt by allowing 50 billion to run off each month we are also looking at slowing global growth a worsening us economic outlook the size of the federal debt the fed possibly lowering interest rates to stimulate the economy and a rush to safe havens like gold due to escalating conflicts let s take each in turn sluggish growth when economies falter gold tends to well the big news here is china whose economy was booming at double digits for most of the 2000s but is now creeping along at just 6 5 in fourth quarter 2018 this is a normal expectation from a country that moved very rapidly to becoming an export driven economy with a low value currency to a more diversified one now however there are worrying signs in china about slack consumer spending on discretionary items like cars and phones chinese imports fell 7 6 in december after gaining 16 1 in 2017 exports are also hurting due to us tariffs on chinese goods but it s not just china while the imf has made a slight downward adjustment to its expected 4 global growth rate in 2019 yale economist stephen roach notes that it s worse than that examining the longer term trend he writes following a crisis induced plunge of 10 4 in the volume of global trade in 2009 a modern day record recovery has been muted after a brief two year rebound in 2010 2011 world trade growth averaged just 3 6 from 2012 to 2018 about half the 7 1 average annual pace in the 20 years before the crisis that combined with a surge in protectionism made apparent by the us china trade war and the anticipated negative fallout from britain leaving the european union has roach sounding a warning all in all the global trade cycle is facing major stress in 2019 and markdowns have only just begun this underscores the risks of a major shortfall in world gdp growth emerging markets better hope that the fed does move in a dovish rather than hawkish direction by keeping rates low according to fitch ratings latin america the middle east and africa will face more downgrades than upgrades to their debt ratings this year if interest rates and the dollar rise that s because these countries currencies have depreciated and they have a high share of their debt denominated in foreign currencies examples are turkey and argentina as the worst performing emerging market currency last year the argentine peso has 83 of its government debt in foreign currency bloomberg reported making it especially vulnerable to a dollar rise 47 of turkey s debt is foreign the lira fell 28 last year not so great again president donald trump took credit for the stock market run that prevailed for most of the last two years since his inauguration in january 2017 the continuation of the longest bull market in american history had even trump s opponents conceding things were going well until the market encountered a serious correction last september december was the worst month for us stock markets since the great depression and while markets are up since the start of the new year investor sentiment is weak and despite the economy barreling along at near full employment and inflation at a very reasonable 2 many economists are urging caution ahead one is j bradford delong an economics professor at the university of california at berkeley delong looked at previous recessions dating from 1825 when england s canal stock boom collapsed he found that the pattern for downturns is a flight to safety following a weakness in financial markets such as the collapse of the sub prime mortgage market in 2007 writing in project syndicate prof delong states needless to say the particular nature and form of the next financial shock will be unanticipated investors speculators and financial institutions are generally hedged against the foreseeable shocks but there will always be other contingencies that have been missed at any rate today s near inverted yield curve low nominal and real bond yields and equity values all suggest that us financial markets have begun to price in the likelihood of a recession assuming that business investment committees are thinking like investors and speculators all it will take now to bring on a recession is an event that triggers a retrenchment of investment spending if there is a meltdown like the housing market collapse that pre dated the financial crisis or the sudden shock of understated earnings that burst the dot com bubble expect gold the time honored safe haven to rally beyond the stock market there are other signs that all is not well in the land of the free as corporate earnings start to trickle in it s not looking good on monday caterpillar a heavy equipment manufacturer and nvidia a chipmaker both reported lower than expected fourth quarter earnings due to weakness in china caterpillar the world s largest maker of construction machinery is seen as a bellwether of us economic health then there s the debt bogeyman according to the congressional budget office as the stimulative effects of trump s tax cuts wane the increasing federal deficit projected at nearly 900 billion will weigh on growth reuters reports the cbo saying that economic growth will slow to 2 3 from 3 1 in 2018 more alarmingly whereas in 2007 total government debt was about 9 trillion 62 of gdp now it is approaching 22 trillion 100 of gdp corporate debt is at a record 46 of gdp this isn t just an american phenomenon though it s global after the financial crisis central banks in the us europe china and japan all lowered their interest rates in an effort to stimulate borrowing and economic activity they also injected massive amounts of liquidity into the system aka printing money through quantitative easing just over a year ago the fed started removing liquidity treasuries and mortgages to try to reduce the multi trillion dollar debt it had accumulated through qe in 2018 it raised interest rates four times and why not the us economy was running hot with no signs of problematic inflation and a healthy stock market china and europe also made moves to deleverage their debt central bank tightening has been blamed for killing the stock market rally last fall the problem is with everyone used to interest rates near zero over the last 10 years the world is mortgaged to the hilt global debt has gone from 113 trillion before the financial crisis to over 186 trillion why is this a problem because if interest rates rise even a little bit the higher interest on loans is going to hurt a lot especially the government which will have trouble servicing its own massive debt and more people and businesses will be locked out of borrowing as the canberra times describes the massive build up in global debt that the central government sought and encouraged developed with interest rates at unprecedented lows that means borrowers are exceptionally sensitive to increases in interest rates and decreases in the availability of credit after a decade of ultra loose monetary policies designed to encourage debt it isn t surprising that the world has gorged on it nor that now that the central banks are starting to reverse course markets and their participants are becoming nervous and more risk averse qe4 given its 22 trillion debt can the united states afford to raise rates any more with the pain that this higher cost of borrowing will entail long time fed critic peter schiff doesn t think so schiff the ceo of euro pacific capital thinks with debt levels so high the only way to finance it is to keep interest rates at ridiculously low levels everybody thinks that quantitative easing is over what they don t realize is it s barely begun the next round is going to be bigger than the first three and that s going to send gold to new highs schiff said at the new orleans investment conference on tuesday ronald peter stoeferle fund manager at incrementum ag and author of the in gold we trust report told kitco news he isn t surprised to see the central banking getting more dovish he agrees with schiff that rates are likely to come down central banks have tried to get out of this zero interest rate trap but they aren t able to the market is addicted to cheap liquidity and i don t think that is going to change anytime soon there is no way out for central banks caught in this trap he said gold does very well in this environment as the rich get richer another disturbing trend in the american economy that few people talk about is its growing inequality why is that important because as more people grow poorer fewer can participate in the economy like borrowing and spending money a study by the economic policy institute found that in 2015 five states 30 metro areas and 78 counties exceeded the previous national record for share of income by the richest 1 at 23 9 the previous record was set in 1929 other stats showing that economic growth in the united states is benefiting only the very rich the incomes of the top 1 grew faster than the 99 between 2009 and 2013 the 1 in 2015 had average household income of 421 926 this was exceeded by 13 states plus washington dc there has been slow wage growth in almost every part of the country over the past 45 years the us has more poor people than sierra leone and nepal 5 3 million americans are living under the poverty line including several million children who live on less than 2 a day the effects of this growing inequality in america is especially felt in urban areas where lower income residents and marginal businesses are being squeezed out of neighborhoods we see the same thing in vancouver it s a kind of reverse gentrification where only the top 10 can afford to live there if and when a recession hits these 10 ers will be hard hit businesses highly dependent on discretionary income like expensive coffee shops will go under in effect the top 10 is ripe for the disruptions of globalization and automation that have already laid waste to the bottom 90 writes charles hugh smith a blogger venezuela in crisis along with the conflict over huawei tuesday s gold rally was also underpinned by the return of safe haven demand particularly with respect to us tensions with venezuela and russia on monday the us sanctioned venezuela s state oil company the boldest action taken so far in the effort to isolate embattled president nicolas maduro the measure blocks about 7 billion in assets the trump administration last week recognized opposition leader juan guaido as the interim president and has called on the venezuelan military to get maduro to resign the country has been gripped with hyperinflation soaring unemployment and a mass exodus of refugees cnn reported it also looks increasingly likely that the us will pull out of a key nuclear disarmament agreement signed in the 1980s nato s 29 members are urging russia to destroy a nuclear capable cruise missile system before feb 2 failure to do so will put the us government on track for a threatened pull out of the 1987 imf treaty we have argued the breakdown of the imf treaty could be the catalyst that starts a new arms race between the united states russia and china as each projects military power in defense of spheres of influence outside their borders we are seeing this in the constant tension between the us and china in the south china sea and taiwan which china claims as its own and russian expansion into the ukraine and military support for syria while no one want to see the return of the nuclear threat if events escalate gold s safe haven status will kick in and we will see upward price pressure conclusion given that gold always pushes against the prevailing economic winds it appears likely that we could be in for an extended up leg in the price we are only now seeing the rot that has begun to set into the us economy the first clue was the stock market correction but others are coming forward as trump s 1 5 trillion tax cuts announced at year end 2017 finish percolating through the economy growth is predicted to stall we are already seeing disappointing corporate earnings especially from companies that sell into china which is also slowing down the trade war isn t helping unemployment is low but this is misleading many americans are working dead end jobs or are employed part time the gap between rich and poor is widening most importantly for gold the tightening cycle appears to have stalled with record debt on the books the central bank has very limited leeway in how fast and far it can raise interest rates if we are heading into a recession as some predict the fed may have no choice but to once again lower rates to stimulate the economy as it did in 2011 bad economic times ahead means good news for gold and gold stocks richard rick mills rick aheadoftheherd com richard is the owner of

easing or money printing machine larry summers who has been banging on about secular stagnation for ages has suggested it and so has ray dalio who is widely admired as a very big and canny hedge fund investor here s dalio s view dalio points out that since 1981 every cyclical peak and cyclical low in interest rates were lower than previous points until short term interest rates eventually fell to 0 which prevented a further rate cut in response central banks had to print more money and buy bonds that s where we find ourselves now he said interest rates around the world are at or near 0 spreads are relatively narrow because asset prices have been pushed up and debt levels are high as a result the ability of central banks to ease is limited at a time when the risks are more on the downside than the upside and most people have a dangerous long bias said differently the risks of the world being at or near the end of its long term debt cycle are significant 2 the end of the debt super cycle dalio speaks at length here in this linkedin post about his theory of the economy and the structural forces creating deflation there s that word again although i also wonder what he is long or short in while we don t know if we have just passed the key turning point we think that it should now be apparent that the risks of deflationary contractions are increasing relative to the risks of inflationary expansion because of these secular forces these long term debt cycle forces are clearly having big effects on china oil producers and emerging countries which are overly indebted in dollars and holding a huge amount of dollar assets at the same time as the world is holding large leveraged long positions while in our opinion the fed has over emphasized the importance of the cyclical i e the short term debt business cycle and underweighted the importance of the secular i e the long term debt supercycle they will react to what happens our risk is that they could be so committed to their highly advertised tightening path that it will be difficult for them to change to a significantly easier path if that should be required 3 maybe it is real john cassidy at the new yorker takes a good look at the latest stock market slump and concludes a correction was due and there are some fundamentals driving the latest falls he makes some good points about brazil and russia which hardly anyone is talking about for a quite a while now analysts who take seriously such valuation ratios as the price to earnings ratio and tobin s q ratio which measures the price of investment assets relative to their replacement cost have been warning about a crack in the market back in february andrew smithers a london based analyst warned that the u s market was trading seventy per cent above its fair value in may bob shiller a well known economist who teaches at yale said that there was a bubble element to the valuations present in the market as always the issue is timing raging bull markets usually go on for longer than skeptics such as myself predict that they will and they rarely end of their own accord sometimes the precipitating event is the prospect or reality of the federal reserve deciding to raise interest rates that s what happened in 1987 and 2000 on other occasions it takes some sort of shock such as the collapse of lehman brothers to set things off on this occasion there was a surfeit of proximate causes for one thing the era of zero per cent interest rates and ultra cheap money appears to be coming to an end with g d p growth picking up a bit after another slow start to the year wall street expects the fed to start raising rates either next month or in december then there is what s happening in the developing world it s not just that the chinese economy is slowing down and prompting the government in beijing to take countervailing measures such as trying and so far failing to prevent a stock market bubble from bursting brazil is in terrible shape and may be headed for a financial crisis the russian economy hit by sanctions and a collapsing oil price is also in a slump of the original bric countries only india looks to be in good shape 4 is mr market right about china martin wolf asks rightly at the ft if we should take any notice of the chinese stock market slump or the renminbi depreciation as any indicators of underlying economic problems in china particualrly given both markets are so skewed and fixed by china s government he also rightly concludes that china s attempts to arrest these falls shows how worried the government itself is events in the chinese market are of wider significance in two related ways one is that the chinese authorities decided to stake substantial resources and even their political authority on their unsurprisingly unsuccessful effort to stop the bubble s collapse the other is that they must have been driven to do so by concern over the economy if they are worried enough to bet on such a forlorn hope the rest of us should worry too nor is this the only way in which the behaviour of the chinese authorities gives reason for concern the other was the decision to devalue the renminbi on august 11 in itself this too is an unimportant event with a cumulative devaluation against the us dollar of just 2 8 per cent so far but it has significant implications the chinese authorities want room to slash interest rates as happened this tuesday again that underlines their concerns about the health of the economy another possible implication is that beijing might seek a revival of export led growth i find this hard to believe since the global consequences would be devastating but it is reasonable at least to worry about this destabilising possibility a last possible implication is that the chinese authorities are preparing to tolerate capital flight if so the us would be hoist by its own petard washington has sought capital account liberalisation by china it might then have to tolerate a destabilising short term consequence a weakening renminbi 5 from investment to consumption wolf also looks at the more important issue of whether china is successfully transitioning from investment and infrastructure spending to consumption and services this is crucial for new zealand we want more of the latter than the former suppose something like this were true according to official figures gross fixed investment was 44 per cent of gross domestic product in 2014 figures for investment are more likely to be correct than those for gdp but does it make economic sense for an economy to invest 44 per cent of gdp and yet grow at only 5 per cent no these data suggest ultra low if not negative marginal returns if so investment could fall sharply that might not lower potential growth provided wasteful investment were cut first but it would cause a collapse in demand everything the chinese authorities have been doing suggests they are worried about just that this worry about deficient aggregate demand is not new it has been a big concern ever since the west s financial crisis which devastated demand for china s exports this is why china then embarked on its own credit fuelled investment boom remarkably and worryingly the share of investment in gdp rose just as the growth of potential output declined that was not a sustainable combination in the longer term 6 back to that global savings glut wolf goes on to make some ominous comments about china s ability to achieve three things at once this now leaves the chinese authorities with three huge economic headaches the first is cleaning up the legacy of past financial excesses while avoiding a financial crisis the second is reshaping the economy so that it is more dependent on private and public consumption and less dependent on extraordinarily high levels of investment the third is achieving all that while sustaining dynamic growth of aggregate demand recent events matter because they suggest the chinese authorities have not yet worked out a way of pulling this triple combination off worse the expedients they have tried over the past seven years have made the predicament even worse maybe mr market has grasped how difficult this is going to be and so how destabilising some of the options the chinese might choose actually are these include devaluation ultra low interest rates and even quantitative easing if this is the case the market turmoil might not be foolish the global savings glut can get worse that would affect everybody 7 china s overnight shock and awe ambrose evans pritchard has a look at last night s rrr cut in china which frees up banks there to pump another us 101 billion of loans into the economy you d have to wonder how committed china is to rebalancing away from infrastructure if it does this sort of thing wei yao from societe generale said the rrr cut was absolutely necessary to stop liquidity drying up and to reverse the passive tightening over recent weeks caused by capital outflows it may not be enough to add any net stimulus to the economy liquidity conditions are still under immense pressure she said the pboc has intervened heavily on the exchange markets to defend the yuan drawing down reserves at a blistering pace the unwanted side effect is to tighten monetary policy it is a textbook case of why it can be so difficult for a country to deploy foreign reserves however large on paper in a recessionary downturn the great unknown is exactly how much money has been leaving the country since the pboc stunned markets by ditching its dollar exchange peg on august 11 and in doing so set off a global crash 8 has globalisation peaked the ft reports figures from the world trade monitor are causing some people to wonder if global trade has peaked world trade recorded its biggest contraction since the financial crisis in the first half of this year according to figures that will fuel a debate over whether globalisation has peaked the volume of global trade fell 0 5 per cent in the three months to june compared with the first quarter the netherlands bureau for economic policy analysis keepers of the world trade monitor said on tuesday those numbers built on what has been a grim pattern for global trade in recent years and the unwinding of a decades old rule that saw trade grow at twice the rate of the global economy as a result of what some have called hyperglobalisation in the three months to june global trade grew just 1 1 per cent from the same quarter of 2014 according to the new dutch figures the international monetary fund expects the global economy to grow 3 5 per cent this year much of this year s slowdown in global trade has been due to a halting recovery in europe as well as a slowing economy in china mr koopman said the global economy s growth engine had been operating as if it had a mechanical fault for some time with good growth in some countries offset by weak growth in others but there is also clearly a structural shift happening in the global economy he said and that means slowing global trade is likely to endure for some time 9 totally john oliver because he s usually funny 10 totally

by bhcm the usd shares of bhm ended 2018 up 14 16 the fund generated positive returns each quarter across a wide range of strategies with solid contributions from us european and uk interest rate trading together with developed and emerging market fx trading at the start of the year the fund was positioned for an increase in the level of us rates and a steepening of the us yield curve as the market moved towards pricing a greater degree of tightening by the federal reserve these positions generated early gains over this period the fund also generated gains from short dated basis trading of us interest rates as well as from tactical positioning in uk rates as opportunities in those areas improved in line with the increase in market volatility and uncertainty around the direction of policy rates heading into the italian elections in march the fund was positioned for an increase in political stress however the market s initially muted response to the elections resulted in small losses for these positions through april and may the market fully repriced the probability of a rate move by the bank of england which eventually elected not to hike interest rates at its may meeting this change in market pricing also created good opportunity for the fund to profit furthermore as the market started to focus on a series of policy proposals from the incoming italian government levels of stress across european markets increased positions across a variety of european interest rate swap and bond markets as well as fx credit and equity markets generated strong gains as the year progressed the directional and yield curve positioning in us interest rates became more tactical with these strategies generating positive returns each quarter us interest rate basis trading also generated positive returns in each quarter during the second half of the year good opportunities for fx trading existed across a broad range of developed and emerging markets resulting in positive returns being generated every month as an example the fund was able to profit through option volatility strategies from the sharp moves in the turkish lira moving to the economic backdrop in 2018 the year began with a globally synchronised expansion that generated considerable optimism among investors by the end of the year the global outlook had frayed with overall financial returns turning in their worst performance since the crisis in 2008 the us was the best performing major economy driven by easy fiscal policy and accommodative monetary policy the us economy surprised on the upside growing approximately 3 with nearly 2 core personal consumption expenditures inflation in response the federal reserve delivered four rate hikes bringing the top end of the policy range to 2 5 higher us interest rates and the appreciation in the us dollar caused ripples abroad especially in vulnerable emerging market economies with their own idiosyncratic problems like argentina and turkey among the other major economies euro area growth and inflation undershot expectations nevertheless the ecb ended the expansion of its balance sheet political uncertainty in europe remains high dominated by populist movements in various countries and the unresolved brexit negotiations in china and japan growth was uneven and inflation generally disappointed while the monetary and fiscal response was tempered the outlook going forward is considerably more uncertain given the tightening in financial conditions in q4 weaker global growth and policy related headwinds from trade disputes looking forward the crosscurrents in the outlook will probably persist in 2019 making for an unsettled macro environment

participating around the world and thank you for joining our 2018 year end earnings call let s begin with slide 3 and review the highlights for 2018 and our progress in advancing our value driven growth strategy record setting earnings in our intermediates derivatives and technology segments partially offset declines primarily in our olefins and polyolefins europe asia and international segment to provide 4 7 billion of net income and 6 9 billion of ebitda for the year increased cash generation helped to fund growth investments while we improved our free cash flow yield by over 200 basis points and posted a strong 27 return on our invested capital during 2018 the acquisition of a schulman in august made lyondellbasell the world s largest plastics compounding company in conjunction with this acquisition we launched our advanced polymer solutions business segment to provide focus and visibility for this new global platform and quickly went to work on integration that achieved an annualized synergy run rate of 47 million by the end of the year progress continues and we remain confident that we will meet or exceed our target to capture 150 million of integration related synergies within two years of the closing date in march we re launching an innovative plastics recycling joint venture with suez that provides a meaningful and sustainable solution for plastic waste we are pleased with initial market demand for these premium recycled plastics and continue to optimize the operational and commercial performance of the business model with an eye toward replicating this model in other parts of europe we advanced our pipeline of organic growth projects during 2018 with our new hyperzone hdpe plant scheduled for start up in the third quarter of this year and construction of the world s largest po tba plant on track for completion in the latter part of 2021 these projects not only increase our production capacity but also represent milestones for the commercialization of proprietary technologies such as our new hyperzone process for polyethylene and the latest developments from our advantaged propylene oxide and co product technologies we continue to actively manage our business portfolio with several small acquisitions and divestitures around the world while we evaluate other opportunities including a potential acquisition of braskem in the meantime our cash flows enabled us to opportunistically repurchase 19 2 million shares of lyondellbasell s stock and return over 3 4 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases in 2018 our company continued to deliver on our promise of value driven growth through a balanced strategy of operational excellence profitable organic expansions accretive m a and significant shareholder returns please turn to slide 4 where i m proud to report that lyondellbasell s employees and contractors finished the year with a significant 14 improvement in our safety performance during 2018 our injury rate was challenged by the need to improve upon the safety performance at the facilities we acquired from a schulman we are diligently working to ensure all of our employees contractors assets and the communities in which we operate finish the day in the same or better condition than they were at the start of the day our goal remains zero incidents or injuries every day of the year let s turn to slide 5 and review some of the detail behind our fourth quarter and annual results diluted earnings were 1 79 per share for the quarter and we earned 12 01 during the full year as shown in the chart on the left after excluding significant non cash tax benefits in 2017 and 2018 earnings per share increased by approximately 10 in 2018 for the fourth quarter of 2018 we incurred 20 million of integration costs related to the schulman acquisition that impacted quarterly earnings by 0 04 per share transaction and integration costs impacted the full year results by 0 14 per share in addition to typical fourth quarter seasonal headwinds seen in our industry our business was challenged by the substantial 40 fall in the price of crude oil that began in early october customers often delay orders and destock inventories during periods of declining oil prices in expectations of lower petrochemical and plastics prices volumes decline in nearly every business across our six segments during the fourth quarter as crude prices rebound in in late december and january our order volumes have improved we ve seen european and asian industrial demand impacted by disruptions in the automotive sector arising from issues with chinese consumer lending new vehicle testing standards in europe and trade uncertainties we believe that global consumer demand remained strong and we ll be closely watching trends in asia after the lunar new year holidays in early february during our third quarter earnings call i outlined three major plan maintenance outages that were estimated to impact fourth quarter earnings by a total of 95 million extended maintenance low rhine river water levels and feedstock supply disruptions at one of our suppliers increased the fourth quarter impact to our o p eai segment by approximately 110 million additionally results were impacted by approximately 20 million by unplanned events in our intermediates and derivatives and refining segments altogether planned and unplanned downtime impacted our fourth quarter earnings by approximately 225 million we do not expect such high levels of maintenance over the coming months during the first half of 2019 our only planned maintenance is scheduled for the first quarter in our o p americas segment we expect that first quarter downtime will impact earnings for the whole company by approximately 60 million to 70 million and now thomas will provide more detail on our financial highlights for the fourth quarter and the year thomas aebischer executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you bob and good day to all of you please turn to slide 6 which illustrates the developments of our business segments over the past two years in 2018 lyondellbasell s business portfolio demonstrated remarkable resilience to changing market environments our intermediates and derivatives segment profitability improved by approximately 35 and for the first time exceeding 2 billion in ebitda our technology group granted 16 licenses for new polyolefin plant designs that helped improve segment ebitda by 47 as seen in the chart these improvements helped to offset declines in o p eai the profitability offsets provided by the geographic and product diversity of our business portfolio is a recurring theme for lyondellbasell and an attribute that we seek to maintain manage and extend as we consider strategic options for the company in olefins and polyolefins americas high industry margins for polyethylene helped to offset the majority of the decline in olefin margins our business continues to benefit from strong demand and advantaged shale based feedstocks that enabled us to retain 95 of our prior year profitability for the segment the results for our new advanced polymer solutions segment includes contributions from the a schulman acquisition beginning in late august 2018 our progress toward our goal of 150 million in synergies is on schedule and will become more apparent during 2019 our houston refinery run very well during 2018 and we completed all major scheduled maintenance for the next two years we expect refining market conditions to rebalance during the first half of 2019 and look forward to strong refinery runs that will capture expected benefits of new sulfur regulations for marine fuels in late 2019 and 2020 now please turn to slide 7 where you can see that our businesses generated 1 3 billion of cash from operating activities during the fourth quarter which contributed to 5 5 billion of cash generation for the year during the quarter investment in capital expenditures increased to approximately 700 million as we ramped up construction of our po tba plant and continue to move our hyperzone plant forward toward start up as the stock market entered a correction during the fourth quarter we significantly increased our share repurchases in response to lower share prices in the fourth quarter we repurchased 11 5 million shares the most in any quarter since 2016 we returned 1 4 billion to shareholders in dividends and share purchases during the fourth quarter in 2018 our opportunistic buyback strategy allowed us to repurchase 8 more shares than would have occurred if we deployed the same amount of cash in equal amounts every trading day of the year the quarter closed with over 1 8 billion of cash and liquid investment on the balance sheet we approximately with approximately 2 5 billion of unused and available credit facilities we completed the quarter with a total liquidity in excess of 4 billion turning to slide 8 let s review our capital deployment over the past six years the light blue bars depict our cash generation from operating activities which has ranged between 4 8 billion to 6 billion since 2013 the stack bars on the right depict our uses of cash ranked in order of priority our highest priority is represented by the dark blue on the bottom our progressively growing dividend during 2018 we increased our dividend by 11 this strong increase reflected an improved out outlook after we updated our views on tax reform and the petrochemical industry we have a top quartile dividend that is currently yielding approximately 4 6 return our next priority is maintenance capital to support the safety and reliability of our operations going forward this baseline investment is approximately 1 1 billion per year the remainder of the orange bar is allocated to profit generating capital investment to support growth projects we estimate this investment will increase to 1 7 billion in 2019 the gray bars reflect our share repurchases we have returned over 18 billion in share repurchases since the inception of the program our buybacks add up to over 280 208 million shares or 36 of the shares that were outstanding in 2013 at the inception of the program opportunistic share repurchase will continue to be a component of our capital deployment the green bar represents last year s a schulman transaction our first significant acquisition we continued to maintain a conservative balance sheet that provides optionality to pursue value creating opportunities and we will continuously reevaluate the relative merits of organic projects grows through m a and share repurchases to optimize returns for our investors now please turn to slide 9 where i would like to address some of your annual modeling questions for 2019 regarding capital we are currently planning to invest approximately 2 8 billion during 2019 to support both our base maintenance and growth programs approximately 60 is targeted toward profit generating growth the majority of this growth investment in 2019 will be dedicated to the new po tba plant although not all plants are finalized we estimate capital spending will average 2 8 billion annually through 2021 for 2019 we have a fairly typical plant maintenance schedule activities during the year will impact annual ebitda by approximately 160 million to 200 million in addition to the first quarter plant maintenance in o p americas mentioned by bob the segment will also have a cracker turnaround in the third quarter that is expected to impact ebitda by approximately 70 to 80 million in our intermediates and derivatives segment we have planned maintenance event that will impact ebitda by approximately 30 million to 40 million in each of the third and fourth quarter in addition to the first quarter planned maintenance in o p americas mentioned by bob the segment will also have a cracker turnaround in the third quarter that is expected to impact ebitda by approximately 70 million to 80 million in our intermediates and derivatives segment we have planned maintenance event that will impact ebitda by approximately 30 million to 40 million in each of the third and fourth quarters our net cash interest expense for 2019 is expected to be approximately 400 million 2019 annual book depreciation and amortization should be approximately 1 3 billion we plan to make regular pension contribution in 2019 that total 110 million and we estimate the pension expense of approximately 90 million we currently expects that 2019 effective tax rate of approximately 20 and that our cash tax rate will be slightly lower than the effective tax rate i will now turn the call back to bob for a more detailed discussion of our segment results thank you bhavesh v patel chief executive officer thank you thomas let s turn to slide 10 and review our segment results in our olefins and polyolefins americas segment fourth quarter ebitda was 631 million a 73 million decrease versus the third quarter for the full year segment ebitda was approximately 2 8 billion relative to the third quarter 2018 olefins results improved by approximately 70 million due to higher ethylene prices and the declining gulf coast ethane costs our cracker operating rates averaged 93 during the fourth quarter exceeding the average industry performance of 87 approximately 80 of our ethylene production was from ethane and 94 came from ngls polyolefin results were approximately 115 million lower than the prior period primarily due to a 0 04 per pound decline in polyethylene spread over ethylene for the full year results decreased by 137 million olefin results declined by approximately 445 million primarily due to a 0 06 per pound reduction in ethylene price spread improvements in polyethylene and polypropylene of 0 07 per pound and 0 03 per pound respectively drove an approximately 360 million improvement in polyolefins to mostly offset the declines in olefins ihs is currently forecasting relatively stable polyethylene chain margins for the first quarter we are optimistic that 2019 will offer our earnings growth for the segment has the pace of polyethylene capacity additions slows while global demand growth remained steady please turn to slide 11 as we review the performance of our olefins and polyolefins europe asia and international segments during the fourth quarter ebitda was 127 million or a 135 million lower than the third quarter for the full year ebitda was 1 2 billion we continue to optimize our portfolio in the fourth quarter by divesting a carbon black subsidiary in france this benefited the quarter by 36 million compared to the third quarter olefins results decreased by approximately 75 million primarily driven by a decline in volume combined polyolefin results decreased approximately 35 million driven by decreased margins equity income decreased by 43 million primarily due to planned maintenance at our polish korean and saudi joint ventures full year ebitda results were 764 million lower than 2017 2017 benefited from a gain of 108 million on the sale of our interest in geosel 2018 results included the benefit from the sale of our carbon black subsidiary and a favorable impact of approximately 95 million due to an increase in the euro versus the us dollar exchange rate relative to 2017 olefin results for the full year decreased approximately 370 million compared to 2017 increased feedstock costs during most of the year resulted in margin declines while planned and unplanned maintenance and low rhine river levels resulted in a volume decrease of approximately 10 combined polyolefins results decreased approximately 345 million due to 0 03 per pound and 0 02 per pound lower spreads in polyethylene and polypropylene respectively joint venture equity income decreased by 46 million primarily due to lower polyolefins spreads in january demand is improving following the typical seasonal declines and destocking of the fourth quarter on slide 12 let s take a look at our intermediates and derivatives segment fourth quarter ebitda was 379 million a decline of 125 million from the prior quarter for the full year the segment generated over 2 billion setting an annual record and improving over the prior year by 521 million fourth quarter po and derivatives results decreased by approximately 10 million when compared with the prior period primarily due to lower volumes partially offset by higher margins intermediate chemicals decreased 65 million primarily due to reduced styrene and acetyls margins oxyfuels and related products results decreased approximately 40 million driven by margin declines due to higher ethanol pricing relative to crude oil and a volume decline due to planned maintenance during 2018 the 521 million improvement in ebitda was largely driven by margin improvements across all products due to tight market conditions and improved contracting strategies we re very proud of the team s accomplishments in 2018 and we expect continued benefits from this work in future years while ihs is forecasting some moderation in methanol pricing for the first quarter we should see improved po and derivatives volumes for the segment due to the completion of the planned maintenance at our bayport texas facility during the fourth quarter slide 13 charts the full year results from i d business improvements we discussed during our second quarter earnings call you might recall that while the majority of the increased profitability was attributable to tight market conditions and reduced maintenance downtime at our facilities we also described lyondellbasell s improved contracting strategies and reliability as sources of durable improvements that should persist beyond 2018 historically our intermediates and derivatives segment generated relatively consistent ebitda that averaged approximately 1 5 billion per year we believe our new midpoint in typical markets will be approximately 1 7 billion while the strong markets seen in 2018 may moderate we do not believe these improved margins will fully revert in 2019 in addition we ve not stopped pursuing self help within this business this year we expect i d contracting improvements to provide an additional 100 million of annual ebitda for the segment starting in mid 2019 on slide 14 let s review the results of our advanced polymer solutions segment fourth quarter ebitda was 86 million a 16 million improvement over the prior period for the full year ebitda was 400 million fourth quarter transaction and integration costs were 20 million compounding and solutions results improved approximately 15 million over the third quarter as we realized the full quarter of contribution from the addition of a schulman product lines this was partially offset by volume and margin declines in polypropylene compounds advanced polymers results decreased approximately 15 million due to lower margins and volumes full year ebitda results for the segment were 38 million lower than 2017 transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition impacted the segment by a 69 million in 2018 compounding and solutions results improved approximately 15 million with higher volumes from new product lines partially offset by lower volume and margin in polypropylene compounds advanced polymers results increased approximately 15 million due to higher volumes integration activities are well under way and we have captured 47 million in forward annualized run rate synergies as of december 31st we expect to see continued improvement in this segment as we begin 2019 with a return of higher seasonal volumes and our continued focus on capturing value from the integration activities turning to slide 15 let s discuss the performance of our refining segment fourth quarter ebitda was negative 84 million 168 million decline from the third quarter for the full year ebitda was 167 million or a 10 million improvement over 2017 planned maintenance on one of our two crude and coker trains was completed in november as a result the average crude throughput was 184 000 barrels per day or 48 000 barrels per day less than the third quarter with this work behind us the refinery is prepared to run full rates for the next two years and benefit from expected market opportunities in the fourth quarter the maya 2 1 1 crack spread declined significantly averaging less than a 11 per barrel for the first quarter and only 9 57 during november over the previous 12 years the maya 2 1 1 has been below 10 for only one month in december of 2011 the average over this time period is more than 22 per barrel spreads are improving as pemex adjusts a monthly k factor of the maya crude oil price formula to ensure that mexican crude remains competitively priced for the us gulf coast refining market for the full year refining margins increased when compared with 2017 due to discounted canadian crude pricing and improved fluid catalytic cracker conversion rates crude throughput was 231 000 barrels per day in 2018 slightly lower than 2017 absent our recent planned maintenance throughput would have averaged 256 000 barrels per day for the full year i d like to congratulate our refinery team for their diligent work and dedication to improve our refinery reliability with our planned maintenance completed we look forward to stronger contributions from our refinery in 2019 as we continue to benefit from improved reliability and an increase to maya 2 1 1 crack spread i would not like to turn to slide 16 and speak with you about a topic of growing global concern the management of plastic waste i think most of you are well aware of how billions of people benefit from advances in plastic in fact our products are well aligned with the united nations sustainable development goals such as a reducing hunger and food spoilage by durable packaging delivering safe drinking water with plastic pipes and reducing energy consumption with innovative materials however we now face the growing problem of what to do with the plastic once it has served its initial purpose the concern over plastic waste management is leading governments and consumers to consider bans on plastic straws and bags but these products make up only a small fraction of the plastic waste that ends up in our oceans some suggests that we should replace all plastics with alternative materials but most alternatives bring higher overall environmental and economic costs on slide 17 i m very proud to highlight an alliance formed by lyondellbasell along with more than 25 of our industry peers and other participants across the value chain that make use sell process collect and recycle plastics together we have committed over 1 billion with the goal of investing 1 5 billion over the next five years in collaborative partnerships to advance meaningful solutions that eliminate plastic waste in our environment the alliance s approach is based on four pillars infrastructure that stops plastic waste from entering the environment innovation in materials technologies and business models that increased the value of plastic waste engagement with partners and government business and consumers to enable solutions and meaningful projects to cleanup plastic waste that has already escaped into our environment new infrastructure to prevent and cleanup plastic waste is especially important in emerging economies where collection practices often lag the developed world once plastic is collected and appropriately sorted the waste can become a valuable feedstock for technologies that create versatile new materials from these post use plastics lyondellbasell s qcp recycling joint venture with suez is an example of an innovative business model that embraces this vision for a circular plastics economy education and engagement with governments businesses and communities is critical to the success of these initiatives the collaborative work of our alliance will be more powerful and efficient than fragmented efforts by each member of company working alone our surveys show that 10 rivers transport more than 90 of the river based plastics to the ocean and more than 50 of land based plastic waste leakage comes from only five countries there will be a focus on developing solutions that stop this leakage at their sources and cleanup areas with the existing plastic waste by recognizing the value of reusing plastic while we certainly have an immense challenge ahead of us i m confident that our alliance will find meaningful solutions to help end plastic waste and create a sustainable future for our industry and our planet now let s turn to slide 18 and discuss the outlook for 2019 ethylene feedstocks were volatile during the second half of 2018 with us gulf coast ethane prices spiking up in september and then reverting in november as we discussed during our third quarter earnings call lyondellbasell has the optionality across our us assets with ethylene production from both low cost midwest ethane and feedstock flexibility at our gulf coast crackers ngl prices are likely to show some volatility during 2019 with increased demand from the remaining new ethylene crackers likely to arrive ahead of planned ngl pipeline and fractionation capacity additions we expect that this pattern of prolong start ups for ethylene crackers along with ngl supply additions will smooth the path forward toward forecast for a return to plentiful feedstock availability within the next year we re encouraged by a forecast for polyethylene demand growth to continue with long term historical ranges of 4 to 5 over the past three years capacity additions have surpassed demand and moderated operating rates with less global capacity scheduled to start up during 2019 and 2020 we believe that lyondellbasell s new hyperzone hdpe capacity will find favorable markets as we ramp up during the second half of this year turning to slide 19 let me summarize the year s highlights in 2018 our strong earnings were supported by record annual ebitda in our intermediates and derivatives and technology segments we ll continue to benefit from some of the improvements from both segments through contracting changes in i d and licensing growth in technology our company generated approximately 5 5 billion of cash from operating activities this strong cash generation contributed to growth through profit generating capital investments and the acquisition of a schulman furthermore we continue to provide significant shareholder returns through a growing top quartile dividend and 1 9 billion in share repurchases by completing the acquisition of a schulman we have created the world s largest plastics compounding business and we are well under way with integration activities that are capturing significant synergies in our new advanced polymer solutions segment our strong cash flows and healthy balance sheet leave us well positioned to take advantage of additional value creating inorganic opportunities in 2018 we advance on the construction of our hyperzone polyethylene plant and we look forward to the added profitability will contribute to our o p americas segment following the start up in the third quarter last august we also began construction of po tba plant that will start up in 2021 providing further earnings growth for our i d segment we move forward on sustainable solutions for our company by forming quality circular polymers our premium plastics recycling joint venture with suez and in collaboration with our industry leaders we formed the alliance to end plastic waste to generate sustainable global solutions for plastic waste that will benefit our industry and the environment going into 2019 we look forward to increase production and availability of shale based feedstocks and a moderation in the pace of capacity additions that should provide a favorable environment for our new hdpe capacity and that allow us to maximize value from our diverse global business portfolio with that said we re now pleased to take your questions questions and answers operator operator instructions our first question comes from duffy fischer your line is open patrick duffy fischer barclays analyst yes good morning fellows bhavesh v patel chief executive officer good morning patrick duffy fischer barclays analyst first question ihs is calling last year polyethylene demand up about 7 which is pretty meaningfully higher than say the 20 year run rate one would you agree with that and two where was that extra demand coming from what caused that to accelerate in your mind bhavesh v patel chief executive officer so duffy we in fact did see that especially in the first three quarters of the year quite a bit of it was in the pipe and packaging segment of the business so not only here in the us but more exports as well which drove global demand growth patrick duffy fischer barclays analyst okay and then on the supply side again several of the global consultants now have less they would have in excess of 20 new naphtha plants coming online in china they kind of call it 2021 and beyond obviously you guys got some insight into that with your licensing business how should we think about what the knowledge base you have kind of across that space what will that wave look like obviously it s not going to be that many but is it 10 is it 15 how many in that mid 20s periods should we think about naphtha crackers in china bhavesh v patel chief executive officer yeah duffy as we have our discussions we don t see that magnitude in that timeframe a lot of them are under consideration but i would say the timeline is much later than what s described and so we ll look for those updates as those projects reach final investment decisions but we expect that those will go forward further in terms of timing patrick duffy fischer barclays analyst great thank you guys bhavesh v patel chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from david begleiter your line is open david begleiter deutsche bank analyst thank you good morning bhavesh v patel chief executive officer good morning david begleiter deutsche bank analyst bob just some on braskem is there a point where you need to make a decision either way and just move forward as is has been sorry to say dragging on for quite a while here bhavesh v patel chief executive officer yeah well david we ve it s a very as i ve talked about in the past it s a very complex transactions and in terms of the timeline the part of the protracted timeline has been the pause because of the change in government and given sort of the shareholder ownership that you all know about braskem so i can tell you that we ve completed very high quality due diligence we have a few follow up items but i think as we sit here today we better understand issues and value creation drivers we had been in discussions with relevant stakeholders including auto brasch we don t know whether these discussions will lead to an agreement we ll and but i can tell you we d only move forward at the right price and if we believe the transaction creates significant value for all of our stakeholders david begleiter deutsche bank analyst very helpful and just one last thing bob on o p americas ebitda in 2019 i think you said you think you can grow this business in 19 versus 18 can you provide a little more color on that thought process given again some new capacity coming on stream and low polyethylene prices in q4 bhavesh v patel chief executive officer yeah i think a lot of that david is the hyperzone plant our new polyethylene capacity coming online you ll recall today ethylene margins are have been very thin so to the extent that we can integrate downstream and capture more of the ethane to polyethylene chain margin that will contribute and it s a world scale plant so it will make a difference in terms of the o p americas profitability david begleiter deutsche bank analyst thank you very much bhavesh v patel chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from vincent andrews your line is open vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst thank you bob are you i m looking at your table 2 with the volume that you sold obviously in polyethylene in the us it was the lowest number on that page and i m assuming the same is true in many of the other products around the world so are you carrying a lot of inventory into 2019 and assuming you run at usual production rate should we should 2019 be a much bigger volume year on an organic basis bhavesh v patel chief executive officer yeah so in terms of inventory no we re not carrying unusually high amounts of inventory across our entire system so i think there is some inventory build for turnaround that we re expecting here in the us of our largest polyethylene plant it s a 2 billion pound per year of polyethylene plant that will have a turnaround in the q1 otherwise the inventories we don t see is being high across the system and frankly downstream because the destocking happened and we think that inventories are quite moderate or kind of below average downstream as well vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst and as go ahead thomas aebischer executive vice president and chief financial officer when you look at the inventory difference year over year on a cash basis it s about a 90 million change versus 2017 so really small vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst okay and in the i d business one of the bright spots in 2018 was the acetyls chain and the spot margins if you look at those have just come in considerably since the third quarter of 18 what are your expectations for those margins can get back to in 2019 bhavesh v patel chief executive officer well vincent i mean it s difficult to predict where they ll go but you ve seen the potential in 18 and the correction has been fairly significant so we ll have to see how that develops i think when you think about our i d business the methanol the acetyls and the styrene margins tend to be the most dynamic part of the portfolio but as i mentioned in my prepared remarks underlying all of that we have more contracting improvements that will accrue to the earnings of i d starting about mid year so i think we ve reached that sort of the base in i d from 1 5 billion ph to 1 7 billion ph and if styrene and methanol markets turn out to be directionally what they were in 18 then we should have another very strong year in i d vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst okay sounds great thanks so much bhavesh v patel chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from aleksey yefremov your line is open sir aleksey yefremov nomura securities analyst thank you good morning everyone you indicated in one of the slides where your you expect po tba earnings to be based on the average for 2014 2018 margins where are the margins today relative to that historical average bhavesh v patel chief executive officer i don t know where the margins are today versus the historical average but we tend to take periods of time when we communicate because if we take narrower timeframes price margins can be much higher or lower so we re very constructive about the market and if you think about tba and specifically mtbe last year especially in the second half gasoline demand and gasoline margins were quite low so we think some improvement in that in addition to lower butane prices which we saw during the winter we think those that boded very well for the mtbe part of our i d business aleksey yefremov nomura securities analyst thank you bob and you spend sometime in recycling how strong is the business case for some capital deployment into to recycling today and also do you see sort of some threat to plastics demand in the near term and over the next 12 months 24 months especially in europe from government policies here bhavesh v patel chief executive officer well so first of all what we ve learned from our qcp joint venture is that collection and segregation are very important and in the past what has ailed the recycling business is this that the input is very mixed and so i think that s what s the differential about our joint venture with suez as we get relatively segregated polyolefin waste that and is further segregated in our venture and then washed and then recycled in terms of impact on demand i think it will take a bit of time for the infrastructure to get in place and to be built out so in the near term we don t expect meaning the next 2 years 3 years 4 years and we don t expect a meaningful impact and we ll just have to watch and see the pace of infrastructure growth in terms of europe i can tell you that even in recent meetings with that my team has had with leadership in brussels the focus is more on a circular economy rather than deselection of plastics and that was again reaffirmed in recent discussions so we think that our approach with the qcp venture is very well placed and the idea for us is to now build out that platform throughout europe and we re focused on doing that aleksey yefremov nomura securities analyst thank you bhavesh v patel chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from robert koort your line is open dylan campbell goldman sachs analyst good morning this is dylan campbell on for bob a quick question one of your competitors is pushing a price increase for they were for january and they are for february for polyethylene in americas i guess what is lyondell s expectation for the first quarter here for polyethylene price and given that at least one consultant is saying that inventory levels are at the highest level and maybe a decade bhavesh v patel chief executive officer well first of all i don t want to comment on direction of prices here on the call but i can tell you that as we look at january we are seeing in the us more return to more normal demand and we expect as february march and april progress seasonally we tend to see an uptick in demand because of packaging and so on and what we hear from our customers is that that seasonal uptick in demand should be expected and if you think about downstream inventories because of the destocking that occurred with those with the reducing oil price we think downstream inventory are quite lean so when you look at inventories you really have to look at the inventories in the chain rather than just in one part of the chain and so i think all this will normalize and our sense is if you step back and look at operating rates globally they still look to be among the highest we ve seen in polyethylene in the past four years so i think the setup is very constructive for the entire year given that demand typically grows in the first two quarters to three quarters of the year and so i mean i think operating rates are high and that points to a very constructive market dylan campbell goldman sachs analyst got it thank you and i guess a quick clarification question you guys mentioned polyethylene to ethylene spreads declined 0 04 per pound sequentially quarter over quarter but i guess if i look in your data supplement polyethylene prices declined by only 0 01 to 0 02 per pound and ethylene was fairly flat quarter over quarter i guess was lyondell selling a bigger discount versus the market or can you just help working me through that math bhavesh v patel chief executive officer sure so that you are referring to the polyethylene gasoline margin for us and the way we transfer ethylene price internally is it s a spot it s a blend of contract and spot and you ll note that in q4 we saw a rising spot price of ethylene so really there was more margin in olefins and a little bit less in polyethylene it it s not a reflection on the revenue of polyethylene dylan campbell goldman sachs analyst got it thank you operator thank you our next question comes from arun viswanathan your line is open sir arun shankar viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst hi guys thanks for taking my question so first off just wanted to ask about kind of the level of earnings here was kind of penetrated pretty substantially in q4 to 1 2 billion ph 1 3 billion ph i guess we saw like a 1 4 billion ph 1 5 billion ph in q4 of 16 i guess what gives you guys the confidence in this snap back in q2 through q4 i guess i m just curious on europe and refining is well feedstocks have come down in europe is there a possibility that you could see some recovery there or would be or pricing would be challenged to take in a lower feedstock environment like that thanks bhavesh v patel chief executive officer yeah thanks arun first of all so if you think about q4 there were kind of three big drivers that we think are kind of one offs first of all we talked about the environment of declining crude oil price and the related destocking and how price moves in that kind of environment a 40 decline in one quarter is really enormous and that s largely played out and oil prices rebounded so we think that s constructive as we look at first half of 19 in terms of europe and eai just from one cracker turnaround that extended past our planned window and the rhine river and some so we had one of our suppliers of feedstock had a disruption that all we think impacted earnings by about 100 million in q4 largely behind us rhine river is back to normal levels our cracker is expected to be for most of the quarter at full rate so 100 million impact we think is really isolated to q4 and then in refining i mean we re sitting here with maya 2 1 1 spreads that are the lowest we ve seen since the 08 timeframe and what s driven that is a few factors first of all you will recall that the k the so called k factor is what get determines the delta between mexican crude and light crude if you will that k factor has been slow to adjust so the light heavy differential has been almost zero of late so we think that will revert we re already seeing some correction to the k factor and we expect more to come and of a long gasoline market that i described which may persist i don t know but i do think the light heavy differential and in particular how maya is priced we should see improvement as the quarter progresses so largely the maintenance impacts in europe were isolated to one unit and they re kind of behind us arun shankar viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst great thanks and as a follow up maybe could you i don t know what you can say on this but maybe if you could just explain maybe some high level some of the strategic benefits in a potential braskem deal would it allow you to reduce your long ethylene position and it obviously will grow in polypropylene but and then also how do you feel about the vinyls chain and participating there is that something that is would be considered core to you guys thanks bhavesh v patel chief executive officer so in terms of the strategic merits i mean i think and first of all when you think about brazil the outlook for brazil continues to improve and the expectations are positive under the new government so and it s an economy if you look at the imf report it s one of the few in the world that s expected to grow at a reasonably good rates we think longer term the economy there hold good potential a scenario where we don t have much of a position so it makes us even more of a global producer and seller of polyolefins in the case of the us and europe there is in part a consolidation opportunity and also a lot of our technology is deployed within braskem so those are just a few of the merits strategic merits of a transaction like that as i mentioned earlier it s got to be at the right price and it has to be significantly value creating for our shareholders arun shankar viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst thanks operator thank you our next question comes from pj juvekar your line is open pj juvekar citigroup analyst yes hi good morning bob bhavesh v patel chief executive officer good morning pj juvekar citigroup analyst on refining you didn t mention imo 2020 and we are hearing some mixed reviews about the benefit of imo 2020 to grms i was wondering if you could comment on that bhavesh v patel chief executive officer well thank you for asking that i was hoping somebody would ask me so i could work it into my commentary i mean i think pj imo we still see meaningful impact especially because we have such a heavy crude processing refinery yes recent press suggest that maybe some of the impact will be muted we actually think if we look at forward curves now perhaps the expectations have corrected to the low side whereas perhaps at the end of last year there was a little bit more enthusiasm we do continue to believe that there will be a positive impact from imo starting in late q3 into q4 as the inventory is rotated into the lower sulfur and diesel and that s deployed across the network around the world and then 2020 we do expect some meaningful impact from imo 2020 so but the thing we can control is we ve got to operate well and i think we ve positioned ourselves by completing all of our maintenance to run at full rates and capture whatever opportunity lies ahead and i continue to think that there will be a meaningful benefit and late this year into 2020 pj juvekar citigroup analyst great thank you and secondly i m glad to see you taking the lead on plastic recycling issue i think the industry needed to do something there i guess when you look at plastic recycling the issue has been the economics of recycling and recycling never made any money in developed markets like the us maybe it makes money in the emerging markets because of cheaper labor but can you talk about the economics of that and how do you work that into the solution bhavesh v patel chief executive officer well i think pj well first of all i appreciate the recognition in terms of the momentum around the alliance and so on and it s credit goes to a lot of companies who have been really a catalyst for getting this going in terms of the economics of recycling as i mentioned earlier really better collection and segregation of the source is critical to the economics and then building up scale and doing the recycling closer to where the waste is collected as it s adding costs by moving waste around the world detracts from the economics so and to tell you that s what we re focused on as with the qcp venture in europe and we believe it s a model that can be replicated certainly within europe and as we develop that further we ll think about other jurisdictions around the world pj juvekar citigroup analyst thank you bhavesh v patel chief executive officer all right thank you david kinney director investor relations yeah if we could limit to one question we still have eight folks in the queue and i don t want to take up your lunch hour there today thanks operator thank you our next question comes from jonas oxgaard your line is open jonas oxgaard sanford c bernstein analyst morning bhavesh v patel chief executive officer good morning jonas oxgaard sanford c bernstein analyst if we re sticking to the plastic waste here you have a slide there 17 it shows four different pillars can you talk a little bit about how do you actually intend to or how does the alliance intend to invest here are they giving grants to companies universities is that you re expected to do it in house and can you give us a little bit of a breakdown on how much do you think is going to be focused on each of the four pillars bhavesh v patel chief executive officer well so that the in terms of the allocation there will be we ll move in parallel and on all four there is not waiting more strongly toward one or the other but if you were to go to the website endplasticwaste org you can see the initial actions the alliance will take which were back backing and supporting an effort through a company called renewlogy that is converting waste plastic into fuel there is a fund called circulate capital that s funding initiatives around the world that directionally end plastic waste so jonas i d encourage you to look at that and that s going to be we want to move on all four fronts we do believe that we ve got a slow down and stop which entering the environment we need to address what s already in the environment and education and innovation are going to be what s going to make this more sort of structural and sustainable part in the fund over the long period of time jonas oxgaard sanford c bernstein analyst okay thank you operator our next question comes from john roberts your line is open john roberts ubs analyst thank you slide 18 talks about the expected volatility in ethane which i assume is even after the sasol cracker has been pushed out to the back end of this year do you think the industry needs to do additional technical difficulty here in the short term to maybe pulling forward some downtime to ease up on the ethane pressures that might cause another spike bhavesh v patel chief executive officer so john that some of the news around the delays is quite fresh and we ve not included that in our analysis here but indeed you re right that what i ve read certainly says that there are some incremental delays in some of the new crackers coming so our view is that in a lower oil price environment like we have and you ll recall last year we said that more of the ngls that are coming from the permian contain more butane and propane as ethane was rejected which caused kind of this run up in ethane all of this is to say that alternative feedstocks like propane butane liquids will be very competitive at lower oil price more propane and butane available especially after we get through the winter season and export capacity in the near term is we don t know of any really big new capacity coming for propane so i think that in the environment that we re in you could say that the volatility should be less if at all especially with the delays so and you saw some evidence of that in q4 when oil price dropped you actually saw propane and butane become a lot cheaper and they were very competitive as feedstocks operator our next question comes from kevin mccarthy your line is open kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst yes good morning bob i was wondering if you could elaborate on your outlook for olefins polyolefins eai if you look back to the prior oil collapse in late 14 that segment really enjoyed a nice year in 2015 up nearly 450 million and listening to you today it doesn t sound so you re as constructive on that segment relative to the americas for example notwithstanding some of the one timers rhine river et cetera so would you compare and contrast the current environment versus what we saw in the following oil collapse or the previous one sorry bhavesh v patel chief executive officer right so kevin in the q4 we had a significant reset in prices and i think that s because of oil price declining that s occurred and my team tells me that in january orders look very good in europe so we ve seen demand come back and so i m actually quite constructive about the supply demand balance in europe so and i think there will be some impetus to improve profitability as the year goes on again if you step back and you look at global operating rates rising this year and now that supply chain could reset because of the declining oil price we re coming into a seasonally strong period this is a all of this is a set up for improving profitability as we work through the first half of the year and i think eai should benefit from the higher global operating rates and the oil price correction behind us so i m actually quite positive about eai operator thank you our next question comes from frank mitsch your line is open frank mitsch fermium research analyst hey good morning and bob i guess i now have to start watching your interaction at industry events with frank bozich hey you said earlier that you re closely watching asia post chinese new year obviously it starts in less than a week and i m curious as to what your best guesses as to what we ll see particularly with respect to the automotive markets obviously very important for polypropylene what are your expectations that we re going to see in a few weeks time there bhavesh v patel chief executive officer well i think ultimately we ll see what happens in about 10 days or 14 days but i think frank given that we ve been through a pretty big destocking cycle and my view at least on the packaging and the non durable side is that demand is growing and all of sort of the demographic factors that we ve discussed in the past that is still in place in terms of automotive i think credit is loosening over there and the middle class is growing so it seems to me that demand for automobiles should be constructive barring some event that none of us can predict so i m quite optimistic and hopeful about what we ll see post chinese new year operator thank you and our next question comes from hassan ahmed your line is open hassan ahmed alembic global advisors analyst good morning bob bhavesh v patel chief executive officer good morning hassan hassan ahmed alembic global advisors analyst well the question on the us ethylene market as we took a look at 18 obviously there was extreme volatility i d actually even call it a fairly sloppy market beyond obviously oil doing what it did i think one of the main reasons was obviously a mismatch between ethylene capacity coming online derivatives not sort of following suit immediately it seems now that as we look at 19 both ethylene and deriv capacity seems to be coming online in lockstep so is it fair to assume that the ethylene market in the us should not actually see the sort of volatility we saw last year bhavesh v patel chief executive officer indeed i mean i think hassan the volatility could come from the degree of reliability we see in the various crackers and as new very large world scale units come online can imagine if one 3 billion pound cracker comes offline and that could cause a significant change in the supply demand balance the other thing that i think we ll have to watch is the timing of derivative expansions versus cracker expansions if derivative expansions come sooner that could actually cause more firmness in the ethylene market i think the opposite is unlikely with anything derivatives could come a little bit earlier especially in one or two projects that are more integrated in terms of their setup thomas aebischer executive vice president and chief financial officer it s not just polyethylene it s glycols it s alpha olefins and lot of other ethylene consumers as well operator thank you our next question comes from jeff zekauskas your line is open jeffrey zekauskas jpmorgan analyst thanks very much oils rebounded since the beginning of the year from roughly 50 to 60 in brent terms but hopefully and really hasn t moved in the united states maybe polymer grade is still a little bit under 0 40 and it s come down from 0 60 can you talk about some of the dynamics that have pushed propylene down what are your expectations for this year and are you surprised that it hasn t moved bhavesh v patel chief executive officer well i think jeff as we see more pdh capacity come into the market it will probably reduce the volatility of propylene because now you have a bigger base that generally runs and is not dependent on feedstock flexibility right so that s been part of the source of propylene price volatility is when feedstocks change in the past that it had a big impact on the amount of propylene volume that was available but now as the base of pdh capacity grows it will probably act to stabilize and maybe reduce some of the volatility operator thank you our next question comes from steve byrne your line is open ian bennett bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi and thanks this is ian bennett on for steve the past couple of quarters as lyondell s ebitda has been declining your net debt has been increasing to buy back more stock and i think that sends a strong message about your view of the longer term trajectory of the earnings and value of this business if ebitda were to continue to decline how willing are you two continue to increase net debt to buyback stock and does that affect your ability at all to pursue braskem bhavesh v patel chief executive officer yeah i ll have thomas will take that question thomas aebischer executive vice president and chief financial officer well thank you ian for the question so i think if you look so first of all we took a significant advantage of attractive share price especially in the fourth quarter we have always said that we are buying back our own share opportunistically i think it s when you ask your question it s important to note that the we obviously increased net debt you re absolutely right but the main reason to increase net debt or the reason is actually the schulman acquisition so if you look at cash flow from operating activity is 5 5 billion for the year we have capex of 2 1 billion and dividend and share buybacks of 3 1 so for the share buyback program we actually did what we always said that we are using excess cash flow to buy back our own shares now we are at a point where we have to make decisions as the share price stays attractive to actually raise debt in order to replenish our debt portfolio which we have used the cash to for the acquisition of schulman so we have sufficient funds as i said the liquidity is about 4 billion we have sufficient funds to pursue our growth initiatives as well as to continue with our share buybacks opportunistically bhavesh v patel chief executive officer yeah and ian if you think step back and strategically look at what we ve been doing we ve been looking to create shareholder value by pulling a number of levers we had meaningful organic growth in 18 inorganic growth with the schulman acquisition and we bought back a meaningful number of our shares so i think you ought to look for that to continue because this is a company that has many levers and we ll look for the one that creates the most value as we think about deploying our operating cash flow or our balance sheet operator and our last question comes from matthew blair your line is open matthew blair tudor pickering holt analyst hey good morning bob so last quarter enterprise announced a couple of new pdh plants we re wondering if you can say whether you re a customer here and how might this affect your potential polypropylene and i guess potential pdh plant as well bhavesh v patel chief executive officer yeah so with all of the other initiatives we ve had going on we ve kind of with the pp plant we re still considering it and certainly the buy versus build scenario on propylene is one that we re contemplating today and as you know from your conference i know jim very well and i spent some time with them so that s an option depending on the economics of buy versus build we ll continue to evaluate that operator thank you and we have no other questions at this time bhavesh v patel chief executive officer okay great well let me offer a few closing remarks if i may so after a challenging fourth quarter where a typical seasonality was exacerbated by declines in crude oil we re looking forward to rebounding demand from restocking of supply chains in 2019 we ll continue to accrue synergies in our aps segment from the schulman acquisition we look forward to growth from our new hyperzone production and anticipate an improving refining market with a lighter planned maintenance schedule in 2019 we re really well prepared to maximize production to meet the needs of growing markets and our global business portfolio provides a resilience we re well positioned to pursue any other value creating opportunities so thank you for your interest and we look forward to updating you in april on our first quarter results with that we re adjourned operator thank you for your participation in today s conference you

and thank you for joining our 2018 year end earnings call let s begin with slide 3 and review the highlights for 2018 and our progress in advancing our value driven growth strategy record setting earnings in our intermediates derivatives and technology segments partially offset declines primarily in our olefins and polyolefins europe asia and international segment to provide 4 7 billion of net income and 6 9 billion of ebitda for the year increased cash generation helped to fund growth investments while we improved our free cash flow yield by over 200 basis points and posted a strong 27 return on our invested capital during 2018 the acquisition of a schulman in august made lyondellbasell the world s largest plastics compounding company in conjunction with this acquisition we launched our advanced polymer solutions business segment to provide focus and visibility for this new global platform and quickly went to work on integration that achieved an annualized synergy run rate of 47 million by the end of the year progress continues and we remain confident that we will meet or exceed our target to capture 150 million of integration related synergies within two years of the closing date in march we re launching an innovative plastics recycling joint venture with suez that provides a meaningful and sustainable solution for plastic waste we are pleased with initial market demand for these premium recycled plastics and continue to optimize the operational and commercial performance of the business model with an eye toward replicating this model in other parts of europe we advanced our pipeline of organic growth projects during 2018 with our new hyperzone hdpe plant scheduled for start up in the third quarter of this year and construction of the world s largest po tba plant on track for completion in the latter part of 2021 these projects not only increase our production capacity but also represent milestones for the commercialization of proprietary technologies such as our new hyperzone process for polyethylene and the latest developments from our advantaged propylene oxide and co product technologies we continue to actively manage our business portfolio with several small acquisitions and divestitures around the world while we evaluate other opportunities including a potential acquisition of braskem in the meantime our cash flows enabled us to opportunistically repurchase 19 2 million shares of lyondellbasell s stock and return over 3 4 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases in 2018 our company continued to deliver on our promise of value driven growth through a balanced strategy of operational excellence profitable organic expansions accretive m a and significant shareholder returns please turn to slide 4 where i m proud to report that lyondellbasell s employees and contractors finished the year with a significant 14 improvement in our safety performance during 2018 our injury rate was challenged by the need to improve upon the safety performance at the facilities we acquired from a schulman we are diligently working to ensure all of our employees contractors assets and the communities in which we operate finish the day in the same or better condition than they were at the start of the day our goal remains zero incidents or injuries every day of the year let s turn to slide 5 and review some of the detail behind our fourth quarter and annual results diluted earnings were 1 79 per share for the quarter and we earned 12 01 during the full year as shown in the chart on the left after excluding significant non cash tax benefits in 2017 and 2018 earnings per share increased by approximately 10 in 2018 for the fourth quarter of 2018 we incurred 20 million of integration costs related to the schulman acquisition that impacted quarterly earnings by 0 04 per share transaction and integration costs impacted the full year results by 0 14 per share in addition to typical fourth quarter seasonal headwinds seen in our industry our business was challenged by the substantial 40 fall in the price of crude oil that began in early october customers often delay orders and destock inventories during periods of declining oil prices in expectations of lower petrochemical and plastics prices volumes decline in nearly every business across our six segments during the fourth quarter as crude prices rebound in in late december and january our order volumes have improved we ve seen european and asian industrial demand impacted by disruptions in the automotive sector arising from issues with chinese consumer lending new vehicle testing standards in europe and trade uncertainties we believe that global consumer demand remained strong and we ll be closely watching trends in asia after the lunar new year holidays in early february during our third quarter earnings call i outlined three major plan maintenance outages that were estimated to impact fourth quarter earnings by a total of 95 million extended maintenance low rhine river water levels and feedstock supply disruptions at one of our suppliers increased the fourth quarter impact to our o p eai segment by approximately 110 million additionally results were impacted by approximately 20 million by unplanned events in our intermediates and derivatives and refining segments altogether planned and unplanned downtime impacted our fourth quarter earnings by approximately 225 million we do not expect such high levels of maintenance over the coming months during the first half of 2019 our only planned maintenance is scheduled for the first quarter in our o p americas segment we expect that first quarter downtime will impact earnings for the whole company by approximately 60 million to 70 million and now thomas will provide more detail on our financial highlights for the fourth quarter and the year thomas aebischer executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you bob and good day to all of you please turn to slide 6 which illustrates the developments of our business segments over the past two years in 2018 lyondellbasell s business portfolio demonstrated remarkable resilience to changing market environments our intermediates and derivatives segment profitability improved by approximately 35 and for the first time exceeding 2 billion in ebitda our technology group granted 16 licenses for new polyolefin plant designs that helped improve segment ebitda by 47 as seen in the chart these improvements helped to offset declines in o p eai the profitability offsets provided by the geographic and product diversity of our business portfolio is a recurring theme for lyondellbasell and an attribute that we seek to maintain manage and extend as we consider strategic options for the company in olefins and polyolefins americas high industry margins for polyethylene helped to offset the majority of the decline in olefin margins our business continues to benefit from strong demand and advantaged shale based feedstocks that enabled us to retain 95 of our prior year profitability for the segment the results for our new advanced polymer solutions segment includes contributions from the a schulman acquisition beginning in late august 2018 our progress toward our goal of 150 million in synergies is on schedule and will become more apparent during 2019 our houston refinery run very well during 2018 and we completed all major scheduled maintenance for the next two years we expect refining market conditions to rebalance during the first half of 2019 and look forward to strong refinery runs that will capture expected benefits of new sulfur regulations for marine fuels in late 2019 and 2020 now please turn to slide 7 where you can see that our businesses generated 1 3 billion of cash from operating activities during the fourth quarter which contributed to 5 5 billion of cash generation for the year during the quarter investment in capital expenditures increased to approximately 700 million as we ramped up construction of our po tba plant and continue to move our hyperzone plant forward toward start up as the stock market entered a correction during the fourth quarter we significantly increased our share repurchases in response to lower share prices in the fourth quarter we repurchased 11 5 million shares the most in any quarter since 2016 we returned 1 4 billion to shareholders in dividends and share purchases during the fourth quarter in 2018 our opportunistic buyback strategy allowed us to repurchase 8 more shares than would have occurred if we deployed the same amount of cash in equal amounts every trading day of the year the quarter closed with over 1 8 billion of cash and liquid investment on the balance sheet we approximately with approximately 2 5 billion of unused and available credit facilities we completed the quarter with a total liquidity in excess of 4 billion turning to slide 8 let s review our capital deployment over the past six years the light blue bars depict our cash generation from operating activities which has ranged between 4 8 billion to 6 billion since 2013 the stack bars on the right depict our uses of cash ranked in order of priority our highest priority is represented by the dark blue on the bottom our progressively growing dividend during 2018 we increased our dividend by 11 this strong increase reflected an improved out outlook after we updated our views on tax reform and the petrochemical industry we have a top quartile dividend that is currently yielding approximately 4 6 return our next priority is maintenance capital to support the safety and reliability of our operations going forward this baseline investment is approximately 1 1 billion per year the remainder of the orange bar is allocated to profit generating capital investment to support growth projects we estimate this investment will increase to 1 7 billion in 2019 the gray bars reflect our share repurchases we have returned over 18 billion in share repurchases since the inception of the program our buybacks add up to over 280 208 million shares or 36 of the shares that were outstanding in 2013 at the inception of the program opportunistic share repurchase will continue to be a component of our capital deployment the green bar represents last year s a schulman transaction our first significant acquisition we continued to maintain a conservative balance sheet that provides optionality to pursue value creating opportunities and we will continuously reevaluate the relative merits of organic projects grows through m a and share repurchases to optimize returns for our investors now please turn to slide 9 where i would like to address some of your annual modeling questions for 2019 regarding capital we are currently planning to invest approximately 2 8 billion during 2019 to support both our base maintenance and growth programs approximately 60 is targeted toward profit generating growth the majority of this growth investment in 2019 will be dedicated to the new po tba plant although not all plants are finalized we estimate capital spending will average 2 8 billion annually through 2021 for 2019 we have a fairly typical plant maintenance schedule activities during the year will impact annual ebitda by approximately 160 million to 200 million in addition to the first quarter plant maintenance in o p americas mentioned by bob the segment will also have a cracker turnaround in the third quarter that is expected to impact ebitda by approximately 70 to 80 million in our intermediates and derivatives segment we have planned maintenance event that will impact ebitda by approximately 30 million to 40 million in each of the third and fourth quarter in addition to the first quarter planned maintenance in o p americas mentioned by bob the segment will also have a cracker turnaround in the third quarter that is expected to impact ebitda by approximately 70 million to 80 million in our intermediates and derivatives segment we have planned maintenance event that will impact ebitda by approximately 30 million to 40 million in each of the third and fourth quarters our net cash interest expense for 2019 is expected to be approximately 400 million 2019 annual book depreciation and amortization should be approximately 1 3 billion we plan to make regular pension contribution in 2019 that total 110 million and we estimate the pension expense of approximately 90 million we currently expects that 2019 effective tax rate of approximately 20 and that our cash tax rate will be slightly lower than the effective tax rate i will now turn the call back to bob for a more detailed discussion of our segment results thank you bhavesh v patel chief executive officer thank you thomas let s turn to slide 10 and review our segment results in our olefins and polyolefins americas segment fourth quarter ebitda was 631 million a 73 million decrease versus the third quarter for the full year segment ebitda was approximately 2 8 billion relative to the third quarter 2018 olefins results improved by approximately 70 million due to higher ethylene prices and the declining gulf coast ethane costs our cracker operating rates averaged 93 during the fourth quarter exceeding the average industry performance of 87 approximately 80 of our ethylene production was from ethane and 94 came from ngls polyolefin results were approximately 115 million lower than the prior period primarily due to a 0 04 per pound decline in polyethylene spread over ethylene for the full year results decreased by 137 million olefin results declined by approximately 445 million primarily due to a 0 06 per pound reduction in ethylene price spread improvements in polyethylene and polypropylene of 0 07 per pound and 0 03 per pound respectively drove an approximately 360 million improvement in polyolefins to mostly offset the declines in olefins ihs is currently forecasting relatively stable polyethylene chain margins for the first quarter we are optimistic that 2019 will offer our earnings growth for the segment has the pace of polyethylene capacity additions slows while global demand growth remained steady please turn to slide 11 as we review the performance of our olefins and polyolefins europe asia and international segments during the fourth quarter ebitda was 127 million or a 135 million lower than the third quarter for the full year ebitda was 1 2 billion we continue to optimize our portfolio in the fourth quarter by divesting a carbon black subsidiary in france this benefited the quarter by 36 million compared to the third quarter olefins results decreased by approximately 75 million primarily driven by a decline in volume combined polyolefin results decreased approximately 35 million driven by decreased margins equity income decreased by 43 million primarily due to planned maintenance at our polish korean and saudi joint ventures full year ebitda results were 764 million lower than 2017 2017 benefited from a gain of 108 million on the sale of our interest in geosel 2018 results included the benefit from the sale of our carbon black subsidiary and a favorable impact of approximately 95 million due to an increase in the euro versus the us dollar exchange rate relative to 2017 olefin results for the full year decreased approximately 370 million compared to 2017 increased feedstock costs during most of the year resulted in margin declines while planned and unplanned maintenance and low rhine river levels resulted in a volume decrease of approximately 10 combined polyolefins results decreased approximately 345 million due to 0 03 per pound and 0 02 per pound lower spreads in polyethylene and polypropylene respectively joint venture equity income decreased by 46 million primarily due to lower polyolefins spreads in january demand is improving following the typical seasonal declines and destocking of the fourth quarter on slide 12 let s take a look at our intermediates and derivatives segment fourth quarter ebitda was 379 million a decline of 125 million from the prior quarter for the full year the segment generated over 2 billion setting an annual record and improving over the prior year by 521 million fourth quarter po and derivatives results decreased by approximately 10 million when compared with the prior period primarily due to lower volumes partially offset by higher margins intermediate chemicals decreased 65 million primarily due to reduced styrene and acetyls margins oxyfuels and related products results decreased approximately 40 million driven by margin declines due to higher ethanol pricing relative to crude oil and a volume decline due to planned maintenance during 2018 the 521 million improvement in ebitda was largely driven by margin improvements across all products due to tight market conditions and improved contracting strategies we re very proud of the team s accomplishments in 2018 and we expect continued benefits from this work in future years while ihs is forecasting some moderation in methanol pricing for the first quarter we should see improved po and derivatives volumes for the segment due to the completion of the planned maintenance at our bayport texas facility during the fourth quarter slide 13 charts the full year results from i d business improvements we discussed during our second quarter earnings call you might recall that while the majority of the increased profitability was attributable to tight market conditions and reduced maintenance downtime at our facilities we also described lyondellbasell s improved contracting strategies and reliability as sources of durable improvements that should persist beyond 2018 historically our intermediates and derivatives segment generated relatively consistent ebitda that averaged approximately 1 5 billion per year we believe our new midpoint in typical markets will be approximately 1 7 billion while the strong markets seen in 2018 may moderate we do not believe these improved margins will fully revert in 2019 in addition we ve not stopped pursuing self help within this business this year we expect i d contracting improvements to provide an additional 100 million of annual ebitda for the segment starting in mid 2019 on slide 14 let s review the results of our advanced polymer solutions segment fourth quarter ebitda was 86 million a 16 million improvement over the prior period for the full year ebitda was 400 million fourth quarter transaction and integration costs were 20 million compounding and solutions results improved approximately 15 million over the third quarter as we realized the full quarter of contribution from the addition of a schulman product lines this was partially offset by volume and margin declines in polypropylene compounds advanced polymers results decreased approximately 15 million due to lower margins and volumes full year ebitda results for the segment were 38 million lower than 2017 transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition impacted the segment by a 69 million in 2018 compounding and solutions results improved approximately 15 million with higher volumes from new product lines partially offset by lower volume and margin in polypropylene compounds advanced polymers results increased approximately 15 million due to higher volumes integration activities are well under way and we have captured 47 million in forward annualized run rate synergies as of december 31st we expect to see continued improvement in this segment as we begin 2019 with a return of higher seasonal volumes and our continued focus on capturing value from the integration activities turning to slide 15 let s discuss the performance of our refining segment fourth quarter ebitda was negative 84 million 168 million decline from the third quarter for the full year ebitda was 167 million or a 10 million improvement over 2017 planned maintenance on one of our two crude and coker trains was completed in november as a result the average crude throughput was 184 000 barrels per day or 48 000 barrels per day less than the third quarter with this work behind us the refinery is prepared to run full rates for the next two years and benefit from expected market opportunities in the fourth quarter the maya 2 1 1 crack spread declined significantly averaging less than a 11 per barrel for the first quarter and only 9 57 during november over the previous 12 years the maya 2 1 1 has been below 10 for only one month in december of 2011 the average over this time period is more than 22 per barrel spreads are improving as pemex adjusts a monthly k factor of the maya crude oil price formula to ensure that mexican crude remains competitively priced for the us gulf coast refining market for the full year refining margins increased when compared with 2017 due to discounted canadian crude pricing and improved fluid catalytic cracker conversion rates crude throughput was 231 000 barrels per day in 2018 slightly lower than 2017 absent our recent planned maintenance throughput would have averaged 256 000 barrels per day for the full year i d like to congratulate our refinery team for their diligent work and dedication to improve our refinery reliability with our planned maintenance completed we look forward to stronger contributions from our refinery in 2019 as we continue to benefit from improved reliability and an increase to maya 2 1 1 crack spread i would not like to turn to slide 16 and speak with you about a topic of growing global concern the management of plastic waste i think most of you are well aware of how billions of people benefit from advances in plastic in fact our products are well aligned with the united nations sustainable development goals such as a reducing hunger and food spoilage by durable packaging delivering safe drinking water with plastic pipes and reducing energy consumption with innovative materials however we now face the growing problem of what to do with the plastic once it has served its initial purpose the concern over plastic waste management is leading governments and consumers to consider bans on plastic straws and bags but these products make up only a small fraction of the plastic waste that ends up in our oceans some suggests that we should replace all plastics with alternative materials but most alternatives bring higher overall environmental and economic costs on slide 17 i m very proud to highlight an alliance formed by lyondellbasell along with more than 25 of our industry peers and other participants across the value chain that make use sell process collect and recycle plastics together we have committed over 1 billion with the goal of investing 1 5 billion over the next five years in collaborative partnerships to advance meaningful solutions that eliminate plastic waste in our environment the alliance s approach is based on four pillars infrastructure that stops plastic waste from entering the environment innovation in materials technologies and business models that increased the value of plastic waste engagement with partners and government business and consumers to enable solutions and meaningful projects to cleanup plastic waste that has already escaped into our environment new infrastructure to prevent and cleanup plastic waste is especially important in emerging economies where collection practices often lag the developed world once plastic is collected and appropriately sorted the waste can become a valuable feedstock for technologies that create versatile new materials from these post use plastics lyondellbasell s qcp recycling joint venture with suez is an example of an innovative business model that embraces this vision for a circular plastics economy education and engagement with governments businesses and communities is critical to the success of these initiatives the collaborative work of our alliance will be more powerful and efficient than fragmented efforts by each member of company working alone our surveys show that 10 rivers transport more than 90 of the river based plastics to the ocean and more than 50 of land based plastic waste leakage comes from only five countries there will be a focus on developing solutions that stop this leakage at their sources and cleanup areas with the existing plastic waste by recognizing the value of reusing plastic while we certainly have an immense challenge ahead of us i m confident that our alliance will find meaningful solutions to help end plastic waste and create a sustainable future for our industry and our planet now let s turn to slide 18 and discuss the outlook for 2019 ethylene feedstocks were volatile during the second half of 2018 with us gulf coast ethane prices spiking up in september and then reverting in november as we discussed during our third quarter earnings call lyondellbasell has the optionality across our us assets with ethylene production from both low cost midwest ethane and feedstock flexibility at our gulf coast crackers ngl prices are likely to show some volatility during 2019 with increased demand from the remaining new ethylene crackers likely to arrive ahead of planned ngl pipeline and fractionation capacity additions we expect that this pattern of prolong start ups for ethylene crackers along with ngl supply additions will smooth the path forward toward forecast for a return to plentiful feedstock availability within the next year we re encouraged by a forecast for polyethylene demand growth to continue with long term historical ranges of 4 to 5 over the past three years capacity additions have surpassed demand and moderated operating rates with less global capacity scheduled to start up during 2019 and 2020 we believe that lyondellbasell s new hyperzone hdpe capacity will find favorable markets as we ramp up during the second half of this year turning to slide 19 let me summarize the year s highlights in 2018 our strong earnings were supported by record annual ebitda in our intermediates and derivatives and technology segments we ll continue to benefit from some of the improvements from both segments through contracting changes in i d and licensing growth in technology our company generated approximately 5 5 billion of cash from operating activities this strong cash generation contributed to growth through profit generating capital investments and the acquisition of a schulman furthermore we continue to provide significant shareholder returns through a growing top quartile dividend and 1 9 billion in share repurchases by completing the acquisition of a schulman we have created the world s largest plastics compounding business and we are well under way with integration activities that are capturing significant synergies in our new advanced polymer solutions segment our strong cash flows and healthy balance sheet leave us well positioned to take advantage of additional value creating inorganic opportunities in 2018 we advance on the construction of our hyperzone polyethylene plant and we look forward to the added profitability will contribute to our o p americas segment following the start up in the third quarter last august we also began construction of po tba plant that will start up in 2021 providing further earnings growth for our i d segment we move forward on sustainable solutions for our company by forming quality circular polymers our premium plastics recycling joint venture with suez and in collaboration with our industry leaders we formed the alliance to end plastic waste to generate sustainable global solutions for plastic waste that will benefit our industry and the environment going into 2019 we look forward to increase production and availability of shale based feedstocks and a moderation in the pace of capacity additions that should provide a favorable environment for our new hdpe capacity and that allow us to maximize value from our diverse global business portfolio with that said we re now pleased to take your questions questions and answers operator operator instructions our first question comes from duffy fischer your line is open patrick duffy fischer barclays analyst yes good morning fellows bhavesh v patel chief executive officer good morning patrick duffy fischer barclays analyst first question ihs is calling last year polyethylene demand up about 7 which is pretty meaningfully higher than say the 20 year run rate one would you agree with that and two where was that extra demand coming from what caused that to accelerate in your mind bhavesh v patel chief executive officer so duffy we in fact did see that especially in the first three quarters of the year quite a bit of it was in the pipe and packaging segment of the business so not only here in the us but more exports as well which drove global demand growth patrick duffy fischer barclays analyst okay and then on the supply side again several of the global consultants now have less they would have in excess of 20 new naphtha plants coming online in china they kind of call it 2021 and beyond obviously you guys got some insight into that with your licensing business how should we think about what the knowledge base you have kind of across that space what will that wave look like obviously it s not going to be that many but is it 10 is it 15 how many in that mid 20s periods should we think about naphtha crackers in china bhavesh v patel chief executive officer yeah duffy as we have our discussions we don t see that magnitude in that timeframe a lot of them are under consideration but i would say the timeline is much later than what s described and so we ll look for those updates as those projects reach final investment decisions but we expect that those will go forward further in terms of timing patrick duffy fischer barclays analyst great thank you guys bhavesh v patel chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from david begleiter your line is open david begleiter deutsche bank analyst thank you good morning bhavesh v patel chief executive officer good morning david begleiter deutsche bank analyst bob just some on braskem is there a point where you need to make a decision either way and just move forward as is has been sorry to say dragging on for quite a while here bhavesh v patel chief executive officer yeah well david we ve it s a very as i ve talked about in the past it s a very complex transactions and in terms of the timeline the part of the protracted timeline has been the pause because of the change in government and given sort of the shareholder ownership that you all know about braskem so i can tell you that we ve completed very high quality due diligence we have a few follow up items but i think as we sit here today we better understand issues and value creation drivers we had been in discussions with relevant stakeholders including auto brasch we don t know whether these discussions will lead to an agreement we ll and but i can tell you we d only move forward at the right price and if we believe the transaction creates significant value for all of our stakeholders david begleiter deutsche bank analyst very helpful and just one last thing bob on o p americas ebitda in 2019 i think you said you think you can grow this business in 19 versus 18 can you provide a little more color on that thought process given again some new capacity coming on stream and low polyethylene prices in q4 bhavesh v patel chief executive officer yeah i think a lot of that david is the hyperzone plant our new polyethylene capacity coming online you ll recall today ethylene margins are have been very thin so to the extent that we can integrate downstream and capture more of the ethane to polyethylene chain margin that will contribute and it s a world scale plant so it will make a difference in terms of the o p americas profitability david begleiter deutsche bank analyst thank you very much bhavesh v patel chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from vincent andrews your line is open vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst thank you bob are you i m looking at your table 2 with the volume that you sold obviously in polyethylene in the us it was the lowest number on that page and i m assuming the same is true in many of the other products around the world so are you carrying a lot of inventory into 2019 and assuming you run at usual production rate should we should 2019 be a much bigger volume year on an organic basis bhavesh v patel chief executive officer yeah so in terms of inventory no we re not carrying unusually high amounts of inventory across our entire system so i think there is some inventory build for turnaround that we re expecting here in the us of our largest polyethylene plant it s a 2 billion pound per year of polyethylene plant that will have a turnaround in the q1 otherwise the inventories we don t see is being high across the system and frankly downstream because the destocking happened and we think that inventories are quite moderate or kind of below average downstream as well vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst and as go ahead thomas aebischer executive vice president and chief financial officer when you look at the inventory difference year over year on a cash basis it s about a 90 million change versus 2017 so really small vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst okay and in the i d business one of the bright spots in 2018 was the acetyls chain and the spot margins if you look at those have just come in considerably since the third quarter of 18 what are your expectations for those margins can get back to in 2019 bhavesh v patel chief executive officer well vincent i mean it s difficult to predict where they ll go but you ve seen the potential in 18 and the correction has been fairly significant so we ll have to see how that develops i think when you think about our i d business the methanol the acetyls and the styrene margins tend to be the most dynamic part of the portfolio but as i mentioned in my prepared remarks underlying all of that we have more contracting improvements that will accrue to the earnings of i d starting about mid year so i think we ve reached that sort of the base in i d from 1 5 billion ph to 1 7 billion ph and if styrene and methanol markets turn out to be directionally what they were in 18 then we should have another very strong year in i d vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst okay sounds great thanks so much bhavesh v patel chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from aleksey yefremov your line is open sir aleksey yefremov nomura securities analyst thank you good morning everyone you indicated in one of the slides where your you expect po tba earnings to be based on the average for 2014 2018 margins where are the margins today relative to that historical average bhavesh v patel chief executive officer i don t know where the margins are today versus the historical average but we tend to take periods of time when we communicate because if we take narrower timeframes price margins can be much higher or lower so we re very constructive about the market and if you think about tba and specifically mtbe last year especially in the second half gasoline demand and gasoline margins were quite low so we think some improvement in that in addition to lower butane prices which we saw during the winter we think those that boded very well for the mtbe part of our i d business aleksey yefremov nomura securities analyst thank you bob and you spend sometime in recycling how strong is the business case for some capital deployment into to recycling today and also do you see sort of some threat to plastics demand in the near term and over the next 12 months 24 months especially in europe from government policies here bhavesh v patel chief executive officer well so first of all what we ve learned from our qcp joint venture is that collection and segregation are very important and in the past what has ailed the recycling business is this that the input is very mixed and so i think that s what s the differential about our joint venture with suez as we get relatively segregated polyolefin waste that and is further segregated in our venture and then washed and then recycled in terms of impact on demand i think it will take a bit of time for the infrastructure to get in place and to be built out so in the near term we don t expect meaning the next 2 years 3 years 4 years and we don t expect a meaningful impact and we ll just have to watch and see the pace of infrastructure growth in terms of europe i can tell you that even in recent meetings with that my team has had with leadership in brussels the focus is more on a circular economy rather than deselection of plastics and that was again reaffirmed in recent discussions so we think that our approach with the qcp venture is very well placed and the idea for us is to now build out that platform throughout europe and we re focused on doing that aleksey yefremov nomura securities analyst thank you bhavesh v patel chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from robert koort your line is open dylan campbell goldman sachs analyst good morning this is dylan campbell on for bob a quick question one of your competitors is pushing a price increase for they were for january and they are for february for polyethylene in americas i guess what is lyondell s expectation for the first quarter here for polyethylene price and given that at least one consultant is saying that inventory levels are at the highest level and maybe a decade bhavesh v patel chief executive officer well first of all i don t want to comment on direction of prices here on the call but i can tell you that as we look at january we are seeing in the us more return to more normal demand and we expect as february march and april progress seasonally we tend to see an uptick in demand because of packaging and so on and what we hear from our customers is that that seasonal uptick in demand should be expected and if you think about downstream inventories because of the destocking that occurred with those with the reducing oil price we think downstream inventory are quite lean so when you look at inventories you really have to look at the inventories in the chain rather than just in one part of the chain and so i think all this will normalize and our sense is if you step back and look at operating rates globally they still look to be among the highest we ve seen in polyethylene in the past four years so i think the setup is very constructive for the entire year given that demand typically grows in the first two quarters to three quarters of the year and so i mean i think operating rates are high and that points to a very constructive market dylan campbell goldman sachs analyst got it thank you and i guess a quick clarification question you guys mentioned polyethylene to ethylene spreads declined 0 04 per pound sequentially quarter over quarter but i guess if i look in your data supplement polyethylene prices declined by only 0 01 to 0 02 per pound and ethylene was fairly flat quarter over quarter i guess was lyondell selling a bigger discount versus the market or can you just help working me through that math bhavesh v patel chief executive officer sure so that you are referring to the polyethylene gasoline margin for us and the way we transfer ethylene price internally is it s a spot it s a blend of contract and spot and you ll note that in q4 we saw a rising spot price of ethylene so really there was more margin in olefins and a little bit less in polyethylene it it s not a reflection on the revenue of polyethylene dylan campbell goldman sachs analyst got it thank you operator thank you our next question comes from arun viswanathan your line is open sir arun shankar viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst hi guys thanks for taking my question so first off just wanted to ask about kind of the level of earnings here was kind of penetrated pretty substantially in q4 to 1 2 billion ph 1 3 billion ph i guess we saw like a 1 4 billion ph 1 5 billion ph in q4 of 16 i guess what gives you guys the confidence in this snap back in q2 through q4 i guess i m just curious on europe and refining is well feedstocks have come down in europe is there a possibility that you could see some recovery there or would be or pricing would be challenged to take in a lower feedstock environment like that thanks bhavesh v patel chief executive officer yeah thanks arun first of all so if you think about q4 there were kind of three big drivers that we think are kind of one offs first of all we talked about the environment of declining crude oil price and the related destocking and how price moves in that kind of environment a 40 decline in one quarter is really enormous and that s largely played out and oil prices rebounded so we think that s constructive as we look at first half of 19 in terms of europe and eai just from one cracker turnaround that extended past our planned window and the rhine river and some so we had one of our suppliers of feedstock had a disruption that all we think impacted earnings by about 100 million in q4 largely behind us rhine river is back to normal levels our cracker is expected to be for most of the quarter at full rate so 100 million impact we think is really isolated to q4 and then in refining i mean we re sitting here with maya 2 1 1 spreads that are the lowest we ve seen since the 08 timeframe and what s driven that is a few factors first of all you will recall that the k the so called k factor is what get determines the delta between mexican crude and light crude if you will that k factor has been slow to adjust so the light heavy differential has been almost zero of late so we think that will revert we re already seeing some correction to the k factor and we expect more to come and of a long gasoline market that i described which may persist i don t know but i do think the light heavy differential and in particular how maya is priced we should see improvement as the quarter progresses so largely the maintenance impacts in europe were isolated to one unit and they re kind of behind us arun shankar viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst great thanks and as a follow up maybe could you i don t know what you can say on this but maybe if you could just explain maybe some high level some of the strategic benefits in a potential braskem deal would it allow you to reduce your long ethylene position and it obviously will grow in polypropylene but and then also how do you feel about the vinyls chain and participating there is that something that is would be considered core to you guys thanks bhavesh v patel chief executive officer so in terms of the strategic merits i mean i think and first of all when you think about brazil the outlook for brazil continues to improve and the expectations are positive under the new government so and it s an economy if you look at the imf report it s one of the few in the world that s expected to grow at a reasonably good rates we think longer term the economy there hold good potential a scenario where we don t have much of a position so it makes us even more of a global producer and seller of polyolefins in the case of the us and europe there is in part a consolidation opportunity and also a lot of our technology is deployed within braskem so those are just a few of the merits strategic merits of a transaction like that as i mentioned earlier it s got to be at the right price and it has to be significantly value creating for our shareholders arun shankar viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst thanks operator thank you our next question comes from pj juvekar your line is open pj juvekar citigroup analyst yes hi good morning bob bhavesh v patel chief executive officer good morning pj juvekar citigroup analyst on refining you didn t mention imo 2020 and we are hearing some mixed reviews about the benefit of imo 2020 to grms i was wondering if you could comment on that bhavesh v patel chief executive officer well thank you for asking that i was hoping somebody would ask me so i could work it into my commentary i mean i think pj imo we still see meaningful impact especially because we have such a heavy crude processing refinery yes recent press suggest that maybe some of the impact will be muted we actually think if we look at forward curves now perhaps the expectations have corrected to the low side whereas perhaps at the end of last year there was a little bit more enthusiasm we do continue to believe that there will be a positive impact from imo starting in late q3 into q4 as the inventory is rotated into the lower sulfur and diesel and that s deployed across the network around the world and then 2020 we do expect some meaningful impact from imo 2020 so but the thing we can control is we ve got to operate well and i think we ve positioned ourselves by completing all of our maintenance to run at full rates and capture whatever opportunity lies ahead and i continue to think that there will be a meaningful benefit and late this year into 2020 pj juvekar citigroup analyst great thank you and secondly i m glad to see you taking the lead on plastic recycling issue i think the industry needed to do something there i guess when you look at plastic recycling the issue has been the economics of recycling and recycling never made any money in developed markets like the us maybe it makes money in the emerging markets because of cheaper labor but can you talk about the economics of that and how do you work that into the solution bhavesh v patel chief executive officer well i think pj well first of all i appreciate the recognition in terms of the momentum around the alliance and so on and it s credit goes to a lot of companies who have been really a catalyst for getting this going in terms of the economics of recycling as i mentioned earlier really better collection and segregation of the source is critical to the economics and then building up scale and doing the recycling closer to where the waste is collected as it s adding costs by moving waste around the world detracts from the economics so and to tell you that s what we re focused on as with the qcp venture in europe and we believe it s a model that can be replicated certainly within europe and as we develop that further we ll think about other jurisdictions around the world pj juvekar citigroup analyst thank you bhavesh v patel chief executive officer all right thank you david kinney director investor relations yeah if we could limit to one question we still have eight folks in the queue and i don t want to take up your lunch hour there today thanks operator thank you our next question comes from jonas oxgaard your line is open jonas oxgaard sanford c bernstein analyst morning bhavesh v patel chief executive officer good morning jonas oxgaard sanford c bernstein analyst if we re sticking to the plastic waste here you have a slide there 17 it shows four different pillars can you talk a little bit about how do you actually intend to or how does the alliance intend to invest here are they giving grants to companies universities is that you re expected to do it in house and can you give us a little bit of a breakdown on how much do you think is going to be focused on each of the four pillars bhavesh v patel chief executive officer well so that the in terms of the allocation there will be we ll move in parallel and on all four there is not waiting more strongly toward one or the other but if you were to go to the website endplasticwaste org you can see the initial actions the alliance will take which were back backing and supporting an effort through a company called renewlogy that is converting waste plastic into fuel there is a fund called circulate capital that s funding initiatives around the world that directionally end plastic waste so jonas i d encourage you to look at that and that s going to be we want to move on all four fronts we do believe that we ve got a slow down and stop which entering the environment we need to address what s already in the environment and education and innovation are going to be what s going to make this more sort of structural and sustainable part in the fund over the long period of time jonas oxgaard sanford c bernstein analyst okay thank you operator our next question comes from john roberts your line is open john roberts ubs analyst thank you slide 18 talks about the expected volatility in ethane which i assume is even after the sasol cracker has been pushed out to the back end of this year do you think the industry needs to do additional technical difficulty here in the short term to maybe pulling forward some downtime to ease up on the ethane pressures that might cause another spike bhavesh v patel chief executive officer so john that some of the news around the delays is quite fresh and we ve not included that in our analysis here but indeed you re right that what i ve read certainly says that there are some incremental delays in some of the new crackers coming so our view is that in a lower oil price environment like we have and you ll recall last year we said that more of the ngls that are coming from the permian contain more butane and propane as ethane was rejected which caused kind of this run up in ethane all of this is to say that alternative feedstocks like propane butane liquids will be very competitive at lower oil price more propane and butane available especially after we get through the winter season and export capacity in the near term is we don t know of any really big new capacity coming for propane so i think that in the environment that we re in you could say that the volatility should be less if at all especially with the delays so and you saw some evidence of that in q4 when oil price dropped you actually saw propane and butane become a lot cheaper and they were very competitive as feedstocks operator our next question comes from kevin mccarthy your line is open kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst yes good morning bob i was wondering if you could elaborate on your outlook for olefins polyolefins eai if you look back to the prior oil collapse in late 14 that segment really enjoyed a nice year in 2015 up nearly 450 million and listening to you today it doesn t sound so you re as constructive on that segment relative to the americas for example notwithstanding some of the one timers rhine river et cetera so would you compare and contrast the current environment versus what we saw in the following oil collapse or the previous one sorry bhavesh v patel chief executive officer right so kevin in the q4 we had a significant reset in prices and i think that s because of oil price declining that s occurred and my team tells me that in january orders look very good in europe so we ve seen demand come back and so i m actually quite constructive about the supply demand balance in europe so and i think there will be some impetus to improve profitability as the year goes on again if you step back and you look at global operating rates rising this year and now that supply chain could reset because of the declining oil price we re coming into a seasonally strong period this is a all of this is a set up for improving profitability as we work through the first half of the year and i think eai should benefit from the higher global operating rates and the oil price correction behind us so i m actually quite positive about eai operator thank you our next question comes from frank mitsch your line is open frank mitsch fermium research analyst hey good morning and bob i guess i now have to start watching your interaction at industry events with frank bozich hey you said earlier that you re closely watching asia post chinese new year obviously it starts in less than a week and i m curious as to what your best guesses as to what we ll see particularly with respect to the automotive markets obviously very important for polypropylene what are your expectations that we re going to see in a few weeks time there bhavesh v patel chief executive officer well i think ultimately we ll see what happens in about 10 days or 14 days but i think frank given that we ve been through a pretty big destocking cycle and my view at least on the packaging and the non durable side is that demand is growing and all of sort of the demographic factors that we ve discussed in the past that is still in place in terms of automotive i think credit is loosening over there and the middle class is growing so it seems to me that demand for automobiles should be constructive barring some event that none of us can predict so i m quite optimistic and hopeful about what we ll see post chinese new year operator thank you and our next question comes from hassan ahmed your line is open hassan ahmed alembic global advisors analyst good morning bob bhavesh v patel chief executive officer good morning hassan hassan ahmed alembic global advisors analyst well the question on the us ethylene market as we took a look at 18 obviously there was extreme volatility i d actually even call it a fairly sloppy market beyond obviously oil doing what it did i think one of the main reasons was obviously a mismatch between ethylene capacity coming online derivatives not sort of following suit immediately it seems now that as we look at 19 both ethylene and deriv capacity seems to be coming online in lockstep so is it fair to assume that the ethylene market in the us should not actually see the sort of volatility we saw last year bhavesh v patel chief executive officer indeed i mean i think hassan the volatility could come from the degree of reliability we see in the various crackers and as new very large world scale units come online can imagine if one 3 billion pound cracker comes offline and that could cause a significant change in the supply demand balance the other thing that i think we ll have to watch is the timing of derivative expansions versus cracker expansions if derivative expansions come sooner that could actually cause more firmness in the ethylene market i think the opposite is unlikely with anything derivatives could come a little bit earlier especially in one or two projects that are more integrated in terms of their setup thomas aebischer executive vice president and chief financial officer it s not just polyethylene it s glycols it s alpha olefins and lot of other ethylene consumers as well operator thank you our next question comes from jeff zekauskas your line is open jeffrey zekauskas jpmorgan analyst thanks very much oils rebounded since the beginning of the year from roughly 50 to 60 in brent terms but hopefully and really hasn t moved in the united states maybe polymer grade is still a little bit under 0 40 and it s come down from 0 60 can you talk about some of the dynamics that have pushed propylene down what are your expectations for this year and are you surprised that it hasn t moved bhavesh v patel chief executive officer well i think jeff as we see more pdh capacity come into the market it will probably reduce the volatility of propylene because now you have a bigger base that generally runs and is not dependent on feedstock flexibility right so that s been part of the source of propylene price volatility is when feedstocks change in the past that it had a big impact on the amount of propylene volume that was available but now as the base of pdh capacity grows it will probably act to stabilize and maybe reduce some of the volatility operator thank you our next question comes from steve byrne your line is open ian bennett bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi and thanks this is ian bennett on for steve the past couple of quarters as lyondell s ebitda has been declining your net debt has been increasing to buy back more stock and i think that sends a strong message about your view of the longer term trajectory of the earnings and value of this business if ebitda were to continue to decline how willing are you two continue to increase net debt to buyback stock and does that affect your ability at all to pursue braskem bhavesh v patel chief executive officer yeah i ll have thomas will take that question thomas aebischer executive vice president and chief financial officer well thank you ian for the question so i think if you look so first of all we took a significant advantage of attractive share price especially in the fourth quarter we have always said that we are buying back our own share opportunistically i think it s when you ask your question it s important to note that the we obviously increased net debt you re absolutely right but the main reason to increase net debt or the reason is actually the schulman acquisition so if you look at cash flow from operating activity is 5 5 billion for the year we have capex of 2 1 billion and dividend and share buybacks of 3 1 so for the share buyback program we actually did what we always said that we are using excess cash flow to buy back our own shares now we are at a point where we have to make decisions as the share price stays attractive to actually raise debt in order to replenish our debt portfolio which we have used the cash to for the acquisition of schulman so we have sufficient funds as i said the liquidity is about 4 billion we have sufficient funds to pursue our growth initiatives as well as to continue with our share buybacks opportunistically bhavesh v patel chief executive officer yeah and ian if you think step back and strategically look at what we ve been doing we ve been looking to create shareholder value by pulling a number of levers we had meaningful organic growth in 18 inorganic growth with the schulman acquisition and we bought back a meaningful number of our shares so i think you ought to look for that to continue because this is a company that has many levers and we ll look for the one that creates the most value as we think about deploying our operating cash flow or our balance sheet operator and our last question comes from matthew blair your line is open matthew blair tudor pickering holt analyst hey good morning bob so last quarter enterprise announced a couple of new pdh plants we re wondering if you can say whether you re a customer here and how might this affect your potential polypropylene and i guess potential pdh plant as well bhavesh v patel chief executive officer yeah so with all of the other initiatives we ve had going on we ve kind of with the pp plant we re still considering it and certainly the buy versus build scenario on propylene is one that we re contemplating today and as you know from your conference i know jim very well and i spent some time with them so that s an option depending on the economics of buy versus build we ll continue to evaluate that operator thank you and we have no other questions at this time bhavesh v patel chief executive officer okay great well let me offer a few closing remarks if i may so after a challenging fourth quarter where a typical seasonality was exacerbated by declines in crude oil we re looking forward to rebounding demand from restocking of supply chains in 2019 we ll continue to accrue synergies in our aps segment from the schulman acquisition we look forward to growth from our new hyperzone production and anticipate an improving refining market with a lighter planned maintenance schedule in 2019 we re really well prepared to maximize production to meet the needs of growing markets and our global business portfolio provides a resilience we re well positioned to pursue any other value creating opportunities so thank you for your interest and we look forward to updating you in april on our first quarter results with that we re adjourned operator thank you for your participation in today s conference you

advertisment earlier this year we witnessed a mini flash crash that hit the fiat currency markets it took approximately seven minutes for the australian dollar to plummet against the japanese yen which surged to levels that it had last held almost a decade ago like a number of fiat currencies bitcoin is going through its own boom and bust cycle which is something it has experienced before historically several global currencies have suffered far worse volatility with hyperinflation often the outcome also read back to basics what is money usd the world s reserve currency before we run down some of the major currency crashes in history it is worth noting that the world s reserve currency is currently the u s dollar the dollar became the reserve currency back in 1973 when president richard nixon abandoned the gold standard prior to the dollar the british pound sterling was the dominant global reserve currency both the euro and japanese yen have also become increasingly popular as a reserve currency given the size of their respective economies the strength of the u s dollar is crucial for example a strong dollar or increase in the exchange rate is better for individuals because it makes imports cheaper and lowers inflation earlier this year bank of england governor mark carney said the chinese yuan could be an alternative reserve currency referring to the chinese currency carney said as the world re orders this disconnect between the real and financial is likely to reduce and in the process other reserve currencies may emerge in the first instance i would expect these will be existing national currencies such as the rmb most of the world s currency prices fluctuate based on the supply and demand in the foreign exchange market the stability of any currency depends on consumer confidence the political state and economic performance all of which affect currency strength those interested in crypto should review the history of currency crashes in order to better understand volatility and how easy it is for currencies to rise and fall venezuelan bolivar the bolivar is one of the most recent high profile cases of a currency collapsing for venezuela it all started back in june 2010 when president hugo chávez declared an economic war due to the increasing shortages in venezuela since then the crisis has only intensified under the maduro government growing more severe as a result of low oil prices in early 2015 and a drop in oil production from lack of maintenance and investment since 2016 political discontent in venezuela has been fueled by increasing hyperinflation power cuts and shortages of food and medicine in 2017 u s president donald trump s administration signed an executive order that prohibits dealings in new debt from the venezuelan government or its state oil company this situation forced president maduro to sidestep the u s and phase in use of its controversial digital currency the petro for oil sales zimbabwean dollar the republic of zimbabwe in southern africa experienced the worst of its inflation in 2008 which led to the abandonment of the currency hyperinflation drove a period of currency instability in zimbabwe which had begun in the late 1990s peak hyperinflation occurred in mid november 2008 with a rate estimated at 79 600 000 000 percent per month this resulted in u s 1 becoming equivalent to the staggering sum of z 2 621 984 228 argentinian peso argentina is latin america s third largest economy since its independence from spain in 1816 the country has defaulted on its debt many times and inflation has often been in the double digits argentina experienced record growth until the opec oil embargo in the mid 1970s after this civil and political unrest followed and budget and trade deficits threatened the onset of a severe recession triggered by this the government resorted to printing money a military coup in 1976 brought further economic decline and more inflation as the money supply continued to expand unfortunately by 1982 gdp was in free fall and dropped 12 percent year over year the worst since the great depression icelandic króna between 2008 and 2011 we witnessed the icelandic financial crisis relative to the size of its economy iceland s systemic banking collapse was the largest experienced by any country in economic history in october 2008 iceland nationalized its three largest banks kaupthing bank landsbanki and glitnir bank which had defaulted on 62 billion of foreign debt as trust in the banks faded this led to a sharp depreciation of the icelandic króna in 2008 troubled turkish lira in 2018 the turkish lira slumped to a record low against the u s dollar turkey s struggling currency is putting huge amounts of pressure on the country s massive debt obligation to other countries from an educational perspective it is worth watching turkey s economic troubles unfold most recently we have seen the lira on the verge of collapse in a crisis that has provided opportunity for some investors many observers have reveled in the fall in value of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies by reviewing the history of currencies however it becomes evident that there is always volatility to some degree this is nothing new and cryptocurrencies like fiat currencies are going through typical boom and bust cycles with hyperinflation impossible with fixed supply currencies like bitcoin the odds of complete devaluation are extremely slender while the potential upside for investors with the patience to hodl is huge would the collapse of a major global currency

over the past few months the investing markets have considered federal reserve chairman powell enemy number one earlier this week the markets once again showed that america s central bank drives sentiment more than any other factor forget trade wars forget earnings forget political drama it is the fed and only the fed that matters that may sound somewhat simplistic to all the fundamental analysts and market technicians out there but let s face facts it s true even the end of the 35 day long government shutdown barely generated a response from the markets what did generate interest was the rumor that the fed may be considering ending its 50 billion a month drawdown of its balance sheet the afternoon of wednesday january 30th after a much more dovish tone out of powell the stock market closed up for the first time after the past eight fomc meetings the longest post fomc losing streak on record the prior meeting on december 19th was followed by a gut wrenching 1 800 point crash in the dow over the following four sessions as we were nearing the end of 2018 it looked and smelled like the fed went too far yet again as it had done in 10 of the past 13 post wwii hikes so much for the narrative of the omniscient central banker as mark twain wrote history doesn t repeat itself but it does rhyme investing is all about finding an inflection point where the market is wrong pricing an asset too high or too low believing a policy to be beneficial when it isn t or vice versa given the ubiquitous nature of the belief that the fed is the central bank that really matters to the market what if that supposition is wrong what if everyone is looking in the wrong direction with the wrong set of expectations what if everyone ought to be looking in the direction of our new global middle class investing theme we will start to explore that idea in this week s piece along with an assessment of the domestic and global economy as chris versace and i wrote in our book cocktail investing there are three major participants in an economy consumers business and government to understand what is happening in an economy one needs to understand the vector and the velocity associated with each one of these participants households outlook dims our middle class squeeze investing theme was again front and center this week in the domestic economy this week we got a rather dour report on how the household sector of the economy is feeling about the future with the university of michigan s monthly index of consumer sentiment which gauges americans view on their own financial condition as well as the economy in general in january the u s consumer confidence dropped to 90 7 versus expectations for 96 8 hitting an 18 month low despite initial jobless claims dropping to a 49 year low likely thanks to the double whammy of the partial government shutdown and the recent volatility in the financial markets the decline was driven primarily by deteriorating expectations about the future with that portion of the index declining 11 in january after falling 13 in december on the other end of the spectrum consumers assessment of current conditions is a mere 2 below the august peak which puts the spread between consumers outlook for the future and their present situation at nearly the largest since 1967 the only period in which the spread was greater was january through march of 2001 the recession began in march 2001 hat tip to david rosenberg of gluskin sheff for the chart below we will be watching this metric particularly closely in february as well as the february manufacturing index given the recent drop in the six month view the rather glum outlook continues to be a headwind to the housing sector house sales excluding newly built homes fell by 10 in december compared with the same month in 2017 according to the national association of realtors interestingly this sharp fall off occurred despite the late 2018 rollover in mortgage rates which as any a home buyer knows makes for a lower cost of total home ownership slowing corporate sector we are knee deep in the december 2018 quarter earnings season with around one third of the s p 500 companies having reported so far with an aggregate increase of 14 2 in earnings per share on an increase of 5 6 in revenue while that sounds pretty good at first glance what concerns us is that the beat ratio so far is the lowest since 2014 despite having the second most aggressive estimate cuts in the months going into this season since the depths of the financial crisis on top of that expectations for 2019 are being materially scaled back with expected eps growth having fallen to just 1 6 year over year in the march quarter driven in large part by weakening revenues for those companies with a lot of international sales exposure as we ve heard from a growing number of companies over the last few weeks they are feeling the pinch of the trade war as well as the strong dollar one theme that keeps rearing its head is the impact of weakness in china which is no small matter given that according to the us census bureau america s exports to china have doubled over the 10 years through 2017 to reach 130 billion a year companies ranging from caterpillar cat to apple aapl nvidia nvda to stanley black decker swk and 3m mmm have commented on the impact of a chinese slowdown caterpillar expects its chinese markets to be flat in 2019 nvidia reported weaker chinese demand for its computer chips and gaming consoles h b fuller co ful reported that weaker demand from china will reduce its profits by 20 million this year ppg industries ppg reported sales of its coatings for cars made in china fell 15 in the december quarter despite these declines however luxury goods associated with our living the life investing theme continue to boom in china according to lvmh moet hennessy louis vuitton otcpk lvmhf during its earnings conference call the company shared that growth in china has accelerated in q4 compared to the previous quarters and the beginning of this year is the same that strength was corroborated by ferrari race that reported its sales in china hong kong and taiwan rose nearly 13 year over year in the december quarter and forecasted a pickup in its china business during the first half of 2019 some of this may reflect the non u s nature of those companies but the more pronounced driver is more than likely demographic in nature as captured by the rising middle class in china and the allure of aspirational goods but also the rapid rise in wealthy and ultra wealthy chinese a key cohort when it comes to the living the life tailwind government while the partial government shutdown has finally come to an end at least temporarily inside the beltway is increasingly looking like a kindergarten class that has missed its afternoon nap the u s federal deficit continues to be quite large compared to post wwii norms the sheer size of the federal deficit combined with the federal reserve program to reduce its balance sheet means that roughly 1 3 trillion is being pulled away from the private sector the more money the government needs which means increased treasury bond supply the less money is available to be spent in the private sector this is referred to as the crowding out effect of large government deficits the fed s actions along with the increased deficit spending are one of the factors behind the recent drop in equity prices as the money has to come from somewhere less money in the private sector means demand for private sector assets declines which impacts prices what about china well it is no longer a buyer of u s debt and may well have become a net seller global economy in 2017 the world s leading economies accelerated in sync boosting equity prices in 2018 the u s economy surged on thanks in part to fiscal stimulus in the form of tax cuts and increased government spending while the rest of the world slowed in 2019 the world looks to be once again syncing up to slow down the imf warned that the global expansion is weakening and at a rate that is somewhat faster than expected the fund revised down its forecasts particularly for advanced economies with the world s economy forecast to grow by 3 6 in 2020 although that is stronger than in some previous years the imf thinks the risks to more significant downward corrections are rising in part because of tensions over trade and uncertainty about brexit the global zentrum fur europaische wirtschaftsforschung zew economic sentiment index echoes what we ve seen from the michigan consumer sentiment index italy has now had two consecutive quarters of contracting gdp which means that technically italians are breaking out the barolo and sadly toasting to their latest recession germany which has been the strongest economy in the eurozone saw its economy contract 0 2 in the third quarter of last year its industrial production decline 1 9 in november and retail sales crash 4 3 in december sparking fears that the country is on the brink of a recession as well recent federal statistics have germany s economy growing by just 1 5 in 2018 versus 2 2 in 2017 with the imf forecasting just 1 3 in 2019 according to data published by ihs markit france s composite output index that reflects its manufacturing and services economy remained in contraction mode at 47 9 in january down from 48 7 in december as a reminder a reading below 50 indicates a contraction while one above 50 indicates growth against that backdrop it s not shocking to read that european central bank president mario draghi say the european central bank is ready to use all its policy tools to support europe s softening economy including by restarting a recently shelved bond buying program as for the u k consumer confidence with respect to the economic outlook fell to a seven year low in january china slows china has the second largest economy in the world and will soon replace the u s as the world s largest retail market as it benefits from the tailwinds in our new global middle class investing theme what happens in china matters to the rest of the world for example china has become the largest importer of wood in the world and the largest exporter of things made from wood ranging from furniture to flooring while china s economy will eclipse that of the u s growth doesn t come in a straight line and we are seeing warning signs china s economy has slowed 6 4 in the fourth quarter of 2018 the third consecutive deceleration growth slowed to 6 6 in 2018 the slowest growth since 1990 when sanctions were imposed following the tiananmen square massacre manufacturing pmi in january stood at 49 5 and was 49 4 in december showing two consecutive months of contraction property sales which had been a reliable source of growth which took advantage of borrowing opportunities have been slowing the growth in retail sales has fallen to its lowest level in more than 15 years sales of cars fell last year for the first time in more than two decades companies have started cutting back hiring and incomes are growing more slowly weighing on consumer sentiment the middle three quintiles of china s population by income distribution saw earnings increase by only about 2 last year in real terms defaults are on the rise corporate bond defaults reached 19 billion yuan in the first half of 2018 versus 14 billion in the same period of 2017 smaller banks in rural areas which would be the first to feel the pain are seeing rising levels of bad loans as a result china is letting up on its drive to deleverage its economy and chinese investment into europe and america fell by 73 in 2018 china has already pivoted towards more supportive economic policies it has sped up spending on infrastructure trimmed income taxes and relaxed some restraints on bank lending china has a massive population that it needs to keep employed and was the world s engine during the last financial crisis providing a floor under demand as much of the rest of the world was crashing what if they are wrong the u s today has the highest non financial private sector debt to gdp ratio in history overall the global debt to gdp ratio is the highest we ve ever seen most likely the fed tightening cycle has come to an end and the next thing we are most likely to see is easing but this time perhaps that cure is already used up we ve already seen materially diminishing returns from fed stimulus efforts in the past what if this time around the only central bank that truly matters is china s what if china decides to alter its monetary policy its peg to the dollar to help its slowing economy thereby creating a cascade across the east as its neighbors scramble to respond what if the only bank in the world that can affect asset prices this time and that can actually create inflation is the one for the biggest consumer of raw materials in the world the one in the east at the people s bank of china while everyone is looking the other way what if indeedâ how many investors are factoring that into their thinking is president trump contemplating that as u s china trade talks continue we ll be watching so stay tuned editor s note the summary bullets for this article were chosen by seeking alpha editors
the us federal reserve confirmed its monetary policy direction has taken an about turn this week as it announced it has kept rates within the 2 25 2 5 range but despite markets having priced in fewer rate rises none have been priced in for 2019 since last month s statement the overall tone of wednesday s announcement still surprised markets according to anna stupnytska global economist at fidelity at the federal open market committee s final meeting of 2018 it suggested rate hikes would be less aggressive through 2019 and 2020 this week it became more flexible rather than further gradual increases jerome powell talked about future adjustments suggesting the next move could in fact be downwards but experts are still split on the fed s direction stupnytska thinks powell could well become a hawk again later on this year considering the decent economic picture in the states candice bangsund vice president at fiera capital agrees and expects a pause through the first six months of 2019 before two hikes at the back end of the year but some are convinced the dovish sentiment will continue nick maroustos co head of global bonds at janus henderson investors thinks the fed is done hiking not for 2019 but for good there are a few reasons for this more dovish stance beginning at home there may be many who think the us economy and consumer remains robust but we re clearly seeing a slowdown meanwhile inflation is non existent geopolitical risk is at an all time high and washington is in gridlock the stagnating economy and geopolitical risk keep a cloud over growth prospects continues maroustos geopolitical worries start to creep in but there seems to be a growing acceptance that global economic conditions must too play a role in the fed s policy it hiked four times in 2018 leading to a strong us dollar this has had negative impacts on many other particularly emerging markets this is due to the higher borrowing costs they will incur on their reserves of us dollar denominated debt raising the possibility of defaults trade tensions between the us and china do not help either clearly a deterioration in the global economy would not be positive for the us while the fed s assessment of economic conditions did not alter solid growth and a strong jobs market it did change its assessment of the risks to that significantly powell emphasised several cross currents that suggest a less favourable outlook notes stupnytska that includes a continuing slowdown in global growth a range of political risks such as brexit trade uncertainty and the us government shutdown as well as less supportive financial conditions you can add chinese stimulus wearing off higher oil prices through most of 2018 italian fears natural disasters and issues in the european auto sector into the mix too notes melanie baker chief economist at royal london asset management there s been a lot for markets businesses and the global economy to digest she continues in hindsight maybe we should ask why global growth hasn t slowed more indeed while the slowdown has been broad based and economic indicators dropped off sharply from their 2017 peaks the only major manufacturing purchasing managers index that has slipped into contraction territory is china s as a result baker says she s cautious but not pessimistic on growth recession risks have risen but i think there is enough support for the global economy to think that this is a slowdown not something more sinister in fact many of the fears baker mentioned that threatened markets have either been temporary in their impact such as natural disasters or have faded for example oil price has fallen back significantly and the us government has re opened after 2017 saw global synchronised growth 2018 saw the us diverge with the rest of the world while economic growth stateside took off elsewhere either stagnated or fell off that trend was mirrored in both stock prices and earnings growth many expect convergence over the coming 12 months and have been busy considering whether it s the us that softens or the rest of the world that surges sonja laud deputy chief investment officer at legal general investment management thinks and the final quarter of 2018 suggests she s correct it will be the former with the failing fiscal stimulus in the us we believe it will be the us approaching the rest of the world that implies we are past the peak for global growth she explains in fact laud claims company earnings are heading for a recession with the us leading the pack having seen 12 month forward consensus earnings per share growth estimates drop 9 9 peak to trough it s no surprise to see the us being the weakest because they have been on a sugar high due to the tax cuts and the artificial boost they have received to their earnings recession expectations commentators have been arguing over the possibility of a us economic or financial recession for a year or more now seemingly the likelihood of one this year has receded in that time with few now seeing imminent warning signs there are some worries cropping up though that suggest it might not be too far away laud picks over the make up of the us investment grade corporate bond universe as troubling more than 50 of this universe is now made up of bbb rated the lowest rating an investment grade bond can attain this suggests issuance is at its lowest quality for more than 25 years trevor greetham head of multi asset at royal london asset management rlam picks out some leading indicators first he asserts when stock markets turn overly negative 50 of the time it leads to a recession 50 to a slowdown it s something to take quite seriously certainly in december markets were saying there is a recession coming in america but the probability it comes this year is low as ever since the 1970s real interest rates have had to be around or above 2 before a recession hits we re far from that point just above zero today the oil price too tends to be a telling signal when oil prices spike sharply consumers need to spend more of their disposable income on gasoline so have less to spend in the wider economy oil price shocks in 1973 1979 and 1980 presaged recessions within the year also by the way people forget the oil price spiked in the run up to the lehman failure greetham cautions people say it was all about the banks but the oil price was 145 per barrel three times the level it is today indeed while oil was strong for most of the year it ended up weak down 30 helping along with tax cuts buoy the us consumer on the oil point greetham concludes no one has told the us consumer about this recession us consumer spending growth is running at about two and a bit percent a slowing housing market also tends to be a good leading indicator and that looks to be the big worry and further rate rises could be quite damaging here however a pause in hikes will prolong that greetham says i don t want to labour this because housing is slowing and there are other things going on but wage growth is still pretty strong in the us the unemployment rate is still quite low and there s been a big drop in gasoline prices so the us consumer could remain quite strong
40 years of chinese economic reforms and gold the economic development of china is one of the most important events in the history of the world in an unprecedentedly short time millions of people have been taken out from poverty but as no country has ever developed so fast that great story raises important worries we invite you to read our today s article about the great progress china made in the last forty years and find out whether it s too good to be true and it must end with some catastrophe triggering rally in the gold prices one of the biggest risks for the global economy which can materialize this year is the slowdown of china s economic growth so it is wise to analyze the current state of the chinese economy its implications for the gold market and what will happen next as december 2018 marked the forty years of market reforms in china we will adopt a long term perspective explaining how china transformed itself from a poor backward and isolated country to the world s economic power we will examine what the global economy and the precious metals market can expect in china s fifth decade of reform and development emancipate the mind seeking truth from facts and unite as one to face the future these are the famous words deng xiaoping said in december 1978 triggering china s economic reform and opening to the international economy initially the changes were rather modest in line with the bird cage economy the market was compared to a bird which had to be contained as otherwise it would fly away the planned economy was still in force but with market experiments the reforms were implemented gradually often started in only a few regions the leaders expanded them upon proven success in line with the country s motto crossing the river by feeling the stones but when the soviet union collapsed china decided to speed up its transformation the government did not merely reform the socialist economy but it opened the economy and included market mechanism wherever possible the next turning point was in december 2001 when china joined the wto the country then received a new powerful impulse for modernization rapidly changing its status of a developing state into a reviving power in 2009 china became the largest exporter on the globe and in 2014 the largest trading state and one year later the second economy in the world at the turn 2014 2015 a tectonic shift occurred the incoming capital to china turned out to be smaller than the capital outgoing china while the imf admitted that china is already the largest economy in the world when using the gdp adjusted for purchasing power parity see the chart below chart 1 china s official real gdp blue line china s alternative real gdp green line and us official real gdp yellow line in millions of 2017 ppp us dollars from 1968 to 2018 in the face of all these successes the chinese leaders rejected the previous strategy of building power quietly offering china and the world new highly ambitious programs such as the belt and road initiative an infrastructure program worth 1 4 billion dollars several times more than americans allocated to the famous marshall plan after the world war ii the country also set three ambitious goals to realize the chinese dream first by mid 2021 for the centenary of the communist party of china the existing economic model based on investment expansion and export is to be replaced by a sustainable development and strong internal consumption second by 2035 china will become a global leader in innovation and third by the end of 2049 for the centenary of the people s republic of china the country wants to achieve great renaissance of the chinese nation through a reunification with taiwan creating the leading civilization on the globe these are quite ambitious plans aren t they no wonder that the current global hegemon woke up after all the trade wars are not only about trade or tariffs but also about dominance hegemony and primacy in high technologies china s economic rise over the last 40 years thanks to the systematic adoption of structural reforms has been extraordinary however as the country faces many challenges the pace of economic growth has been declining in recent years as one can see in the chart below chart 2 china s real gdp growth official estimates blue line left axis in alternative estimates green line left axis in and the gold prices yellow line right axis london p m fix annual average from 1968 to 2018 one of the biggest challenges is the transition from the export led to a domestic consumption driven growth model given that exports account for a decent part of gdp growth the slowdown seems to be inevitable but the question is will china follow in japan s footsteps entering a multi year stagnation possibly but investors should remember that before japan fell into stagnation it had already reached high income status in terms of gdp per capita while china remains significantly below the threshold what does it all imply for the gold market well china has experienced tremendous progress since 1968 lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty it fascinates but also terrifies this is why some people argue that the japanese like stagnation is inevitable while other prophet that china will become the next global hegemon with us dollar replaced by chinese yuan and of course both scenarios are considered to be positive for the gold prices either due to the global slowdown or the demise of the greenback however the truth is in the middle china will not replace the us the red dragon just returned to the prominent role in the global economy that it played long time ago we will have two or multi polar world but do not expect china to dethrone us anytime in the near future especially that america has finally adopted a more confrontational stance towards china sorry gold bulls and the country is not likely to fall into stagnation either the slowdown is projected to be gradual and after all the economic growth at 4 6 percent is still relatively fast this is because china s governance system characterized by centralized policymaking and decentralized experimentation and implementation is relatively flexible and according to some analysts better suited to rapid decision making than dysfunctional and polarized politics under democracies having said that it s clear that china will not be exempt from the iron law of regression to the mean in the long run we are not naïve and we do predict a slowdown in the economic growth actually this is already happening the world bank forecast the gdp growth in china for 6 2 percent in 2019 a decline from 6 5 percent in 2018 you see the country is going through painful structural reforms just when the us decided to tighten its trade policy while president xi jinping boosts his authoritarian rule and the debt burden is mounting chinese households debt to gdp ratio has soared from around 18 percent in 2008 to over 50 percent in 2018 all these factors increase the risk of crisis the boom fueled partially by debt will have to finally come to an end when it happens it will affect the whole globe including the gold market investors should not underestimate the chinese ability to sustain growth but the challenges for beijing get bigger each year the industrial profits have recently fallen for the first time in three years while the car sales have dropped for the first time in nearly 30 years the simultaneous slowdown in both largest economies in the world the us and china would if sharper than expected increase the odds of an abrupt global slowdown and upset the stock markets the yellow metal should shine then thank you if you enjoyed the above analysis and would you like to know more about the gold

the us federal reserve confirmed its monetary policy direction has taken an about turn this week as it announced it has kept rates within the 2 25 2 5 range but despite markets having priced in fewer rate rises none have been priced in for 2019 since last month s statement the overall tone of wednesday s announcement still surprised markets according to anna stupnytska global economist at fidelity at the federal open market committee s final meeting of 2018 it suggested rate hikes would be less aggressive through 2019 and 2020 this week it became more flexible rather than further gradual increases jerome powell talked about future adjustments suggesting the next move could in fact be downwards but experts are still split on the fed s direction stupnytska thinks powell could well become a hawk again later on this year considering the decent economic picture in the states candice bangsund vice president at fiera capital agrees and expects a pause through the first six months of 2019 before two hikes at the back end of the year but some are convinced the dovish sentiment will continue nick maroustos co head of global bonds at janus henderson investors thinks the fed is done hiking not for 2019 but for good there are a few reasons for this more dovish stance beginning at home there may be many who think the us economy and consumer remains robust but we re clearly seeing a slowdown meanwhile inflation is non existent geopolitical risk is at an all time high and washington is in gridlock the stagnating economy and geopolitical risk keep a cloud over growth prospects continues maroustos geopolitical worries start to creep in but there seems to be a growing acceptance that global economic conditions must too play a role in the fed s policy it hiked four times in 2018 leading to a strong us dollar this has had negative impacts on many other particularly emerging markets this is due to the higher borrowing costs they will incur on their reserves of us dollar denominated debt raising the possibility of defaults trade tensions between the us and china do not help either clearly a deterioration in the global economy would not be positive for the us while the fed s assessment of economic conditions did not alter solid growth and a strong jobs market it did change its assessment of the risks to that significantly powell emphasised several cross currents that suggest a less favourable outlook notes stupnytska that includes a continuing slowdown in global growth a range of political risks such as brexit trade uncertainty and the us government shutdown as well as less supportive financial conditions you can add chinese stimulus wearing off higher oil prices through most of 2018 italian fears natural disasters and issues in the european auto sector into the mix too notes melanie baker chief economist at royal london asset management there s been a lot for markets businesses and the global economy to digest she continues in hindsight maybe we should ask why global growth hasn t slowed more indeed while the slowdown has been broad based and economic indicators dropped off sharply from their 2017 peaks the only major manufacturing purchasing managers index that has slipped into contraction territory is china s as a result baker says she s cautious but not pessimistic on growth recession risks have risen but i think there is enough support for the global economy to think that this is a slowdown not something more sinister in fact many of the fears baker mentioned that threatened markets have either been temporary in their impact such as natural disasters or have faded for example oil price has fallen back significantly and the us government has re opened after 2017 saw global synchronised growth 2018 saw the us diverge with the rest of the world while economic growth stateside took off elsewhere either stagnated or fell off that trend was mirrored in both stock prices and earnings growth many expect convergence over the coming 12 months and have been busy considering whether it s the us that softens or the rest of the world that surges sonja laud deputy chief investment officer at legal general investment management thinks and the final quarter of 2018 suggests she s correct it will be the former with the failing fiscal stimulus in the us we believe it will be the us approaching the rest of the world that implies we are past the peak for global growth she explains in fact laud claims company earnings are heading for a recession with the us leading the pack having seen 12 month forward consensus earnings per share growth estimates drop 9 9 peak to trough it s no surprise to see the us being the weakest because they have been on a sugar high due to the tax cuts and the artificial boost they have received to their earnings recession expectations commentators have been arguing over the possibility of a us economic or financial recession for a year or more now seemingly the likelihood of one this year has receded in that time with few now seeing imminent warning signs there are some worries cropping up though that suggest it might not be too far away laud picks over the make up of the us investment grade corporate bond universe as troubling more than 50 of this universe is now made up of bbb rated the lowest rating an investment grade bond can attain this suggests issuance is at its lowest quality for more than 25 years trevor greetham head of multi asset at royal london asset management rlam picks out some leading indicators first he asserts when stock markets turn overly negative 50 of the time it leads to a recession 50 to a slowdown it s something to take quite seriously certainly in december markets were saying there is a recession coming in america but the probability it comes this year is low as ever since the 1970s real interest rates have had to be around or above 2 before a recession hits we re far from that point just above zero today the oil price too tends to be a telling signal when oil prices spike sharply consumers need to spend more of their disposable income on gasoline so have less to spend in the wider economy oil price shocks in 1973 1979 and 1980 presaged recessions within the year also by the way people forget the oil price spiked in the run up to the lehman failure greetham cautions people say it was all about the banks but the oil price was 145 per barrel three times the level it is today indeed while oil was strong for most of the year it ended up weak down 30 helping along with tax cuts buoy the us consumer on the oil point greetham concludes no one has told the us consumer about this recession us consumer spending growth is running at about two and a bit percent a slowing housing market also tends to be a good leading indicator and that looks to be the big worry and further rate rises could be quite damaging here however a pause in hikes will prolong that greetham says i don t want to labour this because housing is slowing and there are other things going on but wage growth is still pretty strong in the us the unemployment rate is still quite low and there s been a big drop in gasoline prices so the us consumer could remain quite strong
washington analysis meng wanzhou the chief financial officer of chinese telecommunications titan huawei appeared in canadian court on tuesday to fight her extradition to the united states if she is extradited she will face fresh charges issued by the u s justice department doj accusing meng and huawei of engaging in bank fraud and trade theft as well as violating u s sanctions against iran the doj s indictments come just two days before scheduled talks between the u s and china to negotiate an end to the trump administration s multi billion dollar trade war these new accusations which meng and huawei flatly deny will undoubtedly strain trade talks and u s china relations just a year ago huawei was scarcely an issue on americans minds americans happily bought goods with the familiar made in china mark huawei and china s alleged wrongdoings were thrust forward into the public discourse when u s president donald trump announced a 30 percent tariff on solar panel imports china being the u s s biggest source of imported solar panels launching what we now know as the u s china trade war what followed was intense scrutiny of all things chinese including products like huawei phones and telecommunications hardware since the beginning of his presidential campaign trump has railed against the u s trade deficit with china he claimed china was ripping off the united states and tariffs were the only thing that would make china trade fairly the deficit since the u s and china began trading is nearing 420 billion this is no small number but when compared with american student loan debt nearing 1 6 trillion and credit card debt over 1 05 trillion the china trade deficit becomes less significant furthermore most economists agree that trade deficits aren t inherently good or bad while chinese companies saw an increase in sales many don t see the benefits u s consumers see in the form of lower prices is trump actually waging a trade war to protect american consumers from unfair trade practices if trump cared about struggling people in this country he would not have backed the 2017 tax cut plan that eliminates the federal estate tax and the alternative minimum tax which are only paid by the super rich is trump a deficit hawk trying to limit waste and excess spending wherever possible including trade no trump reversed the course of the budget deficit since assuming office taking it to six year highs trump s cabinet is one of the wealthiest in recent memory filled with plutocrats hailing from goldman sachs private equity firms and good old inheritance wealth leaving no doubt the interests of average americans will go unrepresented so what is it about china and huawei that has the trump administration endlessly obsessed if not an economic dispute and why is this conflict unfolding now china s peaceful rise after sino soviet relations collapsed over ideological and diplomatic disagreements in 1966 the strength of the world socialist movement had been split in half washington s diplomats sought to drive a wedge even further between their two enemies through a series of diplomatic trips first to china then to the soviet union in 1972 henry kissinger president richard nixon s secretary of state explained the american strategy dubbed triangular diplomacy very plainly in his book diplomacy america s bargaining position would be strongest when america was closer to both communist giants than either was to the other in other words kissinger wanted the soviet union and china to fight over the u s s diplomatic attention to be recognized as the capital of the world communist movement delegitimizing and eventually destroying each other in the process the inevitable outcome was that two sides of the triangle would ice out the third and cause it to lose power unable to trade with its industrialized former ally china was forced to confront its own underdevelopment while the 1949 revolution abolished feudal exploitation overthrew foreign control of china slashed illiteracy and nearly doubled life expectancy the country was still mostly agrarian and poor with the population growing so rapidly chinese leader deng xiaoping foresaw china s inability to provide an adequate standard of living and introduced a reform policy to industrialize the country deng explained his theory of socialism as follows if we don t do everything possible to increase production how can we expand the economy how can we demonstrate the superiority of socialism and communism we have been making revolution for several decades and have been building socialism for more than three nevertheless by 1978 the average monthly salary for our workers was still only 45 yuan and most of our rural areas were still mired in poverty can this be called the superiority of socialism that is why i insisted that the focus of our work should be rapidly shifted to economic development in short while it was crucial to create a more egalitarian society especially for women poor people and ethnic minorities equality was less meaningful if it meant sharing poverty equally the reforms opened up china to foreign investment capital to take advantage of the international market economy while being careful not to allow foreign capital to dictate the direction of the government this became known as socialism with chinese characteristics in order to reach this goal deng enacted a policy of technology transfers when china opened up diplomatic relations with a country it usually ushered in that relationship with a science and technology cooperation treaty for example the 1979 u s china science and technology cooperation agreement these agreements gave foreign capital and corporations access to china s vast market in return chinese companies would not need to expend capital reinventing technologies that had already been invented china has signed cooperation agreements with over one hundred countries through the china association for science and technology bringing rapid growth to china s tech sector the opening up policy brought heavy industry to china elevating china to the status of world superpower in 2010 china surpassed japan as the world s second largest economy with a gross domestic product of 5 trillion since then china s gdp has more than doubled to 12 trillion only 7 trillion behind the u s in accordance with deng s vision china s growth helped bring about the largest poverty reduction campaign in human history according to the world bank china has lifted over 800 million people out of poverty since 1978 reaching all of its millennium development goals and serves as a shining model for poverty reduction in developing countries united nations development program officials believe china will end rural poverty in 2020 china is also becoming the world s leading electric vehicle manufacturer in the city of shenzhen china is creating the world s first city with completely electric powered transportation shenzhen already has more electric buses than any american city has diesel buses and the model will soon be expanded across the country china spends more on improving its infrastructure than the u s and europe combined even trump compared u s infrastructure to that of a third world country making his constant china bashing difficult to understand the belt and road initiative and the made in china 2025 plan for the longest time the u s treated china as a subordinate country china was the butt of many jokes and treated like america s personal factory ironically henry kissinger s diplomatic maneuvers succeeded in accelerating the dissolution of the soviet union but planted the seeds for an independent china in the process china s domestic achievements have proved to the world that it doesn t need to submit to the u s s neoliberal model to prosper to many developing nations china s rise represents the first possibility of a multipolar world since the fall of the soviet union likewise in washington the realization that china poses a real threat to the u s dominated unipolar world order has set in its response an all out attack on china s belt and road initiative and made in china 2025 plan labeling china as a revisionist power under the guise of unfair trade practices and chinese cyber crime through decades of hard work the chinese people have made china the world s manufacturing hub recognizing china s unprecedented accomplishments in poverty reduction and sustainable development the developing world has logically turned to china not the u s to overcome their own challenges likewise china is now strong enough to forge an independent path whereas it once faced the threat of u s reprisal if it pursued its own national interest against the interests of foreign capital enter the belt and road initiative bri in 2013 chinese president xi jinping announced the project which has been described as one of the most ambitious engineering projects in human history the project aims to build infrastructure such as bridges highways railways and waterways across the world in order to increase economic cooperation investment and trade bri will involve 65 countries 62 percent of the world s population and 30 percent of world gdp despite its being in a very early stage western media has already tried to portray bri as china s attempt to conquer the world or gain leverage over small countries it seeks to exploit these accusations are impossible to disprove as the project is nowhere close to being finished what we can observe however is that the number of participants eager to join the project has steadily grown and investments continue to pour in it is clear that china s diplomatic approach has earned it respect and international legitimacy on the other hand with military might as its major means to project influence the u s empire has expanded primarily through military occupation and covert regime change since world war ii american expansionism has given us 20 30 million corpses through assaults on 37 different countries compare that to the people s liberation army which has deployed 60 000 soldiers to plant trees in an area roughly the size of ireland take your pick when the united states kills 30 muslims for every american killed in combat according to conservative estimates it makes sense that the arab league was enthusiastic about joining bri but not the iraq war unfortunately for washington china s military is too powerful for the u s military to invade the country or attempt a covert coup of the chinese communist party the trade war allows the united states to complicate china s foreign policy objectives for seemingly legitimate reasons trump s tariffs on steel and aluminum are intended to hurt chinese steel and aluminum producers companies crucial to china s ability to construct infrastructure necessary to build the new silk roads even more threatening to u s hegemony is the made in china 2025 plan announced by chinese premier li keqiang in 2015 made in china 2025 aims to promote the competitiveness of chinese companies in the fields of advanced industries the plan has the potential to challenge the american monopoly over core internet technologies especially the upcoming 5g wireless network which china is on track to complete before the u s through secret meetings the u s successfully lobbied australia and new zealand to ban huawei from their future 5g networks japan also agreed to ban huawei and the u s is lobbying italy the u k and germany to do the same the made in china 2025 plan goes hand in hand with bri bri participants expect to import state of the art chinese technology as well as export their own indigenous technology a sensible alternative to being forced to take in one of over 800 u s military bases in foreign countries the fundamental goal of the trade war is preserving u s hegemony and monopoly on advanced industries and to force china to sign a new version of the plaza accord an economic agreement which the u s pressured japan to sign on and caused japan s lost decade doing so prevents developing nations from leaving the u s s orbit so much for the free market and competition it still sounds like huawei is up to no good with all of the headlines using the words huawei spying and stealing in the same sentence many believe huawei must be up to something sinister even if it s not everything they ve been charged with however since the u s house intelligence committee published a report in 2012 advocating a u s ban on huawei and zte products asserting they pose a threat to national security the evidence to support the claim that huawei products are chinese spying devices simply isn t there after the government designated the chinese telecommunications companies as threats the u k government conducted its own investigation into the matter the u k cabinet office countered the u s s claims saying it had no concerns about huawei and zte s presence in the u k only 10 days after the house committee published its report the classified investigation into huawei and zte was leaked to reuters and showed no evidence to back up the claims of the report one of the whistleblowers even told reuters we knew certain parts of government really wanted evidence of active spying we would have found it if it were there only a month ago the german federal office for information security bsi conducted an investigation into the huawei spying claims facing pressure from the u s to follow its lead in banning huawei from the country the president of the bsi arne schönbohm told german media that there was no evidence to demonstrate a security risk posed by huawei how did the u s security apparatus counter this investigation by saying it doesn t need to provide evidence that huawei poses a security threat because the chinese government can potentially demand information from huawei at any time the most egregious aspect of the war on huawei is that amidst america s repeated failures to produce a shred of evidence that huawei is a front for chinese espionage there is documented proof that the u s government hacked into huawei s servers and monitored its communications as far back as 2007 the national security agency hacked into huawei s servers to find connections between huawei and the chinese government according to documents leaked by nsa whistleblower edward snowden you would think that if the world s most powerful intelligence apparatus had access to huawei s internal communications they would have found treasure troves of evidence proving an internal plot to spy on americans enough to ban huawei from every corner of the earth but no the 2007 nsa operation came up empty handed even more insulting is that it is more or less common knowledge in the united states thanks to edward snowden s nsa leaks that the u s government collects virtually all digital communications made by americans without a warrant so why isn t trump calling for an end to warrantless surveillance while all of this may come as a surprise to some with an understanding that the u s is trying to slander and stifle china s growth in front of the international community to preserve its global dominance it becomes clear that the u s doesn t need evidence it just needs to repeat falsehoods enough to get the world to believe it evolving war propaganda when the russian hacking hysteria reached its fever pitch russiagaters spent no time proving an individual or organization s documented ties to russia they chose to debate whether one s rhetoric was strong on russia or something a russian bot would say it did not matter whether the russian hacking accusations had any legitimacy because the intention was simply to associate all things russian with hacking malicious intent and anti american sentiment warhawks and deep state agents used this well cultivated xenophobia to pass off their empire building in syria and eastern europe as being tough on putin in almost the exact same fashion the u s china trade war has created a political environment in which it has become acceptable for the government and its adoring fans in the media to say whatever they wanted about china as long as it makes the audience uncomfortable about china virtually copying the russiagate story trump accused china of hacking the u s election only to tweet to the world that he was choosing to interfere in venezuelan politics by declaring opposition member juan guaido president of venezuela just two months later the level of sinophobia in american society is the highest it has been since 1972 and the most terrifying part is that this type of sinophobia is accepted by the u s government and the corporate media as political correctness rather than a racist bias that needs to be corrected and combated even today long after the supposed end of yellow peril chinese people are still portrayed as sneaky cunning spies hackers or technology thieves chinese products from the 5g project to huawei phones are portrayed as vehicles of chinese infiltration an article in the washington post even claimed that metro cars made in china can spy on the american public the aforementioned demonization of china not only distorts the american public s perception of china but it also serves as extremely destructive war propaganda the sinophobic propaganda misleads the american public to believe the economic problems in the u s are not caused by an economic system structured to siphon wealth from the poor to the rich but by chinese economic aggression the white house portrayed china as threatening the united states and the world in its report serving as the declaration of the trade war the u s department of defense similarly accused the chinese manufacturing industry and the supply chain as a national threat it is clear that if you are siding against huawei you are siding with institutions that have never had the good of the people or the truth in mind this narrative must be countered as it is being used prolong the ongoing trade war a war on china and the future of the developing world which severely undermines the interests of the american public especially the american working class update some glad talk both the chinese and u s delegations reported feeling positive about thursday s trade talks china has agreed to buy an additional 5 million soybeans from the u s this development is certainly a good sign but it is important to remember that no deal came out of this meeting only a single concession from china what s important is that the more sensitive issues of intellectual property and technology transfers are still unresolved which include the issues pertaining to huawei 5g and meng wanzhou u s tariffs on china are set to increase by 25 percent on march 1st if this deadline is missed it could set trade progress back even further than it is today while president trump is currently celebrating the progress on twitter keep in mind he considers unpredictability a part of his strategy china s top trade negotiators are in the u s meeting with our representatives meetings are going well with good intent and spirit on both sides china does not want an increase in tariffs and feels they will do much better if they make a deal they are correct i will be donald j trump realdonaldtrump january 31 2019 in june the chinese ministry of commerce lamented over the trump administration s use of tariffs as a means of forcing trade negotiations forward clearly flip flopping his stance and complicating trade negotiations similarly trump praised the outcome of the singapore u s dprk summit in june promising full north korean nuclear disarmament three months later north korea released a statement saying it would not unilaterally disarm because it did not trust that the united states and the trump administration would follow through on its end of the deal when negotiating with trump a lot can happen in a month in addition to the conflict between the two sides over technological issues both sides would face an even larger disagreement when discussing the so called structural issues the role of subsidies and state owned enterprises in the chinese economy as u s vice president mike pence declared in his speech the u s insists that china s state owned enterprises and subsidies are unfair threats to the u s and demands china to reform its economic structure but from china s perspective such a demand is not acceptable ideologically the existence of state owned enterprises is a crucial foundation of socialism with chinese characteristics and politically the economic structure of china is a non negotiable part of chinese sovereignty the chinese people would never accept having their own domestic development model dictated by foreign powers such a huge difference remains a very formidable challenge to the ongoing negotiation top photo u s

million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 211 million in the third quarter of 2018 adjusted ebitda declined versus both comparative periods due to lower north american osb prices and shipments 2018 was an excellent year for norbord said peter wijnbergen norbord s president and ceo despite a disappointing fourth quarter we delivered our best ever adjusted ebitda of 724 million as north american osb prices remained strong for much of the year and we shipped more product to meet increased demand our european business had an outstanding year more than doubling their adjusted ebitda as robust demand growth in our key markets supported higher panel prices norbord s mills in both north america and europe continued to perform well with seven of our mills setting annual production records in 2018 the exceptional operating cash flow we generated last year allowed us to maintain a strong balance sheet even as we reinvested more than 200 million in our mills and returned over 500 million in cash to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks in europe our panel business is set for another great year as osb demand in our key markets continues to increase and our inverness scotland mill will achieve a step change in production now that the new finishing end is complete in north america the pace of us housing growth decelerated in the second half of the year as homebuyers adjusted to higher home prices and mortgage interest rates combined with the usual seasonal slowdown this negatively impacted our fourth quarter results and this weakness has carried over into january the fundamentals underlying new home construction remain supportive and we expect a pick up in osb demand as the spring building season approaches with a strong balance sheet and a diversification strategy that is growing non traditional end uses for osb to help cushion against volatility in housing demand we believe norbord is well positioned for 2019 for the full year 2018

rate of 0 78 in 2018 in line with 2017 in addition two mills completed the year injury free north american osb shipments for the fourth quarter were 5 lower than the third quarter due to seasonality of demand and timing of annual maintenance and other downtime shipments were 3 higher than the same quarter last year and 7 higher for the full year due to the huguley alabama restart in the fourth

excluding the curtailed chambord quebec mill and the portion of 2017 that the huguley alabama mill was curtailed norbord s full year north american osb cash production costs per unit before mill profit share increased 4 versus 2017 due to higher raw material prices and higher maintenance related costs in europe shipments decreased by 2 versus the prior year due to changes in product mix all european panel mills ran on full production schedules during the year excluding maintenance and holiday shutdowns producing at 88 of capacity in 2018 compared to 99 in 2017 capacity utilization decreased due to the restatement of annual production capacity to reflect the new continuous press line at the inverness scotland osb mill that was substantially completed in the fourth quarter of 2017 production from the expanded inverness mill is expected to increase in 2019 now that the new finishing line installation is complete and commissioning is underway annual production records were achieved at two of the company s european mills for 2018 margin improvement program mip gains from a richer product mix and improved productivity were offset by higher maintenance related costs raw material usages and cost associated with executing on strategic capital and sales growth initiatives mip gains are measured relative to the prior year at constant prices and exchange rates improved productivity and lower raw material usage at the restarted huguley alabama and expanded inverness scotland mills were excluded from the 2018 mip calculation these mills are expected to generate mip gains in 2019 capital investments totaled 204 million 205 including intangible assets in 2018 including the inverness scotland finishing line chambord quebec rebuild grande prairie alberta debottlenecking project and several productivity improvement and cost reduction projects across the company s mills included in the 2018 capital investments is 12 million for the installation of a new finishing end at the modernized and expanded inverness scotland mill which was completed during the fourth quarter of 2018 a total of 146 million was invested in the project the board of directors approved a 46 million 35 million second phase investment to further expand capacity at the inverness scotland mill by 225 mmsf 3 8 inch basis 200 000 cubic metres through the addition of a second wood room and dryer this project is expected to take two years to complete and is consistent with the company s strategy of growing its european osb capacity to serve rapid consumption growth in its key markets also included in the 2018 capital investments is 44 million for the grande prairie alberta debottlenecking project the grande prairie mill is one of the largest single line osb facilities in the world but the mill was bottlenecked in the areas before the forming line and press the company completed a project to redeploy the wood handling heat energy and drying equipment from the unfinished and unused second production line to debottleneck the existing first line and support growing demand from key customers the project was completed in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the mill s production capacity increased by 100 mmsf 3 8 inch basis further savings are expected to be realized through reduced wood and natural gas usage a total of 68 million was invested in the project at the chambord quebec mill rebuild project 27 million of the 71 million budget was invested in 2018 norbord believes north american osb demand will continue to grow in order to support this anticipated growth norbord is rebuilding and preparing the chambord quebec mill for an eventual restart the company has not yet made a restart decision however and will only do so when it is sufficiently clear that customers require more product this project involves replacing the dryers and investing in the wood handling and finishing areas to debottleneck the mill s manufacturing process and reduce manufacturing costs as well as upgrades in process and personal safety systems electrical systems and environmental equipment to bring the mill up to current standards after a decade of curtailment the mill s stated capacity has been increased by 80 mmsf 3 8 inch basis norbord s 2019 capital expenditure budget is approximately 150 million for projects focused on reducing manufacturing costs

2019 a c 0 20 per common share or 33 decrease versus the prior quarter s level norbord believes that the longer term fundamentals underlying osb demand remain supportive the variable dividend decrease reflects the weaker than expected north american benchmark osb prices in the fourth quarter of 2018 as well as the 140 million of capital allocated to common share repurchases during the last three months any dividends reinvested on march 21 2019 under the company s dividend reinvestment plan will be used by the transfer agent to purchase common shares on the open market norbord s dividends are

discussion and analysis dated january 31 2019 for a quantitative reconciliation of adjusted ebitda and adjusted earnings to earnings the most directly comparable ifrs measure february 1 2019 to our shareholders 2018 was the best financial year in norbord s history our company delivered a record 724 million of adjusted ebitda as we produced and shipped more product from our mills and north american osb prices remained well above historical trends for much of the year our european business had an excellent year more than doubling its ebitda contribution to 86 million our success enabled us to return more than half a billion dollars to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks these results were underpinned by solid operational performance across the company as seven of our mills set annual production records most importantly our employees continued to work safely and achieved an osha recordable injury rate of 0 78 we are encouraged that our employees continue to prioritize safety even as we invested more than 200 million in productivity and cost reduction initiatives at our mills these investments will also support our ongoing efforts to expand our specialty product sales the exceptional operating cash flow we generated last year preserved our strong balance sheet and we ended the year with 490 million of liquidity including more than 125 million in cash while 2018 was a banner year for norbord us housing sentiment turned negative in the fall and this affected stock market perceptions of companies in our industry in november december and january we saw this as a compelling opportunity to buy back 5 2 million of our shares at prices which we believe are significantly below their intrinsic value a strategic use of our capital to enhance shareholder value our perspective on the markets in 2018 we experienced significant volatility in north american osb prices that is not unusual in our industry let me put this recent market volatility in context the first half of 2018 saw an extraordinary increase in benchmark osb prices due to a combination of strong demand growth and weather related logistics issues which constrained supply particularly in the west the weather improved and logistics issues were resolved in time for the spring homebuilding season but by the fall the pace of us housing growth began to slow as home buyers were faced with higher home prices and rising mortgage interest rates as the year drew to a close and we entered the seasonally slowest time of year particularly wet weather in the us south further constrained homebuilding activity and osb demand this market volatility was reflected in our 2018 financial results with well above average adjusted ebitda in the first three quarters of the year followed by below average results in the fourth quarter which continued into january we continue to share the view of housing experts that the industry is experiencing a temporary pause rather than a directional shift the underlying market fundamentals remain supportive with low unemployment and solid wage growth underpinning consumer confidence and household formation finally moving back above the long term average us housing starts continue to grow albeit at a modest pace with the experts current forecast averaging 1 28 million starts for 2019 demand for lower cost entry level homes remains particularly strong though we believe home builders need time to adapt their offerings to meet this need mortgage interest rates increased by more than 1 from just under 4 to approximately 5 during 2018 but have since moderated down about half a percent outside of housing we see continued solid growth in other osb end uses 83 of our incremental 2018 volumes were specialty and non commodity products we have been investing to support the production and sale of more osb for non traditional end uses and we believe this will support further north american osb demand growth the picture in europe is even more favourable strong demand growth driven by increasing substitution for imported panels contributed to our outstanding european results in 2018 and we expect this trend to continue the new finishing end at our inverness scotland osb mill is now complete and will unlock the capacity of the modernized and expanded press line further our board has approved an incremental 35 million investment at inverness to add a second stranding and drying line to the mill the expanded mill layout was predisposed for this next phase of growth which will allow us to continue steadily increasing our production volume in each of the next five years to support our european customers growing needs priorities for 2019 we will continue to manage the business by closely aligning to the needs of our customers we took more than 130 mill days of downtime during the fourth quarter of 2018 and will continue to produce only what we can sell for 2019 we have budgeted approximately 150 million for ongoing investments in our mills to reduce manufacturing costs and ensure we can support growth in our specialty product sales the budget includes a portion of the inverness phase 2 investment we will also continue to prepare our chambord quebec mill for an eventual restart though no decision has been made about the timing work on the long lead time items is well underway and similar to our approach at huguley alabama we will continue to manage the pace of the rebuild based on market conditions norbord has a track record of superior returns on invested capital versus our peers and we have returned over 1 5 billion in cash to our shareholders over the past 15 years through both dividends and share buybacks we remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders and our variable dividend policy gives us the flexibility to prudently balance capital allocation decisions with the inherent cyclicality in our business with record annual earnings strong operational and sales performance and excellent customer relationships we continue to be a clear leader in the osb industry our diversification strategy is designed to mitigate volatility and deliver value even in times of market uncertainty combined with our strong balance sheet and liquidity we believe norbord is well positioned for the year ahead we believe it is an excellent time to be

million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 211 million in the third quarter of 2018 adjusted ebitda declined versus both comparative periods due to lower north american osb prices and shipments 2018 was an excellent year for norbord said peter wijnbergen norbord s president and ceo despite a disappointing fourth quarter we delivered our best ever adjusted ebitda of 724 million as north american osb prices remained strong for much of the year and we shipped more product to meet increased demand our european business had an outstanding year more than doubling their adjusted ebitda as robust demand growth in our key markets supported higher panel prices norbord s mills in both north america and europe continued to perform well with seven of our mills setting annual production records in 2018 the exceptional operating cash flow we generated last year allowed us to maintain a strong balance sheet even as we reinvested more than 200 million in our mills and returned over 500 million in cash to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks in europe our panel business is set for another great year as osb demand in our key markets continues to increase and our inverness scotland mill will achieve a step change in production now that the new finishing end is complete in north america the pace of us housing growth decelerated in the second half of the year as homebuyers adjusted to higher home prices and mortgage interest rates combined with the usual seasonal slowdown this negatively impacted our fourth quarter results and this weakness has carried over into january the fundamentals underlying new home construction remain supportive and we expect a pick up in osb demand as the spring building season approaches with a strong balance sheet and a diversification strategy that is growing non traditional end uses for osb to help cushion against volatility in housing demand we believe norbord is well positioned for 2019 for the full year 2018

rate of 0 78 in 2018 in line with 2017 in addition two mills completed the year injury free north american osb shipments for the fourth quarter were 5 lower than the third quarter due to seasonality of demand and timing of annual maintenance and other downtime shipments were 3 higher than the same quarter last year and 7 higher for the full year due to the huguley alabama restart in the fourth quarter of 2017 norbord s specialty sales volume including industrial applications and exports continued to increase and represents more than 25 of the company s 7 higher north american osb sales volume annual production records were achieved at five of the company s north american osb mills for the full year norbord s operating osb mills produced at 95 of capacity compared to 96 in 2017 excluding the curtailed chambord quebec mill and the portion of 2017 that the huguley alabama mill was curtailed norbord s full year north american osb cash production costs per unit before mill profit share increased 4 versus 2017 due to higher raw material prices and higher maintenance related costs in europe shipments decreased by 2 versus the prior year due to changes in product mix all european panel mills ran on full production schedules during the year excluding maintenance and holiday shutdowns producing at 88 of capacity in 2018 compared to 99 in 2017 capacity utilization decreased due to the restatement of annual production capacity to reflect the new continuous press line at the inverness scotland osb mill that was substantially completed in the fourth quarter of 2017 production from the expanded inverness mill is expected to increase in 2019 now that the new finishing line installation is complete and commissioning is underway annual production records were achieved at two of the company s european mills for 2018 margin improvement program mip gains from a richer product mix and improved productivity were offset by higher maintenance related costs raw material usages and cost associated with executing on strategic capital and sales growth initiatives mip gains are measured relative to the prior year at constant prices and exchange rates improved productivity and lower raw material usage at the restarted huguley alabama and expanded inverness scotland mills were excluded from the 2018 mip calculation these mills are expected to generate mip gains in 2019 capital investments totaled 204 million 205 including intangible assets in 2018 including the inverness scotland finishing line chambord quebec rebuild grande prairie alberta debottlenecking project and several productivity improvement and cost reduction projects across the company s mills included in the 2018 capital investments is 12 million for the installation of a new finishing end at the modernized and expanded inverness scotland mill which was completed during the fourth quarter of 2018 a total of 146 million was invested in the project the board of directors approved a 46 million 35 million second phase investment to further expand capacity at the inverness scotland mill by 225 mmsf 3 8 inch basis 200 000 cubic metres through the addition of a second wood room and dryer this project is expected to take two years to complete and is consistent with the company s strategy of growing its european osb capacity to serve rapid consumption growth in its key markets also included in the 2018 capital investments is 44 million for the grande prairie alberta debottlenecking project the grande prairie mill is one of the largest single line osb facilities in the world but the mill was bottlenecked in the areas before the forming line and press the company completed a project to redeploy the wood handling heat energy and drying equipment from the unfinished and unused second production line to debottleneck the existing first line and support growing demand from key customers the project was completed in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the mill s production capacity increased by 100 mmsf 3 8 inch basis further savings are expected to be realized through reduced wood and natural gas usage a total of 68 million was invested in the project at the chambord quebec mill rebuild project 27 million of the 71 million budget was invested in 2018 norbord believes north american osb demand will continue to grow in order to support this anticipated growth norbord is rebuilding and preparing the chambord quebec mill for an eventual restart the company has not yet made a restart decision however and will only do so when it is sufficiently clear that customers require more product this project involves replacing the dryers and investing in the wood handling and finishing areas to debottleneck the mill s manufacturing process and reduce manufacturing costs as well as upgrades in process and personal safety systems electrical systems and environmental equipment to bring the mill up to current standards after a decade of curtailment the mill s stated capacity has been increased by 80 mmsf 3 8 inch basis norbord s 2019 capital expenditure budget is approximately 150 million for projects focused on reducing manufacturing costs

2019 a c 0 20 per common share or 33 decrease versus the prior quarter s level norbord believes that the longer term fundamentals underlying osb demand remain supportive the variable dividend decrease reflects the weaker than expected north american benchmark osb prices in the fourth quarter of 2018 as well as the 140 million of capital allocated to common share repurchases during the last three months any dividends reinvested on march 21 2019 under the company s dividend reinvestment plan will be used by the transfer agent to purchase common shares on the open market norbord s dividends are

limit with a total of 5 2 million shares purchased for 140 million norbord believed that the market price of its common shares was attractive as they were trading significantly below replacement cost and management s view of intrinsic value and that the purchase of these common shares was an appropriate use of norbord s funds in light of potential benefits to remaining shareholders developments at

discussion and analysis dated january 31 2019 for a quantitative reconciliation of adjusted ebitda and adjusted earnings to earnings the most directly comparable ifrs measure february 1 2019 to our shareholders 2018 was the best financial year in norbord s history our company delivered a record 724 million of adjusted ebitda as we produced and shipped more product from our mills and north american osb prices remained well above historical trends for much of the year our european business had an excellent year more than doubling its ebitda contribution to 86 million our success enabled us to return more than half a billion dollars to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks these results were underpinned by solid operational performance across the company as seven of our mills set annual production records most importantly our employees continued to work safely and achieved an osha recordable injury rate of 0 78 we are encouraged that our employees continue to prioritize safety even as we invested more than 200 million in productivity and cost reduction initiatives at our mills these investments will also support our ongoing efforts to expand our specialty product sales the exceptional operating cash flow we generated last year preserved our strong balance sheet and we ended the year with 490 million of liquidity including more than 125 million in cash while 2018 was a banner year for norbord us housing sentiment turned negative in the fall and this affected stock market perceptions of companies in our industry in november december and january we saw this as a compelling opportunity to buy back 5 2 million of our shares at prices which we believe are significantly below their intrinsic value a strategic use of our capital to enhance shareholder value our perspective on the markets in 2018 we experienced significant volatility in north american osb prices that is not unusual in our industry let me put this recent market volatility in context the first half of 2018 saw an extraordinary increase in benchmark osb prices due to a combination of strong demand growth and weather related logistics issues which constrained supply particularly in the west the weather improved and logistics issues were resolved in time for the spring homebuilding season but by the fall the pace of us housing growth began to slow as home buyers were faced with higher home prices and rising mortgage interest rates as the year drew to a close and we entered the seasonally slowest time of year particularly wet weather in the us south further constrained homebuilding activity and osb demand this market volatility was reflected in our 2018 financial results with well above average adjusted ebitda in the first three quarters of the year followed by below average results in the fourth quarter which continued into january we continue to share the view of housing experts that the industry is experiencing a temporary pause rather than a directional shift the underlying market fundamentals remain supportive with low unemployment and solid wage growth underpinning consumer confidence and household formation finally moving back above the long term average us housing starts continue to grow albeit at a modest pace with the experts current forecast averaging 1 28 million starts for 2019 demand for lower cost entry level homes remains particularly strong though we believe home builders need time to adapt their offerings to meet this need mortgage interest rates increased by more than 1 from just under 4 to approximately 5 during 2018 but have since moderated down about half a percent outside of housing we see continued solid growth in other osb end uses 83 of our incremental 2018 volumes were specialty and non commodity products we have been investing to support the production and sale of more osb for non traditional end uses and we believe this will support further north american osb demand growth the picture in europe is even more favourable strong demand growth driven by increasing substitution for imported panels contributed to our outstanding european results in 2018 and we expect this trend to continue the new finishing end at our inverness scotland osb mill is now complete and will unlock the capacity of the modernized and expanded press line further our board has approved an incremental 35 million investment at inverness to add a second stranding and drying line to the mill the expanded mill layout was predisposed for this next phase of growth which will allow us to continue steadily increasing our production volume in each of the next five years to support our european customers growing needs priorities for 2019 we will continue to manage the business by closely aligning to the needs of our customers we took more than 130 mill days of downtime during the fourth quarter of 2018 and will continue to produce only what we can sell for 2019 we have budgeted approximately 150 million for ongoing investments in our mills to reduce manufacturing costs and ensure we can support growth in our specialty product sales the budget includes a portion of the inverness phase 2 investment we will also continue to prepare our chambord quebec mill for an eventual restart though no decision has been made about the timing work on the long lead time items is well underway and similar to our approach at huguley alabama we will continue to manage the pace of the rebuild based on market conditions norbord has a track record of superior returns on invested capital versus our peers and we have returned over 1 5 billion in cash to our shareholders over the past 15 years through both dividends and share buybacks we remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders and our variable dividend policy gives us the flexibility to prudently balance capital allocation decisions with the inherent cyclicality in our business with record annual earnings strong operational and sales performance and excellent customer relationships we continue to be a clear leader in the osb industry our diversification strategy is designed to mitigate volatility and deliver value even in times of market uncertainty combined with our strong balance sheet and liquidity we believe norbord is well positioned for the year ahead we believe it is an excellent time to be

full year 2019 cag diagnostics recurring organic revenue growth the impacts of revenue from acquisitions is immaterial comparable constant currency eps growth comparable constant currency eps growth is a non gaap financial measure that excludes the tax effects of share based compensation activity under asu 2016 09 a one time negative impact related to the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act u s tax reform and a discrete tax benefit related to the expected utilization of foreign tax credits management believes comparable constant currency eps growth is a more useful way to measure the company s business performance than eps growth because it enables better period over period comparisons of the fundamental financial results by excluding items that vary independent of performance and provides greater transparency to investors regarding a key metric used by management share based compensation activity is expected to increase projected eps by 0 07 to 0 10 for the full year 2019 increased fourth quarter 2018 eps by 0 01 compared to 0 06 in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased eps by 0 24 for the full year 2018 and increased eps by 0 30 for full year 2017 a one time negative impact related to the enactment of the u s tax reform for the fourth quarter of 2017 due to the deemed repatriation of the company s foreign profits net of the remeasurement of deferred taxes at the lower enacted corporate tax rate reduced fourth quarter and full year 2017 eps by 0 34 a discrete tax benefit related to the expected utilization of foreign tax credits in 2017 increased fourth quarter 2017 eps by 0 01 and full year 2017 eps by 0 04 these impacts and those described in the constant currency note above reconcile reported eps growth to comparable constant currency eps growth for the company free cash flow free cash flow is a non gaap financial measure and means with respect to a measurement period the cash generated from operations during that period including tax benefits attributable to share based compensation reduced by the company s investments in property and equipment management believes free cash flow is a useful measure because it indicates the cash the operations of the business are generating after appropriate reinvestment for recurring investments in property and equipment that are required to operate the business see the supplementary analysis of results below for our calculation of free cash flow for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 since adoption of asu 2016 09 in 2017 the tax benefit from share based compensation is included in cash generated from operations and will no longer be an adjustment in our free cash flow calculation to estimate projected 2019 free cash flow we have deducted projected purchases of property and equipment also referred to as capital expenditures of 160 175 million debt to adjusted ebitda leverage ratios adjusted ebitda gross debt and net debt are non gaap financial measures adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure of earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and share based compensation management believes that using adjusted ebitda gross debt and net debt in the adjusted ebitda ratio is

welcome to this week s market wrap podcast i m mike gleason coming up axel merk of merk investments joins me for a terrific conversation about gold the fed stocks and the dollar and find out why he believes investors will soon realize that it does matter again about where you put your money don t miss my interview with axel merk coming up after this week s market update gold and silver markets closed out the month of january on a high note as the federal reserve signaled it would back off on further rate hikes on wednesday fed policymakers voted unanimously to leave the central bank s benchmark interest rate unchanged fed chairman jerome powell cited recent weakness in economic growth forecasts left unspoken was the recent pressure directed at the fed from the white house and wall street the stock market plunge in late december set off multiple alarm bells and even activated the treasury department s plunge protection team the fed got the message and wall street seems to be back on good terms with monetary planners stocks posted one of their best january performances on record on wednesday president donald trump celebrated the dow jones hitting 25 000 however he didn t mention that the best performing sector this week is the gold miners the hui gold mining index popped over 7 higher into thursday s close gold itself is up a more modest 1 1 this week to bring spot prices to 1 318 per ounce silver trades at 16 01 an ounce after rising 1 4 on the week platinum is putting in a weekly gain of 1 3 to trade at 833 and finally palladium is flat for the week to come in at 1 373 per ounce now just slightly ahead of gold well gold is at the center of a geopolitical crisis now playing out in venezuela the venezuelan government is scrambling to get ahold of its own gold reserves after the united states imposed economic sanctions on the country and the united kingdom refused to release 1 2 billion in gold held on behalf of the maduro regime the united states officially recognizes juan guaidó as the acting president of venezuela even though he hasn t yet formed a government or removed maduro from power the socialist incumbent maduro still has the backing of china and of russia he reportedly sent 20 tons of gold to russia on a cargo jet shrouded in mystery whether maduro is trying to steal the country s gold or prevent it from being stolen isn t clear the long suffering venezuelan people have certainly had much of their wealth stolen through hyperinflation that is now approaching 2 million percent as of this recording the bank of england is still freezing venezuela s gold the unprecedented action is raising grave concerns about trust and counterparty risk in the global financial system we in the united states are busily going through a multi year program to see whether the russians had some role in the united states nothing remotely like what the united states and perhaps now britain are doing inside of venezuela richard wolff and you can be sure that every government in the world is going to rethink putting any money in london as they used to do when they re watching this political manipulation it makes a mockery of every international agreement that we know of about non interference in the internal affairs of other countries neo conservative hawks within the trump administration are bent on toppling venezuelan president nicolás maduro and aren t ruling out a military invasion secretary of state mike pompeo appointed elliott abrams one of the main architects of regime change in iraq to oversee regime change in venezuela the trump administration s hasty pivot towards regime change has drawn surprisingly little opposition from democrats perhaps that s because it is the deep state calling most of the shots on foreign policy and not president trump himself yet when it comes to domestic policy the hyper partisan environment in washington threatens to bring about another government shutdown or declaration of national emergency later this month one of the few genuine opportunities for bipartisanship would be an audit the fed bill in january representative thomas massie reintroduced the federal reserve transparency act with a democrat co sponsor this bill which would subject the board of governors of the federal reserve to a full audit has garnered a large congressional majority of support in the past it would probably win majorities in both the house and senate in spite of the existing partisan divide between them the problem has always been whether it can get through procedural hurdles put up by the fed s legislative shills house speaker nancy pelosi may simply refuse to put audit the fed up for a vote and in the senate where a filibuster proof majority is always hard to obtain chuck schumer is a master at blocking legislation on behalf of central bankers some progress on the sound money front continues to be made at the state level in january the arizona legislature took up the sound money stabilization act it would require that at least 10 of arizona s budget stabilization fund be held in precious metals in a secure depository in 2017 arizona removed all state income taxation on gold and silver last year saw the passage of the wyoming legal tender act it reaffirms gold and silver as constitutional money and removes all state taxation of them sound money advocates in wyoming and arizona legislatures are now pushing bills to provide that a small portion of state assets be held in the monetary metals it s still a major uphill battle to persuade states to protect themselves by holding gold and silver and a number anti gold naysayers in wyoming have already come out of the woodwork to oppose the idea even as they defend the state s devasting losses on investments in third world debt in west virginia legislators will have a chance to vote on the west virginia sound money act it would remove all taxation against gold and silver including sales and use tax property tax individual income tax and corporate income tax the sound money defense league and campaign for liberty are helping to garner public support for these and other sound money initiatives in states across the country well now without further delay let s get right to this week s exclusive interview mike gleason it is my privilege now to welcome axel merk president and chief investment officer of merk investment and author of the book sustainable wealth axel is a well known market commentator and money manager and is a highly sought after guest at financial conferences and on news outlets throughout the world and it s always great to have him back on with us axel it s always a pleasure and thanks for joining us again axel merk my pleasure mike gleason well axel we want to get your thoughts here as the market seemed to be in a bit of flux a few months ago pretty much everyone was looking at three or four rate hikes and for quantitative tightening the reduction of the central banks bond holdings to continue but then the higher rates and prospects of further tightening finally caught up to the equity markets we had three months of sustained selling in stocks late last year and suddenly fed officials are singing a very different tune today they are signaling a much more dovish policy however we ve seen a big rally in stocks it isn t clear what to expect since the equity market seems to be a major factor when it comes to fomc policy tell us what you re expecting here and before we get too much into fed policy moving forward which i ll ask you about in a moment tell us is the selling we saw in the fourth quarter all behind us or is this a bit of a sucker s rally in stocks axel merk sure well i think you re timing is right talking about the expectations we had the end of the third quarter last year about a lot of tightening and to talk market terms there were very substantial positions on short treasuries short bonds betting on higher rates and as investors then looked out towards this year 2019 they repositioned or you can say there was a short squeeze and you had a significant rally in treasuries suddenly this took on a life of its own and the media is never afraid of putting a story into market a move and say oh my god the world is falling apart and sure enough the scare made it all the way to the fed and our mr powell who was walking in his dark room and said alright alright the market once had it a certain way and now it doesn t and then the moment that switched the market then started on rallying a few things here the u s consumer is doing just fine maybe they re going to fall off a cliff we don t see that yet inflation impressions are increasing no matter what everybody is telling you wages are going up not just for the c o level but all the way down the corporate ladder yes there are issues in the rest of the world and yes we are late in the economic cycle and so what all of that means is that higher rates to me automatically translates to more volatility so the high volatility is just natural obviously it may have been exasperated you can blame the algos whatever you want but yes higher volatility is with us historically we don t have a bear market most of the time anyway unless there is a recession and i just said i don t think the recession is imminent now that doesn t mean there isn t a risk of one that doesn t mean volatility isn t high it doesn t mean investments aren t going to diversify but certainly long in the tooth on this expansion and so everybody may well be prudent to kind of trim things back on their risk exposure and that s exactly what s been happening but for the time being i do think this economic cycle is not over yet we are late in it i also happen to think i mentioned inflationary prices the fed is not done tightening we ve gone overboard on that and i think we will likely see two more rate hikes later this year so this back and forth is likely going to continue and it s going to be a bit of a rollercoaster because also i mentioned higher wages that obviously hits corporate earnings corporate america is exposed internationally so yes they ll have some headwinds but in the meantime the consumer seems to be spending happily maybe not on housing but on many other things mike gleason as we re talking here on wednesday afternoon fed chair powell just came out with his statement tell us what you took from that sounds like you re still expecting that we are going to see a couple more rate hikes this year talk about fed policy a bit more axel merk well yeah that was my view and of course my view doesn t matter it matters what mr powell thinks because he is the one who calls the shots right it s not me i just have my thoughts here obviously powell has backpedaled quite substantially and they re two things there is the rate path and then there s this wonderful thing called quantitative tightening you refer to and maybe let s talk about that first remember when yellen talked about paint drying on a wall when they started on this journey basically they decided the fed balance sheet is too large they want to get down but that s about all they decided they didn t make up their mind of where that journey is going to take them in my view they thought that they had until the end of this year or so before they can actually decide how low they want to take the balance sheet so sure enough the market threw a tantrum and powell said okay i get it we got to do something and at the fomc meeting he kind of said we still don t have a clue he didn t use those words but yeah we might consider doing something and that really shows that the fed doesn t have a plan with quantitative tightening they re in so called uncharted territory and there s no academic framework no past of framework other than listening to the markets and that s really dangerous because it s the fed that s supposed to set what the risk free asset is the regulatory risk free asset treasuries and so when the fed just says hey let the market dictate that it creates an interesting unstable back and forth i m not suggesting that wouldn t be better if he market did everything but with the fed in there with a bazooka that kind of creates odd dynamics on the other side of it with regard to raise remember we are still only just about maybe in neutral yet unemployment has been going down and wage prices have been going up at some point that s not going to work anymore and i think that ll have to take the foot further off the accelerator i happen to think that s still on there even though we ve had hiccups in the emerging markets where it matters accessibility to loans financial conditions are just fine in the u s and the whole point of hiking is to tighten financial conditions that hasn t happened unless you re in emerging markets unless you re in some bad areas or from a junk area a little bit but for mainstream america financial conditions have not tightened and that s why i think they will change their view later this year possibly as early as this summer and if you just take what the fed said that s part of what markets rallied that s why metals rallied is because rate hikes are off the table for now and god speed for you people are thinking maybe the economy is going to ease up some point mike gleason yeah happy days are here again i guess at least in the short term one of the reasons it s great to have you on is that we know you re always keeping a close eye on international markets as well there s a lot going on in both europe and china the chinese economy appears to be slowing and any serious recession there will have big impacts for all of us and the political turmoil in europe may also drive markets what do you see as the biggest developing story internationally that will impact investors her in the u s axel axel merk the biggest story may not always be what the biggest impact is you rightfully mentioned china first china is just so much bigger so what happens in china matters china clearly has had a slowdown they have all kinds of incentives along the way to try to boost that they re trying not to actually lower rates so they re actually lowering most of the reserve requirements and have tax cuts they don t like to lower rates because they don t like to mess with the exchange rates too much they like to keep that reasonably stable whatever that means these days with the yuan and so there is some slowing down if they quote unquote panic it means they ll open the floodgates of stimulus but for the time being they re reasonably confident that the stimulus will work its way through the quote unquote bigger story may well be brexit even powell referred to it keep in mind the good old great empire is about less than 3 of world gdp these days so yes brexit matters but it doesn t matter as much as some other things out there similarly italy that was the sideshow mostly a show and sure there are going to be elections in the european union and sure the populists are going to get more votes but none of that really changes the global dynamics obviously what does happen on global scale are the trade discussions the general perception is there are solutions they re not going to happen there tomorrow and if you listen to draghi the head of the european central bank he says oh we downgraded our outlook but it s not that we think that we going to be negative outcomes to these many risk scenarios that s what draghi said he actually thinks there s going to be positive outcomes to most of them but because of the uncertainty the sentiment has been impacted so that s dragging on things and obviously the sentiment is impacted and that s the same danger with the u s consumer of course is that that might actually then induce slower growth all these risks that are out there they re solvable brexit most people believe we re not going to haunt brexit to kick the can down the road heard that term before that s what strong leaders are best at it seems the world will be around tomorrow in the meantime american consumers are happily spending mike gleason let s get your thoughts on what all of this might mean for precious metals can you give us a quick summary of what you re expecting in the metals market as we move through the year axel merk yes sure on gold which is kind of the easiest because of the least industrial influence that s difficult enough to prognosticate about you ve got these two forces on the one end i see rising inflationary pressures that s a positive i see at some point rates are going to go down as a discounting mechanism the market seems to be giving a boost here to precious metals now with that said i do think rates will move higher later this year the main buyer in gold that i see these days is one that buys for diversification when you have higher volatility cash flow gets discounted more that means the risk assets stock market in particular is under pressure potentially but gold historically does well when the stock market doesn t do well there are exceptions like the early 80 s bear market and that s when real interest rates went up to through the roof but it is for diversification because gold is really one of the easiest diversifiers i say easier rather than best necessarily because it has the zero correlation to stocks and it s far easier to do than some long short strategy that gives you an uncorrelated return otherwise if you go to other metals and other commodities of course the dynamics are far more complex that s why i really try to stick to gold especially on a brief analysis mike gleason my guest last week talked about how gold is hitting all time highs in many different currencies talk about the currency side of things the dollar what you re expecting there because obviously gold is trading in reverse correlation to the dollar in many situations not always but in many situations give us your thoughts there axel merk well on the day we re talking the dollar index is plunging other currencies are rising versus the dollar because of this very dovish commentary and statement by the fed and the question really is and the world was divided on that and that s great because we make the market where s it going to be heading from here we ve had years of dollar going up the u s was the cleanest of the dirty shirts and what not and it increasingly appears that the market is looking forward to the next easing cycle whereas the other parts of the world and i include the eurozone here they re still thinking we re on the hiking cycle we have sweden who also negative rates for example other than the eurozone they hiked rates draghi is retiring at the end of this year out of the ecb i happen to think that as both yellen and bernanke were more hawkish towards the end of their terms so will draghi be and draghi is actually quite positive in a medium term the successor to draghi cannot be as dovish in my view as draghi is and then i happen to think the glass is half full on some of these inflation metrics on that note by the way we have low oil prices at the end of last year if oil prices are not depressed any of this year the year over year effects will show quite significant headline inflation in the eurozone by the way headline inflation is the mandate in the u s it s core inflation but if you look at longer term inflation expectations they happen to be very correlated to the price of oil it may not make much sense because obviously in the long run the price of oil of today doesn t really matter but as those changes are filtering through i think inflation expectations will rise wage prices will lead to higher wages inflation expectations so all of that will get other leaders around also to be a tad more hawkish and it appears to be that is in favor of world currencies versus the dollar that just had such a great ride for several years and so it appears to me that this long bull run in the dollar might be over mike gleason well as we begin to wrap up her axel give us any final thoughts that you may have for us today or maybe touch on anything else that you may be focusing on that perhaps we didn t get to already and then ultimately what kind of year do you envision 2019 is going to be for investors expand on any or all of that as we begin to close please axel merk well the short of it is higher volatility higher rates warrant higher volatility and at the risk if using a technical term that means higher dispersion of risk let me expand on that just briefly when you have quantitative easing the perceived risk was taken out of the market so you invested in junk barns and it was quote unquote not risky because the fed took care of it now fear is back and the good news of that is that it matters where you put your money that means active management will come back that means the making a choice is actually going to prove you re right or wrong whereas before you just bought the index and everything was great that doesn t mean that suddenly all the money will go back to active managers i think that s going to be a long process but i would not be surprised of this year active managers are going to significantly outperform the industry simply because of greater opportunities there with the greater volatility reference the sharks but i just look at interest rates because when interest rates are higher there will be more opportunities i think for the active manager mike gleason well we ll leave it there thanks as always axel we certainly appreciate your getting your very studied insights and greatly appreciate your time coming on with us once again now before we let you go like we always do please tell folks a little bit

our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks in europe our panel business is set for another great year as osb demand in our key markets continues to increase and our inverness scotland mill will achieve a step change in production now that the new finishing end is complete in north america the pace of us housing growth decelerated in the second half of the year as homebuyers adjusted to higher home prices and mortgage interest rates combined with the usual seasonal slowdown this negatively impacted our fourth quarter results and this weakness has carried over into january the fundamentals underlying new home construction remain supportive and we expect a pick up in osb demand as the spring building season approaches with a strong balance sheet and a diversification strategy that is growing non traditional end uses for osb to help cushion against volatility in housing demand we believe norbord is well positioned for 2019 for the full year 2018

operating capacity north american benchmark osb prices remained well above historical averages for most of 2018 benchmark osb prices increased steadily in the first half of the year due to increased

rate of 0 78 in 2018 in line with 2017 in addition two mills completed the year injury free north american osb shipments for the fourth quarter were 5 lower than the third quarter due to seasonality of demand and timing of annual maintenance and other downtime shipments were 3 higher than the same quarter last year and 7 higher for the full year due to the huguley alabama restart in the fourth quarter of 2017 norbord s specialty sales volume including industrial applications and exports continued to increase and represents more than 25 of the company s 7 higher north american osb sales volume annual production records were achieved at five of the company s north american osb mills for the full year norbord s operating osb mills produced at 95 of capacity compared to 96 in 2017 excluding the curtailed chambord quebec mill and the portion of 2017 that the huguley alabama mill was curtailed norbord s full year north american osb cash production costs per unit before mill profit share increased 4 versus 2017 due to higher raw material prices and higher maintenance related costs in europe shipments decreased by 2 versus the prior year due to changes in product mix all european panel mills ran on full production schedules during the year excluding maintenance and holiday shutdowns producing at 88 of capacity in 2018 compared to 99 in 2017 capacity utilization decreased due to the restatement of annual production capacity to reflect the new continuous press line at the inverness scotland osb mill that was substantially completed in the fourth quarter of 2017 production from the expanded inverness mill is expected to increase in 2019 now that the new finishing line installation is complete and commissioning is underway annual production records were achieved at two of the company s european mills for 2018 margin improvement program mip gains from a richer product mix and improved productivity were offset by higher maintenance related costs raw material usages and cost associated with executing on strategic capital and sales growth initiatives mip gains are measured relative to the prior year at constant prices and exchange rates improved productivity and lower raw material usage at the restarted huguley alabama and expanded inverness scotland mills were excluded from the 2018 mip calculation these mills are expected to generate mip gains in 2019 capital investments totaled 204 million 205 including intangible assets in 2018 including the inverness scotland finishing line chambord quebec rebuild grande prairie alberta debottlenecking project and several productivity improvement and cost reduction projects across the company s mills included in the 2018 capital investments is 12 million for the installation of a new finishing end at the modernized and expanded inverness scotland mill which was completed during the fourth quarter of 2018 a total of 146 million was invested in the project the board of directors approved a 46 million 35 million second phase investment to further expand capacity at the inverness scotland mill by 225 mmsf 3 8 inch basis 200 000 cubic metres through the addition of a second wood room and dryer this project is expected to take two years to complete and is consistent with the company s strategy of growing its european osb capacity to serve rapid consumption growth in its key markets also included in the 2018 capital investments is 44 million for the grande prairie alberta debottlenecking project the grande prairie mill is one of the largest single line osb facilities in the world but the mill was bottlenecked in the areas before the forming line and press the company completed a project to redeploy the wood handling heat energy and drying equipment from the unfinished and unused second production line to debottleneck the existing first line and support growing demand from key customers the project was completed in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the mill s production capacity increased by 100 mmsf 3 8 inch basis further savings are expected to be realized through reduced wood and natural gas usage a total of 68 million was invested in the project at the chambord quebec mill rebuild project 27 million of the 71 million budget was invested in 2018 norbord believes north american osb demand will continue to grow in order to support this anticipated growth norbord is rebuilding and preparing the chambord quebec mill for an eventual restart the company has not yet made a restart decision however and will only do so when it is sufficiently clear that customers require more product this project involves replacing the dryers and investing in the wood handling and finishing areas to debottleneck the mill s manufacturing process and reduce manufacturing costs as well as upgrades in process and personal safety systems electrical systems and environmental equipment to bring the mill up to current standards after a decade of curtailment the mill s stated capacity has been increased by 80 mmsf 3 8 inch basis norbord s 2019 capital expenditure budget is approximately 150 million for projects focused on reducing manufacturing costs across the mills as well as a portion of the chambord quebec mill rebuild and inverness scotland phase 2 projects it also includes investments to support the company s strategy to increase the production of specialty products for industrial applications and exports operating working capital decreased by 39 million during the year to 88 million at year end due to lower accounts receivable

2019 a c 0 20 per common share or 33 decrease versus the prior quarter s level norbord believes that the longer term fundamentals underlying osb demand remain supportive the variable dividend decrease reflects the weaker than expected north american benchmark osb prices in the fourth quarter of 2018 as well as the 140 million of capital allocated to common share repurchases during the last three months any dividends reinvested on march 21 2019 under the company s dividend reinvestment plan will be used by the transfer agent to purchase common shares on the open market norbord s dividends are

under this bid at a cost of 102 million in december 2018 the company entered into an automatic share purchase plan aspp in order to facilitate the repurchase of its common shares under its ncib during the regularly scheduled quarterly trading blackout period subsequent to year end the company repurchased an additional 1 4 million shares under the aspp and norbord has now exhausted the current ncib limit with a total of 5 2 million shares purchased for 140 million norbord believed that the market price of its common shares was attractive as they were trading significantly below replacement cost and management s view of intrinsic value and that the purchase of these common shares was an appropriate use of norbord s funds in light of potential benefits to remaining shareholders developments at

discussion and analysis dated january 31 2019 for a quantitative reconciliation of adjusted ebitda and adjusted earnings to earnings the most directly comparable ifrs measure february 1 2019 to our shareholders 2018 was the best financial year in norbord s history our company delivered a record 724 million of adjusted ebitda as we produced and shipped more product from our mills and north american osb prices remained well above historical trends for much of the year our european business had an excellent year more than doubling its ebitda contribution to 86 million our success enabled us to return more than half a billion dollars to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks these results were underpinned by solid operational performance across the company as seven of our mills set annual production records most importantly our employees continued to work safely and achieved an osha recordable injury rate of 0 78 we are encouraged that our employees continue to prioritize safety even as we invested more than 200 million in productivity and cost reduction initiatives at our mills these investments will also support our ongoing efforts to expand our specialty product sales the exceptional operating cash flow we generated last year preserved our strong balance sheet and we ended the year with 490 million of liquidity including more than 125 million in cash while 2018 was a banner year for norbord us housing sentiment turned negative in the fall and this affected stock market perceptions of companies in our industry in november december and january we saw this as a compelling opportunity to buy back 5 2 million of our shares at prices which we believe are significantly below their intrinsic value a strategic use of our capital to enhance shareholder value our perspective on the markets in 2018 we experienced significant volatility in north american osb prices that is not unusual in our industry let me put this recent market volatility in context the first half of 2018 saw an extraordinary increase in benchmark osb prices due to a combination of strong demand growth and weather related logistics issues which constrained supply particularly in the west the weather improved and logistics issues were resolved in time for the spring homebuilding season but by the fall the pace of us housing growth began to slow as home buyers were faced with higher home prices and rising mortgage interest rates as the year drew to a close and we entered the seasonally slowest time of year particularly wet weather in the us south further constrained homebuilding activity and osb demand this market volatility was reflected in our 2018 financial results with well above average adjusted ebitda in the first three quarters of the year followed by below average results in the fourth quarter which continued into january we continue to share the view of housing experts that the industry is experiencing a temporary pause rather than a directional shift the underlying market fundamentals remain supportive with low unemployment and solid wage growth underpinning consumer confidence and household formation finally moving back above the long term average us housing starts continue to grow albeit at a modest pace with the experts current forecast averaging 1 28 million starts for 2019 demand for lower cost entry level homes remains particularly strong though we believe home builders need time to adapt their offerings to meet this need mortgage interest rates increased by more than 1 from just under 4 to approximately 5 during 2018 but have since moderated down about half a percent outside of housing we see continued solid growth in other osb end uses 83 of our incremental 2018 volumes were specialty and non commodity products we have been investing to support the production and sale of more osb for non traditional end uses and we believe this will support further north american osb demand growth the picture in europe is even more favourable strong demand growth driven by increasing substitution for imported panels contributed to our outstanding european results in 2018 and we expect this trend to continue the new finishing end at our inverness scotland osb mill is now complete and will unlock the capacity of the modernized and expanded press line further our board has approved an incremental 35 million investment at inverness to add a second stranding and drying line to the mill the expanded mill layout was predisposed for this next phase of growth which will allow us to continue steadily increasing our production volume in each of the next five years to support our european customers growing needs priorities for 2019 we will continue to manage the business by closely aligning to the needs of our customers we took more than 130 mill days of downtime during the fourth quarter of 2018 and will continue to produce only what we can sell for 2019 we have budgeted approximately 150 million for ongoing investments in our mills to reduce manufacturing costs and ensure we can support growth in our specialty product sales the budget includes a portion of the inverness phase 2 investment we will also continue to prepare our chambord quebec mill for an eventual restart though no decision has been made about the timing work on the long lead time items is well underway and similar to our approach at huguley alabama we will continue to manage the pace of the rebuild based on market conditions norbord has a track record of superior returns on invested capital versus our peers and we have returned over 1 5 billion in cash to our shareholders over the past 15 years through both dividends and share buybacks we remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders and our variable dividend policy gives us the flexibility to prudently balance capital allocation decisions with the inherent cyclicality in our business with record annual earnings strong operational and sales performance and excellent customer relationships we continue to be a clear leader in the osb industry our diversification strategy is designed to mitigate volatility and deliver value even in times of market uncertainty combined with our strong balance sheet and liquidity we believe norbord is well positioned for the year ahead we believe it is an excellent time to be

jan 31 2019 alasdair macleod in my last article i used a proven accounting identity to show that the end result of president trump s trade tariffs would be to increase the trade deficit assuming there is no change in the savings rate the savings rate is important because if it does not change then the budget deficit must be financed by any combination of three variables monetary inflation the expansion of bank credit or capital inflows this is captured in that equation where the trade balance is the balance of payments thereby including capital flows as well as goods and services imports exports investment savings government spending taxes it assumes the economy is working normally and as we shall see there is no major economic contraction or systemic crisis this article explores the implications of the relationship between the twin deficits in the context of the current situation for the united states which may or may not be on the edge of a significant economic retrenchment it looks at the detail of how trade tariffs act on the economy at the current stage of its credit cycle and the implications for the economic outlook and for monetary policy it examines the problem through the lens of sound economic theory but empirical evidence is invoked as well for confirmation the empirical evidence looking at history we find that the effect of tariff increases has depended on the stage of the credit cycle the best clearest examples are the tariffs introduced after the first world war the fordney mccumber tariffs of 1922 early in the credit cycle and the smoot hawley tariff act of 1930 at the end of it on the face of it fordney mccumber had little effect while smoot hawley it is generally agreed had a significant effect of course this is in the context of a us centric viewpoint the fordney mccumber tariffs were introduced early in the us s credit cycle at that time the us economy still had the legacy of wartime production whereby imported goods and agricultural products were minimal having been virtually eliminated by wartime economic planning the impact of tariffs on the us s domestic economy was therefore barely relevant to the economic situation consequently unlike the european economies which had been ravaged by war us agricultural and industrial production were both higher in 1920 than they had been in 1913 the year before the outbreak of war the effect on europe was another matter european economies found themselves needing dollars to pay reparations in germany s case and to repay war debt in the case of the allies us tariffs made it extremely difficult for the europeans to earn those dollars a number of european economies collapsed into hyperinflation as governments continued the wartime practice of money printing to finance themselves and service wartime obligations another factor affecting america was the collapse of agricultural prices from inflated wartime levels by 1921 wheat had collapsed from 2 58 a bushel to 92 cents and hogs from 19 cents per pound to under 7 cents tariffs did not help farmers because at that time they depended on export markets to a significant degree and when other countries introduced or increased their tariffs against agricultural products as a response to us tariffs they proved to be wholly counterproductive for us farmers of course tariffs were not the sole problem for america s farmers rapid mechanisation increased canada s wheat yields the argentine was increasing beef production and cuba exporting large quantities of sugar consumers were benefiting from catastrophically lower prices despite tariffs other than the pain faced by producers pain which in free markets is only alleviated by redeploying economic resources away from overcapacity in agriculture the overall economic effect of the fordney mccumber tariffs on america was not significant smoot hawley was different congress voted in favour of it on 31 october 1929 and the stockmarket clearly saw it coming the wall street crash commenced on black thursday 24 october when the market fell 11 that day before recovering most of the fall black monday followed when the market fell 13 by the close on tuesday 29 october the market had lost over 34 in just fifteen calendar days at today s stock prices that would be a loss of over 8 000 dow points the stockmarket continued its fall to a low on 13 november of 198 7 on the dow and after rallying for six months entered a pernicious and continual bear market to a final low of 41 22 on 8 july 1932 it is always a mistake to attribute a market failure to a single cause the only certainty was the market fell however the importance of the smoot hawley vote to the stockmarket is often missed by economic historians the difference between late 1929 and today perhaps is that congress voting for it then was a definite event whereas trump s tariffs are progressing as a fluid mixture of bluff and fact another key difference was the dollar s gold exchange standard of 20 67 to the ounce so long as the exchange rate was defended a slump would certainly lead more dramatically to widespread bankruptcies markets therefore had to discount the enhanced risks from trade protectionism to the economy more immediately compared with today s fiat currency economy when it is assumed future investment risk will be ameliorated by monetary expansion pursuing this line of thought is unlikely to lead us to a definite conclusion a more fruitful approach is to look at the effect of tariffs and trade protectionism in the context of the credit cycle we have established from our examination of the 1921 fordney mccumber tariffs that early in the credit cycle trade protectionism had a limited impact on financial markets and the economy it stands to reason that an economy floating on a tide of money and credit is in a different position and more vulnerable to disruption from upsetting events such as the introduction of tariffs adverse changes in trade policy at any time are an upset to market assumptions and it is clear from both smoot hawley and common sense that trump s trade interventions today are a serious spanner in the works of highly valued markets that is tantamount at the minimum to a claim that trump has upset the speculators this is evidently the case but to understand why trump s trade protectionism should be taken more seriously we need to examine in greater detail the flows implied in the equation at the beginning of this article linking the two deficits why external trade has become central to the whole us economy since the oil shocks of the early 1970s the us has relied on foreign holders of dollars to accumulate us treasuries issued to finance budget deficits that recycling of dollars earned by foreigners selling more things to america than america sells to foreigners has through trade imbalances allowed the us government to run mounting budget deficits the americans have become used to foreigners having no credible alternative to reinvesting their accumulating dollars however we can now see that the dollar hegemony behind this proposition is being eroded by china and russia acting as the powers which are increasingly directing asian trade flows clearly as their determination to do away with dollars bears fruit instead of currently held dollars remaining invested they will be surplus to trade requirements and sold so far they have been bought by other foreigners which is why we see china s holdings of us treasuries decline while those of other foreigners increase and why russia s disposal of cash dollars earned through energy sales has little apparent effect on the exchanges meanwhile the us government has managed to fund itself without a critical increase in borrowing costs this cannot continue ad infinitum because relative to the volumes of trade concerned and the size of the us economy there are already large quantities of dollar balances and dollar investments accumulated in foreign hands which on the last available figures at over 22tn exceed us gdp of around 20tn the failure of american trade policy is to not recognise the consequences of upsetting what has become a very delicate balance in capital flows by imposing aggressively protectionist policies the trump presidency has set back cross border trade significantly reducing the future availability of dollars from non domestic sources to fund the budget deficit furthermore us efforts to restrict inward commercial investment by china muddy these waters further on these grounds alone we can see that attempts to restrict chinese imports are cutting off a vital source of future finance for the us government yet the accounting identity that explains the twin deficit phenomenon tells us in the absence of an increase in the savings rate the trade deficit will continue furthermore due to tax cuts the budget deficit is still increasing at this late stage of the credit cycle and an emerging slowdown in the rate of gdp growth tells us it will increase even more rapidly than currently forecast therefore american protectionist policies risk destabilising the market for us treasuries which have increasingly relied on foreign buyers recycling their surplus dollars the question then arises as to what happens if a contraction in international trade develops out of the current slowdown the ending of the dollar s hegemony the dollar is likely to face a developing problem it is already becoming evident that surplus dollars arising from the slowdown in international trade are shifting out of the dollar into other currencies and gold the following chart of the dollar s trade weighted index illustrates the position how contacting trade contracts bank credit the dollar s bear market appears to be resuming after completing an eight month counter trend consolidation given record levels of foreign ownership of dollars and dollar investments further declines in the dollar could easily trigger currency liquidation making it impossible for the us government to continue to fund budget deficits from foreign investors it appears this is a periodic problem first encountered when the dollar devalued in 1934 and then in the 1960s when the gold pool failed this time with the dollar being unbacked by gold there is little to stop the dollar s exchange rate falling as cross border capital is repatriated to their currencies of origin or into gold a secondary effect of today s trade policies has been to interrupt the fed s monetary normalisation leading to what the fed hopes is just a temporary pause in the process this assumes the banks are not going to become more risk averse and is where a contraction in international trade could disrupt the expansion of bank credit upon which financial markets in particular have become so reliant how this might occur is an important question that should be addressed to understand the mechanisms of how changes in the trade balance can affect the level of bank credit we must first explain why in the absence of a change in savings a budget imbalance leads to a similar trade imbalance let us assume a government is running a budget deficit the deficit represents excess spending over tax and other incidental income and requires to be financed if the government issues bonds the extent to which they are subscribed to by members of the public their pension funds and insurance policies is not inflationary financing merely diverting capital resources from other investments if the government issues bonds that are subscribed to by banks then they are financed through the expansion of bank credit and unless that credit is withdrawn from other bank customers it is inflationary lastly the deficit may be financed by the central bank directly or indirectly buying government bonds and bills this is also inflationary as the government spends the proceeds of these bond issues to the extent they are not financed by private sector savings they put extra currency into circulation this extra currency ends up mostly in the hands of consumers through welfare payments as well as earnings and payments by the government for goods and services but given there is a degree of inelasticity between the supply of extra goods and services and the inflation fuelled demand for them it takes time for markets to respond to the inflationary demand consequently imported goods and services rise to fill in the gap the more so because they are unaffected at least initially by price pressures arising from the monetary inflation in effect it is the expansion of money and credit that emanates from covering a budget deficit assuming no change in total savings that leads to a trade deficit what happens to the exchange rate depends on whether the currency proceeds arising from imports are reinvested or simply sold on the foreign exchanges balance of payments figures are designed to capture the net position between trade and capital flows and it is these figures that are used in the deficit relationship all this assumes a reasonable degree of economic stability that is to say trade continues without severe disruption it is not the case at the end of a long credit cycle when capital misallocation in the private sector has become so great that sooner or later market forces emerge to trigger a correction it is at that point obstacles to balance of payment flows are likely to have the greatest impact setting off and intensifying an unwinding of the accumulated distortions in the domestic economy this was the reason the events following the passing of smoot hawley were so different from those following fordney mccumber the approval of key provisions in smoot hawley by congress in october 1929 crashed wall street in the preceding fortnight and when president hoover signed it into law the following june not only did wall street continue to fall for a further two years but retaliatory action from other nations ensured the ensuing global economic disaster worsened and america s exports in turn suffered badly we are at the same point in the credit cycle which has run for a similar time as that of the 1920s and we have an analogous rise in american protectionism complacency is common to both irving fisher the renowned american economist reflected the super optimism before the crash of 1929 when he stated the stock market had reached a permanently high plateau even keynes and winston churchill were taken in and lost money they were far from being alone and the prospect of a substantial fall in stocks today is widely assumed to be unjustified scaremongering when he was wiser after the event fisher went on to define the vicious relationship between falling collateral values and contracting bank credit insofar as today s economists claim it was the cause of the depression s severity they are incorrect the cause was the monetary and speculative excesses that had built up before the crash if anything the imbalances and misallocation of capital today should be a far greater concern than they were in 1929 we know that a feature of the post smoot hawley events was the unwinding of malinvestments and the severe contraction of outstanding bank credit that accompanied it thousands of banks went under a repeat of these events today is wholly unexpected with even the bears thinking the economy can be rescued by just lowering interest rates and reverting to quantitative easing however a proper and thorough examination of the risks today reveals that a slowdown triggered by trade protectionism will be almost impossible to prevent escalating into a full blown slump the central question in any analysis of future economic and monetary prospects has to be what will happen to the twin deficits we know as surely as the sun will rise tomorrow and every day thereafter that as an economy moves from a stockmarket fall towards a slump budget deficits will rise inexorably particularly in the welfare states yet with demand collapsing in the private sector trade deficits cannot increase in lock step with budget deficits the only way the national accounts can be balanced in a fiat money economy is for there to be an offsetting contraction in bank obligations to the private sector a contraction of bank credit in this event will be impossible to stop and it matters not how well capitalised a bank is for regulatory purposes fractional reserve gearing will ensure that widespread bank insolvencies and bankruptcies ensue it seems increasingly likely that spurred on by falling stockmarkets and dollar weakness a foreign liquidation of an overhang of dollar cash and assets will follow if so the dollar will fall and in accordance with irving fisher s analysis a self feeding implosion of private sector bank lending will then take place whether other currencies fall with the dollar is immaterial the fall will be measured in its purchasing power and credibility measured in gold the difference from the experience of the events that led into the great depression is today s money is not backed by gold inflationists believe that the problems of the 1930s could have been solved if the gold standard had been abandoned or if excess gold reserves had been monetised they argue that similar conditions today can be avoided by allowing the currency to weaken and therefore to prevent prices from sliding monetary policy today is and surely will continue to be guided by these inflationist assumptions central banks led by the fed the ecb bank of japan and bank of england will coordinate aggressive money expansion in a vain attempt to prevent a slump developing and while the quantity of outstanding bank credit contracts it will be more than made up for by the expansion of central bank money today s central bankers are unquestionably on the same course set by rudolf havenstein president of the reichsbank during germany s hyperinflation of 1920 23 havenstein was imbued in a system that financed itself predominantly through money printing today s central bankers are not much different believing that inflation of the money quantity must be a continuing and if necessary accelerating process conclusion pre keynesian economic theory refined by the austrian school identified the credit cycle as the primary cause of periodic booms and busts to this we can add a sporadic cycle of trade protectionism which at the wrong moment can have a devastating effect while it is impossible to satisfactorily link cause and effect there is little doubt that it was the combination of smoot hawley tariffs and the end of an inflation fuelled boom that devasted the world economy in the 1930s this article has shown that similar conditions exist today we must hope that they don t repeat but it would be foolish to ignore the possibility the obvious difference is currencies are now unbacked giving governments an initial policy choice they can let commercial banks go bust as happened in large numbers in the 1930s and cut government spending to preserve a degree of currency stability or they can trash their currencies in an attempt to protect jobs and the state we

by michael hudson a research professor of economics at university of missouri kansas city and a research associate at the levy economics institute of bard college his latest book is and forgive them their debts lending foreclosure and redemption from bronze age finance to the jubilee year jointly posted with hudson s website the end of america s unchallenged global economic dominance has arrived sooner than expected thanks to the very same neocons who gave the world the iraq syria and the dirty wars in latin america just as the vietnam war drove the united states off gold by 1971 its sponsorship and funding of violent regime change wars against venezuela and syria and threatening other countries with sanctions if they do not join this crusade is now driving european and other nations to create their alternative financial institutions this break has been building for quite some time and was bound to occur but who would have thought that donald trump would become the catalytic agent no left wing party no socialist anarchist or foreign nationalist leader anywhere in the world could have achieved what he is doing to break up the american empire the deep state is reacting with shock at how this right wing real estate grifter has been able to drive other countries to defend themselves by dismantling the u s centered world order to rub it in he is using bush and reagan era neocon arsonists john bolton and now elliott abrams to fan the flames in venezuela it is almost like a black political comedy the world of international diplomacy is being turned inside out a world where there is no longer even a pretense that we might adhere to international norms let alone laws or treaties the neocons who trump has appointed are accomplishing what seemed unthinkable not long ago driving china and russia together the great nightmare of henry kissinger and zbigniew brzezinski they also are driving germany and other european countries into the eurasian orbit the heartland nightmare of halford mackinder a century ago the root cause is clear after the crescendo of pretenses and deceptions over iraq libya and syria along with our absolution of the lawless regime of saudi arabia foreign political leaders are coming to recognize what world wide public opinion polls reported even before the iraq iran contra boys turned their attention to the world s largest oil reserves in venezuela the united states is now the greatest threat to peace on the planet calling the u s coup being sponsored in venezuela a defense of democracy reveals the doublethink underlying u s foreign policy it defines democracy to mean supporting u s foreign policy pursuing neoliberal privatization of public infrastructure dismantling government regulation and following the direction of u s dominated global institutions from the imf and world bank to nato for decades the resulting foreign wars domestic austerity programs and military interventions have brought more violence not democracy in the devil s dictionary that u s diplomats are taught to use as their elements of style guidelines for doublethink a democratic country is one that follows u s leadership and opens its economy to u s investment and imf and world bank sponsored privatization the ukraine is deemed democratic along with saudi arabia israel and other countries that act as u s financial and military protectorates and are willing to treat america s enemies are theirs too a point had to come where this policy collided with the self interest of other nations finally breaking through the public relations rhetoric of empire other countries are proceeding to de dollarize and replace what u s diplomacy calls internationalism meaning u s nationalism imposed on the rest of the world with their own national self interest this trajectory could be seen 50 years ago i described it in super imperialism and global fracture it had to happen but nobody thought that the end would come in quite the way that is happening history has turned into comedy or at least irony as its dialectical path unfolds for the past half century u s strategists the state department and national endowment for democracy ned worried that opposition to u s financial imperialism would come from left wing parties it therefore spent enormous resources manipulating parties that called themselves socialist tony blair s british labour party france s socialist party germany s social democrats etc to adopt neoliberal policies that were the diametric opposite to what social democracy meant a century ago but u s political planners and great wurlitzer organists neglected the right wing imagining that it would instinctively support u s thuggishness the reality is that right wing parties want to get elected and a populist nationalism is today s road to election victory in europe and other countries just as it was for donald trump in 2016 trump s agenda may really be to break up the american empire using the old uncle sucker isolationist rhetoric of half a century ago he certainly is going for the empire s most vital organs but it he a witting anti american agent he might as well be but it would be a false mental leap to use quo bono to assume that he is a witting agent after all if no u s contractor supplier labor union or bank will deal with him would vladimir putin china or iran be any more naïve perhaps the problem had to erupt as a result of the inner dynamics of u s sponsored globalism becoming impossible to impose when the result is financial austerity waves of population flight from u s sponsored wars and most of all u s refusal to adhere to the rules and international laws that it itself sponsored seventy years ago in the wake of world war ii dismantling international law and its courts any international system of control requires the rule of law it may be a morally lawless exercise of ruthless power imposing predatory exploitation but it is still the law and it needs courts to apply it backed by police power to enforce it and punish violators here s the first legal contradiction in u s global diplomacy the united states always has resisted letting any other country have any voice in u s domestic policies law making or diplomacy that is what makes america the exceptional nation but for seventy years its diplomats have pretended that its superior judgment promoted a peaceful world as the roman empire claimed to be which let other countries share in prosperity and rising living standards at the united nations u s diplomats insisted on veto power at the world bank and imf they also made sure that their equity share was large enough to give them veto power over any loan or other policy without such power the united states would not join any international organization yet at the same time it depicted its nationalism as protecting globalization and internationalism it was all a euphemism for what really was unilateral u s decision making inevitably u s nationalism had to break up the mirage of one world internationalism and with it any thought of an international court without veto power over the judges the u s never accepted the authority of any court in particular the united nations international court in the hague recently that court undertook an investigation into u s war crimes in afghanistan from its torture policies to bombing of civilian targets such as hospitals weddings and infrastructure that investigation ultimately found a reasonable basis to believe that war crimes and crimes against humanity donald trump s national security adviser john bolton erupted in fury warning in september that the united states will use any means necessary to protect our citizens and those of our allies from unjust prosecution by this illegitimate court adding that the un international court must not be so bold as to investigate israel or other u s allies that prompted a senior judge christoph flügge from germany to resign in protest indeed bolton told the court to keep out of any affairs involving the united states promising to ban the court s judges and prosecutors from entering the united states as bolton spelled out the u s threat we will sanction their funds in the u s financial system and we will prosecute them in the u s criminal system we will not cooperate with the icc we will provide no assistance to the icc we will not join the icc we will let the icc die on its own after all for all intents and purposes the icc is already dead to us what this meant the german judge spelled out was that if these judges ever interfere in the domestic concerns of the u s or investigate an american citizen said the american government would do all it could to ensure that these judges would no longer be allowed to travel to the united states and that they would perhaps even be criminally prosecuted the original inspiration of the court to use the nuremburg laws that were applied against german nazis to bring similar prosecution against any country or officials found guilty of committing war crimes had already fallen into disuse with the failure to indict the authors of the chilean coup iran contra or the u s invasion of iraq for war crimes dismantling dollar hegemony from the imf to swift of all areas of global power politics today international finance and foreign investment have become the key flashpoint international monetary reserves were supposed to be the most sacrosanct and international debt enforcement closely associated central banks have long held their gold and other monetary reserves in the united states and london back in 1945 this seemed reasonable because the new york federal reserve bank in whose basement foreign central bank gold was kept was militarily safe and because the london gold pool was the vehicle by which the u s treasury kept the dollar as good as gold at 35 an ounce foreign reserves over and above gold were kept in the form of u s treasury securities to be bought and sold on the new york and london foreign exchange markets to stabilize exchange rates most foreign loans to governments were denominated in u s dollars so wall street banks were normally name as paying agents that was the case with iran under the shah whom the united states had installed after sponsoring the 1953 coup against mohammed mosaddegh when he sought to nationalize anglo iranian oil now british petroleum or at least tax it after the shah was overthrown the khomeini regime asked its paying agent the chase manhattan bank to use its deposits to pay its bondholders at the direction of the u s government chase refused to do so u s courts then declared iran to be in default and froze all its assets in the united states and anywhere else they were able this showed that international finance was an arm of the u s state department and pentagon but that was a generation ago and only recently did foreign countries begin to feel queasy about leaving their gold holdings in the united states where they might be grabbed at will to punish any country that might act in ways that u s diplomacy found offensive so last year germany finally got up the courage to ask that some of its gold be flown back to germany u s officials pretended to feel shocked at the insult that it might do to a civilized christian country what it had done to iran and germany agreed to slow down the transfer but then came venezuela desperate to spend its gold reserves to provide imports for its economy devastated by u s sanctions a crisis that u s diplomats blame on socialism not on u s political attempts to make the economy scream as nixon officials said of chile under salvador allende venezuela directed the bank of england to transfer some of its 11 billion in gold held in its vaults and those of other central banks in december 2018 this was just like a bank depositor would expect a bank to pay a check that the depositor had written england refused to honor the official request following the direction of bolton and u s secretary of state michael pompeo as bloomberg reported the u s officials are trying to steer venezuela s overseas assets to guaido to help bolster his chances of effectively taking control of the government the 1 2 billion of gold is a big chunk of the 8 billion in foreign reserves held by the venezuelan central bank turkey seemed to be a likely destination prompting bolton and pompeo to warn it to desist from helping venezuela threatening sanctions against it or any other country helping venezuela cope with its economic crisis as for the bank of england and other european countries the bloomberg report concluded central bank officials in caracas have been ordered to no longer try contacting the bank of england these central bankers have been told that bank of england staffers will not respond to them this led to rumors that venezuela was selling 20 tons of gold via a russian boeing 777 some 840 million the money probably would have ended up paying russian and chinese bondholders as well as buying food to relieve the local famine russia denied this report but reuters has confirmed is that venezuela has sold 3 tons of a planned 29 tones of gold to the united arab emirates with another 15 tones are to be shipped on friday february 1 the u s senate s batista cuban hardliner rubio accused this of being theft as if feeding the people to alleviate the u s sponsored crisis was a crime against u s diplomatic leverage if there is any country that u s diplomats hate more than a recalcitrant latin american country it is iran president trump s breaking of the 2015 nuclear agreements negotiated by european and obama administration diplomats has escalated to the point of threatening germany and other european countries with punitive sanctions if they do not also break the agreements they have signed coming on top of u s opposition to german and other european importing of russian gas the u s threat finally prompted europe to find a way to defend itself imperial threats are no longer military no country including russia or china can mount a military invasion of another major country since the vietnam era the only kind of war a democratically elected country can wage is atomic or at least heavy bombing such as the united states has inflicted on iraq libya and syria but now cyber warfare has become a way of pulling out the connections of any economy and the major cyber connections are financial money transfer ones headed by swift the acronym for the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication which is centered in belgium russia and china have already moved to create a shadow bank transfer system in case the united states unplugs them from swift but now european countries have come to realize that threats by bolton and pompeo may lead to heavy fines and asset grabs if they seek to continue trading with iran as called for in the treaties they have negotiated on january 31 the dam broke with the announcement that europe had created its own bypass payments system for use with iran and other countries targeted by u s diplomats germany france and even the u s poodle britain joined to create instex instrument in support of trade exchanges the promise is that this will be used only for humanitarian aid to save iran from a u s sponsored venezuela type devastation but in view of increasingly passionate u s opposition to the nord stream pipeline to carry russian gas this alternative bank clearing system will be ready and able to become operative if the united states tries to direct a sanctions attack on europe i have just returned from germany and seen a remarkable split between that nation s industrialists and their political leadership for years major companies have seen russia as a natural market a complementary economy needing to modernize its manufacturing and able to supply europe with natural gas and other raw materials america s new cold war stance is trying to block this commercial complementarity warning europe against dependence on low price russian gas it has offered to sell high priced lng from the united states via port facilities that do not yet exist in anywhere near the volume required president trump also is insisting that nato members spend a full 2 percent of their gdp on arms preferably bought from the united states not from german or french merchants of death the u s overplaying its position is leading to the mackinder kissinger brzezinski eurasian nightmare that i mentioned above in addition to driving russia and china together u s diplomacy is adding europe to the heartland independent of u s ability to bully into the state of dependency toward which american diplomacy has aimed to achieve since 1945 the world bank for instance traditionally has been headed by a u s secretary of defense its steady policy since its inception is to provide loans for countries to devote their land to export crops instead of giving priority to feeding themselves that is why its loans are only in foreign currency not in the domestic currency needed to provide price supports and agricultural extension services such as have made u s agriculture so productive by following u s advice countries have left themselves open to food blackmail sanctions against providing them with grain and other food in case they step out of line with u s diplomatic demands it is worthwhile to note that our global imposition of the mythical efficiencies of forcing latin american countries to become plantations for export crops like coffee and bananas rather than growing their own wheat and corn has failed catastrophically to deliver better lives especially for those living in central america the spread between the export crops and cheaper food imports from the u s that was supposed to materialize for countries following our playbook failed miserably witness the caravans and refugees across mexico of course our backing of the most brutal military dictators and crime lords has not helped either likewise the imf has been forced to admit that its basic guidelines were fictitious from the beginning a central core has been to enforce payment of official inter government debt by withholding imf credit from countries under default this rule was instituted at a time when most official inter government debt was owed to the united states but a few years ago ukraine defaulted on 3 billion owed to russia the imf said in effect that ukraine and other countries did not have to pay russia or any other country deemed to be acting too independently of the united states the imf has been extending credit to the bottomless it of ukrainian corruption to encourage its anti russian policy rather than standing up for the principle that inter government debts must be paid it is as if the imf now operates out of a small room in the basement of the pentagon in washington europe has taken notice that its own international monetary trade and financial linkages are in danger of attracting u s anger this became clear last autumn at the funeral for george h w bush when the eu s diplomat found himself downgraded to the end of the list to be called to his seat he was told that the u s no longer considers the eu an entity in good standing in december mike pompeo gave a speech on europe in brussels his first and eagerly awaited in which he extolled the virtues of nationalism criticised multilateralism and the eu and said that international bodies which constrain national sovereignty must be reformed or eliminated most of the above events have made the news in just one day january 31 2019 the conjunction of u s moves on so many fronts against venezuela iran and europe not to mention china and the trade threats and moves against huawei also erupting today looks like this will be a year of global fracture it is not all president trump s doing of course we see the democratic party showing the same colors instead of applauding democracy when foreign countries do not elect a leader approved by u s diplomats whether it is allende or maduro they ve let the mask fall and shown themselves to be the leading new cold war imperialists it s now out in the open they would make venezuela the new pinochet era chile trump is not alone in supporting saudi arabia and its wahabi terrorists acting as lyndon johnson put it bastards but they re our bastards where is the left in all this that is the question with which i opened this article how remarkable it is that it is only right wing parties alternative for deutschland afd or marine le pen s french nationalists and those of other countries that are opposing nato militarization and seeking to revive trade and economic links with the rest of eurasia the end of our monetary imperialism about which i first wrote in 1972 in super imperialism stuns even an informed observer like me it took a colossal level of arrogance short sightedness and lawlessness to hasten its decline something that only crazed neocons like john bolton elliot abrams and mike pompeo could deliver for donald trump footnotes

everyone let me encourage you to have our press release and ir presentations in front of you as we go through our call today further let me continue to emphasize we view our business on an annual basis we are now at the midpoint of fiscal 2019 and our key financial metrics remain centered on annual recurring revenues or arr adjusted ebitda and the dollars are always more important than the percentages operating cash flow or ocf and return on invested capital or as we like to say roic i m pleased with our results from the quarter and our progress at the midpoint of the year q2 is a solid data point along the path to our fiscal 2021 aspirations let me go through a few quarterly highlights total revenue of 735 million up 10 quarter over quarter with 1 5 year over year growth in constant currency record annual recurring revenue arr of 530 million up 2 6 year over year and 72 of total revenue adjusted ebitda of 308 million or 42 ps margin at 24 cs margin at 90 and cloud margin at 60 ocf of 189 million up 14 year over year ending cash of 595 million net debt to adjusted ebitda of 1 9 times well under 2 35 deals over 1 million 16 in the cloud 19 off cloud 50 private 50 new private cloud customers we completed the acquisition of liaison customer support renewal rate in the low 90s cloud renewal rate in the mid 90s positive organic growth and let me highlight a few key customer wins from the quarter the international committee of the red cross an organization formed in 1949 as part of the geneva convention to protect those affected by conflict and armed violence we re honored to work with the red cross with their 16 000 person workforce as they digitize to provide the right need to the right places at the right time a key win in the quarter includes the philips radiation and oncology group that selected our eim platform to connect their oncology systems real time to accelerate cancer treatment plans on a business network we re pleased to welcome coca cola and fedex enabling global digital supply chains and within ot2 we had nice wins at bose and the u k nhs both for external review and collaboration ps was up in margin down in revenue the general trend is that we expect ps revenue to remain consistent on an absolute basis though we are gradually transitioning out of lower value work we ll always optimize for high value implementation services that garner higher margin this strategy is proving effective as noted with ps margins at 24 during the quarter lastly well we completed the acquisition of catalyst systems today it was a solid q2 these results reflect quintessential aspects of our long term strategy and thinking opentext has a unique point of view we see a 100 billion addressable market for enterprise information management software or eim we intend to capture that opportunity through m a organic growth distribution expansion strategic and disciplined capital allocation and upper quartile productivity as reflected in our margins and cash flows i can t emphasize enough how strong 42 adjusted ebitda in the quarter is when we purchase companies we unlock their value we do that through integration we do that by providing a global distribution platform we do that by instilling operating discipline via the opentext way we do it by innovating we take businesses from the challenger quadrant to the leadership quadrant and in fact we emerge as the powerhouse in our recurring revenues in the cloud other consolidators have proven that they can deploy capital for sure but that alone is not a successful formula you must also integrate and innovate deliver high roic and high roic and integration and innovation to us is that perfect trifecta as a consolidator we ve also through time believed that eim is as important as erp eim is the digital platform enabling global businesses to compete and win in the fourth industrial revolution the eim margin market is large strategic and is still a young market we were ranked no 1 in business network by idc and no 1 in content services by gartner both of whom published at the end of calendar 2018 we are leading in eim customers want to purchase from leaders from opentext and they want to purchase a suite of products not a series of point solutions our intelligent and connected enterprise messaging is relevant and transformative in resonating with customers over the next five years we expect to invest near 2 billion in organic r d for eim and much more than that in acquisitions we re all in to win eim and most important the greatest opportunity for opentext today in our unique business model and our unique approach to intelligent total growth is the opentext cloud let me expand on this cloud is less than 20 penetrated within our installed base today the super majority of all enterprise workloads still run off cloud our business is scaling to 1 billion year run rate in the cloud and scale matters we own and operate the opentext cloud from 37 data centers in nine countries and thus we control our own service our own features our own capabilities our own certifications on a global basis we can demonstrate massive improvement value to our customers for migrating into the opentext cloud whether a customer is trying to grow revenues get into a new market or cut costs opentext will always be the best possible will always be in the best possible position to run operate and secure opentext software in the opentext cloud so customers don t have to we are just beginning to partner with google cloud platform amazon aws and microsoft azure these are untapped go to market opportunities for us the opentext cloud strategy is unique and diversified and we see it in three core offerings the first is our business network connecting business to business application to application liaison strengthens the business network we see then the second part the private cloud via managed services we now have 2 000 global customers running in our private cloud and i believe we can double this business over the next five years catalyst strengthens our private cloud and we have the third part the public cloud as part of ot2 ot2 is deeply integrated into our off cloud solutions it will compete stand alone as a public saas offering and will compete against pure play saas providers that s our three part strategy to our cloud continuing on why this is our greatest opportunity over a third of our pipeline today is now cloud we have over 6 000 professionals educated trained and certified on the opentext cloud we now have 63 000 customers running in the opentext cloud as i mentioned 2 000 global businesses running in the private cloud got 50 new private cloud customers in the quarter are key names like fedex coca cola and we are very profitable in the opentext cloud the greatest opportunity we have is the opentext cloud both liaison and catalyst significantly enhance that opportunity as they are recurring cloud revenue businesses and leading in their respective markets moving on a little bit to m a we closed liaison on december 17 and we re very pleased with the reaction from customers employees and trading partners we have the opportunity to expand our b2b integration capabilities and to a new and expanding market of application to application integration as newly deployed cloud applications require significant integration to both cloud and off cloud applications and workloads we purchased liaison for approximately usd 311 million trailing 12 month revenues were approximately 100 million in our first year of operations we expect revenue down 15 to 20 or 15 million to 20 million due to ppa and normal integration disruption for the second half of fiscal 2019 we expect approximately 41 million in revenue contribution and expect a negative 100 bps of adjusted ebitda impact in q3 and q4 liaison will be in our offering model within the first year of operations this is a strategic cloud acquisition and we have a strong growth thesis in the years to come as we work through the first year of integration that thesis includes bringing the technology to europe integrating to gxs and bringing self service application to application capabilities to the opentext installed base we announced closing catalyst repository systems today catalyst is the leading provider of ediscovery solutions in the u s legal industry addressing both in house legal organizations as well as leading law firms they are based in denver colorado with 150 employees catalyst plus recommind plus edocs put opentext in a leading position to address this key multibillion dollar legal tech vertical the legal industry is ready for digital and cloud transformation and we re in a fantastic position to capture that opportunity we purchased catalyst for approximately usd 75 million trailing 12 month cloud revenues were approximately 45 million in our first year of operations we expect revenue down 15 to 20 or 7 million to 9 million due to ppa and normal integration disruption for the second half of fiscal 2019 we expect approximately 14 million in revenue contribution catalyst will be on our operating model within the first 12 for within the first year of operations and we expect then to expand in the market from there we have an opportunity to expand our operations into europe grow our customer base in the top 200 law firms and large enterprise corporations combined this is 385 million of capital deployed 145 million of trailing 12 month revenues before first year ppa and normal integration disruption or 2 3 times revenue multiple with expected roic in the high teens let me transition and turn our attention to quarterly factors these are the short term factors to help you model the business they have little bearing on the long term strategic nature of the business but could affect short term 90 day cycles as i stated earlier our business is annual and quarters will vary so we are focused on our annual results calendar q1 or our fiscal q3 is our seasonally low quarter for revenue and adjusted ebitda to put that into more context calendar q1 fiscal q3 is a story of a new fiscal year for the vast majority of the market and budgets are typically just being planned and finalized and then the spend ramps through the calendar year included in our quarterly factors there are concerns for global recession as those concerns continue the after effects of the u s government shutdown and perhaps another shutdown in weeks trade wars and tariffs goods and wage inflation and front and center remains brexit gdpr and data regulation concerns continuing our quarterly factors the u s dollar continues to strengthen against the euro pound canadian dollar and yen we continue to expect a negative revenue impact due to foreign exchange in fiscal 2019 when compared to currency rates a year ago and lastly in our quarterly factors is the opentext cloud investments liaison to negatively impact adjusted ebitda margin by approximately 100 bps in q3 and q4 and our continued cloud investments focused on operations and integration i d like to leave you with three key points in my prepared remarks today first is the cloud is our greatest opportunity we re on a 1 billion run rate for the cloud on an annual basis 60 000 customers 2 000 private cloud customers only 20 penetrated in our installed base and we have scale nine countries 37 data centers second key point i d like to leave you with today is that we completed two acquisitions two key acquisitions over the last 60 days we put 385 million of capital to work smartly all from cash on hand we ve acquired 145 million of trailing 12 month revenues all in the cloud high teens roic expected 2 3 times revenue multiples third key point i d like to leave you with today is here in the shorter term it was a solid quarter total revenues of 735 million arr of 530 million up 3 adjusted ebitda of 42 or 308 million u s dollars operating cash flow of 190 million up 14 resulting in positive organic growth so lastly m a continues to be our leading growth driver supported by organic growth we continue to track to our fiscal 2019 model organic growth and f 21 aspirations of adjusted ebitda and ocf goals and a shifting landscape we plan to take share from our competitors we re ready for all economic scenarios and position to ensure all our stakeholders win and please be mindful of our quarterly factors as you model the company in the shorter term it is my pleasure to hand the call over to our cfo madhu madhu madhu ranganathan chief financial officer mark thank you and hello and thank you all for joining us today during q2 we maintained a laser focus on operations and productivity in every line of business and it shows in our results and turning to the details of our quarterly results and similar to prior quarters my references will be compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year total revenue for the quarter was 735 million up 0 1 or up 1 5 on a constant currency basis as we look as we continue to look at our business on an annual basis and let me note that year to date total revenue was 1 4 billion up 2 or 2 9 on a constant currency basis the geographical split of revenues for the quarter was americas 57 emea 33 and apj 10 consistent with the prior year annual recurring revenue was 530 million for the quarter up 2 6 or 3 9 on a constant currency basis our cloud revenue was particularly strong in the quarter at 219 million up 5 3 or 6 3 on a constant currency basis we also generated 67 9 million in new mcv up slightly compared to 65 1 million in q2 last year our customer support revenue was 310 million up 0 7 or up 2 2 on a constant currency basis we delivered 133 million in license revenues down 1 8 and essentially flat on a constant currency basis our professional services revenues were 73 million down from 83 million 12 2 or 10 1 on a constant currency basis turning to the details of our margin performance in q2 as you can see by our improved adjusted gross margins and adjusted ebitda margin we continue to maintain a clear and deep operating view into all aspects of our business gaap gross margin for the quarter was 69 up 170 basis points adjusted gross margin for the quarter was at a record of 76 up 180 basis points with consistent improvement and most evident in our annual recurring revenue lines cloud was 60 up from 57 last year our customer support was 90 up 89 from last year and license margin was 97 stable compared to last year and professional services margin was 24 up from 23 last year our adjusted ebitda was 308 million in the quarter up 6 year over year adjusted ebitda margin was 42 another record for opentext and an increase of approximately 200 basis points compared to 40 in the prior fiscal year year to date adjusted ebitda was 555 million up 9 compared to the same period last year adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was 0 80 on a diluted basis up 5 from 0 76 per share for the same period last year gaap net income for the quarter was 104 million or 0 39 per share on a diluted basis up from 85 million or 0 32 per share for the same period last year operating cash flows for the quarter were 189 million up 14 year over year year to date operating cash flows were 361 million up 54 from the same period last year during the second quarter dso was 59 days compared to 63 days in the same quarter last year while dsos can vary quarter to quarter we had a very good q2 turning to the balance sheet we ended the quarter with 595 million of cash net of the 311 million payment for liaison acquisition our balance sheet and liquidity position remain very strong and as of december 31 our consolidated net leverage ratio was 1 9 times this is well within our external debt covenant ratio of 4 times and provides us with meaningful capacity to continue executing our total growth strategy an update on restructuring during our q4 call we outlined a restructuring initiative which was successfully initiated during q1 and largely completed as of q2 timing of the same work and execution could not be better our current estimate of savings is consistent with our updates during last quarter and impact of restructuring already factored in our fiscal 2019 target model full benefits of approximately 50 million are expected to be realized in fiscal 2020 and beyond and with respect to the irs matter we received final notice from the irs on substantially the same terms with what we ve been expecting and what we have been communicating to you as we have said in the past resolving these matters take time but we continue to strongly disagree with the irs positions and we are vigorously contesting them turning to foreign exchange at the start of the fiscal year we noted that foreign exchange would have a negative impact to revenue in fiscal 2019 of approximately 60 million compared to the prior year as we look at the rates today and the geo level of components of our business we see no change to that annual impact this has been primarily driven by the u s dollar strength against the euro the pound the canadian dollar and the yen as you can see from our press release we have realized about 12 million of that 60 million annual number to date meaning we anticipate the biggest currency impact to be in the second half of fiscal 2019 that is consistent with what we saw during the second half of fiscal 2018 where the rates are most advantageous to our results now the prospectus on our operating model as mark mentioned in his commentary calendar q1 our fiscal q3 is our seasonally low quarter for revenue and adjusted ebitda margin this is an important section in that we share with you additional specifics for you to consider as you model us our fiscal q3 also being the first quarter of a new calendar year we will be recording typical annual increases to payroll and related cost which will impact all expense categories cost of sales and operating expenses by approximately 3 when you compare to q2 levels with respect to gross margins on license customer support cloud services and professional services on an annual basis we expect to remain within the range of our fy 19 target model on r d expenses as we integrate liaison and catalyst acquisitions we expect a 15 increase sequentially to r d expenses on a full quarter basis in q3 while we expect to remain within the range of our fy 19 target model sales and marketing as a reminder certain expenses as commissions and incentives they follow revenue goals and increase as the year progresses based on quota attainments as is typical of a technology company onboarding liaison and catalyst reduces our adjusted ebitda margin by about 100 basis points during the third and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and consistent with the past practice our objective is to bring both acquisitions into our target operating model within a period of 12 months our interest expenses remain as noted in our fy 19 target model of 144 million to 149 million our adjusted tax rate remains at 14 in summary q2 is a peak margin for the year while q3 is a low point and q4 is a seasonally strong margin quarter albeit below q2 levels we suggest you continue to build out your models for the remainder of the year accordingly to summarize no changes to our annual ranges in our fiscal 2019 target model which as a reminder is in the investor presentation posted on our ir website turning to our long term targets as mark mentioned we remain focused on fiscal 2021 targets adjusted ebitda margin in fiscal 2021 of 38 to 40 and operating cash flows target of 1 billion annually as we exit fiscal 2021 as i wrap up my prepared remarks then let me revisit our communication framework shared with you first in july of last year and reiterated in october we provide information to help you model opentext in a way that s closely aligned to how we see the business and reduce unnecessary short term trading volatility for our long term shareholders and within the framework we provide two metrics at the end of each fiscal year on a historical basis annual organic growth and return on invested capital roic q2 results are a great reflection of the excellent work with the opentext team continuing to achieve best in class levels of productivity a big thank you to the entire team we look forward to sharing our continued progress with you our long term shareholders whose trust and confidence we value during february and march we plan to engage with our investors and analysts through conferences and one on one meetings in canada the united states and europe we re especially looking forward to sharing the opentext story in europe which is an excellent geographical footprint for us in terms of customers partners and employees please do connect with greg secord for more information i would now like to open the call for questions operator questions and answers operator the first question comes from stephanie price of cibc please go ahead stephanie price cibc world markets analyst good afternoon mark barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer hi steph stephanie price cibc world markets analyst hi obviously acquisition spending has been very slow in the last couple of months can you talk a bit about the acquisition environment and what you re seeing in terms of the pipeline of large and small deals mark barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer yes stephanie thanks for the question as we come here into calendar 19 the top of the pipeline activity is stronger i think with market volatility the or the tail end of the effects of the u s tax rate increases from last year and i think as markets kind of lean a little more toward volatility it advantages buyers consolidators like ourselves so we have high capacity top of the pipeline activity is stronger and we re going to remain very strategic and disciplined in how we do due diligence and effectuate acquisitions but as we talked about last time i think last call i do think calendar 19 is going to see more activity in the market stephanie price cibc world markets analyst great and then in terms of revenues you obviously came in at the top end of the guidance you provided for the quarter can you give us some color on some of the sources of strength with the cross selling geographic regions that were strong mark barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer i ll point to one of the key highlights in the call which is the cloud license performed well for sure what we ve talked about over the last few calls is that we re going to tap the accelerator on the opentext cloud so more focused on training and education and certification of our 12 000 employees bringing more capability to market some upgrade of services in our managed services new ot2 platform so i d really point to the cloud and how we re looking to tap on the accelerator we re also executing very well in our off cloud business just the very the ep series is showing extreme strength and stickiness if you will and that s translating into our an off cloud renewal rate in the low 90s and a great margin performance that s really reflective of the strength of our off cloud business as well so i d point to those two things and looking at the arr up near 3 year over year stephanie price cibc world markets analyst great and maybe i ll sneak one more in now that you ve had covisint and guidance for a little over a year can you talk about any positive or negative surprises that came into the integration and what you ve seen in terms of cross selling mark barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer yes fair enough i ll take them maybe one at a time covisint when we purchased covisint they were shrinking and losing money and we felt we could arrest that decline and turn them profitable and we ve done that and it s and that s reflected on our 42 blended adjusted ebitda we have a great opportunity in internet of things and i have got one reflection on covisint is i m still very hopeful that the the base business is exactly what we expected and we always had to serve an upside thesis around the internet of things and we re still very hopeful around it we re beginning to win new identity and access management business iam business i think we call it yam actually as an acronym i a m and we ve learned a lot about okta o k t a probably the primary competitor in the identity and access management space so i know i don t talk a lot about them that s sort of the space we re going to target in identity and access management on guidance software it s we re very pleased with the security aspects of it we didn t enter guidance for their ediscovery capabilities part of the thesis was they had outsourced all their renewals and we had insourced that and bring that into our mechanism we ve now completed that that might have taken one or two quarters a little longer than we wanted to do so those will be my reflections right covisint is what we thought it would be on the base business and still has its upside in identity and access management as well as iot we love the security aspects of guidance and we re sort of completing the and we ve completed the insourcing of the renewals business there s still great promise on the security side stephanie price cibc world markets analyst great thank you very much operator the next question comes from richard tse of national bank financial please go ahead sir richard tse national bank financial analyst thank you i m actually surprised to see you have so much opportunity in your longer standing titles like catalyst and the discovery market my question is are you thinking more about fortifying those silos or would you ever kind of consider expanding into new market segments here mark barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer richard thanks for the question ok look we have really kind of think of this in two vectors we continue microsoft speaks broadly around a horizontal platform and i think that s a good narrative and a good place to learn where we have great opportunity to be this horizontal platform for content services business network application to application integration and identity and access management it doesn t need a lot of verticalization the other vector is word collapse and there are a variety of really key industries for us financial services which is our largest industry retail and cpg which a lot of strength came from gxs we re strong in engineering and construction and there s a whole set of verticals healthcare government but the legal tech sector is a great vertical it s sort of where the content rich process oriented high security needs around information ai analytics deep machine learning the legal vertical is estimated to be about 3 5 billion in size so we re going to go out and prosecute all these key verticals for us as through the years we re strong in financial services today manufacturing auto has always been a strong industry we re building strength in legal tech and i think you ll continue to see us both build on our own and acquire on a vertical basis richard tse national bank financial analyst ok and i think in your conference call in march you talked about coca cola and fedex and i think just from a supply chain perspective i m just wondering if you can sort of elaborate on that a little bit just a bit more color mark barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer sure so if we look at coca cola it s certainly on supply chain and distribution fedex is more logistics and transportation richard tse national bank financial analyst and that s what was that so it s like sort of loading all of the data related to that into your cloud or if you could put just a bit more color if you have mark barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer yes fair enough let me let s think what we can publish out there richard on both the customers and see how we can get into more depth so once you leave us with that then maybe we ll get a case study out on both of them richard tse national bank financial analyst all right i ll leave that thanks operator the next question comes from phillip huang of barclays please go ahead sir phillip huang barclays investment bank analyst hi thanks good afternoon and congrats on the second quarter mark you pointed to continued global recession concerns in your remarks similar to the last quarterly call i just wanted to sort of get an update on your visibility on any impact to your pipeline or what your visibility is to for the business mark barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer yes fair enough yes i called it out last quarter in our quarterly factors i ll call it out again and what i m calling out is just sort of a general sentiment if we look at the world economic forum and many of the headlines that came out of davos over the last two weeks the sentiment is quite different than a year ago now we haven t seen it impact our pipeline we haven t seen it affect our business at this point but i think it s worthy of calling out that it remains a concern and it s more in the headlines of all the papers that we read but we re not yet affected or calling out a change in our pipeline phillip huang barclays investment bank analyst got it that s helpful and then maybe one for liaison obviously you re paying a pricing i guess multiple that is above your historical average i just wanted to maybe get your sense on what are some of the things that we should be aware of that supported the valuations of the deal the strategic rationale obviously makes a lot of sense just wondering on the financial side whether you also expect to see above average growth and or margins once the business is fully integrated mark barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer yes fair enough and it s a good question i think it s always important to look at deals both on their own and in a basket right and in a basket with catalyst 385 million of capital deployed 145 million of trailing 12 month revenues or 2 3 times multiple so i think that s well one that basket of two deals is important around 2 3 times standalone it s just under 3 3 times so it s a little closer to the range higher end of the range of the hp acquisitions that we did ultimately it s about roic right return on invested capital and we believe this will return a high teens roic to us and catalyst will be even slightly better than that when we get it integrated into our model but to support kind of the very high 2s if you will on liaison we re going to grow it and part of that thesis is they re not yet in europe and we got a strong basis in europe with gxs so we can bring the technology to europe i think one of the best comparisons in the market is a mulesoft of how mule is doing application to application level integration we don t have those capabilities today we re we didn t have them before liaison we were more kind of deeper of this edi transaction talking to this edi transaction versus a repository of all these rules of how does sap talk to docusign right how does oracle speak to adobe and you can think of a database of 4 000 5 000 application integration rules that we can now sit in the business network and allow our million plus trading partners to say how does app talk to app versus edi protocol talk to edi protocol we think that s a big opportunity that app to app level integration so our case here is once we get through the first year and we get through our ppa and integration disruption which is typical of all the deals we do we have a strong plan to grow the revenue phillip huang barclays investment bank analyst got it no that s very helpful and then maybe one for madhu just looking at the seasonality for the two acquisitions it looks likely liaison you re expecting 41 million in the back half of 19 which seemed like pretty evenly split between the quarters but catalyst seemed like it s seasonally a little bit lighter in the back half of the fiscal year am i reading that correctly just even after adjusting for the ppa madhu ranganathan chief financial officer thanks for the question yes and a little bit no catalyst is two months out of this quarter and three months in the last quarter right like liaison we closed in the middle of december so you see kind of the month effect and plus some seasonality but i would definitely take the one month timing into consideration phillip huang barclays investment bank analyst got it thank you very much madhu ranganathan chief financial officer thank you operator the next question comes from thanos moschopoulos of bmo capital markets please go ahead thanos moschopoulos bmo capital markets analyst hi good afternoon mark can you update us on the traction you re getting with the ot2 since i think it s been a couple of quarters since you launched it was that a contributor to the cloud strength this quarter or is it still relatively early days for that offering mark barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer yes it s still relatively early we had a couple of nice we had a few nice wins for sure that we re calling out but it s still thanos still early days the stronger contribution was certainly on the value added network and on demand messaging and the business network very strong contribution from the private cloud but a beginning contribution from ot2 hightail actually did well within the quarter our own new and native saas ot2 apps bose and u k nhs so it s still early days but they contributed but ot2 contributed thanos moschopoulos bmo capital markets analyst ok good to hear and you mentioned that you would expect ps revenue to be stable going forward it sounds like that s a decision to offload more of that lower margin work to your partners is that having an impact with respect to partner engagement and the level of new license and cloud bookings coming through that channel or would you expect to change on that front going forward as a result of them doing more of the work mark barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer yes it s a good question it s exactly as you highlighted it we still may have a little pressure on the revenue line as we continue to transition out maybe lower value services now value s in the eye of the beholder right what we view as lower value is high value to a partner because it s more in their implementation thesis what we want to do is to be the experts in opentext and getting the big value out of opentext software versus maybe some run rate implementation services so value is in the eye of the beholder but what we view as low value we are transitioning to partners they like it helps them build more demand so it s a nice virtuous cycle that flows so maybe a little still a little more pressure on the revenue line but in general the absolute dollar performance should remain consistent and again right it that strategy produced 24 margin in q2 so we re it s the right strategy for us thanos moschopoulos bmo capital markets analyst ok just a question for madhu madhu when you re talking about the q3 factors you said licenses would be within the range of the 2019 operating model did you mean for q3 specifically or did you mean on a full year basis madhu ranganathan chief financial officer i meant on a full year basis thanos moschopoulos bmo capital markets analyst ok thank you madhu ranganathan chief financial officer thank you mark barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer and operator as we go into our next question i d just like to touch base on what richard asked for richard on coca cola it s really kind of core coca cola talking to bottlers now on our business network and in fedex it s really fleet management so i just wanted that out thank you operator operator the next question comes from paul steep who s from scotia capital please go ahead sir paul steep scotia capital analyst mark can you talk a little bit about cloud you talked about the pipeline being a third cloud driven can you talk about what the momentum looks like across the broader set are you getting seeing that start to pull through i know you ve always been agnostic but how that s developing and what changes you re maybe making in the sales force around that mark barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer paul thanks for the question we re we still see the world as hybrid and hybrid is the destination it s not a waypoint so i again in the 60 40 40 60 i m not ready to say 70 30 but there s no doubt that when i look at for opentext today the greatest opportunity is cloud we re only 20 penetrated into the installed base today whether it be for business network managed services ot2 is so young and new we haven t even begun to tap the opportunity with the hyperscalers so it doesn t change our thesis of hybrid but unequivocally the greatest opportunity for the company today is driving the adoption of the network of the private cloud in new and native saas workloads paul steep scotia capital analyst great two quick follow ups for madhu largely here cloud margins at 60 we saw a rebound there is that exceptional in terms of anything unusual in the quarter should we think of that as achievable going forward and then the other one for you with regards to irs can you just remind us of what were at dollar was for the contested value and then maybe a broad brush of what the next step actually is madhu ranganathan chief financial officer sure thing i ll take the second one first we are at i think through the 770 million in terms of our estimated exposure right again it s a disclosure item and as a follow up to that as we as i ve stated in my prepared remarks we continue to stand very strongly by our positions our technical positions and we continue to be as you have said contesting the amounts and the irs thesis on it back to cloud margin what i would say is that we did really well as mark mentioned we are going to invest in the cloud so it s going to be it s going to depend on the business need and what happens in one quarter versus the other and as you know we are onboarding liaison and catalyst into the business and they are both cloud services and hence our direction that think about the cloud margins still on an annual basis in the 57 and the 59 we have on our fy 19 target model paul steep scotia capital analyst thank you madhu ranganathan chief financial officer sure thing operator the next question comes from matthew wells with citi please go ahead matthew wells citi hi good afternoon on the backdrop of m a integration and the 100 bps headwind it looks like you maintained the ebitda margin expectations of 36 to 38 and does this account for catalyst integration headwinds and what gives you confidence here mark barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer yes matthew thanks for the question yes we to answer your question it factors in catalyst for sure i said we ll get them on our operating model within the first 12 months might get there actually a little sooner right so we re not calling out catalyst for any special effect if you will here liaison is a little larger if you will so in q3 and q4 it will have a slight impact to the growth basically of adjusted ebitda so we re confident in the range of 36 to 38 we got great visibility into our expense run rate we re very disciplined in that visibility we know the investments in hand we only got five months to go right until the end of the year so it s the visibility it s our integration history and expertise we can have great visibility into catalyst and liaison so we re confident in the 36 to 38 on the year matthew wells citi ok that s really helpful and then switching gears i just have a question on as opentext continues to partner with public cloud providers how are you investing on the opportunity and do you see any risk of clients churning from the opentext cloud to these providers mark barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer yes it s an interesting question we own and operate our own infrastructure we ve been we ve built our ot we have acquired and built our cloud from 0 over the last six years we worked from 0 to almost 1 billion run rate annually so we ve got a lot of experience over the last year the first workload that we think the hyperscalers can help us with help our customers with is the sort of secondary and tertiary workloads around disaster recovery backup we re not in every market today but google s and various markets so is aws so i think with those secondary almost and sometimes tertiary workloads of discovery sorry dr backup they re going to be helpful with when we put our private cloud our public cloud is not going to run on a hyperscaler so ot2 is not intended to run on a hyperscaler so it s our private cloud and when we have certain workloads google is the closest customers will still get a better sla from opentext and but a good enough sla in a third party cloud environment and that s ok with us we still want to win that the software platform the opentext software piece a third party can t win that we re going to win we re going to provide the application performance management and then the transformation services to leverage and use our software so we re going after that value stack not the hosted piece if you will with the hyperscalers so there s really no risk to lose anything it s sort of a trade off of sla is whether you run in the opentext cloud or run in a hyperscaler matthew wells citi thanks that s it it s great color operator this concludes the question and answer session i would now like to hand the call back over to mr barrenechea for any closing remarks mark barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer very good well i d like to thank you for joining us today and i d like to conclude by leaving you with three things our top three messages that we wanted to convey today is that the opentext cloud is the greatest opportunity in front of us two we ve completed two acquisitions over the last 60 days and again put 380 million of capital to work for a trailing 12 month revenues of 145 million all cloud revenue high teens roic expected 2 3 times revenue multiple and in the shorter term it was a very solid quarter with arr of 530 million up 3 and adjusted ebitda of 42 and operating cash flow of 190 million up 14 resulting in positive organic growth thanks for joining us today and we look forward to seeing you in our investor conferences have a good day operator duration 55 minutes call participants greg secord vice president of investor relations mark barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer madhu ranganathan chief financial officer stephanie price cibc world markets analyst richard tse

since the 2014 change of government in ukraine driven by the country s pro eu aspirations and russia s subsequent war on the country the state of affairs in ukraine has become a focal point for the european union russia s now half decade long unlawful war against the country has also made a successful western oriented ukraine critical for europe s security and stability the 2018 keeping ukraine on the reform path discussion paper prepared for the eu council by the foreign ministers of thirteen eu member states who are friends of ukraine said that for europe the success of ukraine is of strategic importance the paper also called ukraine s presidential and parliamentary elections in 2019 a test for ukraine these statements remind us what is at stake for the european union in ukraine s 2019 elections particularly the presidential elections in march recent polls indicate that reformist candidates including the incumbent president petro poroshenko could lose the presidential race to the populists in particular to former prime minister and gas oligarch yulia tymoshenko as the populist politician who stands the biggest chance of winning it is important to consider what tymoshenko s presidency would mean for pro eu reforms in ukraine an examination of her current anti reformist agenda her presidential campaign and political track record expressly demonstrate that if elected ukraine s pro european reforms will be in jeopardy eu support for reforms in ukraine over the last five years the eu has been considerably invested in helping ukraine the eu and many individual eu member states have been aiding ukraine to conduct ambitious institutional reforms to strengthen the country as it faces ongoing russian hybrid warfare the eu established the support group for ukraine and the eu advisory mission to back ukrainian reforms with expert advice and resources and supports reform programmes in decentralisation public administration energy deregulation and anti corruption to name but a few the eu has disbursed the largest ever macro financial assistance to a non eu country 3 3 billion euros in low interest loans to reinvigorate ukraine s economy which suffered a dramatic downfall as a result of russia s military aggression and its occupation of a large portion of ukraine s territory the eu also backs reforms and the local economy in ukraine via hundreds of millions of euros in grants through various instruments like the european neighbourhood instrument the external investment plan and other programmes importantly ukraine benefits from the association agreement including the extensive deep and comprehensive free trade agreement dfta and a visa free regime with schengen states offering ukraine new opportunities for increasing trade and attracting foreign direct investment the eu is invested in ukraine s success because in the last five years ukrainians have demonstrated that they share the eu s vision of building a society based on the values of freedom liberal democracy rooted in the rule of law in an ambitious drive to change the country ukraine s post euromaidan governments have implemented far reaching reforms in decentralisation deregulation public administration public procurement open data prevention of corruption judiciary law enforcement army and security healthcare education social security energy banking taxation and other areas the list of achievements is even more impressive considering that they have been taking place against the backdrop of russia s hugely destabilising hybrid war effort and the domestic political vulnerability of the governing coalition the 2019 elections in ukraine put the success of pro european reforms in ukraine at stake as the prime minister of denmark lars løkke rasmussen noted in his speech at the 2018 ukraine reform conference if populist forces succeed in ukraine the impact could be dramatic tymoshenko s opposition to eu backed reforms regretfully the achievements of ukraine s post euromaidan governments have been largely unacknowledged and trivialised in ukraine factors like the kremlin s concerted disinformation campaign biased and unqualified media coverage and fierce often utterly irresponsible domestic political competition have contributed to creating an atmosphere of disappointment in society popu lists like mrs tymoshenko who promise ukrainians prosperity without painful reforms are capitalising on this to make political gains since tymoshenko s batkivshchyna fatherland party quit the government coalition in 2016 to allow tymoshenko to later run for president as an opposition candidate she has significantly contributed to encouraging the sense of disenchantment tymoshenko routinely attacks reformist policies many of which are entirely backed by the eu branding them in extreme fashion as genocide extermination and the impoverishment of ukrainians echoing the language of the kremlin she routinely maligns the democratically elected reformist post euromaidan governments as dictatorship regime and mafia it is difficult not to conclude that tymoshenko has an agenda to undermine and derail eu sponsored reforms in ukraine anti democratic agenda although tymoshenko presents herself as democratic leader strongly exploiting her image of one of the leaders of the 2004 pro democracy orange revolution her past actions and present political agenda make her devotion to democracy questionable tymoshenko s track record of a ruthless quest for power from the secretive intrigue to unseat president yushchenko in september 2005 to the back room rewriting of ukraine s constitution to establish a 20 year long power sharing arrangement with yanukovych in 2009 shows she is no stranger to employing means that undermine democracy in the country her present campaign promises focus on abolishing ukraine s parliamentary presidential system and introducing a true european parliamentary system however a closer look at her proposals cloaked as new mechanisms of direct democracy reveals a badly masked power grab agenda which will represent a huge departure from the tradition of european democracy and will move ukraine back into the days of authoritarian rule tymoshenko already speaks about her political future after her term as president hinting in inter views that she will aim for a newly created position of chancellor after implementing constitutional reforms during her presidency tymoshenko s ambitions to remain in power for as long as possible by subverting national constitutional mechanisms to suit her agenda is reminiscent of the shift to au thoritarianism happening elsewhere in the region anti reformist while publicly accusing the government of counter revolution tymoshenko has been mounting campaigns to derail the progressive reforms pursued by the government the european union and other international partners of ukraine have invested substantial effort and resources to drive the re forms that tymoshenko is opposing she fiercely opposes energy health care land market pension and judicial reforms and demands legislative moratoriums on the increases of gas tariffs on the participation of private companies in the ukrainian gas transmission network s operations management and on the sale of farmland all of which will bring progressive reforms in those sectors to an end in recent years tymoshenko also launched personal political assaults on many of ukraine s most effective reformers she has ferociously attacked the ceo of the state owned energy giant naftogaz andriy kobolyev who has overseen the company s reorganisation according to eu energy rules and transition to transparent management the former head of the national bank valeriya hontareva who helped clean up the banking system so oligarchs could no longer use their shady financial institutions as personal piggy banks was also a regular target but tymoshenko has been especially aggressive in her attacks on the reformist acting health minister american born ulana suprun who has devoted herself to fighting corruption in the health sector and in implementing ambitious reforms to health care even modernising medical education anti corruption track record tymoshenko presents herself as an anti corruption crusader she even proudly wears her past criminal charges of bribery and embezzlement as badges of distinction for political persecution because of her opposition role but her efficient public relations strategy should not be confused with the fact that tymoshenko has no track record to back her image of a corruption fighter in reality tymoshenko s name has regularly popped up in relation to big corruption scandals tymoshenko is most notoriously known for her dealings in the 1990 s with former ukrainian prime minister pavlo lazarenko her political and business associate who fled embezzlement charges in ukraine and was convicted in the united states for money laundering in a letter to the us department of justice tymoshenko defended lazarenko s criminal actions making the absurd claim that he hid the embezzled money in offshore jurisdictions to fund a future presidential campaign it is a tymoshenko trademark to use the status of opposition to defend criminal acts according to ukraine s former prime minister yatseniuk and ukrainian investigative journalist serhiy leshchenko in 2010 tymoshenko helped ukrainian oligarch ihor kolomoyskyi obtain man agement control over the majority state owned ukrnafta oil company this deal allowed the companies affiliated with kolomoisky to buy ukrnafta s oil at heavily discounted prices to the detriment of the ukrainian state presently kolomoyskyi is facing law suits in the uk switzerland and ukraine to the tune of three billion us dollars for embezzling funds of his pryvatbank that the government was forced to bail out and later nationalise in 2016 tymoshenko s name came up many times in relation to the criminal case against a former member of parliament from her batkivshchyna party oleksandr shepelev who was charged with embezzling millions from rodovid bank and later fled to russia shepelev was said to be tymoshenko s shadow overseer in rodovid which meant management decisions had to be approved by him after it was bailed out and nationalised by tymoshenko s government to understand the political context one should know that bailing out failing banks in the aftermath of 2008 09 financial crisis was a prominent part of tymoshenko s political policies another recent telling episode of tymoshenko s anti corruption track record is her role in the scandal connected to a member of ukraine s parliament oleksandr onyshchenko in 2016 onyshchenko was charged by ukraine s anti corruption bureau nabu of organising a corrupt scheme involving a subsidiary of the state owned gas giant naftogaz which allowed his organised crime group to embezzle 1 6 billion hryvnias ukraine s parliament lifted parliamentary immunity from onyshchenko be cause the majority of mp s found the case against him persuasive onyshchenko fled the country in 2016 to avoid criminal prosecution and has been on the run reportedly in the united kingdom spain germany and russia ever since what further speaks to the seriousness of the criminal charg es against onyshchenko is that in 2017 the office of the anti corruption prosecutor and nabu charged the ex chief of ukraine s tax office roman nasirov with abuse of office in connection to the unlawful decisions that benefited onyshchenko s businesses also a dozen other suspected accomplices of onyshchenko s embezzlement scheme have been criminally charged despite serious evidence of onyshchenko s wrongdoing tymoshenko publicly defended him in a tv interview it is noteworthy that tymoshenko fervently opposes gas market reform and lobbies to keep ukraine s gas sector shackled to the corrupt two tier system which on paper sells cheap gas at government con trolled prices to private households but in reality allows corrupt government officials and other ac tors to divert the gas designated for private households to industrial consumers at higher prices pocketing the difference in price in april 2018 ukraine s anti corruption bureau initiated an investigation into the illegal financing of tymoshenko s 2010 electoral campaign by the late libyan leader muammar gaddafi during tymoshenko s 2007 2010 term as prime minister gaddafi pursued a deal with the ukrainian government to lease 100 000 hectares of ukrainian farming land as well as other joint economic projects according to reporting by the asharq al awsat newspaper gaddafi donated 4 9 million us dollars in cash to tymoshenko s presidential campaign despite such a compromising track record that should have made tymoshenko toxic in the west it seems eu politicians do not want to look beyond tymoshenko s glamourous image and see her for who she really is epp turns a blind eye considering tymoshenko s anti reformist and shady track record and populist agenda it is inexplica ble that her batkivshchyna party maintains an observer status with the european people s party epp in 2008 her party joined the epp family in a move regarded by many as a transparent means of driving support away from the political party of tymoshenko s political rival president viktor yushchenko the 2012 epp manifesto says there is a danger that populism and political radicalism will spread they are threats to our democracies and to the european union it is perverse that tymoshenko s destructive populism which is undermining the functioning of democracy in ukraine has not raised concerns in brussels the epp also ignores tymoshenko s party s meagre support for international monetary fund supported and eu backed reforms in ukraine in particular those related to the association agreement with the european union moreover many policies promoted by tymoshenko undermine ukraine s path of european integration in particular her stark opposition to reform in ukraine s gas sector and land reform nevertheless the epp lends tymoshenko credibility as a pro european reformist in 2015 the epp president joseph daul wrote in his letter to tymoshenko the epp recognises the decisive efforts you have made in bringing ukraine closer to europe for strengthening european values and respect for european standards and also for ensuring welfare and freedom in ukraine respect for the rule of law and independence of the judiciary and for fighting corruption considering tymoshenko s actual track record mr daul s praise seems rather undeserved in fact such validation of someone with tymoshenko s history is detrimental to ukraine s democracy nevertheless in 2019 daul reiterated his praise for tymoshenko in his greetings on the occasion of the announcement of her presidential candidacy one cannot help but wonder why publicly available in formation about tymoshenko is ignored and what lobbyism efforts ensured a blind eye was turned to reality mistakes of the past should not be repeated in 2009 tymoshenko managed to convince eu leaders that her election as president could be acceptable both to the west and to vladimir putin unfortunately at that time the west still regarded ukraine as russia s backyard and tymoshenko was seen as someone who would not irritate russia as president yushchenko had with policies that caused moscow to fear that ukraine would be decisively pulled out of russia s orbit the west cannot afford to pretend that ukraine can move toward the western liberal democratic order with a leadership that is agreeable to putin s authoritarian regime a strong independent ukraine as a reliable ally is in the best interest of western democracies and the international security order in 2019 the cost of buying into tymoshenko s clever public relations campaigns is simply too high helping boost the political credibility of a politician who undermines ukraine s pro european and democratic reforms is always dangerous at a time when russia is waging war not only against ukraine but against the eu and the entire international security order it is of the utmost importance that the eu be clear eyed about the risks tymoshenko s presidency would pose for ukraine s nation hood as well as the balance of power and stability in europe ukraine deserves political leadership that is committed to pro european reforms eu political actors should support candidates who have a good track record of delivering on those reforms not those with a history of undermining them this

january 31 2019 if western elites understood how the postwar liberal system was created they d think twice about asking for its renewal by adam tooze klaus schwab impresario of the world economic forum released a manifesto in the run up to this year s annual meeting at davos switzerland in which he called for a contemporary equivalent to the postwar conferences that established the liberal international order after the second world war leaders from across the globe came together to design a new set of institutional structures to enable the post war world to collaborate towards building a shared future he wrote the world has changed and as a matter of urgency we must undertake this process again schwab went on to call for a new moment of collective design for globalization s alleged fourth iteration creatively labeled globalization 4 0 schwab is not the first to make this kind of appeal since the financial crisis there have been repeated calls for a new bretton woods the conference in 1944 at which in schwab s words leaders from across the globe came together to design a financial system for the postwar era establishing the international monetary fund imf and the world bank in the process it was the moment at which u s hegemony proved its most comprehensive and enlightened by empowering economist statesmen foremost among them john maynard keynes to lead the world out of the postwar ruins and the preceding decades of crisis under washington s wise leadership even rancorous europe moved toward peaceful and prosperous integration this is a story with wide support in places like davos it s also one that deserves far more scrutiny its history of the founding of the postwar order is wrong more important its implicit theory about how international order emerges through a collective design effort by world leaders coming together to reconcile their interests is fundamentally mistaken what history actually suggests is that order tends to emerge not from cooperation and deliberation but from a cruder calculus of power and material constraints bretton woods may have been a conference of experts and officials but it was first and foremost a gathering of a wartime alliance engaged in the massive mobilization effort of total war the conference met in july 1944 in the weeks following d day and the final soviet breakthrough on the eastern front as a wartime rather than a postwar meeting disagreements were minimized though the conference was about the future order of the international economy and though the aim of the talks was to link national economies back together the building blocks were centralized state controlled war economies the bretton woods negotiators were government officials not businessmen or bankers as they had done since the collapse of the global financial system in the early 1930s central bankers played second fiddle to treasury officials the americans who were bankrolling the allied war effort called the shots the basic monetary vision of bretton woods was to create order by establishing fully convertible currencies at fixed exchange rates with the dollar pegged to gold but the tough conditions of the bretton woods monetary architecture set by the united states proved far too demanding for war weakened european economies when britain the least damaged economy in europe tried to implement free convertibility of pounds into dollars its attempt collapsed at the first hurdle in 1947 the social democratic labour party government in london quickly moved to stop the subsequent drain of precious dollars by reimposing exchange controls and tightening import quotas meanwhile the grand design for a free trade order embodied by the havana charter and the international trade organization fell afoul of the u s congress and was thus stopped in its tracks the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt was its cumbersome and slow moving replacement the talk of a connection between the present and the bretton woods moment is legitimated perhaps above all by the claimed continuity of the imf and the world bank which were duly set up in december 1945 but beyond institutional titles this supposed continuity is largely false within a year of the founding of its key institutions almost the entire global agenda of bretton woods was put on ice already in 1946 the soviet union absented itself from the formation of the imf and the world bank milton friedman with the cold war paralyzing the u n institutions that had originally been intended to frame bretton woods what emerged under u s hegemony was a far narrower postwar order centered on the north atlantic the marshall plan of 1948 was not so much a complement to bretton woods as an acknowledgement of its failure for true liberals in both the united states and europe who hankered after the golden age of globalization in the late 19th century the resulting cold war economic order was a profound disappointment the u s treasury and the first generation of neo liberals in europe fretted against the u s state department and its interventionist economic tendencies mavericks such as the young milton friedman true advocates of free markets in the way we take for granted today demanded a bonfire of all regulations they insisted that rather than exchange rates being fixed currencies should be allowed to float with their value defined by competitive markets in the 1950s friedman could be dismissed as eccentric the reality of the liberal order that supposedly came into existence in the postwar moment was the more or less haphazard continuation of wartime controls it would take until 1958 before the bretton woods vision was finally implemented even then it was not a liberal order by the standard of the gilded age of the 19th century or in the sense that davos understands it today international mobility of capital for anything other than long term investment was strictly limited liberalization of trade also made slow progress the gradual abolition of exchange controls went hand in hand with the lifting of trade quotas only when these more elementary limitations on foreign trade were removed did tariff negotiations become relevant gatt s lumbering deliberations did not begin making major inroads until the kennedy round of the 1960s 20 years after the end of the war and rising global trade was a mixed blessing huge german and japanese trade surpluses put pressure on the bretton woods exchange rate system this was compounded in the 1960s by the connivance of u s treasury and u k authorities in enabling wall street to sidestep financial repression and launch the unregulated euro dollar market based in bank accounts in london by the late 1960s barely more than 10 years old bretton woods was already in terminal trouble and when confronted with demands for deflation u s president richard nixon reverted to economic nationalism between 1971 and 1973 he unhitched the dollar from gold and abandoned any effort to defend the exchange rate sending the dollar plunging and helping to restore something closer to trade balance if our own world has a historic birthplace it was not in 1945 but in the early 1970s with the advent of fiat money and floating exchange rates the unpalatable truth is that our world was born not out of wise collective agreement but out of chaos unleashed by america s unilateral refusal any longer to underwrite the global monetary order as the tensions built up in the 1960s exploded foreign exchange instability contributed to a historically unprecedented surge in inflation across the western world we now know that this era of inflationary instability would be concluded by the market revolution and what ben bernanke dubbed the great moderation but once again hindsight should not blind us to the depth of the crisis and uncertainty prevailing at the time the first attempts to restore order were not by way of the market revolution but by the means of corporatism direct negotiations among governments trade unions and employers with a view of limiting the vicious spiral of prices and wages this promised a direct control of inflation by way of price setting but its effect was to stoke an ever greater politicization of the economy with left wing social theorists diagnosing a crisis of capitalist democracy the trilateral commission warned of democratic ungovernability what broke the deadlock was not some inclusive conference of stakeholders the stakeholders in the 1970s were obstreperous trade unions and that kind of consultation was precisely the bad habit that the neoliberal revolutionaries set out to break the solution as u s federal reserve chair paul volcker s recent memoirs make embarrassingly clear was blunt force wielded by the fed volcker s unilateral interest rate hike the sharp revaluation of the dollar de industrialization and the crash of surging unemployment dealt a death blow to organized labor and tamed inflationary pressure the volcker shock established so called independent central bankers as the true arbiters of the new dispensation they put paid to what margaret thatcher referred to as the enemy within but the global victory of the liberal order required a more far reaching struggle the world of the market revolution of the 1980s was still divided between communism and capitalism between first second and third worlds the overcoming of those divisions was a matter of power politics first and foremost negotiation second the united states and its allies in europe raised the pressure on the soviet union and after a period of spectacularly heightened tension mikhail gorbachev chose to de escalate unwittingly precipitating the union s collapse the truth is that the postwar moment that the davos crowd truly hankers after is not that of 1945 but the aftermath of the cold war the moment of western triumph it was finally in 1995 that the bretton woods vision of a comprehensive world trade organization was realized a sanitized version of this moment would describe it as a third triumph of enlightened technocracy after bretton woods and the defeat of inflation this was the age of the washington consensus but as in those previous moments its underpinnings were power politics at home the humbling of organized labor abroad the collapse of soviet challenge and the decision by the beijing regime to embark on the incorporation of china into the world economy since 2008 that new order has come under threat from its own internal dysfunction oppositional domestic politics and the geopolitical power shift engendered by truly widespread convergent growth the crisis goes deep it is not surprising that there should be calls for a new institutional design but we should be careful what we wish for if history is anything to go by that new order will not emerge from an enlightened act of collective leadership ideas and leadership matter but to think that they by themselves found international order is to put the cart before the horse what will resolve the current tension is a power grab by a new stakeholder determined to have its way and the central question of the current moment is whether the west is ready for that if not we should get comfortable with the new disorder

by the end of america s unchallenged global economic dominance has arrived sooner than expected thanks to the very same neocons who gave the world the iraq syria and the dirty wars in latin america just as the vietnam war drove the united states off gold by 1971 its violent regime change warfare against venezuela and syria and threatening other countries with sanctions if they do not join this crusade is driving european and other nations to create their alternative financial institutions this break has been building for quite some time and was bound to occur but who would have thought that donald trump would become the catalytic agent no left wing party no socialist anarchist or foreign nationalist leader anywhere in the world could have achieved what he is doing to break up the american empire the deep state is reacting with shock at how this right wing real estate grifter has been able to drive other countries to defend themselves by dismantling the u s centered world order to rub it in he is using bush and reagan era neocon arsonists john bolton and now elliott abrams to fan the flames in venezuela it is almost like a black political comedy the world of international diplomacy is being turned inside out a world where there is no longer even a pretense that we might adhere to international norms let alone laws or treaties the neocons who trump has appointed are accomplishing what seemed unthinkable not long ago driving china and russia together the great nightmare of henry kissinger and zbigniew brzezinski they also are driving germany and other european countries into the eurasian orbit the heartland nightmare of halford mackinder a century ago the root cause is clear after the crescendo of pretenses and deceptions over iraq libya and syria along with our absolution of the lawless regime of saudi arabia foreign political leaders are coming to recognize what world wide public opinion polls reported even before the iraq iran contra boys turned their attention to the world s largest oil reserves in venezuela the united states is now the greatest threat to peace on the planet calling the u s coup being sponsored in venezuela a defense of democracy reveals the doublethink underlying u s foreign policy it defines democracy to mean supporting u s foreign policy pursuing neoliberal privatization of public infrastructure dismantling government regulation and following the direction of u s dominated global institutions from the imf and world bank to nato for decades the resulting foreign wars domestic austerity programs and military interventions have brought more violence not democracy in the devil s dictionary that u s diplomats are taught to use as their elements of style guidelines for doublethink a democratic country is one that follows u s leadership and opens its economy to u s investment and imf and world bank sponsored privatization the ukraine is deemed democratic along with saudi arabia israel and other countries that act as u s financial and military protectorates and are willing to treat america s enemies are theirs too a point had to come where this policy collided with the self interest of other nations finally breaking through the public relations rhetoric of empire other countries are proceeding to de dollarize and replace what u s diplomacy calls internationalism meaning u s nationalism imposed on the rest of the world with their own national self interest this trajectory could be seen 50 years ago i described it in super imperialism and global fracture it had to happen but nobody thought that the end would come in quite the way that is happening history has turned into comedy or at least irony as its dialectical path unfolds for the past half century u s strategists the state department and national endowment for democracy ned worried that opposition to u s financial imperialism would come from left wing parties it therefore spent enormous resources manipulating parties that called themselves socialist tony blair s british labour party france s socialist party germany s social democrats etc to adopt neoliberal policies that were the diametric opposite to what social democracy meant a century ago but u s political planners and great wurlitzer organists neglected the right wing imagining that it would instinctively support u s thuggishness the reality is that right wing parties want to get elected and a populist nationalism is today s road to election victory in europe and other countries just as it was for donald trump in 2016 trump s agenda may really be to break up the american empire using the old uncle sucker isolationist rhetoric of half a century ago he certainly is going for the empire s most vital organs but it he a witting anti american agent he might as well be but it would be a false mental leap to use quo bono to assume that he is a witting agent after all if no u s contractor supplier labor union or bank will deal with him would vladimir putin china or iran be any more naïve perhaps the problem had to erupt as a result of the inner dynamics of u s sponsored globalism becoming impossible to impose when the result is financial austerity waves of population flight from u s sponsored wars and most of all u s refusal to adhere to the rules and international laws that it itself sponsored seventy years ago in the wake of world war ii dismantling international law and its courts any international system of control requires the rule of law it may be a morally lawless exercise of ruthless power imposing predatory exploitation but it is still the law and it needs courts to apply it backed by police power to enforce it and punish violators here s the first legal contradiction in u s global diplomacy the united states always has resisted letting any other country have any voice in u s domestic policies law making or diplomacy that is what makes america the exceptional nation but for seventy years its diplomats have pretended that its superior judgment promoted a peaceful world as the roman empire claimed to be which let other countries share in prosperity and rising living standards at the united nations u s diplomats insisted on veto power at the world bank and imf they also made sure that their equity share was large enough to give them veto power over any loan or other policy without such power the united states would not join any international organization yet at the same time it depicted its nationalism as protecting globalization and internationalism it was all a euphemism for what really was unilateral u s decision making inevitably u s nationalism had to break up the mirage of one world internationalism and with it any thought of an international court without veto power over the judges the u s never accepted the authority of any court in particular the united nations international court in the hague recently that court undertook an investigation into u s war crimes in afghanistan from its torture policies to bombing of civilian targets such as hospitals weddings and infrastructure that investigation ultimately found a reasonable basis to believe that war crimes and crimes against humanity 1 donald trump s national security adviser john bolton erupted in fury warning in september that the united states will use any means necessary to protect our citizens and those of our allies from unjust prosecution by this illegitimate court adding that the un international court must not be so bold as to investigate israel or other u s allies that prompted a senior judge christoph flügge from germany to resign in protest indeed bolton told the court to keep out of any affairs involving the united states promising to ban the court s judges and prosecutors from entering the united states as bolton spelled out the u s threat we will sanction their funds in the u s financial system and we will prosecute them in the u s criminal system we will not cooperate with the icc we will provide no assistance to the icc we will not join the icc we will let the icc die on its own after all for all intents and purposes the icc is already dead to us what this meant the german judge spelled out was that if these judges ever interfere in the domestic concerns of the u s or investigate an american citizen said the american government would do all it could to ensure that these judges would no longer be allowed to travel to the united states and that they would perhaps even be criminally prosecuted the original inspiration of the court to use the nuremburg laws that were applied against german nazis to bring similar prosecution against any country or officials found guilty of committing war crimes had already fallen into disuse with the failure to indict the authors of the chilean coup iran contra or the u s invasion of iraq for war crimes dismantling dollar hegemony from the imf to swift of all areas of global power politics today international finance and foreign investment have become the key flashpoint international monetary reserves were supposed to be the most sacrosanct and international debt enforcement closely associated central banks have long held their gold and other monetary reserves in the united states and london back in 1945 this seemed reasonable because the new york federal reserve bank in whose basement foreign central bank gold was kept was militarily safe and because the london gold pool was the vehicle by which the u s treasury kept the dollar as good as gold at 35 an ounce foreign reserves over and above gold were kept in the form of u s treasury securities to be bought and sold on the new york and london foreign exchange markets to stabilize exchange rates most foreign loans to governments were denominated in u s dollars so wall street banks were normally name as paying agents that was the case with iran under the shah whom the united states had installed after sponsoring the 1953 coup against mohammed mosaddegh when he sought to nationalize anglo iranian oil now british petroleum or at least tax it after the shah was overthrown the khomeini regime asked its paying agent the chase manhattan bank to use its deposits to pay its bondholders at the direction of the u s government chase refused to do so u s courts then declared iran to be in default and froze all its assets in the united states and anywhere else they were able this showed that international finance was an arm of the u s state department and pentagon but that was a generation ago and only recently did foreign countries begin to feel queasy about leaving their gold holdings in the united states where they might be grabbed at will to punish any country that might act in ways that u s diplomacy found offensive so last year germany finally got up the courage to ask that some of its gold be flown back to germany u s officials pretended to feel shocked at the insult that it might do to a civilized christian country what it had done to iran and germany agreed to slow down the transfer but then came venezuela desperate to spend its gold reserves to provide imports for its economy devastated by u s sanctions a crisis that u s diplomats blame on socialism not on u s political attempts to make the economy scream as nixon officials said of chile under salvador allende venezuela directed the bank of england to transfer some of its 11 billion in gold held in its vaults and those of other central banks in december 2018 this was just like a bank depositor would expect a bank to pay a check that the depositor had written england refused to honor the official request following the direction of bolton and u s secretary of state michael pompeo as bloomberg reported the u s officials are trying to steer venezuela s overseas assets to guaido to help bolster his chances of effectively taking control of the government the 1 2 billion of gold is a big chunk of the 8 billion in foreign reserves held by the venezuelan central bank 2 turkey seemed to be a likely destination prompting bolton and pompeo to warn it to desist from helping venezuela threatening sanctions against it or any other country helping venezuela cope with its economic crisis as for the bank of england and other european countries the bloomberg report concluded central bank officials in caracas have been ordered to no longer try contacting the bank of england these central bankers have been told that bank of england staffers will not respond to them this led to rumors that venezuela was selling 20 tons of gold via a russian boeing 777 some 840 million the money probably would have ended up paying russian and chinese bondholders as well as buying food to relieve the local famine 3 russia denied this report but reuters has confirmed is that venezuela has sold 3 tons of a planned 29 tones of gold to the united arab emirates with another 15 tones are to be shipped on friday february 1 4 the u s senate s batista cuban hardliner rubio accused this of being theft as if feeding the people to alleviate the u s sponsored crisis was a crime against u s diplomatic leverage if there is any country that u s diplomats hate more than a recalcitrant latin american country it is iran president trump s breaking of the 2015 nuclear agreements negotiated by european and obama administration diplomats has escalated to the point of threatening germany and other european countries with punitive sanctions if they do not also break the agreements they have signed coming on top of u s opposition to german and other european importing of russian gas the u s threat finally prompted europe to find a way to defend itself imperial threats are no longer military no country including russia or china can mount a military invasion of another major country since the vietnam era the only kind of war a democratically elected country can wage is atomic or at least heavy bombing such as the united states has inflicted on iraq libya and syria but now cyber warfare has become a way of pulling out the connections of any economy and the major cyber connections are financial money transfer ones headed by swift the acronym for the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication which is centered in belgium russia and china have already moved to create a shadow bank transfer system in case the united states unplugs them from swift but now european countries have come to realize that threats by bolton and pompeo may lead to heavy fines and asset grabs if they seek to continue trading with iran as called for in the treaties they have negotiated on january 31 the dam broke with the announcement that europe had created its own bypass payments system for use with iran and other countries targeted by u s diplomats germany france and even the u s poodle britain joined to create instex instrument in support of trade exchanges the promise is that this will be used only for humanitarian aid to save iran from a u s sponsored venezuela type devastation but in view of increasingly passionate u s opposition to the nord stream pipeline to carry russian gas this alternative bank clearing system will be ready and able to become operative if the united states tries to direct a sanctions attack on europe i have just returned from germany and seen a remarkable split between that nation s industrialists and their political leadership for years major companies have seen russia as a natural market a complementary economy needing to modernize its manufacturing and able to supply europe with natural gas and other raw materials america s new cold war stance is trying to block this commercial complementarity warning europe against dependence on low price russian gas it has offered to sell high priced lng from the united states via port facilities that do not yet exist in anywhere near the volume required president trump also is insisting that nato members spend a full 2 percent of their gdp on arms preferably bought from the united states not from german or french merchants of death u s overplaying its position is leading to the mackinder kissinger brzezinski eurasian nightmare that i mentioned above in addition to driving russia and china together u s diplomacy is adding europe to the heartland independent of u s ability to bully into the state of dependency toward which american diplomacy has aimed to achieve since 1945 the world bank for instance traditionally has been headed by a u s secretary of defense its steady policy since its inception is to provide loans for countries to devote their land to export crops instead of giving priority to feeding themselves that is why its loans are only in foreign currency not in the domestic currency needed to provide price supports and agricultural extension services such as have made u s agriculture so productive by following u s advice countries have left themselves open to food blackmail sanctions against providing them with grain and other food in case they step out of line with u s diplomatic demands it is worthwhile to note that our global imposition of the mythical efficiencies of forcing latin american countries to become plantations for export crops like coffee and bananas rather than growing their own wheat and corn has failed catastrophically to deliver better lives especially for those living in central america the spread between the export crops and cheaper food imports from the u s that was supposed to materialize for countries following our playbook failed miserably witness the caravans and refugees across mexico of course our backing of the most brutal military dictators and crime lords has not helped either likewise the imf has been forced to admit that its basic guidelines were fictitious from the beginning a central core has been to enforce payment of official inter government debt by withholding imf credit from countries under default this rule was instituted at a time when most official inter government debt was owed to the united states but a few years ago ukraine defaulted on 3 billion owed to russia the imf said in effect that ukraine and other countries did not have to pay russia or any other country deemed to be acting too independently of the united states the imf has been extending credit to the bottomless it of ukrainian corruption to encourage its anti russian policy rather than standing up for the principle that inter government debts must be paid it is as if the imf now operates out of a small room in the basement of the pentagon in washington europe has taken notice that its own international monetary trade and financial linkages are in danger of attracting u s anger this became clear last autumn at the funeral for george h w bush when the eu s diplomat found himself downgraded to the end of the list to be called to his seat he was told that the u s no longer considers the eu an entity in good standing in december mike pompeo gave a speech on europe in brussels his first and eagerly awaited in which he extolled the virtues of nationalism criticised multilateralism and the eu and said that international bodies which constrain national sovereignty must be reformed or eliminated 5 most of the above events have made the news in just one day january 31 2019 the conjunction of u s moves on so many fronts against venezuela iran and europe not to mention china and the trade threats and moves against huawei also erupting today looks like this will be a year of global fracture it is not all president trump s doing of course we see the democratic party showing the same colors instead of applauding democracy when foreign countries do not elect a leader approved by u s diplomats whether it is allende or maduro they ve let the mask fall and shown themselves to be the leading new cold war imperialists it s now out in the open they would make venezuela the new pinochet era chile trump is not alone in supporting saudi arabia and its wahabi terrorists acting as lyndon johnson put it bastards but they re our bastards where is the left in all this that is the question with which i opened this article how remarkable it is that it is only right wing parties alternative for deutschland afd or marine le pen s french nationalists and those of other countries that are opposing nato militarization and seeking to revive trade and economic links with the rest of eurasia the end of our monetary imperialism about which i first wrote in 1972 in super imperialism stuns even an informed observer like me it took a colossal level of arrogance short sightedness and lawlessness to hasten its decline something that only crazed neocons like john bolton elliott abrams and mike pompeo could deliver for donald trump notes alexander

radiation and oncology group that selected our eim platform to connect their oncology systems real time to accelerate cancer treatment plans on a business network we re pleased to welcome coca cola and fedex enabling global digital supply chains and within ot2 we had nice wins at bose and the u k nhs both for external review and collaboration ps was up in margin down in revenue the general trend is that we expect ps revenue to remain consistent on an absolute basis though we are gradually transitioning out of lower value work we ll always optimize for high value implementation services that garner higher margin this strategy is proving effective as noted with ps margins at 24 during the quarter lastly well we completed the acquisition of catalyst systems today it was a solid q2 these results reflect quintessential aspects of our long term strategy and thinking opentext has a unique point of view we see a 100 billion addressable market for enterprise information management software or eim we intend to capture that opportunity through m a organic growth distribution expansion strategic and disciplined capital allocation and upper quartile productivity as reflected in our margins and cash flows i can t emphasize enough how strong 42 adjusted ebitda in the quarter is when we purchase companies we unlock their value we do that through integration we do that by providing a global distribution platform we do that by instilling operating discipline via the opentext way we do it by innovating we take businesses from the challenger quadrant to the leadership quadrant and in fact we emerge as the powerhouse in our recurring revenues in the cloud other consolidators have proven that they can deploy capital for sure but that alone is not a successful formula you must also integrate and innovate deliver high roic and high roic and integration and innovation to us is that perfect trifecta as a consolidator we ve also through time believed that eim is as important as erp eim is the digital platform enabling global businesses to compete and win in the fourth industrial revolution the eim margin market is large strategic and is still a young market we were ranked no 1 in business network by idc and no 1 in content services by gartner both of whom published at the end of calendar 2018 we are leading in eim customers want to purchase from leaders from opentext and they want to purchase a suite of products not a series of point solutions our intelligent and connected enterprise messaging is relevant and transformative in resonating with customers over the next five years we expect to invest near 2 billion in organic r d for eim and much more than that in acquisitions we re all in to win eim and most important the greatest opportunity for opentext today in our unique business model and our unique approach to intelligent total growth is the opentext cloud let me expand on this cloud is less than 20 penetrated within our installed base today the super majority of all enterprise workloads still run off cloud our business is scaling to 1 billion year run rate in the cloud and scale matters we own and operate the opentext cloud from 37 data centers in nine countries and thus we control our own service our own features our own capabilities our own certifications on a global basis we can demonstrate massive improvement value to our customers for migrating into the opentext cloud whether a customer is trying to grow revenues get into a new market or cut costs opentext will always be the best possible will always be in the best possible position to run operate and secure opentext software in the opentext cloud so customers don t have to we are just beginning to partner with google cloud platform amazon aws and microsoft azure these are untapped go to market opportunities for us the opentext cloud strategy is unique and diversified and we see it in three core offerings the first is our business network connecting business to business application to application liaison strengthens the business network we see then the second part the private cloud via managed services we now have 2 000 global customers running in our private cloud and i believe we can double this business over the next five years catalyst strengthens our private cloud and we have the third part the public cloud as part of ot2 ot2 is deeply integrated into our off cloud solutions it will compete stand alone as a public saas offering and will compete against pure play saas providers that s our three part strategy to our cloud continuing on why this is our greatest opportunity over a third of our pipeline today is now cloud we have over 6 000 professionals educated trained and certified on the opentext cloud we now have 63 000 customers running in the opentext cloud as i mentioned 2 000 global businesses running in the private cloud got 50 new private cloud customers in the quarter are key names like fedex coca cola and we are very profitable in the opentext cloud the greatest opportunity we have is the opentext cloud both liaison and catalyst significantly enhance that opportunity as they are recurring cloud revenue businesses and leading in their respective markets moving on a little bit to m a we closed liaison on december 17 and we re very pleased with the reaction from customers employees and trading partners we have the opportunity to expand our b2b integration capabilities and to a new and expanding market of application to application integration as newly deployed cloud applications require significant integration to both cloud and off cloud applications and workloads we purchased liaison for approximately usd 311 million trailing 12 month revenues were approximately 100 million in our first year of operations we expect revenue down 15 to 20 or 15 million to 20 million due to ppa and normal integration disruption for the second half of fiscal 2019 we expect approximately 41 million in revenue contribution and expect a negative 100 bps of adjusted ebitda impact in q3 and q4 liaison will be in our offering model within the first year of operations this is a strategic cloud acquisition and we have a strong growth thesis in the years to come as we work through the first year of integration that thesis includes bringing the technology to europe integrating to gxs and bringing self service application to application capabilities to the opentext installed base we announced closing catalyst repository systems today catalyst is the leading provider of ediscovery solutions in the u s legal industry addressing both in house legal organizations as well as leading law firms they are based in denver colorado with 150 employees catalyst plus recommind plus edocs put opentext in a leading position to address this key multibillion dollar legal tech vertical the legal industry is ready for digital and cloud transformation and we re in a fantastic position to capture that opportunity we purchased catalyst for approximately usd 75 million trailing 12 month cloud revenues were approximately 45 million in our first year of operations we expect revenue down 15 to 20 or 7 million to 9 million due to ppa and normal integration disruption for the second half of fiscal 2019 we expect approximately 14 million in revenue contribution catalyst will be on our operating model within the first 12 for within the first year of operations and we expect then to expand in the market from there we have an opportunity to expand our operations into europe grow our customer base in the top 200 law firms and large enterprise corporations combined this is 385 million of capital deployed 145 million of trailing 12 month revenues before first year ppa and normal integration disruption or 2 3 times revenue multiple with expected roic in the high teens let me transition and turn our attention to quarterly factors these are the short term factors to help you model the business they have little bearing on the long term strategic nature of the business but could affect short term 90 day cycles as i stated earlier our business is annual and quarters will vary so we are focused on our annual results calendar q1 or our fiscal q3 is our seasonally low quarter for revenue and adjusted ebitda to put that into more context calendar q1 fiscal q3 is a story of a new fiscal year for the vast majority of the market and budgets are typically just being planned and finalized and then the spend ramps through the calendar year included in our quarterly factors there are concerns for global recession as those concerns continue the after effects of the u s government shutdown and perhaps another shutdown in weeks trade wars and tariffs goods and wage inflation and front and center remains brexit gdpr and data regulation concerns continuing our quarterly factors the u s dollar continues to strengthen against the euro pound canadian dollar and yen we continue to expect a negative revenue impact due to foreign exchange in fiscal 2019 when compared to currency rates a year ago and lastly in our quarterly factors is the opentext cloud investments liaison to negatively impact adjusted ebitda margin by approximately 100 bps in q3 and q4 and our continued cloud investments focused on operations and integration i d like to leave you with three key points in my prepared remarks today first is the cloud is our greatest opportunity we re on a 1 billion run rate for the cloud on an annual basis 60 000 customers 2 000 private cloud customers only 20 penetrated in our installed base and we have scale nine countries 37 data centers second key point i d like to leave you with today is that we completed two acquisitions two key acquisitions over the last 60 days we put 385 million of capital to work smartly all from cash on hand we ve acquired 145 million of trailing 12 month revenues all in the cloud high teens roic expected 2 3 times revenue multiples third key point i d like to leave you with today is here in the shorter term it was a solid quarter total revenues of 735 million arr of 530 million up 3 adjusted ebitda of 42 or 308 million u s dollars operating cash flow of 190 million up 14 resulting in positive organic growth so lastly m a continues to be our leading growth driver supported by organic growth we continue to track to our fiscal 2019 model organic growth and f 21 aspirations of adjusted ebitda and ocf goals and a shifting landscape we plan to take share from our competitors we re ready for all economic scenarios and position to ensure all our stakeholders win and please be mindful of our quarterly factors as you model the company in the shorter term it is my pleasure to hand the call over to our cfo madhu madhu madhu ranganathan chief financial officer mark thank you and hello and thank you all for joining us today during q2 we maintained a laser focus on operations and productivity in every line of business and it shows in our results and turning to the details of our quarterly results and similar to prior quarters my references will be compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year total revenue for the quarter was 735 million up 0 1 or up 1 5 on a constant currency basis as we look as we continue to look at our business on an annual basis and let me note that year to date total revenue was 1 4 billion up 2 or 2 9 on a constant currency basis the geographical split of revenues for the quarter was americas 57 emea 33 and apj 10 consistent with the prior year annual recurring revenue was 530 million for the quarter up 2 6 or 3 9 on a constant currency basis our cloud revenue was particularly strong in the quarter at 219 million up 5 3 or 6 3 on a constant currency basis we also generated 67 9 million in new mcv up slightly compared to 65 1 million in q2 last year our customer support revenue was 310 million up 0 7 or up 2 2 on a constant currency basis we delivered 133 million in license revenues down 1 8 and essentially flat on a constant currency basis our professional services revenues were 73 million down from 83 million 12 2 or 10 1 on a constant currency basis turning to the details of our margin performance in q2 as you can see by our improved adjusted gross margins and adjusted ebitda margin we continue to maintain a clear and deep operating view into all aspects of our business gaap gross margin for the quarter was 69 up 170 basis points adjusted gross margin for the quarter was at a record of 76 up 180 basis points with consistent improvement and most evident in our annual recurring revenue lines cloud was 60 up from 57 last year our customer support was 90 up 89 from last year and license margin was 97 stable compared to last year and professional services margin was 24 up from 23 last year our adjusted ebitda was 308 million in the quarter up 6 year over year adjusted ebitda margin was 42 another record for opentext and an increase of approximately 200 basis points compared to 40 in the prior fiscal year year to date adjusted ebitda was 555 million up 9 compared to the same period last year adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was 0 80 on a diluted basis up 5 from 0 76 per share for the same period last year gaap net income for the quarter was 104 million or 0 39 per share on a diluted basis up from 85 million or 0 32 per share for the same period last year operating cash flows for the quarter were 189 million up 14 year over year year to date operating cash flows were 361 million up 54 from the same period last year during the second quarter dso was 59 days compared to 63 days in the same quarter last year while dsos can vary quarter to quarter we had a very good q2 turning to the balance sheet we ended the quarter with 595 million of cash net of the 311 million payment for liaison acquisition our balance sheet and liquidity position remain very strong and as of december 31 our consolidated net leverage ratio was 1 9 times this is well within our external debt covenant ratio of 4 times and provides us with meaningful capacity to continue executing our total growth strategy an update on restructuring during our q4 call we outlined a restructuring initiative which was successfully initiated during q1 and largely completed as of q2 timing of the same work and execution could not be better our current estimate of savings is consistent with our updates during last quarter and impact of restructuring already factored in our fiscal 2019 target model full benefits of approximately 50 million are expected to be realized in fiscal 2020 and beyond and with respect to the irs matter we received final notice from the irs on substantially the same terms with what we ve been expecting and what we have been communicating to you as we have said in the past resolving these matters take time but we continue to strongly disagree with the irs positions and we are vigorously contesting them turning to foreign exchange at the start of the fiscal year we noted that foreign exchange would have a negative impact to revenue in fiscal 2019 of approximately 60 million compared to the prior year as we look at the rates today and the geo level of components of our business we see no change to that annual impact this has been primarily driven by the u s dollar strength against the euro the pound the canadian dollar and the yen as you can see from our press release we have realized about 12 million of that 60 million annual number to date meaning we anticipate the biggest currency impact to be in the second half of fiscal 2019 that is consistent with what we saw during the second half of fiscal 2018 where the rates are most advantageous to our results now the prospectus on our operating model as mark mentioned in his commentary calendar q1 our fiscal q3 is our seasonally low quarter for revenue and adjusted ebitda margin this is an important section in that we share with you additional specifics for you to consider as you model us our fiscal q3 also being the first quarter of a new calendar year we will be recording typical annual increases to payroll and related cost which will impact all expense categories cost of sales and operating expenses by approximately 3 when you compare to q2 levels with respect to gross margins on license customer support cloud services and professional services on an annual basis we expect to remain within the range of our fy 19 target model on r d expenses as we integrate liaison and catalyst acquisitions we expect a 15 increase sequentially to r d expenses on a full quarter basis in q3 while we expect to remain within the range of our fy 19 target model sales and marketing as a reminder certain expenses as commissions and incentives they follow revenue goals and increase as the year progresses based on quota attainments as is typical of a technology company onboarding liaison and catalyst reduces our adjusted ebitda margin by about 100 basis points during the third and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and consistent with the past practice our objective is to bring both acquisitions into our target operating model within a period of 12 months our interest expenses remain as noted in our fy 19 target model of 144 million to 149 million our adjusted tax rate remains at 14 in summary q2 is a peak margin for the year while q3 is a low point and q4 is a seasonally strong margin quarter albeit below q2 levels we suggest you continue to build out your models for the remainder of the year accordingly to summarize no changes to our annual ranges in our fiscal 2019 target model which as a reminder is in the investor presentation posted on our ir website turning to our long term targets as mark mentioned we remain focused on fiscal 2021 targets adjusted ebitda margin in fiscal 2021 of 38 to 40 and operating cash flows target of 1 billion annually as we exit fiscal 2021 as i wrap up my prepared remarks then let me revisit our communication framework shared with you first in july of last year and reiterated in october we provide information to help you model opentext in a way that s closely aligned to how we see the business and reduce unnecessary short term trading volatility for our long term shareholders and within the framework we provide two metrics at the end of each fiscal year on a historical basis annual organic growth and return on invested capital roic q2 results are a great reflection of the excellent work with the opentext team continuing to achieve best in class levels of productivity a big thank you to the entire team we look forward to sharing our continued progress with you our long term shareholders whose trust and confidence we value during february and march we plan to engage with our investors and analysts through conferences and one on one meetings in canada the united states and europe we re especially looking forward to sharing the opentext story in europe which is an excellent geographical footprint for us in terms of customers partners and employees please do connect with greg secord for more information i would now like to open the call for questions operator questions and answers operator the first question comes from stephanie price of cibc please go ahead stephanie price cibc world markets analyst good afternoon mark barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer hi steph stephanie price cibc world markets analyst hi obviously acquisition spending has been very slow in the last couple of months can you talk a bit about the acquisition environment and what you re seeing in terms of the pipeline of large and small deals mark barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer yes stephanie thanks for the question as we come here into calendar 19 the top of the pipeline activity is stronger i think with market volatility the or the tail end of the effects of the u s tax rate increases from last year and i think as markets kind of lean a little more toward volatility it advantages buyers consolidators like ourselves so we have high capacity top of the pipeline activity is stronger and we re going to remain very strategic and disciplined in how we do due diligence and effectuate acquisitions but as we talked about last time i think last call i do think calendar 19 is going to see more activity in the market stephanie price cibc world markets analyst great and then in terms of revenues you obviously came in at the top end of the guidance you provided for the quarter can you give us some color on some of the sources of strength with the cross selling geographic regions that were strong mark barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer i ll point to one of the key highlights in the call which is the cloud license performed well for sure what we ve talked about over the last few calls is that we re going to tap the accelerator on the opentext cloud so more focused on training and education and certification of our 12 000 employees bringing more capability to market some upgrade of services in our managed services new ot2 platform so i d really point to the cloud and how we re looking to tap on the accelerator we re also executing very well in our off cloud business just the very the ep series is showing extreme strength and stickiness if you will and that s translating into our an off cloud renewal rate in the low 90s and a great margin performance that s really reflective of the strength of our off cloud business as well so i d point to those two things and looking at the arr up near 3 year over year stephanie price cibc world markets analyst great and maybe i ll sneak one more in now that you ve had covisint and guidance for a little over a year can you talk about any positive or negative surprises that came into the integration and what you ve seen in terms of cross selling mark barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer yes fair enough i ll take them maybe one at a time covisint when we purchased covisint they were shrinking and losing money and we felt we could arrest that decline and turn them profitable and we ve done that and it s and that s reflected on our 42 blended adjusted ebitda we have a great opportunity in internet of things and i have got one reflection on covisint is i m still very hopeful that the the base business is exactly what we expected and we always had to serve an upside thesis around the internet of things and we re still very hopeful around it we re beginning to win new identity and access management business iam business i think we call it yam actually as an acronym i a m and we ve learned a lot about okta o k t a probably the primary competitor in the identity and access management space so i know i don t talk a lot about them that s sort of the space we re going to target in identity and access management on guidance software it s we re very pleased with the security aspects of it we didn t enter guidance for their ediscovery capabilities part of the thesis was they had outsourced all their renewals and we had insourced that and bring that into our mechanism we ve now completed that that might have taken one or two quarters a little longer than we wanted to do so those will be my reflections right covisint is what we thought it would be on the base business and still has its upside in identity and access management as well as iot we love the security aspects of guidance and we re sort of completing the and we ve completed the insourcing of the renewals business there s still great promise on the security side stephanie price cibc world markets analyst great thank you very much operator the next question comes from richard tse of national bank financial please go ahead sir richard tse national bank financial analyst thank you i m actually surprised to see you have so much opportunity in your longer standing titles like catalyst and the discovery market my question is are you thinking more about fortifying those silos or would you ever kind of consider expanding into new market segments here mark barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer richard thanks for the question ok look we have really kind of think of this in two vectors we continue microsoft speaks broadly around a horizontal platform and i think that s a good narrative and a good place to learn where we have great opportunity to be this horizontal platform for content services business network application to application integration and identity and access management it doesn t need a lot of verticalization the other vector is word collapse and there are a variety of really key industries for us financial services which is our largest industry retail and cpg which a lot of strength came from gxs we re strong in engineering and construction and there s a whole set of verticals healthcare government but the legal tech sector is a great vertical it s sort of where the content rich process oriented high security needs around information ai analytics deep machine learning the legal vertical is estimated to be about 3 5 billion in size so we re going to go out and prosecute all these key verticals for us as through the years we re strong in financial services today manufacturing auto has always been a strong industry we re building strength in legal tech and i think you ll continue to see us both build on our own and acquire on a vertical basis richard tse national bank financial analyst ok and i think in your conference call in march you talked about coca cola and fedex and i think just from a supply chain perspective i m just wondering if you can sort of elaborate on that a little bit just a bit more color mark barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer sure so if we look at coca cola it s certainly on supply chain and distribution fedex is more logistics and transportation richard tse national bank financial analyst and that s what was that so it s like sort of loading all of the data related to that into your cloud or if you could put just a bit more color if you have mark barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer yes fair enough let me let s think what we can publish out there richard on both the customers and see how we can get into more depth so once you leave us with that then maybe we ll get a case study out on both of them richard tse national bank financial analyst all right i ll leave that thanks operator the next question comes from phillip huang of barclays please go ahead sir phillip huang barclays investment bank analyst hi thanks good afternoon and congrats on the second quarter mark you pointed to continued global recession concerns in your remarks similar to the last quarterly call i just wanted to sort of get an update on your visibility on any impact to your pipeline or what your visibility is to for the business mark barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer yes fair enough yes i called it out last quarter in our quarterly factors i ll call it out again and what i m calling out is just sort of a general sentiment if we look at the world economic forum and many of the headlines that came out of davos over the last two weeks the sentiment is quite different than a year ago now we haven t seen it impact our pipeline we haven t seen it affect our business at this point but i think it s worthy of calling out that it remains a concern and it s more in the headlines of all the papers that we read but we re not yet affected or calling out a change in our pipeline phillip huang barclays investment bank analyst got it that s helpful and then maybe one for liaison obviously you re paying a pricing i guess multiple that is above your historical average i just wanted to maybe get your sense on what are some of the things that we should be aware of that supported the valuations of the deal the strategic rationale obviously makes a lot of sense just wondering on the financial side whether you also expect to see above average growth and or margins once the business is fully integrated mark barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer yes fair enough and it s a good question i think it s always important to look at deals both on their own and in a basket right and in a basket with catalyst 385 million of capital deployed 145 million of trailing 12 month revenues or 2 3 times multiple so i think that s well one that basket of two deals is important around 2 3 times standalone it s just under 3 3 times so it s a little closer to the range higher end of the range of the hp acquisitions that we did ultimately it s about roic right return on invested capital and we believe this will return a high teens roic to us and catalyst will be even slightly better than that when we get it integrated into our model but to support kind of the very high 2s if you will on liaison we re going to grow it and part of that thesis is they re not yet in europe and we got a strong basis in europe with gxs so we can bring the technology to europe i think one of the best comparisons in the market is a mulesoft of how mule is doing application to application level integration we don t have those capabilities today we re we didn t have them before liaison we were more kind of deeper of this edi transaction talking to this edi transaction versus a repository of all these rules of how does sap talk to docusign right how does oracle speak to adobe and you can think of a database of 4 000 5 000 application integration rules that we can now sit in the business network and allow our million plus trading partners to say how does app talk to app versus edi protocol talk to edi protocol we think that s a big opportunity that app to app level integration so our case here is once we get through the first year and we get through our ppa and integration disruption which is typical of all the deals we do we have a strong plan to grow the revenue phillip huang barclays investment bank analyst got it no that s very helpful and then maybe one for madhu just looking at the seasonality for the two acquisitions it looks likely liaison you re expecting 41 million in the back half of 19 which seemed like pretty evenly split between the quarters but catalyst seemed like it s seasonally a little bit lighter in the back half of the fiscal year am i reading that correctly just even after adjusting for the ppa madhu ranganathan chief financial officer thanks for the question yes and a little bit no catalyst is two months out of this quarter and three months in the last quarter right like liaison we closed in the middle of december so you see kind of the month effect and plus some seasonality but i would definitely take the one month timing into consideration phillip huang barclays investment bank analyst got it thank you very much madhu ranganathan chief financial officer thank you operator the next question comes from thanos moschopoulos of bmo capital markets please go ahead thanos moschopoulos bmo capital markets analyst hi good afternoon mark can you update us on the traction you re getting with the ot2 since i think it s been a couple of quarters since you launched it was that a contributor to the cloud strength this quarter or is it still relatively early days for that offering mark barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer yes it s still relatively early we had a couple of nice we had a few nice wins for sure that we re calling out but it s still thanos still early days the stronger contribution was certainly on the value added network and on demand messaging and the business network very strong contribution from the private cloud but a beginning contribution from ot2 hightail actually did well within the quarter our own new and native saas ot2 apps bose and u k nhs so it s still early days but they contributed but ot2 contributed thanos moschopoulos bmo capital markets analyst ok good to hear and you mentioned that you would expect ps revenue to be stable going forward it sounds like that s a decision to offload more of that lower margin work to your partners is that having an impact with respect to partner engagement and the level of new license and cloud bookings coming through that channel or would you expect to change on that front going forward as a result of them doing more of the work mark barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer yes it s a good question it s exactly as you highlighted it we still may have a little pressure on the revenue line as we continue to transition out maybe lower value services now value s in the eye of the beholder right what we view as lower value is high value to a partner because it s more in their implementation thesis what we want to do is to be the experts in opentext and getting the big value out of opentext software versus maybe some run rate implementation services so value is in the eye of the beholder but what we view as low value we are transitioning to partners they like it helps them build more demand so it s a nice virtuous cycle that flows so maybe a little still a little more pressure on the revenue line but in general the absolute dollar performance should remain consistent and again right it that strategy produced 24 margin in q2 so we re it s the right strategy for us thanos moschopoulos bmo capital markets analyst ok just a question for madhu madhu when you re talking about the q3 factors you said licenses would be within the range of the 2019 operating model did you mean for q3 specifically or did you mean on a full year basis madhu ranganathan chief financial officer i meant on a full year basis thanos moschopoulos bmo capital markets analyst ok thank you madhu ranganathan chief financial officer thank you mark barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer and operator as we go into our next question i d just like to touch base on what richard asked for richard on coca cola it s really kind of core coca cola talking to bottlers now on our business network and in fedex it s really fleet management so i just wanted that out thank you operator operator the next question comes from paul steep who s from scotia capital please go ahead sir paul steep scotia capital analyst mark can you talk a little bit about cloud you talked about the pipeline being a third cloud driven can you talk about what the momentum looks like across the broader set are you getting seeing that start to pull through i know you ve always been agnostic but how that s developing and what changes you re maybe making in the sales force around that mark barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer paul thanks for the question we re we still see the world as hybrid and hybrid is the destination it s not a waypoint so i again in the 60 40 40 60 i m not ready to say 70 30 but there s no doubt that when i look at for opentext today the greatest opportunity is cloud we re only 20 penetrated into the installed base today whether it be for business network managed services ot2 is so young and new we haven t even begun to tap the opportunity with the hyperscalers so it doesn t change our thesis of hybrid but unequivocally the greatest opportunity for the company today is driving the adoption of the network of the private cloud in new and native saas workloads paul steep scotia capital analyst great two quick follow ups for madhu largely here cloud margins at 60 we saw a rebound there is that exceptional in terms of anything unusual in the quarter should we think of that as achievable going forward and then the other one for you with regards to irs can you just remind us of what were at dollar was for the contested value and then maybe a broad brush of what the next step actually is madhu ranganathan chief financial officer sure thing i ll take the second one first we are at i think through the 770 million in terms of our estimated exposure right again it s a disclosure item and as a follow up to that as we as i ve stated in my prepared remarks we continue to stand very strongly by our positions our technical positions and we continue to be as you have said contesting the amounts and the irs thesis on it back to cloud margin what i would say is that we did really well as mark mentioned we are going to invest in the cloud so it s going to be it s going to depend on the business need and what happens in one quarter versus the other and as you know we are onboarding liaison and catalyst into the business and they are both cloud services and hence our direction that think about the cloud margins still on an annual basis in the 57 and the 59 we have on our fy 19 target model paul steep scotia capital analyst thank you madhu ranganathan chief financial officer sure thing operator the next question comes from matthew wells with citi please go ahead matthew wells citi hi good afternoon on the backdrop of m a integration and the 100 bps headwind it looks like you maintained the ebitda margin expectations of 36 to 38 and does this account for catalyst integration headwinds and what gives you confidence here mark barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer yes matthew thanks for the question yes we to answer your question it factors in catalyst for sure i said we ll get them on our operating model within the first 12 months might get there actually a little sooner right so we re not calling out catalyst for any special effect if you will here liaison is a little larger if you will so in q3 and q4 it will have a slight impact to the growth basically of adjusted ebitda so we re confident in the range of 36 to 38 we got great visibility into our expense run rate we re very disciplined in that visibility we know the investments in hand we only got five months to go right until the end of the year so it s the visibility it s our integration history and expertise we can have great visibility into catalyst and liaison so we re confident in the 36 to 38 on the year matthew wells citi ok that s really helpful and then switching gears i just have a question on as opentext continues to partner with public cloud providers how are you investing on the opportunity and do you see any risk of clients churning from the opentext cloud to these providers mark barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer yes it s an interesting question we own and operate our own infrastructure we ve been we ve built our ot we have acquired and built our cloud from 0 over the last six years we worked from 0 to almost 1 billion run rate annually so we ve got a lot of experience over the last year the first workload that we think the hyperscalers can help us with help our customers with is the sort of secondary and tertiary workloads around disaster recovery backup we re not in every market today but google s and various markets so is aws so i think with those secondary almost and sometimes tertiary workloads of discovery sorry dr backup they re going to be helpful with when we put our private cloud our public cloud is not going to run on a hyperscaler so ot2 is not intended to run on a hyperscaler so it s our private cloud and when we have certain workloads google is the closest customers will still get a better sla from opentext and but a good enough sla in a third party cloud environment and that s ok with us we still want to win that the software platform the opentext software piece a third party can t win that we re going to win we re going to provide the application performance management and then the transformation services to leverage and use our software so we re going after that value stack not the hosted piece if you will with the hyperscalers so there s really no risk to lose anything it s sort of a trade off of sla is whether you run in the opentext cloud or run in a hyperscaler matthew wells citi thanks that s it it s great color operator this concludes the question and answer session i would now like to hand the call back over to mr barrenechea for any closing remarks mark barrenechea chief executive officer and chief technology officer very good well i d like to thank you for joining us today and i d like to conclude by leaving you with three things our top three messages that we wanted to convey today is that the opentext cloud is the greatest opportunity in front of us two we ve completed two acquisitions over the last 60 days and again put 380 million of capital to work for a trailing 12 month revenues of 145 million all cloud revenue high teens roic expected 2 3 times revenue multiple and in the shorter term it was a very solid quarter with arr of 530 million up 3 and adjusted ebitda of 42 and operating cash flow of 190 million up 14 resulting in

by marius zaharia hong kong reuters factory activity shrank across much of asia in january falling to the weakest in years in several countries and adding to worries that trade tariffs and cooling demand in china pose an increasing threat to global growth the weak purchasing managers index pmi readings reinforce expectations that central banks in asia will put any further interest rate hikes on hold this year in some countries such as china australia and india there is even chatter about potential rate cuts trade focused asia appears to be suffering the most visible loss of momentum so far

reasonable deal then we can actually avert this potential trade recession but at the moment it s all tentative u s president donald trump said on thursday he will meet with chinese president xi jinping soon to try to seal a comprehensive trade deal as trump and his top trade negotiator both cited substantial progress in two days of high level talks trump speaking at the white house during a meeting with chinese vice premier liu he said he was optimistic that the world s two largest economies could reach the biggest deal ever made meanwhile bleak factory gauges suggests that the global economy will get worse before it gets better china s factory activity shrank the most in almost three years in january as new orders slumped further and output fell the private caixin markit pmi survey showed the numbers were weaker than thursday s official pmi survey but both suggested the economy is continuing to slow in the new year taiwan posted its weakest readings since september 2015 south korea the joint lowest since november 2016 and indonesia the first contraction in a year japan s factory activity was the slowest in 29 months with weakening exports and output suggesting it

conscious chinese tourists are expected to chose destinations closer to home for the upcoming week off rather than more expensive trips to places such as australia or new zealand a reuters poll of hundreds of economists from around the world showed a synchronised global economic slowdown was under way with growth forecasts cut for 33 of 46 economies the international monetary fund last week cut its world growth forecasts for this year and next and said failure to resolve protectionism could further destabilise the slowing global economy those concerns were reinforced on monday by sales

new year holidays many firms scale back operations or close for long periods around the holidays which begin on feb 4 this year however workers business owners and labour activists have told reuters that companies are shutting earlier than usual as the trade war bites with some likely to close for good so far china has fast tracked infrastructure projects cut taxes and pumped liquidity into the financial system to help keep cash starved firms afloat it has also been guiding down borrowing costs investors are closely watching to see if beijing unveils more fiscal stimulus during the upcoming parliamentary meeting in march including bigger tax cuts though the effects of policy easing are not expected to stabilise the economy until the second half of the year chinese leaders with an eye on a mountain of debt have vowed they will not resort to massive stimulus like that deployed in past downturns but some analysts believe more aggressive measures such as rate cuts are possible if conditions rapidly sour although we believe china s gdp growth will eventually bottom out markets do not appear to have factored in such a sharp slowdown and may still be putting in our opinion too much faith in the efficacy of government support economists at nomura said in a recent note even then some economists say support measures may only steady activity in china and not produce a strong rebound in its demand like that which helped pull the global economy out of recession after the financial crisis the global outlook is a bit more at risk from china today than it was say two or three

hansa trust lon benefited from the diversification of its portfolio in 2018 with its strategic holding in brazilian maritime services firm wilson sons wson and its defensive allocation to hedge funds helping it to post a small positive nav return in contrast to most world equity markets fund manager alec letchfield is mindful of the challenges facing the global economy in the year ahead but remains cautiously optimistic for a more positive investment backdrop letchfield has transitioned hansa trust to a more dynamic approach over the past five years and the portfolio is now made up of five principal segments ocean wilsons holdings owhl which includes the wson stake core regional funds thematic funds diversifying funds including hedge funds and direct global equities as hansa trust and owhl both trade at a discount to nav investors effectively gain exposure to 1 56 of assets for each 1 invested investment strategy diversified and specialist hansa trust seeks to preserve and grow capital by holding a diversified global portfolio of equities and funds alongside a long term strategic investment in ocean wilsons holdings owhl which itself owns a majority stake in brazilian maritime services company wilson sons lead manager alec letchfield sets the overall allocation and selects the funds which are largely specialist vehicles including regional equity thematic and hedge funds that individual investors would otherwise be unable or unlikely to own the direct equity portion is managed by rob royle market outlook positives amid uncertainty after a strong year in 2017 buoyed by synchronised global economic growth and ample liquidity many asset markets saw declines in 2018 while the factors that caused the volatility us protectionism monetary tightening slowing growth and geopolitical worries in the uk and eu have not entirely abated any positive developments could cause a relief rally particularly given more attractive company valuations however given the uncertain outlook prudent investors may prefer to take a more diversified approach to limit correlation with equity market returns valuation building awareness to narrow the discount at 30 january hansa trust s a shares traded at a 29 0 discount to cum income nav with the ordinary shares at a 23 4 discount the a share discount is broadly in line with the one three and five year averages although markedly narrower than the 10 year high of 36 9 seen in mid 2016 the board seeks to reduce the discount by raising awareness and understanding of the trust rather than by undertaking share buybacks which would reduce the asset base and inflate the size of the owhl holding as a percentage of total assets hansa trust currently yields 1 6 investment trusts market outlook potential for positive surprise volatility returned to the world s stock markets in 2018 after a year in which investor optimism about synchronised global economic growth translated into steady gains for most equity indices for sterling based investors the brexit induced weakness of the currency limited losses in some cases translating into small gains on overseas assets but even given uk companies high proportion of overseas earnings the broad index produced a negative total return of 9 5 for the calendar year as shown in exhibit 2 left hand chart uk investors have been better served by investing globally over the decade since the global financial crisis although the majority of gains have come from the us which now makes up c 50 or more of most global equity indices the factors that made investors nervous in 2018 central bank tightening slowing global growth particularly in china protectionist trade policies emanating from the us and the geopolitical fallout from the uk s failure so far to agree an acceptable deal for leaving the european union have not gone away what will perhaps define the coming year in asset markets is not just how these themes develop but how investors choose to react to them while global gdp growth right hand chart is forecast to slow the international monetary fund has recently revised its 2019 estimate down to 3 5 from 3 7 the world economy is still growing above the trend of the past 10 years advanced economies are forecast to grow by 2 0 in 2019 before slowing in 2020 and emerging markets 4 5 growth forecast for 2019 remain an important engine for the world economy with the us federal reserve signalling a more measured pace of monetary tightening a ceasefire in donald trump s trade war with the rest of the world and the possibility that a no deal brexit may be avoided there is potential for equity markets to surprise on the upside particularly if corporate earnings growth remains positive however with so much uncertainty still in the picture investors may prefer to take a more diversified multi asset approach to introduce an element of downside protection fund profile unique structure with alignment of interest hansa trust began life in 1912 as the scottish mercantile which was one of several investment companies acquired by the merchant bank rea brothers itself controlled by the salomon family in the 1950s the salomon family remain majority owners of hansa trust s 8 0m ordinary shares as well as holding a smaller number of the non voting a shares hansa trust is managed by the salomon family office hansa capital partners with alec letchfield as lead portfolio manager the trust has a somewhat unusual structure see exhibit 3 as its largest asset is a c 26 holding in ocean wilsons holdings owhl which was acquired by rea brothers in the late 1950s owhl which is listed on the london stock exchange in turn owns a majority stake in brazilian maritime services company wilson sons which has listings on the sao paulo and luxembourg stock exchanges owhl owns a portfolio of funds ocean wilsons investments or owil which is also advised by hansa capital partners hansa trust s asset ownership structure is illustrated in exhibit 3 both hansa trust and owhl as a holding company trade at a discount to the underlying value of their assets shown in exhibit 4 the look through nav at 29 january 2019 is c 10 7 higher than hansa trust s reported cum income nav the owhl investment including wson and owil has become a major part of the hansa trust portfolio largely as a result of wson s strong historical performance and made up 33 1 of net assets 20 4 wson and 12 7 owil at 31 december 2018 the balance of the hansa trust portfolio is invested in a blend of third party funds and direct global equities with the aim of achieving long term preservation and growth of capital from a spread of investments that individual investors would be unable or unlikely to access there is a degree of overlap between the owil and hansa trust fund holdings although owil also has an allocation of around one third of its assets to private equity and private debt funds hansa trust is a member of the association of investment companies aic flexible investment sector it has no benchmark but measures its performance against a range of key performance indicators kpis including the total returns from uk and global stock markets uk government bonds and the annual rate of uk cpi inflation while the trust has a 30m gearing facility this remains undrawn the fund manager alec letchfield the manager s view seeking balance in uncertain times letchfield notes that after a banner year for markets in 2017 the past year was a rare period in which all asset classes equities bonds real assets and commodities saw negative returns while this was a nightmare scenario for multi asset investors the manager notes that the hansa trust portfolio did relatively well in the challenging conditions posting a positive nav total return of 0 5 for the year the headwinds of 2018 included declining economic growth in most regions except the us tightening monetary policy after the ultra loose liquidity conditions that followed the global financial crisis donald trump s protectionist trade war and negative geopolitical developments in the european union such as the brexit impasse and the election of an anti eu coalition government in italy while few of these concerns have abated with the exception of italy which did manage to agree a budget that kept within eu fiscal rules letchfield believes asset markets could still make progress in 2019 although the best years of the current cycle are almost certainly behind us recession is a major cause of bear markets in equities and letchfield argues that leading indicators do not yet suggest an economic contraction is imminent the current global economic expansion while entering its 10th year has been relatively lacklustre and although employment rates are high in most developed economies there is no sign yet of real capacity constraints the manager sees the biggest risks to the global economy as the effect of slowing growth in china and the possibility of a misstep in central bank policy china s large economy and high growth rate compared with more developed countries have meant it has supplied around one third of global gdp growth in recent years although the chinese government has proved adept at managing past slowdowns the addition of punitive us trade tariffs to the mix could make the coming year harder for it to navigate however letchfield believes there is sufficient flexibility in the chinese economy to avoid a significant deterioration meanwhile central banks seem cognisant of the risk that over tightening of monetary policy could precipitate a recession although they equally would not want to enter such a recession with ultra low interest rates denying them the important lever of rate cuts other signs that have historically pointed to an approaching bear phase include excess and exuberance but letchfield argues that with the possible exception of the credit market where corporate debt is higher and the proportion of riskier credit is growing there is no evidence yet of excess on the scale of the 1990s tech bubble or the 2008 subprime mortgage disaster the manager says his central scenario is still for positive although slower economic growth reasonably accommodative liquidity conditions and a continuation of corporate earnings growth the sell off in equity markets has meant many now look quite attractively valued on a forward p e multiple basis however the risk of a more negative scenario with a meaningful slowing in economic growth and or a significant rise in interest rates and bond yields means that letchfield continues to take a balanced approach to investing across regions and asset classes and may in time add to the defensive portion of hansa trust s portfolio asset allocation investment process focus on capital preservation and growth since early 2014 hansa trust has adopted a more diversified approach blending higher risk and more defensive assets to enable it to adapt to changing market conditions fund manager alec letchfield who joined hansa capital partners in late 2013 from hsbc is a multi asset specialist and aims to build a portfolio of assets that individual investors would be unable or unlikely to access by themselves in addition to the long term strategic holding in ocean wilsons wilson sons the fund manager has organised the hansa trust portfolio into a number of silos with a portfolio of direct global equities managed by rob royle who joined from smith williamson in late 2016 a core regional funds allocation a small number of thematic funds in areas such as healthcare and technology and a diversifying portfolio including hedge funds letchfield seeks to invest with third party managers who share hansa trust s focus on capital preservation and alignment of interests including other family offices and boutique fund groups where the founders have invested significant amounts of their own capital asset class and regional allocations across the portfolio are an output of hansa s top down house view although within each allocation the investments themselves are selected on a bottom up basis using fundamental analysis letchfield s focus on preservation and growth of capital means the overall portfolio is biased towards equities although the diversifying element which aims to have a low correlation with equity market returns contains property and credit specialists alongside the allocation to hedge funds in the direct equity portfolio royle seeks to invest in cash generative businesses with improving prospects that are able to invest for long term growth mirroring the approach in the rest of the portfolio royle also looks for alignment of interests in the management teams he invests alongside with average insider ownership in the global equity portfolio at more than 10 the shared focus on capital preservation is expressed through the view of risk not as volatility but on an absolute basis royle seeks to avoid a permanent impairment of capital by investing with a margin of safety portfolio turnover is generally low although somewhat higher in the global equity portfolio current portfolio positioning at 31 december 2018 hansa trust had 58 holdings compared with 57 a year earlier these included 24 direct equity positions 17 core regional funds 12 diversifying funds three thematic funds the owil funds portfolio which has some overlap with other fund holdings and the strategic stake in wson the top 10 holdings made up 63 4 of the portfolio 30 3 for the top nine excluding owhl compared with 61 9 31 2 at 31 december 2017 as shown in exhibit 5 on a look through basis the largest sector weighting was in industrials however this includes wson excluding wson the largest weightings were in information technology including second largest fund holding gam star technology and a direct holding in samsung ks and financials including an msci world financials index tracking fund and a direct holding in the warren buffett vehicle berkshire hathaway nyse geographically the largest exposure was to north america with holdings including specialist regional fund findlay park american and direct equity investments such as alphabet nasdaq google and tripadvisor because of the large exposure to latin america mainly through wson hansa trust has underweight positions in most regions compared with the msci ac world index looking at the silo exposure owil wson and global equities all increased in percentage terms over the 12 months to 31 december 2018 while the core regional funds and thematic diversifying allocations reduced slightly cash was broadly stable at 1 3 compared with 1 5 a year earlier hansa trust now splits out its thematic and diversifying exposures at 31 december 2018 the diversifying portfolio was 11 1 of net assets and the thematic portion was 5 5 in terms of portfolio activity the thematic part of the portfolio with sector specialist funds in technology financials and healthcare remains unchanged as does the core regional allocation although the holdings in two japan funds have been switched into unhedged yen share classes illustrating the manager s long term patient approach in the diversifying portfolio two new funds have been bought and two have been sold while letchfield has also topped up the holding in discretionary macro fund hudson bay international the position in field street offshore a global macro hedge fund was sold after a period of disappointing performance and staff turnover while jlp credit opportunities was exited as letchfield felt the outlook for stressed credit was poor new positions were taken in the apollo total return bond fund and biopharma credit bpcr the apollo fund has a dynamic approach and invests in a variety of credit strategies including direct lending with the aim of achieving uncorrelated total returns bpcr is a specialist credit fund that makes loans to biotechnology and healthcare companies secured on royalty streams from approved drugs this is a specialist market that is underserved by banks and bpcr benefits from the innovation of these companies while remaining uncorrelated with their volatile share prices the manager says he may add one or two further names to the defensives allocation in the medium term in expectation of more challenging market conditions letchfield says the global equity portfolio is now in a good position with manager rob royle having reshaped it since taking responsibility in early 2017 under the previous manager john alexander it was a uk focused selection but now contains a spread of geographies and sectors royle remains focused on stock picking and in the past 12 months has been finding opportunities in the unloved telecom sector with purchases of orange in france and kt in korea both companies have high free cash flows and growing dividends royle believes the market is overlooking any potential improvement in pricing power that may come from consolidation and the implementation of 5g and as such both companies trade with attractive free cash flow yields of over 10 hansa trust s performance was broadly flat in the difficult markets of 2018 exhibit 6 ending the year with an nav total return of 0 5 and an a share price total return of 0 6 longer term returns have been better at c 8 10 pa over three and 10 years and 4 5 pa over five years the trust has no benchmark but measures itself against a range of key performance indicators exhibit 7 hansa trust markedly outperformed uk and global equity indices in 2018 broadly matched the return on uk gilts and slightly lagged uk inflation as shown in exhibit 8 the largest positive contribution in 2018 came from owhl the ex owhl nav total return for the year was 2 4 investors reassessed brazilian equities following the election in october of jair bolsonaro seen as market friendly as president and the market reversed its prior declines to post full year gains in sterling terms the biggest detractors from hansa trust s performance in 2018 were its japanese equity funds however the diversifying funds portfolio protected against some of the downturn in wider equity markets and the weakness of sterling also had a beneficial effect on overall returns discount trading in line with medium term average at 30 january 2019 hansa trust s a shares traded at a 29 0 discount to cum income nav while the ordinary shares were at a 23 4 discount the a shares current discount is broadly in line with both short and medium term averages 29 1 30 8 and 29 1 over one three and five years respectively and somewhat wider than the 10 year average of 24 8 the current discount on the a shares is in the middle of a relatively tight range over the past 12 months from a low of 26 3 in march 2018 to a high of 32 6 in july however there has been an appreciable narrowing from the 10 year high of 36 9 reached in july 2016 owhl also trades at a discount to its underlying assets taking into account wson s share price at 29 january 2019 and the latest reported value of the owil portfolio this gives a look through discount on hansa trust s a shares of 35 9 capital structure and fees hansa trust is a conventional investment trust with two classes of share the 16 0m a shares do not carry voting rights while the majority of the 8 0m ordinary shares with voting rights are owned by or on behalf of members of the salomon family although the trust has the authority to repurchase up to 14 99 of the a shares each year in order to manage a discount in practice this is not used as buying back shares would reduce the size of the trust and therefore inflate the already large holding in owhl as a percentage of the portfolio gearing of up to 30m is available via a short term borrowing facility which if fully drawn would equate to gross gearing of c 9 based on 30 january 2019 net assets the purpose of the gearing facility which is currently undrawn is to give the manager flexibility over the timing of investments rather than to increase market exposure on a long term basis hansa capital partners is paid an annual management fee of 1 0 of net assets after deducting the value of the owhl holding on which no fee is payable there is no performance fee and ongoing charges for fy18 were 1 08 dividend policy and record hansa trust pays dividends twice a year in november and may for the last five financial years total dividends of 16 0p have been paid and this pattern is set to be repeated in fy19 ending 31 march with a first interim dividend of 8 0p having been paid in november 2018 the board sets out its expected dividend for the following financial year in each year s annual results meaning investors have some certainty over the level of income they will receive dividends have been partly uncovered by income in five of the past six financial years but hansa trust has sizeable revenue and capital reserves from which it can make up any shortfall it is worth noting that all expenses are currently charged to the revenue account any change to this policy many peers divide the allocation of charges in line with the expected split of income and capital returns for example would have the effect of boosting the revenue return per share based on the current share prices and the expected dividends for fy19 hansa trust s ordinary shares have a dividend yield of 1 5 and the a shares have a yield of 1 6 peer group comparison formerly a member of the aic s global peer group hansa trust moved to the flexible investment sector in 2018 below in exhibit 10 we show the group of funds that hansa trust s board and managers see as the most appropriate peers most are drawn from the flexible investment sector with the exception of british empire and witan which are in the global sector while all the funds below follow a more or less multi asset or fund of funds approach none is directly comparable to hansa trust on account of its unique structure hansa trust s nav total

by daniel jennings offthegridnews com 2 1 2019 taking a page out of their radical progressivist playbook the democrats plan hyperinflation to finance massive spending increases and new entitlements in fact many democrats are embracing the ideas of economist stephanie kelton or modern monetary theory however even liberal nobel prize winning economist paul krugman calls kelton s ideas a blueprint for hyperinflation in particular kelton believes that the government will never go bankrupt because the treasury can print all the money it wants so the government can supposedly spend all the money politicians want consequently kelton s theory is now the biggest idea in washington the huffington post claims just how will the democrats plan hyperinflation the democrats plan hyperinflation by increasing the money supply the week s james pethokoukis claims as a result the democrats plan to make kelton s ideas function as national policy particularly democrats will issue an unlimited amount of debt to pay for programs such as basic income free college tuition medicare for all and a jobs guarantee astonishingly kelton believes the government can pay for all that without raising taxes through the printing of more and more money conversely krugman believes that this practice will cause an inflation rate of 12 a month or 144 a year this will destroy your money because 1 will be worth 1 44 after merely a year of such hyperinflation as a consequence a 62 000 annual salary will be worth 7 740 per year under modern monetary policy notwithstanding the u s department of health and human services sets the poverty rate for a family of four at 25 750 a year because of this modern monetary policy will impoverish most americans why wall street and the democrats plan hyperinflation krugman also thinks that the monthly inflation rate from unlimited government spending could exceed 400 specifically an item on the mcdonald s dollar menu could cost 40 000 after only 10 months of modern monetary theory under these conditions most investments including savings bonds and real estate will lose most of their value yet some investments like stocks gold silver and cryptocurrencies could grow in value under hyperinflation for this reason many investment bankers speculators hedge fund managers and stock investors like inflation therefore many people on wall street may welcome kelton and her economic ideas democrats blueprint for hyperinflation could lead to hunger riots and civil war notably modern monetary theory is currently being employed in venezuela where it is a spectacular failure for instance venezuela is experiencing widespread hunger because millions of people cannot afford food moreover one third of venezuelans eat only one meal a day because that is all they can afford the miami herald reports hyperinflation leads to food shortages because prices increase faster than families incomes consequently people cannot afford to buy food beyond hunger hyperinflation leads to civil unrest and crime for example a national guard unit from a poor neighborhood in venezuela s capital of caracas mutinied recently the herald states additionally riots killed 16 people and injured 228 protesters in venezuela last week newsweek claims hyperinflation could lead to civil war in venezuela because two men claim to be president socialist incumbent nicolás maduro claims to have won the last presidential election nonetheless rival socialist juan guaidó also claims to be president democrats blueprint for hyperinflation could turn america into venezuela hyperinflation is destroying venezuela because of two decades of uncontrolled spending by maduro and his late predecessor hugo chavez presently the international monetary fund imf estimates venezuela s inflation rate at one million percent in essence the democrats blueprint for hyperinflation could change america into venezuela remarkably venezuela was the richest country in south america until they elected chavez in 1998 nevertheless the venezuelan economy shrank by 30 between 2013 and 2017 due to hyperinflation the imf calculates furthermore venezuela s gross domestic product gdp shrank by 18 in 2018 now a cup of coffee in venezuela costs two million bolivars forbes contributor garth friessen estimates meanwhile statista asserts that the average cup of coffee costs 3 12 in new york which is one of america s most expensive cities to clarify the bolivar is venezuela s national currency named for simón bolívar bolívar was the general who led venezuela s revolution against spanish imperialism in the 19th century democrats plan hyperinflation despite the venezuelan catastrophe the democrats are still planning hyperinflation through modern monetary policy despite the venezuelan disaster as an illustration democratic presidential candidate and u s senator kamala harris plans to pay every american family a 500 per month basic income as a tax refund harris s rival u s senator kirsten gillibrand d new york wants a jobs guarantee and a green new deal a jobs guarantee offers all unemployed people a 15 an hour government job with health insurance in addition the green new deal is yet another massive spending program that serves to switch america from fossil fuels to green energy and then there s democratic frontrunner bernie sanders of course he wants the government to pay all of the costs of healthcare and college for every american the rest here

by american economic sanctions have been the worst crime against humanity since world war two america s economic sanctions have killed more innocent people than all of the nuclear biological and chemical weapons ever used in the history of mankind the fact that for america the issue in venezuela is oil not democracy will surprise only those who watch the news and ignore history venezuela has the world s largest oil reserves on the planet america seeks control of venezuela because it sits atop the strategic intersection of the caribbean south and central american worlds control of the nation has always been a remarkably effective way to project power into these three regions and beyond from the first moment hugo chavez took office the united states has been trying to overthrow venezuela s socialist movement by using sanctions coup attempts and funding the opposition parties after all there is nothing more undemocratic than a coup d état united nations human rights council special rapporteur alfred de zayas recommended just a few days ago that the international criminal court investigate economic sanctions against venezuela as a possible crime against humanity perpetrated by america over the past five years american sanctions have cut venezuela off from most financial markets which have caused local oil production to plummet consequently venezuela has experienced the largest decline in living standards of any country in recorded latin american history prior to american sanctions socialism in venezuela had reduced inequality and poverty whilst pensions expanded during the same time period in america it has been the absolute reverse president chavez funnelled venezuela s oil revenues into social spending such as free 6 healthcare education subsidized food networks and housing construction in order to fully understand why america is waging economic war on the people of venezuela one must analyse the historical relationship between the petrodollar system and sanctions of mass destruction prior to the 20th century the value of money was tied to gold when banks lent money they were constrained by the size of their gold reserves but in 1971 u s president richard nixon took the country off the gold standard nixon and saudi arabia came to an oil for dollars agreement that would change the course of history and become the root cause of countless wars for oil under this petrodollar agreement the only currency that saudi arabia could sell its oil in was the us dollar the saudi kingdom would in turn ensure that its oil profits flow back into u s government treasuries and american banks in exchange america pledged to provide the saudi royal family s regime with military protection and military hardware it was the start of something truly great for america access to oil defined 20th century empires and the petrodollar agreement was the key to the ascendancy of the united states as the world s sole superpower america s war machine runs on is funded by and exists in protection of oil threats by any nation to undermine the petrodollar system are viewed by washington as tantamount to a declaration of war against the united states of america within the last two decades iraq iran libya and venezuela have all threatened to sell their oil in other currencies consequently they have all been subject to crippling u s sanctions over time the petrodollar system spread beyond oil and the u s dollar slowly but surely became the reserve currency for global trades in most commodities and goods this system allows america to maintain its position of dominance as the world s only superpower despite being a staggering 23 trillion in debt with billions of dollars worth of minerals in the ground and with the world s largest oil reserves venezuela should not only be wealthy but her people the envy of the developing world but the nation is essentially broke because american sanctions have cut them off from the international financial system and cost the economy 6 billion over the last five years without sanctions venezuela could recover easily by collateralizing some of its abundant resources or its 8 billion of gold reserves in order to get the loans necessary to kick start their economy in order to fully understand the insidious nature of the venezuelan crisis it is necessary to understand the genesis of economic sanctions at the height of world war two president truman issued an order for american bombers to drop fat man and little boy on the cities of hiroshima and nagasaki killing 140 000 people instantly the gruesome images that emerged from the rubble were broadcast through television sets across the world and caused unprecedented outrage the political backlash forced u s policy makers to devise a more subtle weapon of mass destruction economic sanctions the term weapons of mass destruction wmd was first defined by the united nations in 1948 as atomic explosive weapons radioactive material weapons lethal chemical and biological weapons and any weapons developed in the future which have characteristics comparable in destructive effect to those of the atomic bomb or other weapons mentioned above sanctions are clearly the 21st century s deadliest weapon of mass destruction in 2001 the u s administration told us that iraq had weapons of mass destruction iraq was a terrorist state iraq was tied to al qaeda it all amounted to nothing in fact america already knew that the only weapons of mass destruction that saddam had were not nuclear in nature but rather chemical and biological the only reason they knew this in advance was because america sold the weapons to saddam to use on iran in 1991 what the u s administration did not tell us was that saddam hussein used to be a strong ally of the united states the main reason for toppling saddam and putting sanctions on the people of iraq was the fact that iraq had ditched the dollar for oil sales the united nations estimates that 1 7 million iraqis died due to bill clinton s sanctions 500 000 of whom were children in 1996 a journalist asked former u s secretary of state madeleine albright about these un reports specifically about the children america s top foreign policy official albright replied i think this is a very hard choice but the price we think the price is worth it clearly u s sanctions policies are nothing short of state sanctioned genocide over the last five years sanctions have caused venezuelan per capita incomes to drop by 40 percent which is a decline similar to that of war torn iraq and syria at the height of their armed conflicts millions of venezuelans have had to flee the country if america is so concerned about refugees trump should stop furthering disastrous foreign policies that actually createthem under chavez venezuela had a policy of welcoming refugees president chavez turned venezuela into the wealthiest society in latin america with the best income equality another much vilified leader who used oil wealth to enrich his people only to be put under severe sanctions is muammar gaddafi in 1967 colonel gaddafi inherited one of the poorest nations in africa however by the time he was assassinated gaddafi had turned libya into africa s wealthiest nation perhaps gaddafi s greatest crime in the eyes of nato was his quest to quit selling libyan oil in u s dollars and denominate crude sales in a new gold backed common african currency in fact in august 2011 president obama confiscated 30 billion from libya s central bank which gaddafi had earmarked for the establishment of an african central bank and the african gold backed dinar currency africa has the fastest growing oil industry in the world and oil sales in a common african currency would have been especially devastating for the american dollar the u s economy and particularly the elite in charge of the petrodollar system it is for this reason that president clinton signed the now infamous iran libya sanctions act which the united nations children s fund said caused widespread suffering among civilians by severely limiting supplies of fuel access to cash and the means of replenishing stocks of food and essential medications clearly u s sanctions are weapons of mass destruction not so long ago iraq and libya were the two most modern and secular states in the middle east and north africa with the highest regional standards of living nowadays u s military intervention and economic sanctions have turned libya and iraq into two of the world s most failed nations they want to seize libya s oil and they care nothing about the lives of the libyan people remarked chavez during the western intervention in libya in 2011 in september 2017 president maduro made good on chavez s promise to list oil sales in yuan rather than the us dollar weeks later trump signed a round of crippling sanctions on the people of venezuela on monday u s national security adviser john bolton announced new sanctions that essentially steal 7 billion from venezuela s state owned oil company at that press conference bolton brazenly flashed a note pad that ominously said 5 000 troops to colombia when confronted about it by the media bolton simply said president trump stated that all options are on the table america s media is unquestionably the most corrupt institution in america the nation s media may quibble about trump s domestic policies but when it comes to starting wars for oil abroad they sing in remarkable unison fox news cnn and the new york times all cheered the nation into war in iraq over fictitious weapons of mass destruction whilst america was actually using sanctions of mass destruction on the iraqi people they did it in libya and now they are doing it again in venezuela democracy and freedom have always been the smoke screen in front of capitalist expansion for oil and the western media owns the smoke machine economic warfare has long since been under way against venezuela but military warfare is now imminent trump just hired elliot abrams as u s special envoy for venezuela who has a long and torrid history in latin america abrams pleaded guilty to lying to congress about the iran contra affair which involved america funding deadly communist rebels and was the worst scandal in the reagan era abrams was later pardoned by george bush senior america s new point man on venezuela also lied about the largest mass killing in recent latin american history by u s trained forces in el salvador there is nothing more undemocratic than a coup d état a un human rights council rapporteur alfred de zayas pointed out that america s aim in venezuela is to crush this government and bring in a neoliberal government that is going to privatise everything and is going to sell out a lot of transitional corporations stand to gain enormous profits and the united states is driven by the transnational corporations ever since 1980 the united states has steadily devolved from the status of the world s top creditor country to the world s most indebted country but thanks to the petrodollar system s huge global artificial demand for u s dollars america can continue exponential military expansion record breaking deficits and unrestrained spending america s largest export used to be manufactured goods made proudly in america today america s largest export is the u s dollar any nation like venezuela that threatens that export is met with america s second largest export weapons chief amongst which are sanctions of mass destruction

defined benefit pension plans are being pared back or even eliminated by employers giving those older generations an even bigger financial leg up laziness isn t the culprit here millennials are working and working hard in fact they re actually participating in the labour force more and by some measures working harder than previous generations did in 1980 78 9 per cent of all canadians

more expensive so they have to compromise on either renting or they have to switch to condominiums or smart houses or they might buy a car and stay with their parents in the 1960s census data suggest as few as eight per cent of canadians ages 18 to 35 were living with parents today as has been well documented those numbers have skyrocketed come 2016 a total of 34 7 per cent of canadians between

that is helping them is their parents said tal from the cibc the education system basically failed them they are highly educated but they are not educated in what s relevant there is a mismatch

post graduate certificates and diplomas in the 2016 census but the degree by itself isn t proving to be enough it s not an option about whether or not they re going to have an education that s like an

situation like an arms race for qualifications to set a candidate apart from their competitors so they can land a good job and start their lives the problem is the process is forcing them to put their actual life on hold the thing about this generation is that everything is delayed said duxbury they stay in school longer they get married later if you start comparing the average age of marriage the average age of their first kid the average age of their first permanent full time job it s also forcing those within the generation to compete with one another in ways that are specifically benefitting employers with so much talent available competition for available entry levels jobs is fierce this allows employers to pay less for the workers they need some are even getting away with not paying their employees at all advertisement 11 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content according to the canadian federation of students as many as 300 000 millennials were working in unpaid internships in a bid to further their careers by collecting relevant on the job experience in 2016 the issue with unpaid internships is that most millennials in those jobs are also working in another position likely one that pays minimum wage in order to make ends meet according to the cfs the organization which lobbies on behalf of students also pointed to statistics canada data that shows in 1997 the first year that wage data was collected only 640 000 canadians were making the minimum wage or less in 2017 that number sat at 1 02 million almost double the number previously recorded further compounding the issues facing the millennials is the steady drop in government support offered to post secondary institutions according to the cfs government provided more than 80 per cent of university operating revenues in 1982 that figure fell below 60 per cent in 2012 the most recent year for which statistics are available the cfs says government support has continued to fall in more recent years advertisement 12 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content as government support has decreased students have been forced to shoulder more of the financial burden when obtaining their education that has led to students exiting post secondary institutions with

michael dell founder of dell technologies and microsoft corp founder bill gates expressing objections the call for higher estate taxes in canada was recently reinforced in a study released by the canadian centre for policy alternatives ccpa you d expect canada s tax regime would try to counteract this concentration of wealth at the very top where it s needed the least but in fact federal

preferences for capital gains and dividend income in a bid to better distribute wealth across demographics that may sound like a scary scenario to older generations who have amassed wealth throughout their lifetimes and typically been more conservative when it comes to political fiscal policies but for the millennial generation it s only the tip of the iceberg bring the big government according to abacus data millennials are looking to government to take big steps to fix their problems this generation is more comfortable with big interventionist government than allowing market forces to play their part surveys suggest many millennials truly believe that the economic system that has been in place for hundreds of years fails to work for them advertisement 26 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the company s research suggests that millennials clearly prioritize increased government spending over balanced budgets in order to tackle issues such as alleviating income inequality they believe corporations don t pay their fair share of taxes and that government has a big role to play in redistributing that money having lived through the 2008 financial crisis and a rise in housing costs many are outright skeptical of the free market when asked to indicate if they lean more towards one perspective or the other only 46 per cent suggested that capitalism is the best economic model we have while 54 per cent believe canada would be better off with a more socialist system reads an abacus data survey released last year perhaps the most pertinent fact millennials are now the largest block of voters in the country and have the ability to swing an election toward the party or platform of their choice provided the generation gets out the vote so far they have remained relatively quiet in most elections politicians aren t talking about issues that they care about they aren t very compelling they aren t giving them a reason to get engaged said abacus s coletto millennials are unique from previous generations particularly the boomers and those who came before the boomers in that voting is not considered a duty we don t do it because we have to we do it because we have a reason to reasons seem to be emerging according to elections canada 38 8 per cent of eligible voters between the ages of 18 and 24 years of age voted in the 2011 federal election of those between 25 and 34 years of age 45 1 per cent cast their ballot by comparison a total of 64 5 per cent of canadians between the ages of 45 and 54 voted in that election when it came to canadians between the ages of 65 and 74 a total of 75 1 per cent of eligible voters participated the federal election in 2015 saw better turnout by millennials more than 57 1 per cent of eligible voters between 18 and 24 years of age cast a ballot the number was similar in the 25 through 34 year old age group where 57 4 per cent of eligible voters participated one of the big issues during the 2015 election was the liberal party s promise to legalize cannabis sales in canada which is something that appeals specifically to the millennial generation s interests more than 60 per cent of canadians between the ages of 18 and 34 supported legalizing cannabis according to a study released by nrg research group and peak communicators in march 2017 photo by chris young the canadian press it s expected that more politicians will be looking to woo the millennial vote heading into october s federal election last week finance minister bill morneau said the federal government is looking at ways to make housing purchases more affordable for millennials in the months ahead he called the issue a priority but didn t elaborate ndp leader jagmeet singh has said his party would propose measures to help build as many as 500 000 affordable housing units across the country if elected with more politicians tuning into the fact that the millennial generation will vote for political platforms that speak to their agenda the 18 through 35 demographic looks as though it will soon find itself in an unfamiliar position instead of taking a back seat while older generations plot the course millennials are poised to grab the wheel and take a drastic detour it hasn t boiled over yet but the pot is starting to get warm said coletto there are more millennials than there are boomers more millennials are eligible to vote than any other generation more politicians are mindful of the shift that millennials could bring meanwhile barrett is

more expensive so they have to compromise on either renting or they have to switch to condominiums or smart houses or they might buy a car and stay with their parents in the 1960s census data suggest as few as eight per cent of canadians ages 18 to 35 were living with parents today as has been well documented those numbers have skyrocketed come 2016 a total of 34 7 per cent of canadians between

that is helping them is their parents said tal from the cibc the education system basically failed them they are highly educated but they are not educated in what s relevant there is a mismatch

actual life on hold the thing about this generation is that everything is delayed said duxbury they stay in school longer they get married later if you start comparing the average age of marriage the average age of their first kid the average age of their first permanent full time job it s also forcing those within the generation to compete with one another in ways that are specifically

02 million almost double the number previously recorded further compounding the issues facing the millennials is the steady drop in government support offered to post secondary institutions according

economist at cibc this is really the story of this cohort we have a situation where housing is much more expensive so they have to compromise on either renting or they have to switch to condominiums or smart houses or they might buy a car and stay with their parents in the 1960s census data suggest as few as eight per cent of canadians ages 18 to 35 were living with parents today as has been well documented those numbers have skyrocketed come 2016 a total of 34 7 per cent of canadians between the ages of 20 and 34 were living at home with their parents that s as many as 3 5 million canadians

to buy a home a cibc survey found how will they do it a national survey by hsbc bank of canada released in 2017 found 37 per cent of millennials who have purchased a home received some of the money for the purchase from their parents the education system basically failed them the only thing that is helping them is their parents said tal from the cibc the education system basically failed them they are highly educated but they are not educated in what s relevant there is a mismatch between the skills that they have and what the economy needs and therefore you have many people underemployed and or trying to compromise advertisement 9 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content there is no denying that millennials are highly educated a study released by the pew research center in the u s suggests that they make up the most highly educated generation ever produced more than 3 5 million canadians between the ages of 20 and 34 reported having some sort of post secondary education including bachelor degrees and post graduate certificates and diplomas in the 2016 census but the degree by itself isn t proving to be enough it s not an option about whether or not they re going to have an education that s like an invitation card to the party said carleton university s linda duxbury a professor in management sciences at the sprott school of business who specializes in demographic trends she s also a member of the baby boomer generation people who are now 54 to 73 years of age advertisement 10 story continues below

even going to be looked at photo by darren brown ottawa citizen duxbury described the situation like an arms race for qualifications to set a candidate apart from their competitors so they can land a good job and start their lives the problem is the process is forcing them to put their actual life on hold the thing about this generation is that everything is delayed said duxbury they stay in school longer they get married later if you start comparing the average age of marriage the average age of their first kid the average age of their first permanent full time job it s also forcing those within the generation to compete with one another in ways that are specifically benefitting employers with so much talent available competition for available entry levels jobs is fierce this allows employers to pay less for the workers they need some are even getting away with not paying their employees at all advertisement 11 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content according to the canadian federation of students as many as 300 000 millennials were working in unpaid internships in a bid to further their careers by collecting relevant on the job experience in 2016 the issue with unpaid internships is that most millennials in those jobs are also working in another position likely one that pays minimum wage in order to make ends meet according to the cfs the organization which lobbies on behalf of students also pointed to statistics canada data that shows in 1997 the first year that wage data was collected only 640 000 canadians were making the minimum wage or less in 2017 that number sat at 1 02 million almost double the number previously recorded further compounding the issues facing the millennials is the steady drop in government support offered to post secondary institutions according to the cfs government provided more than 80 per cent of university operating revenues in 1982 that figure fell below 60 per cent in 2012 the most recent year for which statistics are available the cfs says government support has continued to fall in more recent years advertisement 12 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content as government support has decreased students have been forced to shoulder more of the financial burden when obtaining their education that has led to students exiting post secondary institutions with record amounts of debt using data from statistics canada the cfs said that average student debt levels have increased more than 40 per cent between 1999 and 2012 those levels have continued to climb in more recent years the increased cost of education at a time when obtaining a degree has never been more important is another hot button issue for millennials the underemployed generation underemployment a term used to describe people who are overqualified for the positions they find themselves in is also rising rapidly advertisement 13 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content for ottawa s barrett it means her bachelor of science degree isn t enough for her to start a career she is working at a family health clinic on a part time basis and as a goaltending instructor at two different businesses in the nation s capital she is hoping the

university academic all canadian all five years i was there i had a good gpa that doesn t matter in terms of getting a job i need to get another degree in order to get a job in a desired field she has

but your article continues below article content photo by julie oliver postmedia it s tough and competitive she said even for a lot of the programs you are looking at applying to to get an actual career the amount of hours of experience you need for example the physician assistant program that i applied to it s only offered by three universities in canada and i couldn t apply to the third which is the university of toronto because they require almost 1 000 hours of health care experience so where am i supposed to get that hypothetically what i m doing now could count but most people applying to that it s their second career they re going to be older in america where numbers are more readily available underemployment held steady at around 33 per cent of all post secondary graduates between the 1980s and 2010 advertisement 15 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content however that figure jumped to more than 44 per cent of all graduates in 2012 the most recent year for which statistics were available this week ontario s financial accountability office flagged underemployment as an issue that is affecting certain demographics and their ability to keep up financially income inequality has become more entrenched as lower income ontarians are increasingly staying in low income and higher income

ontario s economy and labour market including a rise in part time and temporary work advertisement 16 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content these trends in ontario incomes raise important questions about the role of government in ensuring that all individuals have access to similar economic opportunities he said abacus s coletto is seeing signs that the trend exists here in canada too one of the key indicators of underemployment is wages which would be reflected in the rise of minimum wage workers but the other big indicator is the benefits offered by employers self employed people largely don t have access to benefits people making minimum wage get a minimum amount of benefits from their employers only 55 per cent of millennials have access to a prescription drug plan 53 per cent to dental insurance 36 per cent to an rrsp and only 29 per cent to an employer provided pension plan according to a recent study

changing older millennials in the demographic who graduated 10 or 15 years ago are finding the education that they worked so hard to receive and paid good money for is no longer relevant to the work

1 032 900 people the professional scientific and technical industry which includes high technology workers employed 393 400 people in 1980 that swelled to more than 1 393 700 by 2016 today s employers

don t spend the money on training and development that they should and they d rather have someone coming in with the credentials then they would training somebody who is currently working for them my father when he came back from the war had a grade 12 education when he retired he was vice president at 3m why because there was a different attitude then is it harder to buy a home yes are we taking on higher student debt yes have we been trained and educated in the wrong things many of us yes said abacus s coletto we ve been raised around these expectations go do what you want to do the world is your oyster dream big those expectations were set quite high when you enter a world where it s not possible to achieve the things that your parents and your teachers and society has been saying is going to be there it creates further tension advertisement 19 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content baby boomers won t go can t go the tension is being compounded by the baby boomer generation s refusal to leave the workforce if the millennials are stuck in a bottleneck fighting for career advancement right now the baby boomers are acting like a cork preventing any movement whereas the age 65 was once marked by a person s announcing their retirement today s senior citizens are opting to soldier on the idea of freedom at 55 seems long forgotten extended life spans better health and in some cases continued financial responsibilities are seeing many people in the baby boomer demographic work well into their 70s before opting for retirement boomers have significant expenses that perhaps they didn t anticipate plus they love their jobs and they re healthy they think what am i going to do for the next 25 years said duxbury advertisement 20 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content duxbury also said that baby boomers are now finding themselves in a situation where they are caring for or paying for the care of their aging parents many also find themselves sandwiched in between paying for their parents while also supporting their millennial children who have returned to the family home the millennials can t afford to leave their parents homes because they don t have the opportunity or means to do so but their parents can t afford to retire which would open spaces in the workforce for millennials because they are still supporting those kids at home it is a problem that the boomers aren t leaving that s absolutely true said duxbury so what comes next the awakening of the millennial tectonic plates are beginning to shift advertisement 21 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content that s the opinion at least of karen foster assistant professor at dalhousie university and canada research chair in sustainable rural futures for atlantic canada one of foster s areas of expertise is in researching generational divisions at work she said there is no doubt millennials are upset and that their complaints have been falling on deaf ears however one of the larger issues that millennials are facing is a growing wealth gap between themselves and older generations due to the fact that major life milestones have been delayed investments in real estate or other financial transactions aren t yielding the same return for the younger generation foster said sure property values have skyrocketed for older generations who bought when prices were affordable and have been hanging onto the property but the millennial who just purchased is seeing bigger mortgages than ever before and interest rates that are steadily rising advertisement 22 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content critics of millennial concerns have often pointed out that are next in line to inherit massive amounts of wealth that has been accumulated by their aging parents in fact between 2016 and 2026 the largest wealth transfer in history is expected to take place as older generations pass on as much as 1 trillion to younger generations in canada according to toronto based research firm strategic insight but foster pointed out one critical problem with the upcoming windfall the expected transfer of wealth will only benefit those people who come from families that are already wealthy it will also affect people from major canadian cities where property prices have been steadily rising in a much different way than those people from less populated towns if your family is from somewhere such as moncton n b moose jaw sask or sudbury ont you won t see the same windfall when it comes time to collect an inheritance advertisement 23 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content people who are set to inherit money from their parents or in a sense have been inheriting it their whole lives through various kinds of support that s where the real inequality happens she said adding that millennials are looking to completely upend the status quo that really comes down to a restructuring of the tax system we need to be taxing wealth and high incomes and corporate profits more in order to redistribute wealth across the demographics foster predicts that millennials are likely to push for things such as increased estate taxes in order to ensure that some of the wealth that is transferred from older generations is redistributed throughout all of society the idea is being spearheaded in the united states by recently elected democrat congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez ocasio cortez who at 29 is also a

refusal to leave the workforce if the millennials are stuck in a bottleneck fighting for career advancement right now the baby boomers are acting like a cork preventing any movement whereas the age 65 was once marked by a person s announcing their retirement today s senior citizens are opting to soldier on the idea of freedom at 55 seems long forgotten extended life spans better health and in some cases continued financial responsibilities are seeing many people in the baby boomer demographic work well into their 70s before opting for retirement boomers have significant expenses that perhaps they didn t anticipate plus they love their jobs and they re healthy they think what am i going to do for the next 25 years said duxbury advertisement 20 story continues below this advertisement has

aging parents many also find themselves sandwiched in between paying for their parents while also supporting their millennial children who have returned to the family home the millennials can t afford to leave their parents homes because they don t have the opportunity or means to do so but their parents can t afford to retire which would open spaces in the workforce for millennials because they are still supporting those kids at home it is a problem that the boomers aren t leaving that s absolutely true said duxbury so what comes next the awakening of the millennial tectonic plates are beginning to shift advertisement 21 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content that s the opinion at least of karen foster assistant professor at dalhousie university and canada research chair in sustainable rural futures for atlantic canada one of foster s areas of expertise is in researching generational divisions at work she said there is no doubt millennials are upset and that their complaints have been falling on deaf ears however one of the larger issues that millennials are facing is a growing wealth gap between themselves and older generations due to the fact that major life milestones have been delayed investments in real estate or other financial transactions aren t yielding the same return for the younger generation foster said sure property values have skyrocketed for older generations who bought when prices were affordable and have been hanging onto the property but the millennial who just purchased is seeing bigger mortgages than ever before and interest rates that are steadily rising advertisement 22 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content critics of millennial concerns have often pointed out that are next in line to inherit massive amounts of wealth that has been accumulated by their aging parents in fact between 2016 and 2026 the largest wealth transfer in history is expected to take place as older generations pass on as much as 1 trillion to younger generations in canada according to toronto based research firm strategic insight but foster pointed out one critical problem with the upcoming windfall the expected transfer of wealth will only benefit those people who come from families that are already wealthy it will also affect people from major canadian cities where property prices have been steadily rising in a much different way than those people from less populated towns if your family is from somewhere such as moncton n b moose jaw sask or sudbury ont you won t see the same windfall when it comes time to collect an inheritance advertisement 23 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content people who are set to inherit money from their parents or in a sense have been inheriting it their whole lives through various kinds of support that s where the real inequality happens she said adding that millennials are looking to completely upend the status quo that really comes down to a restructuring of the tax system we need to be taxing wealth and high incomes and corporate profits more in order to redistribute wealth across the demographics foster predicts that millennials are likely to push for things such as increased estate taxes in order to ensure that some of the wealth that is transferred from older generations is redistributed throughout all of society the idea is being spearheaded in the united states by recently elected democrat congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez ocasio cortez who at 29 is also a millennial is lobbying for the introduction of a tax on the wealthiest americans in the country she believes that every dollar of income over 10 million should be taxed at 70 per cent advertisement 24 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content there will of course be pushback to that idea it s been panned by the audience at the world economic forum in davos switzerland as recently as last week with attendees including michael dell founder of dell technologies and microsoft corp founder bill gates expressing objections the call for higher estate taxes in canada was recently reinforced in a study released by the canadian centre for policy alternatives ccpa you d expect canada s tax regime would try to counteract this concentration of wealth at the very top where it s needed the least but in fact federal policies encourage it said the centre s senior economist david macdonald in a release canada is the only country in the g7 without an inheritance estate or gift tax on tremendous family wealth advertisement 25 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the ccpa s report said canada s wealthiest families saw their net worth grow on average by 37 per cent between 2012 and 2016 middle class families saw their net worth grow by only 16 per cent during the same time frame the study calls for high estate taxes eliminating tax preferences for capital gains and dividend income in a bid to better distribute wealth across demographics that may sound like a scary scenario to older generations who have amassed wealth throughout their lifetimes and typically been more conservative when it comes to political fiscal policies but for the millennial generation it s only the tip of the iceberg bring the big government according to abacus data millennials are looking to government to take big steps to fix their problems this generation is more comfortable with big interventionist government than allowing market forces to play their part surveys suggest many millennials truly believe that the economic system that has been in place for hundreds of years fails to work for them advertisement 26 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the company s research suggests that millennials clearly prioritize increased government spending over balanced budgets in order to tackle issues such as alleviating income inequality they believe corporations don t pay their fair share of taxes and that government has a big role to play in redistributing that money having lived through the 2008 financial crisis and a rise in housing costs many are outright skeptical of the free market when asked to indicate if they lean more towards one perspective or the other only 46 per cent suggested that capitalism is the best economic model we have while 54 per cent believe canada would be better off with a more socialist system reads an abacus data survey released last year perhaps the most pertinent fact millennials are now the largest block of voters in the country and have the ability to swing an election toward the party or platform of their choice provided the generation gets out the vote so far they have remained relatively quiet in most elections politicians aren t talking about issues that they care about they aren t very compelling they aren t giving them a reason to get engaged said abacus s coletto millennials are unique from previous generations particularly the boomers and those who came before the boomers in that voting is not considered a duty we don t do it because we have to we do it because we have a reason to reasons seem to be emerging according to elections canada 38 8 per cent of eligible voters between the ages of 18 and 24 years of age voted in the 2011 federal election of those between 25 and 34 years of age 45 1 per cent cast their ballot by comparison a total of 64 5 per cent of canadians between the ages of 45 and 54 voted in that election when it came to canadians between the ages of 65 and 74 a total of 75 1 per cent of eligible voters participated the federal election in 2015 saw better turnout by millennials more than 57 1 per cent of eligible voters between 18 and 24 years of age cast a ballot the number was similar in the 25 through 34 year old age group where 57 4 per cent of eligible voters participated one of the big issues during the 2015 election was the liberal party s promise to legalize cannabis sales in canada which is something that appeals specifically to the millennial generation s interests more than 60 per cent of canadians between the ages of 18 and 34 supported legalizing cannabis according to a study released by nrg research group and peak communicators in march 2017 photo by chris young the canadian press it s expected that more politicians will be looking to woo the millennial vote heading into october s federal election last week finance minister bill morneau said the federal government is looking at ways to make housing purchases more affordable for millennials in the months ahead he called the issue a priority but didn t elaborate ndp leader jagmeet singh has said his party would propose measures to help build as many as 500 000 affordable housing units across the country if elected with more politicians tuning into the fact that the millennial generation will vote for political platforms that speak to their agenda the 18 through 35 demographic looks as though it will soon find itself in an unfamiliar position instead of taking a back seat while older generations plot the course millennials are poised to grab the wheel and take a drastic detour it hasn t boiled over yet but the pot is starting to get warm said coletto there are more millennials than there are boomers more millennials are eligible to vote than any other generation more politicians are mindful of the shift that millennials could bring meanwhile barrett is

abacus data millennials are looking to government to take big steps to fix their problems this generation is more comfortable with big interventionist government than allowing market forces to play their part surveys suggest many millennials truly believe that the economic system that has been in place for hundreds of years fails to work for them advertisement 26 story continues below this

budgets in order to tackle issues such as alleviating income inequality they believe corporations don t pay their fair share of taxes and that government has a big role to play in redistributing that money having lived through the 2008 financial crisis and a rise in housing costs many are outright skeptical of the free market when asked to indicate if they lean more towards one perspective or the other only 46 per cent suggested that capitalism is the best economic model we have while 54 per cent believe canada would be better off with a more socialist system reads an abacus data survey released last year perhaps the most pertinent fact millennials are now the largest block of voters in the country and have the ability to swing an election toward the party or platform of their choice provided the generation gets out the vote so far they have remained relatively quiet in most elections politicians aren t talking about issues that they care about they aren t very compelling they aren t giving them a reason to get engaged said abacus s coletto millennials are unique from previous generations particularly the boomers and those who came before the boomers in that voting is not considered a duty we don t do it because we have to we do it because we have a reason to reasons seem to be emerging according to elections canada 38 8 per cent of eligible voters between the ages of 18 and 24 years of age voted in the 2011 federal election of those between 25 and 34 years of age 45 1 per cent cast their ballot by comparison a total of 64 5 per cent of canadians between the ages of 45 and 54 voted in that election when it came to canadians between the ages of 65 and 74 a total of 75 1 per cent of eligible voters participated the federal election in 2015 saw better turnout by millennials more than 57 1 per cent of eligible voters between 18 and 24 years of age cast a ballot the number was similar in the 25 through 34 year old age group where 57 4 per cent of eligible voters participated one of the big issues during the 2015 election was the liberal party s promise to legalize cannabis sales in canada which is something that appeals specifically to the millennial generation s interests more than 60 per cent of canadians between the ages of 18 and 34 supported legalizing cannabis according to a study released by nrg research group and peak communicators in march 2017 photo by chris young the canadian press it s expected that more politicians will be looking to woo the millennial vote heading into october s federal election last week finance minister bill morneau said the federal government is looking at ways to make housing purchases more affordable for millennials in the months ahead he called the issue a priority but didn t elaborate ndp leader jagmeet singh has said his party would propose measures to help build as many as 500 000 affordable housing units across the country if elected with more politicians tuning into the fact that the millennial generation will vote for political platforms that speak to their agenda the 18 through 35 demographic looks as though it will soon find itself in an unfamiliar position instead of taking a back seat while older generations plot the course millennials are poised to grab the wheel and take a drastic detour it hasn t boiled over yet but the pot is starting to get warm said coletto there are more millennials than there are boomers more millennials are eligible to vote than any other generation more politicians are mindful of the shift that millennials could bring meanwhile barrett is

more expensive so they have to compromise on either renting or they have to switch to condominiums or smart houses or they might buy a car and stay with their parents in the 1960s census data suggest as few as eight per cent of canadians ages 18 to 35 were living with parents today as has been well documented those numbers have skyrocketed come 2016 a total of 34 7 per cent of canadians between

that is helping them is their parents said tal from the cibc the education system basically failed them they are highly educated but they are not educated in what s relevant there is a mismatch

post graduate certificates and diplomas in the 2016 census but the degree by itself isn t proving to be enough it s not an option about whether or not they re going to have an education that s like an

situation like an arms race for qualifications to set a candidate apart from their competitors so they can land a good job and start their lives the problem is the process is forcing them to put their actual life on hold the thing about this generation is that everything is delayed said duxbury they stay in school longer they get married later if you start comparing the average age of marriage the average age of their first kid the average age of their first permanent full time job it s also forcing those within the generation to compete with one another in ways that are specifically benefitting employers with so much talent available competition for available entry levels jobs is fierce this allows employers to pay less for the workers they need some are even getting away with not paying their employees at all advertisement 11 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content according to the canadian federation of students as many as 300 000 millennials were working in unpaid internships in a bid to further their careers by collecting relevant on the job experience in 2016 the issue with unpaid internships is that most millennials in those jobs are also working in another position likely one that pays minimum wage in order to make ends meet according to the cfs the organization which lobbies on behalf of students also pointed to statistics canada data that shows in 1997 the first year that wage data was collected only 640 000 canadians were making the minimum wage or less in 2017 that number sat at 1 02 million almost double the number previously recorded further compounding the issues facing the millennials is the steady drop in government support offered to post secondary institutions according to the cfs government provided more than 80 per cent of university operating revenues in 1982 that figure fell below 60 per cent in 2012 the most recent year for which statistics are available the cfs says government support has continued to fall in more recent years advertisement 12 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content as

record amounts of debt using data from statistics canada the cfs said that average student debt levels have increased more than 40 per cent between 1999 and 2012 those levels have continued to climb

more expensive so they have to compromise on either renting or they have to switch to condominiums or smart houses or they might buy a car and stay with their parents in the 1960s census data suggest as few as eight per cent of canadians ages 18 to 35 were living with parents today as has been well documented those numbers have skyrocketed come 2016 a total of 34 7 per cent of canadians between

that is helping them is their parents said tal from the cibc the education system basically failed them they are highly educated but they are not educated in what s relevant there is a mismatch

up the most highly educated generation ever produced more than 3 5 million canadians between the ages of 20 and 34 reported having some sort of post secondary education including bachelor degrees and post graduate certificates and diplomas in the 2016 census but the degree by itself isn t proving to be enough it s not an option about whether or not they re going to have an education that s like an invitation card to the party said carleton university s linda duxbury a professor in management sciences at the sprott school of business who specializes in demographic trends she s also a member of

situation like an arms race for qualifications to set a candidate apart from their competitors so they can land a good job and start their lives the problem is the process is forcing them to put their actual life on hold the thing about this generation is that everything is delayed said duxbury they stay in school longer they get married later if you start comparing the average age of marriage the average age of their first kid the average age of their first permanent full time job it s also forcing those within the generation to compete with one another in ways that are specifically benefitting employers with so much talent available competition for available entry levels jobs is fierce this allows employers to pay less for the workers they need some are even getting away with not paying their employees at all advertisement 11 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content according to the canadian federation of students as many as 300 000 millennials were working in unpaid internships in a bid to further their careers by collecting relevant on the job experience in 2016 the issue with unpaid internships is that most millennials in those jobs are also working in another position likely one that pays minimum wage in order to make ends meet according to the cfs the organization which lobbies on behalf of students also pointed to statistics canada data that shows in 1997 the first year that wage data was collected only 640 000 canadians were making the minimum wage or less in 2017 that number sat at 1 02 million almost double the number previously recorded further compounding the issues facing the millennials is the steady drop in government support offered to post secondary institutions according to the cfs government provided more than 80 per cent of university operating revenues in 1982 that figure fell below 60 per cent in 2012 the most recent year for which statistics are available the cfs says government support has continued to fall in more recent years advertisement 12 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content as government support has decreased students have been forced to shoulder more of the financial burden when obtaining their education that has led to students exiting post secondary institutions with record amounts of debt using data from statistics canada the cfs said that average student debt levels have increased more than 40 per cent between 1999 and 2012 those levels have continued to climb in more recent years the increased cost of education at a time when obtaining a degree has never been more important is another hot button issue for millennials the underemployed generation

health care experience so where am i supposed to get that hypothetically what i m doing now could count but most people applying to that it s their second career they re going to be older in america where numbers are more readily available underemployment held steady at around 33 per cent of all post secondary graduates between the 1980s and 2010 advertisement 15 story continues below this

of government in ensuring that all individuals have access to similar economic opportunities he said abacus s coletto is seeing signs that the trend exists here in canada too one of the key indicators of underemployment is wages which would be reflected in the rise of minimum wage workers but the other big indicator is the benefits offered by employers self employed people largely don t have access to benefits people making minimum wage get a minimum amount of benefits from their employers only 55 per cent of millennials have access to a prescription drug plan 53 per cent to dental insurance 36

he was vice president at 3m why because there was a different attitude then is it harder to buy a home yes are we taking on higher student debt yes have we been trained and educated in the wrong things many of us yes said abacus s coletto we ve been raised around these expectations go do what you want to do the world is your oyster dream big those expectations were set quite high when you enter a world where it s not possible to achieve the things that your parents and your teachers and society has been saying is going to be there it creates further tension advertisement 19 story

refusal to leave the workforce if the millennials are stuck in a bottleneck fighting for career advancement right now the baby boomers are acting like a cork preventing any movement whereas the age 65 was once marked by a person s announcing their retirement today s senior citizens are opting to soldier on the idea of freedom at 55 seems long forgotten extended life spans better health and in some cases continued financial responsibilities are seeing many people in the baby boomer demographic work well into their 70s before opting for retirement boomers have significant expenses that perhaps they didn t anticipate plus they love their jobs and they re healthy they think what am i going to do for the next 25 years said duxbury advertisement 20 story continues below this advertisement has

aging parents many also find themselves sandwiched in between paying for their parents while also supporting their millennial children who have returned to the family home the millennials can t afford to leave their parents homes because they don t have the opportunity or means to do so but their parents can t afford to retire which would open spaces in the workforce for millennials because they are still supporting those kids at home it is a problem that the boomers aren t leaving that s absolutely true said duxbury so what comes next the awakening of the millennial tectonic plates are

professor at dalhousie university and canada research chair in sustainable rural futures for atlantic canada one of foster s areas of expertise is in researching generational divisions at work she said there is no doubt millennials are upset and that their complaints have been falling on deaf ears however one of the larger issues that millennials are facing is a growing wealth gap between themselves and older generations due to the fact that major life milestones have been delayed investments in real estate or other financial transactions aren t yielding the same return for the younger generation foster said sure property values have skyrocketed for older generations who bought when prices were affordable and have been hanging onto the property but the millennial who just purchased is seeing bigger mortgages than ever before and interest rates that are steadily rising advertisement 22 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content critics of millennial concerns have often pointed out that are next in line to inherit massive amounts of wealth that has been accumulated by their aging parents in fact between 2016 and 2026 the largest wealth transfer in history is expected to take place as older generations pass on as much as 1 trillion to younger generations in canada according to toronto based research firm strategic insight but foster pointed out one critical problem with the upcoming windfall the expected transfer of wealth will only benefit those people who come from families that are already wealthy it will also affect people from major canadian cities where property prices have been steadily rising in a much different way than those people from less populated towns if your family is from somewhere such as moncton n b moose jaw sask or sudbury ont you won t see the same windfall when it comes time to collect an inheritance advertisement 23 story continues below this advertisement has

support that s where the real inequality happens she said adding that millennials are looking to completely upend the status quo that really comes down to a restructuring of the tax system we need to be taxing wealth and high incomes and corporate profits more in order to redistribute wealth across the demographics foster predicts that millennials are likely to push for things such as increased estate taxes in order to ensure that some of the wealth that is transferred from older generations is redistributed throughout all of society the idea is being spearheaded in the united states by recently elected democrat congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez ocasio cortez who at 29 is also a millennial is lobbying for the introduction of a tax on the wealthiest americans in the country she

more expensive so they have to compromise on either renting or they have to switch to condominiums or smart houses or they might buy a car and stay with their parents in the 1960s census data suggest

02 million almost double the number previously recorded further compounding the issues facing the millennials is the steady drop in government support offered to post secondary institutions according

themselves and older generations due to the fact that major life milestones have been delayed investments in real estate or other financial transactions aren t yielding the same return for the younger

strategic insight but foster pointed out one critical problem with the upcoming windfall the expected transfer of wealth will only benefit those people who come from families that are already wealthy it will also affect people from major canadian cities where property prices have been steadily rising in a much different way than those people from less populated towns if your family is from

be taxing wealth and high incomes and corporate profits more in order to redistribute wealth across the demographics foster predicts that millennials are likely to push for things such as increased estate taxes in order to ensure that some of the wealth that is transferred from older generations is redistributed throughout all of society the idea is being spearheaded in the united states by recently elected democrat congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez ocasio cortez who at 29 is also a millennial is lobbying for the introduction of a tax on the wealthiest americans in the country she

canadian centre for policy alternatives ccpa you d expect canada s tax regime would try to counteract this concentration of wealth at the very top where it s needed the least but in fact federal

preferences for capital gains and dividend income in a bid to better distribute wealth across demographics that may sound like a scary scenario to older generations who have amassed wealth throughout their lifetimes and typically been more conservative when it comes to political fiscal policies but for the millennial generation it s only the tip of the iceberg bring the big government according to abacus data millennials are looking to government to take big steps to fix their problems this generation is more comfortable with big interventionist government than allowing market forces to play their part surveys suggest many millennials truly believe that the economic system that has been in place for hundreds of years fails to work for them advertisement 26 story continues below this

budgets in order to tackle issues such as alleviating income inequality they believe corporations don t pay their fair share of taxes and that government has a big role to play in redistributing that

other only 46 per cent suggested that capitalism is the best economic model we have while 54 per cent believe canada would be better off with a more socialist system reads an abacus data survey released last year perhaps the most pertinent fact millennials are now the largest block of voters in the country and have the ability to swing an election toward the party or platform of their choice provided the generation gets out the vote so far they have remained relatively quiet in most elections politicians aren t talking about issues that they care about they aren t very compelling they aren t giving them a reason to get engaged said abacus s coletto millennials are unique from previous generations particularly the boomers and those who came before the boomers in that voting is not considered a duty we don t do it because we have to we do it because we have a reason to reasons seem to be emerging according to elections canada 38 8 per cent of eligible voters between the ages of 18 and 24 years of age voted in the 2011 federal election of those between 25 and 34 years of age 45 1 per cent cast their ballot by comparison a total of 64 5 per cent of canadians between the ages of 45 and 54 voted in that election when it came to canadians between the ages of 65 and 74 a total of 75 1 per cent of eligible voters participated the federal election in 2015 saw better turnout by millennials more than 57 1 per cent of eligible voters between 18 and 24 years of age cast a ballot the number was similar in the 25 through 34 year old age group where 57 4 per cent of eligible voters participated one of the big issues during the 2015 election was the liberal party s promise to legalize cannabis sales in canada which is something that appeals specifically to the millennial generation s interests more than 60 per cent of canadians between the ages of 18 and 34 supported legalizing cannabis according to a study released by nrg research group and peak communicators in march 2017 photo by chris young the canadian press it s expected that more politicians will be looking to woo the millennial vote heading into october s federal election last week finance minister

jagmeet singh has said his party would propose measures to help build as many as 500 000 affordable housing units across the country if elected with more politicians tuning into the fact that the millennial generation will vote for political platforms that speak to their agenda the 18 through 35 demographic looks as though it will soon find itself in an unfamiliar position instead of taking a back seat while older generations plot the course millennials are poised to grab the wheel and take a drastic detour it hasn t boiled over yet but the pot is starting to get warm said coletto there are more millennials than there are boomers more millennials are eligible to vote than any other generation more politicians are mindful of the shift that millennials could bring meanwhile barrett is

as thousands of central americans continued to join an exodus headed toward mexico and the united states government officials from the region met in san salvador on january 15 to discuss the details of a foreign assistance plan mexico ambitiously claims will address the root causes of migration by funding job creation and poverty reduction in central america and southern mexico following the example of the marshall plan for european reconstruction in the wake of world war ii the government of mexican president andrés manuel lópez obrador is calling for the investment of some 30 billion over five years to stimulate economic development in the region while details remain unclear the northern triangle countries of el salvador guatemala and honduras signed a joint declaration with mexico last month to kick off talks to define the initiative formally called the comprehensive development plan mexico has asked the united states to pitch in though so far the commitment has been paltry under the original marshall plan officially called the european recovery program the united states pumped nearly 13 billion into western europe between 1948 and 1951 the goal was to reconstruct european nations devastated by world war ii liberalize trade and contain communism in the early years of the cold war noam chomsky has argued that the plan was crafted to serve u s corporate interests and laid the groundwork for the rise of transnational corporations though it did contribute to europe s recovery alongside the economic agenda covert cia operations financed with 5 percent of marshall plan funds used a a network of false fronts to undermine socialist and communist labor unions and other social organizations as part of his call for a marshall plan for central america lópez obrador known as amlo has proposed prioritizing development over security in the region signaling that sustainable development in central america is tied to that of mexico mexico says the plan aims to combat the drivers of migration in a comprehensive way as part of a broader effort to ease restrictive immigration policy to improve conditions for central americans in transit meanwhile security remains the top pillar in the u s state department s strategy for central america under which new funding to the region will fall endorsing the agreement between mexico and the northern triangle countries the united nations economic commission for latin america and the caribbean says the plan has the potential to change the paradigm of migration development and cooperation in the region but critics argue that while the situations in the northern triangle are indeed dire and require urgent attention the plan will likely follow in the footsteps of other regional u s backed initiatives that have failed to effectively tackle the underlying causes of migration and instead prioritized militarization and private profits misguided priorities compounded by weak and corrupt government institutions in the region have led to a funding model that not only falls short of tackling root causes but may exacerbate the inequality displacement and failed anti violence policies that drive people to flee their homes in their first place difficult conditions deep institutional crises in the governments of the region rooted at least in part in unrealized promises of peace and democracy after the end of u s backed civil wars in the region leaves many wary of regional leaders will and ability to effectively administer funds in ways that will benefit populations in need while the idea of a marshall plan for central america sounds promising it is unlikely to produce meaningful results without rethinking the ways foreign aid has been allocated and administered critics say i think it is very difficult in these conditions that any plan could change the situations in our countries says ursula roldan director of the institute for research and social projection on global and territorial dynamics at the rafael landivar university in guatemala city first we would have to stabilize the region through deepening the fight against corruption and through more legitimate elections the crises are deep guatemala is in the grips of a slow motion coup set off by the government s bid to unilaterally boot a un backed anti corruption commission out of the country honduras is still reeling from a 2009 military coup and widely condemned 2017 presidential election both tacitly endorsed by the united states and accompanied by widespread political violence and el salvador set to vote for a new president on february 3 remains locked into a 15 year old iron fist clampdown on gangs that has failed to rein in violent crime geoff thale vice president of programs at the washington office on latin america wola argues it s time to fundamentally rethink foreign aid plans for the region to yield meaningful results in principle a marshall plan for central america is the right thing thale says but there s a long way from saying that it s a good idea to figuring out how to actually make it work in a way that generates both development and equity in the region that is adequate funded and that is not riddled by corruption and mismanagement in ways that make it ineffective government of criminals bartolo fuentes a honduran journalist and former member of congress says that the southern mexico development portion of the marshall plan could be promising fuentes helped get the word out last october about the first big caravan from honduras made up of people fleeing violence political persecution poverty and unemployment contrary to trump s rhetoric he says the idea of the caravan was never to enter the united states en masse or by force and some 3 000 central americans opted to request asylum in southern mexico fuentes believes that if salaries are decent employment in mexico could be an attractive option for some hondurans seeking economic opportunities he points to the mexican government s maya train rail project as one potential source of employment for migrant workers indigenous groups in mexico have rejected the project over the government s failure to consult their communities while environmentalist warn of impacts on forests and wildlife habitat in southern states but fuentes argues that investment in honduras administered by the government of president juan orlando hernández sworn in for a controversial second term one year ago after a highly questioned presidential election would be a lost cause we have a corrupt government he says rhyming off a raft of underfunded public programs like health and education as well as a slew of high profile government corruption scandals including the arrest of the president s brother in miami on drug trafficking charges in few words we need a change of government says fuentes this is a government of criminals as long as those people there will be no plan for prosperity that really works neither by mexico nor the united states doubling down on failed policies fuentes criticism of the united states references an ongoing regional development initiative ostensibly aimed at stemming migration from the region the alliance for prosperity developed under the obama administration the alliance for prosperity includes plans to build a gas pipeline from mexico to central america expand energy infrastructure and logistics corridors coordinate border security across the region and attract foreign investment though initially billed as a 1 billion per year plan over five years the united states has allocated 2 1 billion to the region since 2016 the northern triangle governments have allocated 7 7 billion to the alliance for prosperity in the same period journalist and author dawn paley reported two years ago that the plan proposed as a solution to the increase in unaccompanied central american children arriving in the united states was likely to deepen the refugee crisis because it proposed the same kinds of corporate projects and militarized security that community leaders in the region were fighting to stop far from improving the situation four years on we see increased social and environmental conflict increased militarization increased polarization increased poverty and an ongoing mass exodus she says of the alliance for prosperity in her book drug war capitalism paley argues that the war on drugs in latin america has provided a pretext for u s backed militarization which in turn pushes the frontiers of global capitalism by opening up land and resources for foreign investment and extraction the 18 year old 10 billion counter narcotics and counterinsurgency program plan colombia for example sold free market economic reforms and military aid as a package deal back in 1998 colombia s then president andrés pastrana arango had called for a kind of marshall plan for colombia a year later he forged plan colombia with then president bill clinton plan colombia utterly failed to curb cocaine production while the human costs of the war soared foreign direct investment hit a high in 2013 at roughly seven times the 2000 level and investment in mining and oil in particular ballooned exponentially the alliance for prosperity follows a familiar playbook we don t have many specific details about the proposed plan at this point paley says of the new marshall plan but based on the fact that funding is supposed to come from international financial institutions and private investors as well as the u s and mexican governments it s unlikely we ll see a departure from the alliance for prosperity the inter american development bank facilitated the creation of the alliance for prosperity and will continue to be one of the partners with which u s support for the marshall plan proposes to work closely along with the world bank international monetary fund and private sector partners such as the overseas private investment corporation rights groups and researchers have warned militarized security paired with development schemes designed to keep riches in the hands of transnational corporations and local elites often exacerbate conditions that drive people to flee home in the first place one of the things that has continuously failed is investment in security which means militarization that doesn t attend to the longer historical realities of a region that is completely stratified says alex villalpando professor of pan african studies and latin american studies at california state university los angeles many also have raised concern that u s funding for the region continues to support state security forces with track records of human rights abuses and violent repression of social movements more than 50 members of u s congress for example have called for the united states to more rigorously condition foreign aid and loans to honduras police and military in light of rampant impunity for violence against human rights defenders epitomized by the murder of internationally renowned indigenous leader berta cáceres in guatemala military jeeps the united states donated in the name of the war on drugs were deployed last year to intimidate the anti corruption commission the intercept reported for villalpando any talk of a marshall plan for central america is shaped by a racialized logic in the kind of relationship the united states has with central america compared to europe while the united states saw european countries as imperial allies when the marshall plan was rolled out after world war ii washington has long had a paternalistic relationship with central america he explains that s where the idea of a marshall plan falls villalpando says central america has been crucial to the u s s development as an empire and as a global capitalist power a sordid history in response to amlo s push for the central america plan the united states pledged to pitch in 5 8 billion for central america though most of that sum recommits existing funds with over half coming from private investment guarantees washington says the aid proposes to promote institutional reforms and development through public and private investment in the name of promoting a safer and more prosperous central america private investment guarantees for southern mexico total 4 8 billion the trump administration will ask for just 180 million in new bilateral assistance for the region for 2019 wola s thale says the u s contribution remains fictional at this point there s almost no real new money in the proposal the administration made he says if this is a 30 billion plan we ought to be contributing a larger share aquiles magaña executive secretary of el salvador s national council for the protection and development of migrants and their families believes that the united states has a historical responsibility to address structural causes of migration after decades of intervention in the region unlike other critics he says that the alliance for prosperity and other u s socio economic investments are a step in the right direction but he also argues that present day funding doesn t measure up to the hundreds of millions of dollars in u s economic and military aid that propped up el salvador s dictatorship during the country s 12 year civil war when washington also sent military advisors to support the salvadoran military suggesting the united states should invest more in regional development u s history in neighboring guatemala and honduras is similarly sordid in 1954 a cia backed coup in guatemala set the stage for 36 years of brutal civil war and genocide against maya indigenous peoples the conflict claimed 200 000 victims mostly at the hands of state forces and aligned death squads meanwhile honduras served as the cold war staging ground for u s counterinsurgency strategy in the region and in the 1980s a secret cia trained military unit terrorized tortured and killed at least 184 dissidents to discourage a revolutionary uprising on honduran soil in the years after the region s peace accords u s free trade policies shaped the region s economies including undermining local agricultural production by flooding local markets with cheap u s imports in 2009 the obama administration refused to cut aid to honduras after the military coup and later endorsed widely boycotted elections that took place under the coup regime and most recently the trump administration appears to be turning a blind eye to constitutional crisis in guatemala central america never managed to deepen its democracies explains rafael landivar university s roldan she says powerful economic interests undermined the transition to democracy and the creation of meaningful public policies after the end of us backed civil wars today we have co opted governments a business sector with too much power no checks and balances on the exercise of power and illicit forces that have controlled judicial and legislative apparatuses she says what we need is to retake the path of democratic reconstruction in these countries the u s administration s plans to request 180 million in new foreign aid for the northern triangle pales in comparison to trump s 5 7 billion request to build 234 miles of a new physical barrier at the border since the announcement of the central america aid trump has focused immigration debate squarely on the wall as the only way to combat what he calls a crisis at the southern border critics argue that the only humanitarian crisis is one of the united states own making as artificially slow processing of asylum seekers left thousands of central americans in limbo at the us mexico border late last year tens of thousands more asylum seekers living in the united states will be impacted as the government shutdown interrupts immigration court hearings meanwhile deterrence policies from obama era efforts to tighten mexico s southern border through programa frontera sur to trump s zero tolerance policies continue to show no signs of slowing the central american exodus a new paradigm against the backdrop of the manufactured border crisis and years of misguided u s responses to central american migration wola s thale believes it is positive that mexico is leading the strategy but berenice valdez rivera public policy coordinator with the institute for women in migration a mexican social organization stresses that amlo should learn from his predecessor s mistakes and move away from failed solutions of militarized borders and increased immigration policing independent of the marshall plan for the region she believes mexico s priorities in responding to the central american exodus in the short term should include simplifying processes for central americans to regularize their status in mexico reducing immigration patrols and raising awareness about and facilitating humanitarian visa options with thousands of central americans on their doorstep mexican immigration authorities will attend to foreigners who arrive in mexican territory with full respect or their human rights offering them a humane reception regularization processes so they can transit the country as well as information and orientation marissa gonzalez ramirez a spokesperson for mexico s national institute for migration said since the

quarters of applicants are from honduras but only a fraction of applicants have received their visas mexico s agreement with the northern triangle countries proposes to address all facets of migration from root causes to transit asylum and deportation processes although these moves appear to be making good on commitments to improve rights of migrants and refugees in transit mexico announced it has closed requests for humanitarian visas some rights groups also have raised concern about processing times being slower than the five days expected noting the uncertainty has prompted some central americans to carry on without waiting for the visa but simultaneously amlo has attracted ire for pushing a plan to create a 60 000 strong national guard critics say the force will continue a militarized public security strategy that far from containing violent crime has perpetuated violence and human rights abuses since former mexican president felipe calderón launched the war on drugs 12 years ago lower house lawmakers overwhelmingly approved the plan which now passes to the senate amlo has called for the final version of the national guard to include a stronger role for the military the move does not inspire confidence that amlo is willing to take a clear step away from militarization as central americans interested in staying in mexico have options to request asylum or one year humanitarian visas it remains unclear what will happen to refugees seeking asylum in the united states under trump s remain in mexico plan the policy requires asylum seekers to wait for their immigration court dates in mexico which could take years mexico has criticized the policy as unilateral but nevertheless has stated the country will accept asylum seekers returned to mexican territory immigration lawyers and human rights groups slam remain in mexico as a logistical nightmare that will put vulnerable asylum seekers at greater risk for valdez rivera ensuring humane treatment of migrants and refugees in transit through mexico as well as effective implementation of a marshall plan for the region will require the government to work closely with human rights and social

post graduate certificates and diplomas in the 2016 census but the degree by itself isn t proving to be enough it s not an option about whether or not they re going to have an education that s like an invitation card to the party said carleton university s linda duxbury a professor in management sciences at the sprott school of business who specializes in demographic trends she s also a member of

situation like an arms race for qualifications to set a candidate apart from their competitors so they can land a good job and start their lives the problem is the process is forcing them to put their actual life on hold the thing about this generation is that everything is delayed said duxbury they stay in school longer they get married later if you start comparing the average age of marriage the average age of their first kid the average age of their first permanent full time job it s also forcing those within the generation to compete with one another in ways that are specifically benefitting employers with so much talent available competition for available entry levels jobs is fierce this allows employers to pay less for the workers they need some are even getting away with not paying their employees at all advertisement 11 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content according to the canadian federation of students as many as 300 000 millennials were working in unpaid internships in a bid to further their careers by collecting relevant on the job experience in 2016 the issue with unpaid internships is that most millennials in those jobs are also working in another position likely one that pays minimum wage in order to make ends meet according to the cfs the organization which lobbies on behalf of students also pointed to statistics canada data that shows in 1997 the first year that wage data was collected only 640 000 canadians were making the minimum wage or less in 2017 that number sat at 1 02 million almost double the number previously recorded further compounding the issues facing the millennials is the steady drop in government support offered to post secondary institutions according to the cfs government provided more than 80 per cent of university operating revenues in 1982 that figure fell below 60 per cent in 2012 the most recent year for which statistics are available the cfs says government support has continued to fall in more recent years advertisement 12 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content as government support has decreased students have been forced to shoulder more of the financial burden when obtaining their education that has led to students exiting post secondary institutions with record amounts of debt using data from statistics canada the cfs said that average student debt levels have increased more than 40 per cent between 1999 and 2012 those levels have continued to climb in more recent years the increased cost of education at a time when obtaining a degree has never been more important is another hot button issue for millennials the underemployed generation

postmedia it s tough and competitive she said even for a lot of the programs you are looking at applying to to get an actual career the amount of hours of experience you need for example the physician assistant program that i applied to it s only offered by three universities in canada and i couldn t apply to the third which is the university of toronto because they require almost 1 000 hours of health care experience so where am i supposed to get that hypothetically what i m doing now could count but most people applying to that it s their second career they re going to be older in america

has become more entrenched as lower income ontarians are increasingly staying in low income and higher income ontarians are increasingly staying in high income said peter weltman the province s financial accountability officer in a report released thursday he highlighted significant structural changes in ontario s economy and labour market including a rise in part time and temporary work

of government in ensuring that all individuals have access to similar economic opportunities he said abacus s coletto is seeing signs that the trend exists here in canada too one of the key indicators of underemployment is wages which would be reflected in the rise of minimum wage workers but the other big indicator is the benefits offered by employers self employed people largely don t have access to benefits people making minimum wage get a minimum amount of benefits from their employers only 55 per cent of millennials have access to a prescription drug plan 53 per cent to dental insurance 36

rather have someone coming in with the credentials then they would training somebody who is currently working for them my father when he came back from the war had a grade 12 education when he retired he was vice president at 3m why because there was a different attitude then is it harder to buy a home yes are we taking on higher student debt yes have we been trained and educated in the wrong things many of us yes said abacus s coletto we ve been raised around these expectations go do what you want to do the world is your oyster dream big those expectations were set quite high when you enter a world where it s not possible to achieve the things that your parents and your teachers and society has been saying is going to be there it creates further tension advertisement 19 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content baby boomers won t go can t go the tension is being compounded by the baby boomer generation s refusal to leave the workforce if the millennials are stuck in a bottleneck fighting for career advancement right now the baby boomers are acting like a cork preventing any movement whereas the age 65 was once marked by a person s announcing their retirement today s senior citizens are opting to soldier on the idea of freedom at 55 seems long forgotten extended life spans better health and in some cases continued financial responsibilities are seeing many people in the baby boomer demographic work well into their 70s before opting for retirement boomers have significant expenses that perhaps they didn t anticipate plus they love their jobs and they re healthy they think what am i going to do for the next 25 years said duxbury advertisement 20 story continues below this advertisement has

aging parents many also find themselves sandwiched in between paying for their parents while also supporting their millennial children who have returned to the family home the millennials can t afford to leave their parents homes because they don t have the opportunity or means to do so but their parents can t afford to retire which would open spaces in the workforce for millennials because they are still supporting those kids at home it is a problem that the boomers aren t leaving that s absolutely true said duxbury so what comes next the awakening of the millennial tectonic plates are beginning to shift advertisement 21 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content that s the opinion at least of karen foster assistant professor at dalhousie university and canada research chair in sustainable rural futures for atlantic canada one of foster s areas of expertise is in researching generational divisions at work she said there is no doubt millennials are upset and that their complaints have been falling on deaf ears however one of the larger issues that millennials are facing is a growing wealth gap between themselves and older generations due to the fact that major life milestones have been delayed investments in real estate or other financial transactions aren t yielding the same return for the younger generation foster said sure property values have skyrocketed for older generations who bought when prices were affordable and have been hanging onto the property but the millennial who just purchased is seeing bigger mortgages than ever before and interest rates that are steadily rising advertisement 22 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content critics of millennial concerns have often pointed out that are next in line to inherit massive amounts of wealth that has been accumulated by their aging parents in fact between 2016 and 2026 the largest wealth transfer in history is expected to take place as older generations pass on as much as 1 trillion to younger generations in canada according to toronto based research firm strategic insight but foster pointed out one critical problem with the upcoming windfall the expected transfer of wealth will only benefit those people who come from families that are already wealthy it will also affect people from major canadian cities where property prices have been steadily rising in a much different way than those people from less populated towns if your family is from somewhere such as moncton n b moose jaw sask or sudbury ont you won t see the same windfall when it comes time to collect an inheritance advertisement 23 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content people who are set to inherit money from their parents or in a sense have been inheriting it their whole lives through various kinds of support that s where the real inequality happens she said adding that millennials are looking to completely upend the status quo that really comes down to a restructuring of the tax system we need to be taxing wealth and high incomes and corporate profits more in order to redistribute wealth across the demographics foster predicts that millennials are likely to push for things such as increased estate taxes in order to ensure that some of the wealth that is transferred from older generations is redistributed throughout all of society the idea is being spearheaded in the united states by recently elected democrat congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez ocasio cortez who at 29 is also a millennial is lobbying for the introduction of a tax on the wealthiest americans in the country she believes that every dollar of income over 10 million should be taxed at 70 per cent advertisement 24 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content there will of course be pushback to that idea it s been panned by the audience at the world economic forum in davos switzerland as recently as last week with attendees including michael dell founder of dell technologies and microsoft corp founder bill gates expressing objections the call for higher estate taxes in canada was recently reinforced in a study released by the canadian centre for policy alternatives ccpa you d expect canada s tax regime would try to counteract this concentration of wealth at the very top where it s needed the least but in fact federal policies encourage it said the centre s senior economist david macdonald in a release canada is the only country in the g7 without an inheritance estate or gift tax on tremendous family wealth advertisement 25 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the ccpa s report said canada s wealthiest families saw their net worth grow on average by 37 per cent between 2012 and 2016 middle class families saw their net worth grow by only 16 per cent during the same time frame the study calls for high estate taxes eliminating tax preferences for capital gains and dividend income in a bid to better distribute wealth across demographics that may sound like a scary scenario to older generations who have amassed wealth throughout their lifetimes and typically been more conservative when it comes to political fiscal policies but for the millennial generation it s only the tip of the iceberg bring the big government according to abacus data millennials are looking to government to take big steps to fix their problems this generation is more comfortable with big interventionist government than allowing market forces to play their part surveys suggest many millennials truly believe that the economic system that has been in place for hundreds of years fails to work for them advertisement 26 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the company s research suggests that millennials clearly prioritize increased government spending over balanced budgets in order to tackle issues such as alleviating income inequality they believe corporations don t pay their fair share of taxes and that government has a big role to play in redistributing that money having lived through the 2008 financial crisis and a rise in housing costs many are outright skeptical of the free market when asked to indicate if they lean more towards one perspective or the other only 46 per cent suggested that capitalism is the best economic model we have while 54 per cent believe canada would be better off with a more socialist system reads an abacus data survey released last year perhaps the most pertinent fact millennials are now the largest block of voters in the country and have the ability to swing an election toward the party or platform of their choice provided the generation gets out the vote so far they have remained relatively quiet in most elections politicians aren t talking about issues that they care about they aren t very compelling they aren t giving them a reason to get engaged said abacus s coletto millennials are unique from previous generations particularly the boomers and those who came before the boomers in that voting is not considered a duty we don t do it because we have to we do it because we have a reason to reasons seem to be emerging according to elections canada 38 8 per cent of eligible voters between the ages of 18 and 24 years of age voted in the 2011 federal election of those between 25 and 34 years of age 45 1 per cent cast their ballot by comparison a total of 64 5 per cent of canadians between the ages of 45 and 54 voted in that election when it came to canadians between the ages of 65 and 74 a total of 75 1 per cent of eligible voters participated the federal election in 2015 saw better turnout by millennials more than 57 1 per cent of eligible voters between 18 and 24 years of age cast a ballot the number was similar in the 25 through 34 year old age group where 57 4 per cent of eligible voters participated one of the big issues during the 2015 election was the liberal party s promise to legalize cannabis sales in canada which is something that appeals specifically to the millennial generation s interests more than 60 per cent of canadians between the ages of 18 and 34 supported legalizing cannabis according to a study released by nrg research group and peak communicators in march 2017 photo by chris young the canadian press it s expected that more politicians will be looking to woo the millennial vote heading into october s federal election last week finance minister bill morneau said the federal government is looking at ways to make housing purchases more affordable for millennials in the months ahead he called the issue a priority but didn t elaborate ndp leader jagmeet singh has said his party would propose measures to help build as many as 500 000 affordable housing units across the country if elected with more politicians tuning into the fact that the millennial generation will vote for political platforms that speak to their agenda the 18 through 35 demographic looks as though it will soon find itself in an unfamiliar position instead of taking a back seat while older generations plot the course millennials are poised to grab the wheel and take a drastic detour it hasn t boiled over yet but the pot is starting to get warm said coletto there are more millennials than there are boomers more millennials are eligible to vote than any other generation more politicians are mindful of the shift that millennials could bring meanwhile barrett is

refusal to leave the workforce if the millennials are stuck in a bottleneck fighting for career advancement right now the baby boomers are acting like a cork preventing any movement whereas the age 65 was once marked by a person s announcing their retirement today s senior citizens are opting to soldier on the idea of freedom at 55 seems long forgotten extended life spans better health and in some cases continued financial responsibilities are seeing many people in the baby boomer demographic work well into their 70s before opting for retirement boomers have significant expenses that perhaps

aging parents many also find themselves sandwiched in between paying for their parents while also supporting their millennial children who have returned to the family home the millennials can t afford to leave their parents homes because they don t have the opportunity or means to do so but their parents can t afford to retire which would open spaces in the workforce for millennials because they are still supporting those kids at home it is a problem that the boomers aren t leaving that s absolutely true said duxbury so what comes next the awakening of the millennial tectonic plates are beginning to shift advertisement 21 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content that s the opinion at least of karen foster assistant professor at dalhousie university and canada research chair in sustainable rural futures for atlantic canada one of foster s areas of expertise is in researching generational divisions at work she said there is no doubt millennials are upset and that their complaints have been falling on deaf ears however one of the larger issues that millennials are facing is a growing wealth gap between themselves and older generations due to the fact that major life milestones have been delayed investments in real estate or other financial transactions aren t yielding the same return for the younger generation foster said sure property values have skyrocketed for older generations who bought when prices were affordable and have been hanging onto the property but the millennial who just purchased is seeing bigger mortgages than ever before and interest rates that are steadily rising advertisement 22 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content critics of millennial concerns have often pointed out that are next in line to inherit massive amounts of wealth that has been accumulated by their aging parents in fact between 2016 and 2026 the largest wealth transfer in history is expected to take place as older generations pass on as much as 1 trillion to younger generations in canada according to toronto based research firm strategic insight but foster pointed out one critical problem with the upcoming windfall the expected transfer of wealth will only benefit those people who come from families that are already wealthy it will also affect people from major canadian cities where property prices have been steadily rising in a much different way than those people from less populated towns if your family is from somewhere such as moncton n b moose jaw sask or sudbury ont you won t see the same windfall when it comes time to collect an inheritance advertisement 23 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content people who are set to inherit money from their parents or in a sense have been inheriting it their whole lives through various kinds of support that s where the real inequality happens she said adding that millennials are looking to completely upend the status quo that really comes down to a restructuring of the tax system we need to be taxing wealth and high incomes and corporate profits more in order to redistribute wealth across the demographics foster predicts that millennials are likely to push for things such as increased estate taxes in order to ensure that some of the wealth that is transferred from older generations is redistributed throughout all of society the idea is being spearheaded in the united states by recently elected democrat congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez ocasio cortez who at 29 is also a millennial is lobbying for the introduction of a tax on the wealthiest americans in the country she believes that every dollar of income over 10 million should be taxed at 70 per cent advertisement 24 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content there will of course be pushback to that idea it s been panned by the audience at the world economic forum in davos switzerland as recently as last week with attendees including michael dell founder of dell technologies and microsoft corp founder bill gates expressing objections the call for higher estate taxes in canada was recently reinforced in a study released by the canadian centre for policy alternatives ccpa you d expect canada s tax regime would try to counteract this concentration of wealth at the very top where it s needed the least but in fact federal policies encourage it said the centre s senior economist david macdonald in a release canada is the only country in the g7 without an inheritance estate or gift tax on tremendous family wealth advertisement 25 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the ccpa s report said canada s wealthiest families saw their net worth grow on average by 37 per cent between 2012 and 2016 middle class families saw their net worth grow by only 16 per cent during the same time frame the study calls for high estate taxes eliminating tax preferences for capital gains and dividend income in a bid to better distribute wealth across demographics that may sound like a scary scenario to older generations who have amassed wealth throughout their lifetimes and typically been more conservative when it comes to political fiscal policies but for the millennial generation it s only the tip of the iceberg bring the big government according to abacus data millennials are looking to government to take big steps to fix their problems this generation is more comfortable with big interventionist government than allowing market forces to play their part surveys suggest many millennials truly believe that the economic system that has been in place for hundreds of years fails to work for them advertisement 26 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the company s research suggests that millennials clearly prioritize increased government spending over balanced budgets in order to tackle issues such as alleviating income inequality they believe corporations don t pay their fair share of taxes and that government has a big role to play in redistributing that money having lived through the 2008 financial crisis and a rise in housing costs many are outright skeptical of the free market when asked to indicate if they lean more towards one perspective or the other only 46 per cent suggested that capitalism is the best economic model we have while 54 per cent believe canada would be better off with a more socialist system reads an abacus data survey released last year perhaps the most pertinent fact millennials are now the largest block of voters in the country and have the ability to swing an election toward the party or platform of their choice provided the generation gets out the vote so far they have remained relatively quiet in most elections politicians aren t talking about issues that they care about they aren t very compelling they aren t giving them a reason to get engaged said abacus s coletto millennials are unique from previous generations particularly the boomers and those who came before the boomers in that voting is not considered a duty we don t do it because we have to we do it because we have a reason to reasons seem to be emerging according to elections canada 38 8 per cent of eligible voters between the ages of 18 and 24 years of age voted in the 2011 federal election of those between 25 and 34 years of age 45 1 per cent cast their ballot by comparison a total of 64 5 per cent of canadians between the ages of 45 and 54 voted in that election when it came to canadians between the ages of 65 and 74 a total of 75 1 per cent of eligible voters participated the federal election in 2015 saw better turnout by millennials more than 57 1 per cent of eligible voters between 18 and 24 years of age cast a ballot the number was similar in the 25 through 34 year old age group where 57 4 per cent of eligible voters participated one of the big issues during the 2015 election was the liberal party s promise to legalize cannabis sales in canada which is something that appeals specifically to the millennial generation s interests more than 60 per cent of canadians between the ages of 18 and 34 supported legalizing cannabis according to a study released by nrg research group and peak communicators in march 2017 photo by chris young the canadian press it s expected that more politicians will be looking to woo the millennial vote heading into october s federal election last week finance minister bill morneau said the federal government is looking at ways to make housing purchases more affordable for millennials in the months ahead he called the issue a priority but didn t elaborate ndp leader jagmeet singh has said his party would propose measures to help build as many as 500 000 affordable housing units across the country if elected with more politicians tuning into the fact that the millennial generation will vote for political platforms that speak to their agenda the 18 through 35 demographic looks as though it will soon find itself in an unfamiliar position instead of taking a back seat while older generations plot the course millennials are poised to grab the wheel and take a drastic detour it hasn t boiled over yet but the pot is starting to get warm said coletto there are more millennials than there are boomers more millennials are eligible to vote than any other generation more politicians are mindful of the shift that millennials could bring meanwhile barrett is taking things in stride i ve seen a fair amount of challenges our generation may seem to think that we go through more but i think that every generation goes through some kind of hardships when it

it will also affect people from major canadian cities where property prices have been steadily rising in a much different way than those people from less populated towns if your family is from

support that s where the real inequality happens she said adding that millennials are looking to completely upend the status quo that really comes down to a restructuring of the tax system we need to be taxing wealth and high incomes and corporate profits more in order to redistribute wealth across the demographics foster predicts that millennials are likely to push for things such as increased estate taxes in order to ensure that some of the wealth that is transferred from older generations is redistributed throughout all of society the idea is being spearheaded in the united states by recently elected democrat congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez ocasio cortez who at 29 is also a millennial is lobbying for the introduction of a tax on the wealthiest americans in the country she believes that every dollar of income over 10 million should be taxed at 70 per cent advertisement 24 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content there will of course be pushback to that idea it s been panned by the audience at the world economic forum in davos switzerland as recently as last week with attendees including michael dell founder of dell technologies and microsoft corp founder bill gates expressing objections the call for higher estate taxes in canada was recently reinforced in a study released by the canadian centre for policy alternatives ccpa you d expect canada s tax regime would try to counteract this concentration of wealth at the very top where it s needed the least but in fact federal policies encourage it said the centre s senior economist david macdonald in a release canada is the only country in the g7 without an inheritance estate or gift tax on tremendous family wealth advertisement 25 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the ccpa s report said canada s wealthiest families saw their net worth grow on average by 37 per cent between 2012 and 2016 middle class families saw their net worth grow by only 16 per cent during the same time frame the study calls for high estate taxes eliminating tax preferences for capital gains and dividend income in a bid to better distribute wealth across demographics that may sound like a scary scenario to older generations who have amassed wealth throughout their lifetimes and typically been more conservative when it comes to political fiscal policies but for the millennial generation it s only the tip of the iceberg bring the big government according to abacus data millennials are looking to government to take big steps to fix their problems this generation is more comfortable with big interventionist government than allowing market forces to play their part surveys suggest many millennials truly believe that the economic system that has been in place for hundreds of years fails to work for them advertisement 26 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the company s research suggests that millennials clearly prioritize increased government spending over balanced budgets in order to tackle issues such as alleviating income inequality they believe corporations don t pay their fair share of taxes and that government has a big role to play in redistributing that money having lived through the 2008 financial crisis and a rise in housing costs many are outright skeptical of the free market when asked to indicate if they lean more towards one perspective or the other only 46 per cent suggested that capitalism is the best economic model we have while 54 per cent believe canada would be better off with a more socialist system reads an abacus data survey released last year perhaps the most pertinent fact millennials are now the largest block of voters in the country and have the ability to swing an election toward the party or platform of their choice provided the generation gets out the vote so far they have remained relatively quiet in most elections politicians aren t talking about issues that they care about they aren t very compelling they aren t giving them a reason to get engaged said abacus s coletto millennials are unique from previous generations particularly the boomers and those who came before the boomers in that voting is not considered a duty we don t do it because we have to we do it because we have a reason to reasons seem to be emerging according to elections canada 38 8 per cent of eligible voters between the ages of 18 and 24 years of age voted in the 2011 federal election of those between 25 and 34 years of age 45 1 per cent cast their ballot by comparison a total of 64 5 per cent of canadians between the ages of 45 and 54 voted in that election when it came to canadians between the ages of 65 and 74 a total of 75 1 per cent of eligible voters participated the federal election in 2015 saw better turnout by millennials more than 57 1 per cent of eligible voters between 18 and 24 years of age cast a ballot the number was similar in the 25 through 34 year old age group where 57 4 per cent of eligible voters participated one of the big issues during the 2015 election was the liberal party s promise to legalize cannabis sales in canada which is something that appeals specifically to the millennial generation s interests more than 60 per cent of canadians between the ages of 18 and 34 supported legalizing cannabis according to a study released by nrg research group and peak communicators in march 2017 photo by chris young the canadian press it s expected that more politicians will be looking to woo the millennial vote heading into october s federal election last week finance minister bill morneau said the federal government is looking at ways to make housing purchases more affordable for millennials in the months ahead he called the issue a priority but didn t elaborate ndp leader jagmeet singh has said his party would propose measures to help build as many as 500 000 affordable housing units across the country if elected with more politicians tuning into the fact that the millennial generation will vote for political platforms that speak to their agenda the 18 through 35 demographic looks as though it will soon find itself in an unfamiliar position instead of taking a back seat while older generations plot the course millennials are poised to grab the wheel and take a drastic detour it hasn t boiled over yet but the pot is starting to get warm said coletto there are more millennials than there are boomers more millennials are eligible to vote than any other generation more politicians are mindful of the shift that millennials could bring meanwhile barrett is

generation is really really stuck in many ways said benjamin tal managing director and deputy chief economist at cibc this is really the story of this cohort we have a situation where housing is much more expensive so they have to compromise on either renting or they have to switch to condominiums or smart houses or they might buy a car and stay with their parents in the 1960s census data suggest as few as eight per cent of canadians ages 18 to 35 were living with parents today as has been well documented those numbers have skyrocketed come 2016 a total of 34 7 per cent of canadians between

released in 2017 found 37 per cent of millennials who have purchased a home received some of the money for the purchase from their parents the education system basically failed them the only thing that is helping them is their parents said tal from the cibc the education system basically failed them they are highly educated but they are not educated in what s relevant there is a mismatch between the skills that they have and what the economy needs and therefore you have many people underemployed and or trying to compromise advertisement 9 story continues below this advertisement has

up the most highly educated generation ever produced more than 3 5 million canadians between the ages of 20 and 34 reported having some sort of post secondary education including bachelor degrees and post graduate certificates and diplomas in the 2016 census but the degree by itself isn t proving to be enough it s not an option about whether or not they re going to have an education that s like an invitation card to the party said carleton university s linda duxbury a professor in management sciences at the sprott school of business who specializes in demographic trends she s also a member of

situation like an arms race for qualifications to set a candidate apart from their competitors so they can land a good job and start their lives the problem is the process is forcing them to put their actual life on hold the thing about this generation is that everything is delayed said duxbury they stay in school longer they get married later if you start comparing the average age of marriage the average age of their first kid the average age of their first permanent full time job it s also forcing those within the generation to compete with one another in ways that are specifically benefitting employers with so much talent available competition for available entry levels jobs is fierce this allows employers to pay less for the workers they need some are even getting away with not paying their employees at all advertisement 11 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content according to the canadian federation of students as many as 300 000 millennials were working in unpaid internships in a bid to further their careers by collecting relevant on the job experience in 2016 the issue with unpaid internships is that most millennials in those jobs are also working in another position likely one that pays minimum wage in order to make ends meet according to the cfs the organization which lobbies on behalf of students also pointed to statistics canada data that shows in 1997 the first year that wage data was collected only 640 000 canadians were making the minimum wage or less in 2017 that number sat at 1 02 million almost double the number previously recorded further compounding the issues facing the millennials is the steady drop in government support offered to post secondary institutions according to the cfs government provided more than 80 per cent of university operating revenues in 1982 that figure fell below 60 per cent in 2012 the most recent year for which statistics are available the cfs says government support has continued to fall in more recent years advertisement 12 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content as government support has decreased students have been forced to shoulder more of the financial burden when obtaining their education that has led to students exiting post secondary institutions with record amounts of debt using data from statistics canada the cfs said that average student debt levels have increased more than 40 per cent between 1999 and 2012 those levels have continued to climb in more recent years the increased cost of education at a time when obtaining a degree has never been more important is another hot button issue for millennials the underemployed generation

postmedia it s tough and competitive she said even for a lot of the programs you are looking at applying to to get an actual career the amount of hours of experience you need for example the physician assistant program that i applied to it s only offered by three universities in canada and i couldn t apply to the third which is the university of toronto because they require almost 1 000 hours of health care experience so where am i supposed to get that hypothetically what i m doing now could count but most people applying to that it s their second career they re going to be older in america where numbers are more readily available underemployment held steady at around 33 per cent of all post secondary graduates between the 1980s and 2010 advertisement 15 story continues below this

has become more entrenched as lower income ontarians are increasingly staying in low income and higher income ontarians are increasingly staying in high income said peter weltman the province s financial accountability officer in a report released thursday he highlighted significant structural changes in ontario s economy and labour market including a rise in part time and temporary work

of government in ensuring that all individuals have access to similar economic opportunities he said abacus s coletto is seeing signs that the trend exists here in canada too one of the key indicators of underemployment is wages which would be reflected in the rise of minimum wage workers but the other big indicator is the benefits offered by employers self employed people largely don t have access to benefits people making minimum wage get a minimum amount of benefits from their employers only 55 per cent of millennials have access to a prescription drug plan 53 per cent to dental insurance 36

rather have someone coming in with the credentials then they would training somebody who is currently working for them my father when he came back from the war had a grade 12 education when he retired he was vice president at 3m why because there was a different attitude then is it harder to buy a home yes are we taking on higher student debt yes have we been trained and educated in the wrong things many of us yes said abacus s coletto we ve been raised around these expectations go do what you want to do the world is your oyster dream big those expectations were set quite high when you enter a world where it s not possible to achieve the things that your parents and your teachers and society has been saying is going to be there it creates further tension advertisement 19 story

refusal to leave the workforce if the millennials are stuck in a bottleneck fighting for career advancement right now the baby boomers are acting like a cork preventing any movement whereas the age 65 was once marked by a person s announcing their retirement today s senior citizens are opting to soldier on the idea of freedom at 55 seems long forgotten extended life spans better health and in some cases continued financial responsibilities are seeing many people in the baby boomer demographic work well into their 70s before opting for retirement boomers have significant expenses that perhaps they didn t anticipate plus they love their jobs and they re healthy they think what am i going to do for the next 25 years said duxbury advertisement 20 story continues below this advertisement has

aging parents many also find themselves sandwiched in between paying for their parents while also supporting their millennial children who have returned to the family home the millennials can t afford to leave their parents homes because they don t have the opportunity or means to do so but their parents can t afford to retire which would open spaces in the workforce for millennials because they are still supporting those kids at home it is a problem that the boomers aren t leaving that s absolutely true said duxbury so what comes next the awakening of the millennial tectonic plates are

said there is no doubt millennials are upset and that their complaints have been falling on deaf ears however one of the larger issues that millennials are facing is a growing wealth gap between themselves and older generations due to the fact that major life milestones have been delayed investments in real estate or other financial transactions aren t yielding the same return for the younger

by challenging united states hegemony is never an easy course a county need not be socialist it is enough to either voice aspirations toward socialism or merely demonstrate a pattern of not doing as washington dictates so here we go again this time with venezuela ironically for a country that the corporate media insistently claims has been ruled by two dictators remember that hugo chávez was routinely denounced in the same ways that nicolás maduro is today it would be difficult to find a country with more opportunities for grassroots democracy and for everyday people to participate in the decisions that affect their lives and neighborhoods there has been backtracking on some of this and there are legitimate complaints about the top down manner in which the ruling united socialist party of venezuela psuv is run the u s government is in no position to point fingers however given its history in latin america and the widespread voter suppression that is a regular feature of u s elections it is also preposterous to assert that socialism has failed in venezuela when 70 percent of the country s economy is in private hands the country is completely integrated into the world capitalist system and it is overly dependent on a commodity with a price that wildly fluctuates on capitalist markets venezuela is a capitalist country that does far more than most to ameliorate the conditions of capitalism and in which socialism remains an aspiration if something has failed it is capitalism leaving much of the economy in the hands of capitalists leaves them with the ability to sabotage an economy a lesson learned in painful fashion during the 1980s in sandinista nicaragua before delving into the significant problems of venezuela largely due to the economic war being waged against it by the u s government and the economic sabotage within by venezuela s industrialists and other business interests it is worthwhile to briefly examine some of the democratic institutions that have been created since the bolivarian revolution took root in 1998 communal councils organize at neighborhood level the base of the venezuelan political system are the communal councils various political structures designed to organize people at the grassroots level have evolved into a system of communal councils organized on a neighborhood level which in turn build up to communes and communal cities these are direct democracy bodies that identify and solve the problems and deficiencies of their local areas with the direct support and funding of the national government after decades of neglect by previous governments there were no shortage of problems to tackle like many institutions of the bolivarian revolution these have roots in grassroots organizing that pre date hugo chávez s first election the barrio assembly of caracas emerged in 1991 as something of a general assembly representing local groups coming into being after demonstrations marking the first and second anniversaries of the caracazo uprising were dispersed by soldiers firing on them from rooftops the caracazo uprising was a massive revolt sparked by popular resistance to an austerity package dictated by the international monetary fund later versions of these assemblies organized on the eve of the 2002 coup attempting to overthrow president chávez among these assemblies accomplishments were distributing 100 000 fliers calling for a march on the presidential palace to defend the government the communal councils are the base of an alternative government structure one intended to bypass municipal and other local governments and to eventually replace them this was an attempt to provide a concrete form to the concept of constituent power the idea that people should be direct participants in the decisions to affect their lives and communities legislation passed in 2006 formally recognized the communal councils and the form quickly gained popularity there were an estimated 30 000 in existence by 2009 these councils are formed in compact urban areas containing 200 to 400 households in cities and 20 or so in rural areas all residents of the territory are eligible to participate in turn communal councils organize into larger communes and communes into communal cities to coordinate projects too large for a neighborhood or to organize projects necessarily on a larger scale such as improving municipal services communal councils are required to propose three projects that will contribute to development in the community funding for approved projects will usually come from national government bodies an interesting development is that many in the case of councils studied by researchers a majority who have taken active roles in the communal councils were not politically active before the 2002 failed coup generally women outnumber men among the active participants and it is often older women taking the lead the culture of participation that the councils encourage and that the bolivarian government is paying vastly more attention to solving social problems and the needs of the poor than prior governments has facilitated the organizing of women and the new activity of women in turn is breaking down traditional macho attitudes that pensions are now much stronger proving material security also enables participation health committees tackling problems of illness access to contraception and motherhood are often where participation begins once involved women sign up for training programs with more women then men taking advantage of these communes often organize enterprises to provide employment for local residents and to help supply needed basic goods one example is the el panal 2012 commune in caracas el panal operates several enterprises and a communal bank one of the enterprises is a sugar packaging plant and there are also bakeries el panal activists are also creating links with neighboring communes in caracas and in other parts of the country links are also being created with the countryside a pueblo a pueblo initiative brings together urban communities and farmers to distribute food directly eliminating intermediaries and speculators el panal also regularly organizes food fairs at which meats vegetables and other basic foods can be bought at discounts well below market prices tackling social problems through missions there are also the social programs known as missions that are based on the direct participation of the beneficiaries begun in 2003 there are more than two dozen missions that seek to solve a wide array of social problems given the corruption and inertia of the state bureaucracy and the unwillingness of many professionals to provide services to poor neighborhoods the missions were established to provide services directly while enabling participants to shape the programs much government money was poured into these programs thanks to the then high price of oil which in turn enabled the chávez government to fund them among the approximately two dozen missions are alimentación which incorporates the mercal network that provides food at subsidized prices and a distribution system cultura which seeks the decentralization and democratization of culture to ensure that all have access to it and stimulate community participation guaicaipuro intended to guarantee the rights of indigenous peoples as specified in the constitution madres del barrio designed to provide support to housewives in dire poverty and help their families overcome their poverty negra hipólita which assists children adolescents and adults who are homeless piar which seeks to help mining communities through dignifying living conditions and establishing environmental practices and zamora intended to reorganize land especially idle land that could be used for agriculture in accordance with the constitution venezuelan political scientist and historian margarita lópez maya summarized the breadth of the missions in a socialist register article missions programs bypassing uncooperative or ineffective state agencies such as barrio adentro free 24 hours a day primary health care and disease prevention for low income groups mercal state distribution of food at subsidized prices robinson 1 and 2 literacy and primary education for adults ribas and sucre secondary and university education for those who had missed or not finished these vuelvan caras training for employment and the bolivarian schools where a full day schedule has been restored with two free meals and two snacks a day plus free uniforms and textbooks all these undoubtedly had a positive political impact the government has also invested in the social economy as in the ruedas de negocios in which the creation of cooperatives is encouraged in order to supply goods and services to the state sector the government has also created a system of micro financing with the women s bank the sovereign people s bank and so on which make small loans to lower income borrowers struggles for economic democracy in the workplaces there are experiments with co management cooperatives socialist production units and workers councils these forms have been contested an ongoing multiple sided struggle over what constitutes workers control of industry and what forms such control should take continues cooperative enterprises are enshrined in the constitution and a 2001 law mandates that all members be included in decision making and that an assembly of all members has final decision making power over all topics temporary workers can be hired for a maximum of six months after which they must be accepted as members a state ministry was created to provide assistance to cooperatives and small businesses including the facilitation of securing contracts from state companies there are difficulties here one significant problem were instances of cooperatives being formed only in order to acquire the start up capital provided by the government or were small companies that converted to being cooperatives only on paper to take advantage of preferential priority for state contracts or to obtain subsidies in response to these irregularities the government began to require coops obtain a certificate of fulfillment of responsibilities which includes financial audits and demonstration of work within their local community nonetheless there are many examples of successful cooperative enterprises there are also socialist production units these are nonprofit state owned enterprises that are managed democratically by a combination of their workers local communal councils and the national government these enterprises are intended to provide local services such as transportation and distribution of cooking gas and the creation of production although workers are directly involved in decision making at these enterprises the state also has a role which can sometimes lead to tensions the goods produced are most often distributed through the mercal state owned chain of supermarkets that provides food at subsidized prices and pdval a state run food distribution network these are often operated at a loss as they are intended to provide needed goods and services to communities at steep discounts a continuing area of contestation are state owned enterprises some argue for state ownership with employee participation others argue for full autonomy of enterprises and the workers in them and there are gradations in between there are managements that don t wish to cede decision making authority to their workforce and there are government officials despite being part of the bolivarian movement who oppose workers control sometimes because they believe in top down control by the state there are examples of state owned companies in which management structures have changed multiple times as different factions temporarily gain control the push and pull of competing interests and tendencies is exemplified in the case of the state owned aluminum smelter alcasa which had a well functioning system of workers control under co management that reversed its debt problems then had a new director appointed who ignored the co management structure with an accompanying fall in productivity and return of corruption and then a return to co management when president chávez named a new company president selected by the workers workers control was reinstated with new structures and because of the precarious financial situation caused by the corruption of the middle period workers began designing parts to be produced internally instead of buying them from suppliers as previously done more difficulties arose when a dissident union aligned with the local state governor attempted to stop production and although unsuccessful caused a significant disruption yet another change in management by chávez led to a renewed deterioration in co management and struggles at alcasa continued economic warfare at home and abroad shifting from a traditional capitalist economy toward a participatory economic democracy can t be expected to be smooth sailing especially when this attempt is being done in a country with subaltern status in the world capitalist system president chávez had to withstand three successive attempts to remove him the 2002 coup 2002 03 bosses lockout and the 2004 recall referendum five times he was elected president never with less than 55 percent of the vote and overall he won 16 of 17 elections and referendums in which his movement participated the election system put in place by the chávez government was declared by former u s president jimmy carter s carter center to be the best in the world none of this prevented the late president from being furiously denounced as a dictator once he died however the attacks were stepped up by the revolution s opponents apparently believing that the loss of the leader would make the revolution vulnerable in reality the bolivarian revolution has always been a movement propelled by millions who will not readily give up the many gains they have achieved and which pushed the late president to go further venezuela has a long tradition of strong organized movements which predate the bolivarian revolution despite the difficulties of recent years and increasing popular disapproval of president maduro those movements do not want their gains to be reversed during the chávez years unemployment and poverty were drastically reduced and people were able to participate in the political process for the first time so how much of venezuela s serious economic problems are the fault of the current president some of the blame can be laid at his doorstep but mostly for his inability to act in timely fashion and allowing problems caused by outside forces to deepen a serious mistake that has ran through the past 20 years is that no progress was made on reducing venezuela s heavy reliance on oil exports when oil prices were high the government was content to let the money flow and use it to fund social programs and finance a wide variety of projects but the later crash in oil prices left the government vulnerable by not diversifying the economy much less is earned when the inevitable falls in price arrive and it becomes difficult to maintain consumption because so many consumer products must be imported the over reliance on a single export commodity would be difficult to overcome by itself but greatly compounding venezuela s problems are u s sanctions a currency that became drastically overvalued and an inflationary spiral resulting from that overvaluation that incentivized black markets and smuggling poor management on the part of the government of president maduro has intensified the damage done by those factors although the venezuelan government set an official exchange rate for its currency the bolívar the effective exchange rate was determined by international currency speculators and thus the value of the bolívar is not in the control of caracas speculators caused the value of the bolívar to be reduced by 97 percent in 2017 and further drastic reductions in the currency s value continued well into 2018 the value or output of the venezuelan economy hardly declined by anything remotely comparable so there are other factors at work for such a drastic reduction in exchange value but because the maduro government did not adjust the official exchange rate when the bolívar came under attack the spread between the official rate and the de facto rate widened to the point that vast opportunities for smuggling and black market operations were created that in turn caused shortages and hyperinflation these developments were a consequence of venezuela s integration into the world capitalist system and the country s heavy reliance on imports food and consumer goods intended to be sold at discounts in state stores were diverted to the black market where profiteers sold them at prices several times higher or smuggled them into colombia for huge profits government officials have repeatedly discovered vast quantities of consumer goods hidden in warehouses by local capitalists who are artificially causing shortages hardening financial sanctions united states government sanctions on venezuela prohibit any u s persons or banks from providing financing or purchasing any debt issued by the venezuelan government or the state oil company pdvsa the purpose of which is to make it more difficult for the government to raise funds internationally or to restructure debt these sanctions are effectively extra territorial a non u s bank that seeks to handle a transaction in u s dollars the currency most often used in international transactions has to do so by clearing the transaction through a u s bank a u s bank that cleared such a transaction would be in violation of the sanctions the obama administration intensified the u s financial war on venezuela by absurdly declaring the latter a national security threat and the trump administration has issued a succession of decrees tightening the screws the latest issued on january 28 freezes all property and interests of pdvsa subject to u s jurisdiction in other words blocking venezuela from any access to the profits generated by pdvsa s u s subsidiary citgo or any pdvsa activities in the united states the trump administration expects venezuela to lose us 11 billion this year the new york times reports that move is in addition to repeated calls by the trump administration for an overthrow of the venezuelan government threats by president trump to invade and the trump administration recognizing the opposition leader juan guaidó as president although guaidó has never run for the position and is largely unknown to the venezuelan public an added insult is the appointment of death squad cheerleader elliot abrams to oversee a return to democracy an idea that would draw laughs if abrams history in latin america during the reagan administration weren t so deadly successive u s administrations have subsidized opposition groups an estimated us 100 million has been pouredinto venezuela in an effort to subvert the elected government alan macleod a specialist in media studies summarized the extra territorial effect of u s sanctions he sanctions strongly discourage other countries from lending money to the country for fear of reprisal and also discourage any businesses from doing business there too a study from the 2018 opposition presidential candidate s economics czar suggested the sanctions were responsible for a 50 drop in oil production furthermore trump s sanctions prevent profits from venezuela owned citgo from being sent back to venezuela trump has also threatened banks with 30 years in jail if they co operate with caracas and has intimidated others into going along with them president maduro is repeatedly called a dictator an epithet endless repeated across the corporate media but when a portion of the opposition boycotts can it be a surprise that the incumbent wins the opposition actually asked the united nations to not send observers a sure sign that they expected to lose a fair election despite their claims that the election would be rigged nonetheless a coalition of canadian unions church leaders and other officials declared the election to be a transparent secure democratic and orderly electoral and voting process unfortunately there is every reason to be concerned given the hostility of u s governments and capitalists to any intent to become independent of the u s or to direct economic activity to benefit local people rather than maximizing the profits of u s multinational corporations the united states has militarily invaded latin american and caribbean countries 96 times including 48 times in the 20th century that total constitutes only direct interventions and doesn t include coups fomented by the u s such as guatemala in 1954 and chile in 1973 guatemala was attempting nothing more radical than a land reform that would have forced united fruit to sell idle land at united fruit s own under valuation of the land a self assessment made by united fruit to avoid paying a fair share of taxes the u s overthrew the government and instituted what would become a 40 year nightmare of state organized mass murder that ultimately cost 200 000 lives the chilean effort to build a humane economy was ended with the overthrow of salvador allende and the installation of augusto pinochet and his murderous regime that immiserated chileans dissimilar results can hardly be expected if the u s were to succeed in overthrowing the venezuelan government and installing a right wing government that would reverse the many gains of the past 20 years hands off venezuela

defined benefit pension plans are being pared back or even eliminated by employers giving those older generations an even bigger financial leg up laziness isn t the culprit here millennials are working and working hard in fact they re actually participating in the labour force more and by some measures working harder than previous generations did in 1980 78 9 per cent of all canadians

more expensive so they have to compromise on either renting or they have to switch to condominiums or smart houses or they might buy a car and stay with their parents in the 1960s census data suggest as few as eight per cent of canadians ages 18 to 35 were living with parents today as has been well documented those numbers have skyrocketed come 2016 a total of 34 7 per cent of canadians between

that is helping them is their parents said tal from the cibc the education system basically failed them they are highly educated but they are not educated in what s relevant there is a mismatch

post graduate certificates and diplomas in the 2016 census but the degree by itself isn t proving to be enough it s not an option about whether or not they re going to have an education that s like an

actual life on hold the thing about this generation is that everything is delayed said duxbury they stay in school longer they get married later if you start comparing the average age of marriage the average age of their first kid the average age of their first permanent full time job it s also forcing those within the generation to compete with one another in ways that are specifically benefitting employers with so much talent available competition for available entry levels jobs is fierce this allows employers to pay less for the workers they need some are even getting away with not paying their employees at all advertisement 11 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content according to the canadian federation of students as many as 300 000 millennials were working in unpaid internships in a bid to further their careers by collecting relevant on the job experience in 2016 the issue with unpaid internships is that most millennials in those jobs are also working in another position likely one that pays minimum wage in order to make ends meet according to the cfs the organization which lobbies on behalf of students also pointed to statistics canada data that shows in 1997 the first year that wage data was collected only 640 000 canadians were making the minimum wage or less in 2017 that number sat at 1 02 million almost double the number previously recorded further compounding the issues facing the millennials is the steady drop in government support offered to post secondary institutions according to the cfs government provided more than 80 per cent of university operating revenues in 1982 that figure fell below 60 per cent in 2012 the most recent year for which statistics are available the cfs says government support has continued to fall in more recent years advertisement 12 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content as

record amounts of debt using data from statistics canada the cfs said that average student debt levels have increased more than 40 per cent between 1999 and 2012 those levels have continued to climb in more recent years the increased cost of education at a time when obtaining a degree has never been more important is another hot button issue for millennials the underemployed generation

of underemployment is wages which would be reflected in the rise of minimum wage workers but the other big indicator is the benefits offered by employers self employed people largely don t have access to benefits people making minimum wage get a minimum amount of benefits from their employers only 55 per cent of millennials have access to a prescription drug plan 53 per cent to dental insurance 36

more expensive so they have to compromise on either renting or they have to switch to condominiums or smart houses or they might buy a car and stay with their parents in the 1960s census data suggest as few as eight per cent of canadians ages 18 to 35 were living with parents today as has been well documented those numbers have skyrocketed come 2016 a total of 34 7 per cent of canadians between

that is helping them is their parents said tal from the cibc the education system basically failed them they are highly educated but they are not educated in what s relevant there is a mismatch

post graduate certificates and diplomas in the 2016 census but the degree by itself isn t proving to be enough it s not an option about whether or not they re going to have an education that s like an invitation card to the party said carleton university s linda duxbury a professor in management sciences at the sprott school of business who specializes in demographic trends she s also a member of

situation like an arms race for qualifications to set a candidate apart from their competitors so they can land a good job and start their lives the problem is the process is forcing them to put their actual life on hold the thing about this generation is that everything is delayed said duxbury they stay in school longer they get married later if you start comparing the average age of marriage the average age of their first kid the average age of their first permanent full time job it s also forcing those within the generation to compete with one another in ways that are specifically benefitting employers with so much talent available competition for available entry levels jobs is fierce this allows employers to pay less for the workers they need some are even getting away with not paying their employees at all advertisement 11 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content according to the canadian federation of students as many as 300 000 millennials were working in unpaid internships in a bid to further their careers by collecting relevant on the job experience in 2016 the issue with unpaid internships is that most millennials in those jobs are also working in another position likely one that pays minimum wage in order to make ends meet according to the cfs the organization which lobbies on behalf of students also pointed to statistics canada data that shows in 1997 the first year that wage data was collected only 640 000 canadians were making the minimum wage or less in 2017 that number sat at 1 02 million almost double the number previously recorded further compounding the issues facing the millennials is the steady drop in government support offered to post secondary institutions according to the cfs government provided more than 80 per cent of university operating revenues in 1982 that figure fell below 60 per cent in 2012 the most recent year for which statistics are available the cfs says government support has continued to fall in more recent years advertisement 12 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content as government support has decreased students have been forced to shoulder more of the financial burden when obtaining their education that has led to students exiting post secondary institutions with record amounts of debt using data from statistics canada the cfs said that average student debt levels have increased more than 40 per cent between 1999 and 2012 those levels have continued to climb in more recent years the increased cost of education at a time when obtaining a degree has never been more important is another hot button issue for millennials the underemployed generation

health care experience so where am i supposed to get that hypothetically what i m doing now could count but most people applying to that it s their second career they re going to be older in america

of government in ensuring that all individuals have access to similar economic opportunities he said abacus s coletto is seeing signs that the trend exists here in canada too one of the key indicators of underemployment is wages which would be reflected in the rise of minimum wage workers but the other big indicator is the benefits offered by employers self employed people largely don t have access to benefits people making minimum wage get a minimum amount of benefits from their employers only 55 per cent of millennials have access to a prescription drug plan 53 per cent to dental insurance 36

defined benefit pension plans are being pared back or even eliminated by employers giving those older generations an even bigger financial leg up laziness isn t the culprit here millennials are working and working hard in fact they re actually participating in the labour force more and by some measures working harder than previous generations did in 1980 78 9 per cent of all canadians

million people now in the millennial generation accounting for 27 5 per cent of canada s population that sheer size makes them the largest generational demographic in the country it also suggests there are more people between the ages of 18 and 35 working in the labour force today than ever before still there seem to be major hurdles in their path play for the home team housing was the top issue cited by millennials in six surveys done by abacus last year coletto says of those who don t own a home currently 86 per cent want to he said in 1980 the average price of a house in canada was

generation is really really stuck in many ways said benjamin tal managing director and deputy chief economist at cibc this is really the story of this cohort we have a situation where housing is much more expensive so they have to compromise on either renting or they have to switch to condominiums or smart houses or they might buy a car and stay with their parents in the 1960s census data suggest as few as eight per cent of canadians ages 18 to 35 were living with parents today as has been well documented those numbers have skyrocketed come 2016 a total of 34 7 per cent of canadians between the ages of 20 and 34 were living at home with their parents that s as many as 3 5 million canadians the highest number recorded to that point and ontario had the highest percentage of millennials

released in 2017 found 37 per cent of millennials who have purchased a home received some of the money for the purchase from their parents the education system basically failed them the only thing that is helping them is their parents said tal from the cibc the education system basically failed them they are highly educated but they are not educated in what s relevant there is a mismatch between the skills that they have and what the economy needs and therefore you have many people underemployed and or trying to compromise advertisement 9 story continues below this advertisement has

up the most highly educated generation ever produced more than 3 5 million canadians between the ages of 20 and 34 reported having some sort of post secondary education including bachelor degrees and post graduate certificates and diplomas in the 2016 census but the degree by itself isn t proving to be enough it s not an option about whether or not they re going to have an education that s like an invitation card to the party said carleton university s linda duxbury a professor in management sciences at the sprott school of business who specializes in demographic trends she s also a member of the baby boomer generation people who are now 54 to 73 years of age advertisement 10 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content you

situation like an arms race for qualifications to set a candidate apart from their competitors so they can land a good job and start their lives the problem is the process is forcing them to put their actual life on hold the thing about this generation is that everything is delayed said duxbury they stay in school longer they get married later if you start comparing the average age of marriage the average age of their first kid the average age of their first permanent full time job it s also forcing those within the generation to compete with one another in ways that are specifically benefitting employers with so much talent available competition for available entry levels jobs is fierce this allows employers to pay less for the workers they need some are even getting away with not paying their employees at all advertisement 11 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content according to the canadian federation of students as many as 300 000 millennials were working in unpaid internships in a bid to further their careers by collecting relevant on the job experience in 2016 the issue with unpaid internships is that most millennials in those jobs are also working in another position likely one that pays minimum wage in order to make ends meet according to the cfs the organization which lobbies on behalf of students also pointed to statistics canada data that shows in 1997 the first year that wage data was collected only 640 000 canadians were making the minimum wage or less in 2017 that number sat at 1 02 million almost double the number previously recorded further compounding the issues facing the millennials is the steady drop in government support offered to post secondary institutions according to the cfs government provided more than 80 per cent of university operating revenues in 1982 that figure fell below 60 per cent in 2012 the most recent year for which statistics are available the cfs says government support has continued to fall in more recent years advertisement 12 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content as government support has decreased students have been forced to shoulder more of the financial burden when obtaining their education that has led to students exiting post secondary institutions with record amounts of debt using data from statistics canada the cfs said that average student debt levels have increased more than 40 per cent between 1999 and 2012 those levels have continued to climb in more recent years the increased cost of education at a time when obtaining a degree has never been more important is another hot button issue for millennials the underemployed generation

health care experience so where am i supposed to get that hypothetically what i m doing now could count but most people applying to that it s their second career they re going to be older in america

of government in ensuring that all individuals have access to similar economic opportunities he said abacus s coletto is seeing signs that the trend exists here in canada too one of the key indicators of underemployment is wages which would be reflected in the rise of minimum wage workers but the other big indicator is the benefits offered by employers self employed people largely don t have access to benefits people making minimum wage get a minimum amount of benefits from their employers only 55 per cent of millennials have access to a prescription drug plan 53 per cent to dental insurance 36

rather have someone coming in with the credentials then they would training somebody who is currently working for them my father when he came back from the war had a grade 12 education when he retired he was vice president at 3m why because there was a different attitude then is it harder to buy a home yes are we taking on higher student debt yes have we been trained and educated in the wrong things many of us yes said abacus s coletto we ve been raised around these expectations go do what you want to do the world is your oyster dream big those expectations were set quite high when you enter a world where it s not possible to achieve the things that your parents and your teachers and society has been saying is going to be there it creates further tension advertisement 19 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content baby boomers won t go can t go the tension is being compounded by the baby boomer generation s refusal to leave the workforce if the millennials are stuck in a bottleneck fighting for career advancement right now the baby boomers are acting like a cork preventing any movement whereas the age 65 was once marked by a person s announcing their retirement today s senior citizens are opting to soldier on the idea of freedom at 55 seems long forgotten extended life spans better health and in some cases continued financial responsibilities are seeing many people in the baby boomer demographic work well into their 70s before opting for retirement boomers have significant expenses that perhaps they didn t anticipate plus they love their jobs and they re healthy they think what am i going to do for the next 25 years said duxbury advertisement 20 story continues below this advertisement has

aging parents many also find themselves sandwiched in between paying for their parents while also supporting their millennial children who have returned to the family home the millennials can t afford to leave their parents homes because they don t have the opportunity or means to do so but their parents can t afford to retire which would open spaces in the workforce for millennials because they are still supporting those kids at home it is a problem that the boomers aren t leaving that s absolutely true said duxbury so what comes next the awakening of the millennial tectonic plates are beginning to shift advertisement 21 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content that s the opinion at least of karen foster assistant professor at dalhousie university and canada research chair in sustainable rural futures for atlantic canada one of foster s areas of expertise is in researching generational divisions at work she said there is no doubt millennials are upset and that their complaints have been falling on deaf ears however one of the larger issues that millennials are facing is a growing wealth gap between themselves and older generations due to the fact that major life milestones have been delayed investments in real estate or other financial transactions aren t yielding the same return for the younger generation foster said sure property values have skyrocketed for older generations who bought when prices were affordable and have been hanging onto the property but the millennial who just purchased is seeing bigger mortgages than ever before and interest rates that are steadily rising advertisement 22 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content critics of millennial concerns have often pointed out that are next in line to inherit massive amounts of wealth that has been accumulated by their aging parents in fact between 2016 and 2026 the largest wealth transfer in history is expected to take place as older generations pass on as much as 1 trillion to younger generations in canada according to toronto based research firm strategic insight but foster pointed out one critical problem with the upcoming windfall the expected transfer of wealth will only benefit those people who come from families that are already wealthy it will also affect people from major canadian cities where property prices have been steadily rising in a much different way than those people from less populated towns if your family is from somewhere such as moncton n b moose jaw sask or sudbury ont you won t see the same windfall when it comes time to collect an inheritance advertisement 23 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content people who are set to inherit money from their parents or in a sense have been inheriting it their whole lives through various kinds of support that s where the real inequality happens she said adding that millennials are looking to completely upend the status quo that really comes down to a restructuring of the tax system we need to be taxing wealth and high incomes and corporate profits more in order to redistribute wealth across the demographics foster predicts that millennials are likely to push for things such as increased estate taxes in order to ensure that some of the wealth that is transferred from older generations is redistributed throughout all of society the idea is being spearheaded in the united states by recently elected democrat congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez ocasio cortez who at 29 is also a millennial is lobbying for the introduction of a tax on the wealthiest americans in the country she believes that every dollar of income over 10 million should be taxed at 70 per cent advertisement 24 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content there will of course be pushback to that idea it s been panned by the audience at the world economic forum in davos switzerland as recently as last week with attendees including michael dell founder of dell technologies and microsoft corp founder bill gates expressing objections the call for higher estate taxes in canada was recently reinforced in a study released by the canadian centre for policy alternatives ccpa you d expect canada s tax regime would try to counteract this concentration of wealth at the very top where it s needed the least but in fact federal policies encourage it said the centre s senior economist david macdonald in a release canada is the only country in the g7 without an inheritance estate or gift tax on tremendous family wealth advertisement 25 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the ccpa s report said canada s wealthiest families saw their net worth grow on average by 37 per cent between 2012 and 2016 middle class families saw their net worth grow by only 16 per cent during the same time frame the study calls for high estate taxes eliminating tax preferences for capital gains and dividend income in a bid to better distribute wealth across demographics that may sound like a scary scenario to older generations who have amassed wealth throughout their lifetimes and typically been more conservative when it comes to political fiscal policies but for the millennial generation it s only the tip of the iceberg bring the big government according to abacus data millennials are looking to government to take big steps to fix their problems this generation is more comfortable with big interventionist government than allowing market forces to play their part surveys suggest many millennials truly believe that the economic system that has been in place for hundreds of years fails to work for them advertisement 26 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the company s research suggests that millennials clearly prioritize increased government spending over balanced budgets in order to tackle issues such as alleviating income inequality they believe corporations don t pay their fair share of taxes and that government has a big role to play in redistributing that money having lived through the 2008 financial crisis and a rise in housing costs many are outright skeptical of the free market when asked to indicate if they lean more towards one perspective or the other only 46 per cent suggested that capitalism is the best economic model we have while 54 per cent believe canada would be better off with a more socialist system reads an abacus data survey released last year perhaps the most pertinent fact millennials are now the largest block of voters in the country and have the ability to swing an election toward the party or platform of their choice provided the generation gets out the vote so far they have remained relatively quiet in most elections politicians aren t talking about issues that they care about they aren t very compelling they aren t giving them a reason to get engaged said abacus s coletto millennials are unique from previous generations particularly the boomers and those who came before the boomers in that voting is not considered a duty we don t do it because we have to we do it because we have a reason to reasons seem to be emerging according to elections canada 38 8 per cent of eligible voters between the ages of 18 and 24 years of age voted in the 2011 federal election of those between 25 and 34 years of age 45 1 per cent cast their ballot by comparison a total of 64 5 per cent of canadians between the ages of 45 and 54 voted in that election when it came to canadians between the ages of 65 and 74 a total of 75 1 per cent of eligible voters participated the federal election in 2015 saw better turnout by millennials more than 57 1 per cent of eligible voters between 18 and 24 years of age cast a ballot the number was similar in the 25 through 34 year old age group where 57 4 per cent of eligible voters participated one of the big issues during the 2015 election was the liberal party s promise to legalize cannabis sales in canada which is something that appeals specifically to the millennial generation s interests more than 60 per cent of canadians between the ages of 18 and 34 supported legalizing cannabis according to a study released by nrg research group and peak communicators in

of government in ensuring that all individuals have access to similar economic opportunities he said abacus s coletto is seeing signs that the trend exists here in canada too one of the key indicators of underemployment is wages which would be reflected in the rise of minimum wage workers but the other big indicator is the benefits offered by employers self employed people largely don t have access to benefits people making minimum wage get a minimum amount of benefits from their employers only 55 per cent of millennials have access to a prescription drug plan 53 per cent to dental insurance 36

rather have someone coming in with the credentials then they would training somebody who is currently working for them my father when he came back from the war had a grade 12 education when he retired he was vice president at 3m why because there was a different attitude then is it harder to buy a home yes are we taking on higher student debt yes have we been trained and educated in the wrong things many of us yes said abacus s coletto we ve been raised around these expectations go do what you want to do the world is your oyster dream big those expectations were set quite high when you enter a world where it s not possible to achieve the things that your parents and your teachers and society has been saying is going to be there it creates further tension advertisement 19 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content baby boomers won t go can t go the tension is being compounded by the baby boomer generation s refusal to leave the workforce if the millennials are stuck in a bottleneck fighting for career advancement right now the baby boomers are acting like a cork preventing any movement whereas the age 65 was once marked by a person s announcing their retirement today s senior citizens are opting to soldier on the idea of freedom at 55 seems long forgotten extended life spans better health and in some cases continued financial responsibilities are seeing many people in the baby boomer demographic work well into their 70s before opting for retirement boomers have significant expenses that perhaps they didn t anticipate plus they love their jobs and they re healthy they think what am i going to do for the next 25 years said duxbury advertisement 20 story continues below this advertisement has

aging parents many also find themselves sandwiched in between paying for their parents while also supporting their millennial children who have returned to the family home the millennials can t afford to leave their parents homes because they don t have the opportunity or means to do so but their parents can t afford to retire which would open spaces in the workforce for millennials because they are still supporting those kids at home it is a problem that the boomers aren t leaving that s absolutely true said duxbury so what comes next the awakening of the millennial tectonic plates are beginning to shift advertisement 21 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content that s the opinion at least of karen foster assistant professor at dalhousie university and canada research chair in sustainable rural futures for atlantic canada one of foster s areas of expertise is in researching generational divisions at work she said there is no doubt millennials are upset and that their complaints have been falling on deaf ears however one of the larger issues that millennials are facing is a growing wealth gap between themselves and older generations due to the fact that major life milestones have been delayed investments in real estate or other financial transactions aren t yielding the same return for the younger generation foster said sure property values have skyrocketed for older generations who bought when prices were affordable and have been hanging onto the property but the millennial who just purchased is seeing bigger mortgages than ever before and interest rates that are steadily rising advertisement 22 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content critics of millennial concerns have often pointed out that are next in line to inherit massive amounts of wealth that has been accumulated by their aging parents in fact between 2016 and 2026 the largest wealth transfer in history is expected to take place as older generations pass on as much as 1 trillion to younger generations in canada according to toronto based research firm strategic insight but foster pointed out one critical problem with the upcoming windfall the expected transfer of wealth will only benefit those people who come from families that are already wealthy it will also affect people from major canadian cities where property prices have been steadily rising in a much different way than those people from less populated towns if your family is from somewhere such as moncton n b moose jaw sask or sudbury ont you won t see the same windfall when it comes time to collect an inheritance advertisement 23 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content people who are set to inherit money from their parents or in a sense have been inheriting it their whole lives through various kinds of support that s where the real inequality happens she said adding that millennials are looking to completely upend the status quo that really comes down to a restructuring of the tax system we need to be taxing wealth and high incomes and corporate profits more in order to redistribute wealth across the demographics foster predicts that millennials are likely to push for things such as increased estate taxes in order to ensure that some of the wealth that is transferred from older generations is redistributed throughout all of society the idea is being spearheaded in the united states by recently elected democrat congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez ocasio cortez who at 29 is also a millennial is lobbying for the introduction of a tax on the wealthiest americans in the country she believes that every dollar of income over 10 million should be taxed at 70 per cent advertisement 24 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content there will of course be pushback to that idea it s been panned by the audience at the world economic forum in davos switzerland as recently as last week with attendees including michael dell founder of dell technologies and microsoft corp founder bill gates expressing objections the call for higher estate taxes in canada was recently reinforced in a study released by the canadian centre for policy alternatives ccpa you d expect canada s tax regime would try to counteract this concentration of wealth at the very top where it s needed the least but in fact federal policies encourage it said the centre s senior economist david macdonald in a release canada is the only country in the g7 without an inheritance estate or gift tax on tremendous family wealth advertisement 25 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the ccpa s report said canada s wealthiest families saw their net worth grow on average by 37 per cent between 2012 and 2016 middle class families saw their net worth grow by only 16 per cent during the same time frame the study calls for high estate taxes eliminating tax preferences for capital gains and dividend income in a bid to better distribute wealth across demographics that may sound like a scary scenario to older generations who have amassed wealth throughout their lifetimes and typically been more conservative when it comes to political fiscal policies but for the millennial generation it s only the tip of the iceberg bring the big government according to abacus data millennials are looking to government to take big steps to fix their problems this generation is more comfortable with big interventionist government than allowing market forces to play their part surveys suggest many millennials truly believe that the economic system that has been in place for hundreds of years fails to work for them advertisement 26 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the company s research suggests that millennials clearly prioritize increased government spending over balanced budgets in order to tackle issues such as alleviating income inequality they believe corporations don t pay their fair share of taxes and that government has a big role to play in redistributing that money having lived through the 2008 financial crisis and a rise in housing costs many are outright skeptical of the free market when asked to indicate if they lean more towards one perspective or the other only 46 per cent suggested that capitalism is the best economic model we have while 54 per cent believe canada would be better off with a more socialist system reads an abacus data survey released last year perhaps the most pertinent fact millennials are now the largest block of voters in the country and have the ability to swing an election toward the party or platform of their choice provided the generation gets out the vote so far they have remained relatively quiet in most elections politicians aren t talking about issues that they care about they aren t very compelling they aren t giving them a reason to get engaged said abacus s coletto millennials are unique from previous generations particularly the boomers and those who came before the boomers in that voting is not considered a duty we don t do it because we have to we do it because we have a reason to reasons seem to be emerging according to elections canada 38 8 per cent of eligible voters between the ages of 18 and 24 years of age voted in the 2011 federal election of those between 25 and 34 years of age 45 1 per cent cast their ballot by comparison a total of 64 5 per cent of canadians between the ages of 45 and 54 voted in that election when it came to canadians between the ages of 65 and 74 a total of 75 1 per cent of eligible voters participated the federal election in 2015 saw better turnout by millennials more than 57 1 per cent of eligible voters between 18 and 24 years of age cast a ballot the number was similar in the 25 through 34 year old age group where 57 4 per cent of eligible voters participated one of the big issues during the 2015 election was the liberal party s promise to legalize cannabis sales in canada which is something that appeals specifically to the millennial generation s interests more than 60 per cent of canadians between the ages of 18 and 34 supported legalizing cannabis according to a study released by nrg research group and peak communicators in march 2017 photo by chris young the canadian press it s expected that more politicians will be looking to woo the millennial vote heading into october s federal election last week finance minister bill morneau said the federal government is looking at ways to make housing purchases more affordable for millennials in the months ahead he called the issue a priority but didn t elaborate ndp leader jagmeet singh has said his party would propose measures to help build as many as 500 000 affordable housing units across the country if elected with more politicians tuning into the fact that the millennial generation will vote for political platforms that speak to their agenda the 18 through 35 demographic looks as though it will soon find itself in an unfamiliar position instead of taking a back seat while older generations plot the course millennials are poised to grab the wheel and take a drastic detour it hasn t boiled over yet but the pot is starting to get warm said coletto there are more millennials than there are boomers more millennials are eligible to vote than any other generation more politicians are mindful of the shift that millennials could bring meanwhile barrett is

preferences for capital gains and dividend income in a bid to better distribute wealth across demographics that may sound like a scary scenario to older generations who have amassed wealth throughout their lifetimes and typically been more conservative when it comes to political fiscal policies but for the millennial generation it s only the tip of the iceberg bring the big government according to abacus data millennials are looking to government to take big steps to fix their problems this generation is more comfortable with big interventionist government than allowing market forces to play their part surveys suggest many millennials truly believe that the economic system that has been in place for hundreds of years fails to work for them advertisement 26 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the company s research suggests that millennials clearly prioritize increased government spending over balanced budgets in order to tackle issues such as alleviating income inequality they believe corporations don t pay their fair share of taxes and that government has a big role to play in redistributing that money having lived through the 2008 financial crisis and a rise in housing costs many are outright skeptical of the free market when asked to indicate if they lean more towards one perspective or the other only 46 per cent suggested that capitalism is the best economic model we have while 54 per cent believe canada would be better off with a more socialist system reads an abacus data survey released last year perhaps the most pertinent fact millennials are now the largest block of voters in the country and have the ability to swing an election toward the party or platform of their choice provided the generation gets out the vote so far they have remained relatively quiet in most elections politicians aren t talking about issues that they care about they aren t very compelling they aren t giving them a reason to get engaged said abacus s coletto millennials are unique from previous generations particularly the boomers and those who came before the boomers in that voting is not considered a duty we don t do it because we have to we do it because we have a reason to reasons seem to be emerging according to elections canada 38 8 per cent of eligible voters between the ages of 18 and 24 years of age voted in the 2011 federal election of those between 25 and 34 years of age 45 1 per cent cast their ballot by comparison a total of 64 5 per cent of canadians between the ages of 45 and 54 voted in that election when it came to canadians between the ages of 65 and 74 a total of 75 1 per cent of eligible voters participated the federal election in 2015 saw better turnout by millennials more than 57 1 per cent of eligible voters between 18 and 24 years of age cast a ballot the number was similar in the 25 through 34 year old age group where 57 4 per cent of eligible voters participated one of the big issues during the 2015 election was the liberal party s promise to legalize cannabis sales in canada which is something that appeals specifically to the millennial generation s interests more than 60 per cent of canadians between the ages of 18 and 34 supported legalizing cannabis according to a study released by nrg research group and peak communicators in march 2017 photo by chris young the canadian press it s expected that more politicians will be looking to woo the millennial vote heading into october s federal election last week finance minister bill morneau said the federal government is looking at ways to make housing purchases more affordable for millennials in the months ahead he called the issue a priority but didn t elaborate ndp leader jagmeet singh has said his party would propose measures to help build as many as 500 000 affordable housing units across the country if elected with more politicians tuning into the fact that the millennial generation will vote for political platforms that speak to their agenda the 18 through 35 demographic looks as though it will soon find itself in an unfamiliar position instead of taking a back seat while older generations plot the course millennials are poised to grab the wheel and take a drastic detour it hasn t boiled over yet but the pot is starting to get warm said coletto there are more millennials than there are boomers more millennials are eligible to vote than any other generation more politicians are mindful of the shift that millennials could bring meanwhile barrett is

issue cited by millennials in six surveys done by abacus last year coletto says of those who don t own a home currently 86 per cent want to he said in 1980 the average price of a house in canada was

more expensive so they have to compromise on either renting or they have to switch to condominiums or smart houses or they might buy a car and stay with their parents in the 1960s census data suggest as few as eight per cent of canadians ages 18 to 35 were living with parents today as has been well documented those numbers have skyrocketed come 2016 a total of 34 7 per cent of canadians between

released in 2017 found 37 per cent of millennials who have purchased a home received some of the money for the purchase from their parents the education system basically failed them the only thing that is helping them is their parents said tal from the cibc the education system basically failed them they are highly educated but they are not educated in what s relevant there is a mismatch

up the most highly educated generation ever produced more than 3 5 million canadians between the ages of 20 and 34 reported having some sort of post secondary education including bachelor degrees and post graduate certificates and diplomas in the 2016 census but the degree by itself isn t proving to be enough it s not an option about whether or not they re going to have an education that s like an invitation card to the party said carleton university s linda duxbury a professor in management sciences at the sprott school of business who specializes in demographic trends she s also a member of

situation like an arms race for qualifications to set a candidate apart from their competitors so they can land a good job and start their lives the problem is the process is forcing them to put their actual life on hold the thing about this generation is that everything is delayed said duxbury they stay in school longer they get married later if you start comparing the average age of marriage the average age of their first kid the average age of their first permanent full time job it s also forcing those within the generation to compete with one another in ways that are specifically benefitting employers with so much talent available competition for available entry levels jobs is fierce this allows employers to pay less for the workers they need some are even getting away with not paying their employees at all advertisement 11 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content according to the canadian federation of students as many as 300 000 millennials were working in unpaid internships in a bid to further their careers by collecting relevant on the job experience in 2016 the issue with unpaid internships is that most millennials in those jobs are also working in another position likely one that pays minimum wage in order to make ends meet according to the cfs the organization which lobbies on behalf of students also pointed to statistics canada data that shows in 1997 the first year that wage data was collected only 640 000 canadians were making the minimum wage or less in 2017 that number sat at 1 02 million almost double the number previously recorded further compounding the issues facing the millennials is the steady drop in government support offered to post secondary institutions according to the cfs government provided more than 80 per cent of university operating revenues in 1982 that figure fell below 60 per cent in 2012 the most recent year for which statistics are available the cfs says government support has continued to fall in more recent years advertisement 12 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content as

record amounts of debt using data from statistics canada the cfs said that average student debt levels have increased more than 40 per cent between 1999 and 2012 those levels have continued to climb in more recent years the increased cost of education at a time when obtaining a degree has never been more important is another hot button issue for millennials the underemployed generation

generation is really really stuck in many ways said benjamin tal managing director and deputy chief economist at cibc this is really the story of this cohort we have a situation where housing is much more expensive so they have to compromise on either renting or they have to switch to condominiums or smart houses or they might buy a car and stay with their parents in the 1960s census data suggest as few as eight per cent of canadians ages 18 to 35 were living with parents today as has been well documented those numbers have skyrocketed come 2016 a total of 34 7 per cent of canadians between

that is helping them is their parents said tal from the cibc the education system basically failed them they are highly educated but they are not educated in what s relevant there is a mismatch between the skills that they have and what the economy needs and therefore you have many people underemployed and or trying to compromise advertisement 9 story continues below this advertisement has

up the most highly educated generation ever produced more than 3 5 million canadians between the ages of 20 and 34 reported having some sort of post secondary education including bachelor degrees and post graduate certificates and diplomas in the 2016 census but the degree by itself isn t proving to be enough it s not an option about whether or not they re going to have an education that s like an invitation card to the party said carleton university s linda duxbury a professor in management sciences at the sprott school of business who specializes in demographic trends she s also a member of the baby boomer generation people who are now 54 to 73 years of age advertisement 10 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content you don t have the skills you don t have post graduate education today be it college or university you aren t even going to be looked at photo by darren brown ottawa citizen duxbury described the situation like an arms race for qualifications to set a candidate apart from their competitors so they can land a good job and start their lives the problem is the process is forcing them to put their actual life on hold the thing about this generation is that everything is delayed said duxbury they stay in school longer they get married later if you start comparing the average age of marriage the average age of their first kid the average age of their first permanent full time job it s also forcing those within the generation to compete with one another in ways that are specifically benefitting employers with so much talent available competition for available entry levels jobs is fierce this allows employers to pay less for the workers they need some are even getting away with not paying their employees at all advertisement 11 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content according to the canadian federation of students as many as 300 000 millennials were working in unpaid internships in a bid to further their careers by collecting relevant on the job experience in 2016 the issue with unpaid internships is that most millennials in those jobs are also working in another position likely one that pays minimum wage in order to make ends meet according to the cfs the organization which lobbies on behalf of students also pointed to statistics canada data that shows in 1997 the first year that wage data was collected only 640 000 canadians were making the minimum wage or less in 2017 that number sat at 1 02 million almost double the number previously recorded further compounding the issues facing the millennials is the steady drop in government support offered to post secondary institutions according to the cfs government provided more than 80 per cent of university operating revenues in 1982 that figure fell below 60 per cent in 2012 the most recent year for which statistics are available the cfs says government support has continued to fall in more recent years advertisement 12 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content as government support has decreased students have been forced to shoulder more of the financial burden when obtaining their education that has led to students exiting post secondary institutions with record amounts of debt using data from statistics canada the cfs said that average student debt levels have increased more than 40 per cent between 1999 and 2012 those levels have continued to climb in more recent years the increased cost of education at a time when obtaining a degree has never been more important is another hot button issue for millennials the underemployed generation

postmedia it s tough and competitive she said even for a lot of the programs you are looking at applying to to get an actual career the amount of hours of experience you need for example the physician assistant program that i applied to it s only offered by three universities in canada and i couldn t apply to the third which is the university of toronto because they require almost 1 000 hours of health care experience so where am i supposed to get that hypothetically what i m doing now could count but most people applying to that it s their second career they re going to be older in america where numbers are more readily available underemployment held steady at around 33 per cent of all post secondary graduates between the 1980s and 2010 advertisement 15 story continues below this

has become more entrenched as lower income ontarians are increasingly staying in low income and higher income ontarians are increasingly staying in high income said peter weltman the province s financial accountability officer in a report released thursday he highlighted significant structural changes in ontario s economy and labour market including a rise in part time and temporary work

of government in ensuring that all individuals have access to similar economic opportunities he said abacus s coletto is seeing signs that the trend exists here in canada too one of the key indicators of underemployment is wages which would be reflected in the rise of minimum wage workers but the other big indicator is the benefits offered by employers self employed people largely don t have access to benefits people making minimum wage get a minimum amount of benefits from their employers only 55 per cent of millennials have access to a prescription drug plan 53 per cent to dental insurance 36

rather have someone coming in with the credentials then they would training somebody who is currently working for them my father when he came back from the war had a grade 12 education when he retired he was vice president at 3m why because there was a different attitude then is it harder to buy a home yes are we taking on higher student debt yes have we been trained and educated in the wrong things many of us yes said abacus s coletto we ve been raised around these expectations go do what you want to do the world is your oyster dream big those expectations were set quite high when you enter a world where it s not possible to achieve the things that your parents and your teachers and society has been saying is going to be there it creates further tension advertisement 19 story

refusal to leave the workforce if the millennials are stuck in a bottleneck fighting for career advancement right now the baby boomers are acting like a cork preventing any movement whereas the age 65 was once marked by a person s announcing their retirement today s senior citizens are opting to soldier on the idea of freedom at 55 seems long forgotten extended life spans better health and in some cases continued financial responsibilities are seeing many people in the baby boomer demographic work well into their 70s before opting for retirement boomers have significant expenses that perhaps they didn t anticipate plus they love their jobs and they re healthy they think what am i going to do for the next 25 years said duxbury advertisement 20 story continues below this advertisement has

aging parents many also find themselves sandwiched in between paying for their parents while also supporting their millennial children who have returned to the family home the millennials can t afford to leave their parents homes because they don t have the opportunity or means to do so but their parents can t afford to retire which would open spaces in the workforce for millennials because they are still supporting those kids at home it is a problem that the boomers aren t leaving that s absolutely true said duxbury so what comes next the awakening of the millennial tectonic plates are beginning to shift advertisement 21 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content that s the opinion at least of karen foster assistant professor at dalhousie university and canada research chair in sustainable rural futures for atlantic canada one of foster s areas of expertise is in researching generational divisions at work she said there is no doubt millennials are upset and that their complaints have been falling on deaf ears however one of the larger issues that millennials are facing is a growing wealth gap between themselves and older generations due to the fact that major life milestones have been delayed investments in real estate or other financial transactions aren t yielding the same return for the younger generation foster said sure property values have skyrocketed for older generations who bought when prices were affordable and have been hanging onto the property but the millennial who just purchased is seeing bigger mortgages than ever before and interest rates that are steadily rising advertisement 22 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content critics of millennial concerns have often pointed out that are next in line to inherit massive amounts of wealth that has been accumulated by their aging parents in fact between 2016 and 2026 the largest wealth transfer in history is expected to take place as older generations pass on as much as 1 trillion to younger generations in canada according to toronto based research firm strategic insight but foster pointed out one critical problem with the upcoming windfall the expected transfer of wealth will only benefit those people who come from families that are already wealthy it will also affect people from major canadian cities where property prices have been steadily rising in a much different way than those people from less populated towns if your family is from somewhere such as moncton n b moose jaw sask or sudbury ont you won t see the same windfall when it comes time to collect an inheritance advertisement 23 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content people who are set to inherit money from their parents or in a sense have been inheriting it their whole lives through various kinds of support that s where the real inequality happens she said adding that millennials are looking to completely upend the status quo that really comes down to a restructuring of the tax system we need to be taxing wealth and high incomes and corporate profits more in order to redistribute wealth across the demographics foster predicts that millennials are likely to push for things such as increased estate taxes in order to ensure that some of the wealth that is transferred from older generations is redistributed throughout all of society the idea is being spearheaded in the united states by recently elected democrat congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez ocasio cortez who at 29 is also a millennial is lobbying for the introduction of a tax on the wealthiest americans in the country she

canadian centre for policy alternatives ccpa you d expect canada s tax regime would try to counteract this concentration of wealth at the very top where it s needed the least but in fact federal

cases continued financial responsibilities are seeing many people in the baby boomer demographic work well into their 70s before opting for retirement boomers have significant expenses that perhaps

to leave their parents homes because they don t have the opportunity or means to do so but their parents can t afford to retire which would open spaces in the workforce for millennials because they are still supporting those kids at home it is a problem that the boomers aren t leaving that s absolutely true said duxbury so what comes next the awakening of the millennial tectonic plates are beginning to shift advertisement 21 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content that s the opinion at least of karen foster assistant professor at dalhousie university and canada research chair in sustainable rural futures for atlantic canada one of foster s areas of expertise is in researching generational divisions at work she said there is no doubt millennials are upset and that their complaints have been falling on deaf ears however one of the larger issues that millennials are facing is a growing wealth gap between themselves and older generations due to the fact that major life milestones have been delayed investments in real estate or other financial transactions aren t yielding the same return for the younger generation foster said sure property values have skyrocketed for older generations who bought when prices were affordable and have been hanging onto the property but the millennial who just purchased is seeing bigger mortgages than ever before and interest rates that are steadily rising advertisement 22 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content critics of millennial concerns have often pointed out that are next in line to inherit massive amounts of wealth that has been accumulated by their aging parents in fact between 2016 and 2026 the largest wealth transfer in history is expected to take place as older generations pass on as much as 1 trillion to younger generations in canada according to toronto based research firm strategic insight but foster pointed out one critical problem with the upcoming windfall the expected transfer of wealth will only benefit those people who come from families that are already wealthy it will also affect people from major canadian cities where property prices have been steadily rising in a much different way than those people from less populated towns if your family is from somewhere such as moncton n b moose jaw sask or sudbury ont you won t see the same windfall when it comes time to collect an inheritance advertisement 23 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content people who are set to inherit money from their parents or in a sense have been inheriting it their whole lives through various kinds of support that s where the real inequality happens she said adding that millennials are looking to completely upend the status quo that really comes down to a restructuring of the tax system we need to be taxing wealth and high incomes and corporate profits more in order to redistribute wealth across the demographics foster predicts that millennials are likely to push for things such as increased estate taxes in order to ensure that some of the wealth that is transferred from older generations is redistributed throughout all of society the idea is being spearheaded in the united states by recently elected democrat congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez ocasio cortez who at 29 is also a millennial is lobbying for the introduction of a tax on the wealthiest americans in the country she believes that every dollar of income over 10 million should be taxed at 70 per cent advertisement 24 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content there will of course be pushback to that idea it s been panned by the audience at the world economic forum in davos switzerland as recently as last week with attendees including michael dell founder of dell technologies and microsoft corp founder bill gates expressing objections the call for higher estate taxes in canada was recently reinforced in a study released by the canadian centre for policy alternatives ccpa you d expect canada s tax regime would try to counteract this concentration of wealth at the very top where it s needed the least but in fact federal policies encourage it said the centre s senior economist david macdonald in a release canada is the only country in the g7 without an inheritance estate or gift tax on tremendous family wealth advertisement 25 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the ccpa s report said canada s wealthiest families saw their net worth grow on average by 37 per cent between 2012 and 2016 middle class families saw their net worth grow by only 16 per cent during the same time frame the study calls for high estate taxes eliminating tax preferences for capital gains and dividend income in a bid to better distribute wealth across demographics that may sound like a scary scenario to older generations who have amassed wealth throughout their lifetimes and typically been more conservative when it comes to political fiscal policies but for the millennial generation it s only the tip of the iceberg bring the big government according to abacus data millennials are looking to government to take big steps to fix their problems this generation is more comfortable with big interventionist government than allowing market forces to play their part surveys suggest many millennials truly believe that the economic system that has been in place for hundreds of years fails to work for them advertisement 26 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the company s research suggests that millennials clearly prioritize increased government spending over balanced budgets in order to tackle issues such as alleviating income inequality they believe corporations don t pay their fair share of taxes and that government has a big role to play in redistributing that money having lived through the 2008 financial crisis and a rise in housing costs many are outright skeptical of the free market when asked to indicate if they lean more towards one perspective or the other only 46 per cent suggested that capitalism is the best economic model we have while 54 per cent believe canada would be better off with a more socialist system reads an abacus data survey released last year perhaps the most pertinent fact millennials are now the largest block of voters in the country and have the ability to swing an election toward the party or platform of their choice provided the generation gets out the vote so far they have remained relatively quiet in most elections politicians aren t talking about issues that they care about they aren t very compelling they aren t giving them a reason to get engaged said abacus s coletto millennials are unique from previous generations particularly the boomers and those who came before the boomers in that voting is not considered a duty we don t do it because we have to we do it because we have a reason to reasons seem to be emerging according to elections canada 38 8 per cent of eligible voters between the ages of 18 and 24 years of age voted in the 2011 federal election of those between 25 and 34 years of age 45 1 per cent cast their ballot by comparison a total of 64 5 per cent of canadians between the ages of 45 and 54 voted in that election when it came to canadians between the ages of 65 and 74 a total of 75 1 per cent of eligible voters participated the federal election in 2015 saw better turnout by millennials more than 57 1 per cent of eligible voters between 18 and 24 years of age cast a ballot the number was similar in the 25 through 34 year old age group where 57 4 per cent of eligible voters participated one of the big issues during the 2015 election was the liberal party s promise to legalize cannabis sales in canada which is something that appeals specifically to the millennial generation s interests more than 60 per cent of canadians between the ages of 18 and 34 supported legalizing cannabis according to a study released by nrg research group and peak communicators in march 2017 photo by chris young the canadian press it s expected that more politicians will be looking to woo the millennial vote heading into october s federal election last week finance minister bill morneau said the federal government is looking at ways to make housing purchases more affordable for millennials in the months ahead he called the issue a priority but didn t elaborate ndp leader jagmeet singh has said his party would propose measures to help build as many as 500 000 affordable housing units across the country if elected with more politicians tuning into the fact that the millennial generation will vote for political platforms that speak to their agenda the 18 through 35 demographic looks as though it will soon find itself in an unfamiliar position instead of taking a back seat while older generations plot the course millennials are poised to grab the wheel and take a drastic detour it hasn t boiled over yet but the pot is starting to get warm said coletto there are more millennials than there are boomers more millennials are eligible to vote than any other generation more politicians are mindful of the shift that millennials could bring meanwhile barrett is

more expensive so they have to compromise on either renting or they have to switch to condominiums or smart houses or they might buy a car and stay with their parents in the 1960s census data suggest as few as eight per cent of canadians ages 18 to 35 were living with parents today as has been well documented those numbers have skyrocketed come 2016 a total of 34 7 per cent of canadians between

that is helping them is their parents said tal from the cibc the education system basically failed them they are highly educated but they are not educated in what s relevant there is a mismatch

post graduate certificates and diplomas in the 2016 census but the degree by itself isn t proving to be enough it s not an option about whether or not they re going to have an education that s like an invitation card to the party said carleton university s linda duxbury a professor in management sciences at the sprott school of business who specializes in demographic trends she s also a member of

situation like an arms race for qualifications to set a candidate apart from their competitors so they can land a good job and start their lives the problem is the process is forcing them to put their actual life on hold the thing about this generation is that everything is delayed said duxbury they stay in school longer they get married later if you start comparing the average age of marriage the average age of their first kid the average age of their first permanent full time job it s also forcing those within the generation to compete with one another in ways that are specifically benefitting employers with so much talent available competition for available entry levels jobs is fierce this allows employers to pay less for the workers they need some are even getting away with not paying their employees at all advertisement 11 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content according to the canadian federation of students as many as 300 000 millennials were working in unpaid internships in a bid to further their careers by collecting relevant on the job experience in 2016 the issue with unpaid internships is that most millennials in those jobs are also working in another position likely one that pays minimum wage in order to make ends meet according to the cfs the organization which lobbies on behalf of students also pointed to statistics canada data that shows in 1997 the first year that wage data was collected only 640 000 canadians were making the minimum wage or less in 2017 that number sat at 1 02 million almost double the number previously recorded further compounding the issues facing the millennials is the steady drop in government support offered to post secondary institutions according to the cfs government provided more than 80 per cent of university operating revenues in 1982 that figure fell below 60 per cent in 2012 the most recent year for which statistics are available the cfs says government support has continued to fall in more recent years advertisement 12 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content as government support has decreased students have been forced to shoulder more of the financial burden when obtaining their education that has led to students exiting post secondary institutions with record amounts of debt using data from statistics canada the cfs said that average student debt levels have increased more than 40 per cent between 1999 and 2012 those levels have continued to climb in more recent years the increased cost of education at a time when obtaining a degree has never been more important is another hot button issue for millennials the underemployed generation

health care experience so where am i supposed to get that hypothetically what i m doing now could count but most people applying to that it s their second career they re going to be older in america

that is helping them is their parents said tal from the cibc the education system basically failed them they are highly educated but they are not educated in what s relevant there is a mismatch

up the most highly educated generation ever produced more than 3 5 million canadians between the ages of 20 and 34 reported having some sort of post secondary education including bachelor degrees and post graduate certificates and diplomas in the 2016 census but the degree by itself isn t proving to be enough it s not an option about whether or not they re going to have an education that s like an invitation card to the party said carleton university s linda duxbury a professor in management sciences at the sprott school of business who specializes in demographic trends she s also a member of

situation like an arms race for qualifications to set a candidate apart from their competitors so they can land a good job and start their lives the problem is the process is forcing them to put their actual life on hold the thing about this generation is that everything is delayed said duxbury they stay in school longer they get married later if you start comparing the average age of marriage the average age of their first kid the average age of their first permanent full time job it s also forcing those within the generation to compete with one another in ways that are specifically benefitting employers with so much talent available competition for available entry levels jobs is fierce this allows employers to pay less for the workers they need some are even getting away with not paying their employees at all advertisement 11 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content according to the canadian federation of students as many as 300 000 millennials were working in unpaid internships in a bid to further their careers by collecting relevant on the job experience in 2016 the issue with unpaid internships is that most millennials in those jobs are also working in another position likely one that pays minimum wage in order to make ends meet according to the cfs the organization which lobbies on behalf of students also pointed to statistics canada data that shows in 1997 the first year that wage data was collected only 640 000 canadians were making the minimum wage or less in 2017 that number sat at 1 02 million almost double the number previously recorded further compounding the issues facing the millennials is the steady drop in government support offered to post secondary institutions according to the cfs government provided more than 80 per cent of university operating revenues in 1982 that figure fell below 60 per cent in 2012 the most recent year for which statistics are available the cfs says government support has continued to fall in more recent years advertisement 12 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content as government support has decreased students have been forced to shoulder more of the financial burden when obtaining their education that has led to students exiting post secondary institutions with record amounts of debt using data from statistics canada the cfs said that average student debt levels have increased more than 40 per cent between 1999 and 2012 those levels have continued to climb in more recent years the increased cost of education at a time when obtaining a degree has never been more important is another hot button issue for millennials the underemployed generation

health care experience so where am i supposed to get that hypothetically what i m doing now could count but most people applying to that it s their second career they re going to be older in america where numbers are more readily available underemployment held steady at around 33 per cent of all post secondary graduates between the 1980s and 2010 advertisement 15 story continues below this

of government in ensuring that all individuals have access to similar economic opportunities he said abacus s coletto is seeing signs that the trend exists here in canada too one of the key indicators of underemployment is wages which would be reflected in the rise of minimum wage workers but the other big indicator is the benefits offered by employers self employed people largely don t have access to benefits people making minimum wage get a minimum amount of benefits from their employers only 55 per cent of millennials have access to a prescription drug plan 53 per cent to dental insurance 36

rather have someone coming in with the credentials then they would training somebody who is currently working for them my father when he came back from the war had a grade 12 education when he retired he was vice president at 3m why because there was a different attitude then is it harder to buy a home yes are we taking on higher student debt yes have we been trained and educated in the wrong things many of us yes said abacus s coletto we ve been raised around these expectations go do what you want to do the world is your oyster dream big those expectations were set quite high when you enter a world where it s not possible to achieve the things that your parents and your teachers and society has been saying is going to be there it creates further tension advertisement 19 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content baby boomers won t go can t go the tension is being compounded by the baby boomer generation s refusal to leave the workforce if the millennials are stuck in a bottleneck fighting for career advancement right now the baby boomers are acting like a cork preventing any movement whereas the age 65 was once marked by a person s announcing their retirement today s senior citizens are opting to soldier on the idea of freedom at 55 seems long forgotten extended life spans better health and in some cases continued financial responsibilities are seeing many people in the baby boomer demographic work well into their 70s before opting for retirement boomers have significant expenses that perhaps they didn t anticipate plus they love their jobs and they re healthy they think what am i going to do for the next 25 years said duxbury advertisement 20 story continues below this advertisement has

aging parents many also find themselves sandwiched in between paying for their parents while also supporting their millennial children who have returned to the family home the millennials can t afford to leave their parents homes because they don t have the opportunity or means to do so but their parents can t afford to retire which would open spaces in the workforce for millennials because they are still supporting those kids at home it is a problem that the boomers aren t leaving that s absolutely true said duxbury so what comes next the awakening of the millennial tectonic plates are beginning to shift advertisement 21 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content that s the opinion at least of karen foster assistant professor at dalhousie university and canada research chair in sustainable rural futures for atlantic canada one of foster s areas of expertise is in researching generational divisions at work she said there is no doubt millennials are upset and that their complaints have been falling on deaf ears however one of the larger issues that millennials are facing is a growing wealth gap between themselves and older generations due to the fact that major life milestones have been delayed investments in real estate or other financial transactions aren t yielding the same return for the younger generation foster said sure property values have skyrocketed for older generations who bought when prices were affordable and have been hanging onto the property but the millennial who just purchased is seeing bigger mortgages than ever before and interest rates that are steadily rising advertisement 22 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content critics of millennial concerns have often pointed out that are next in line to inherit massive amounts of wealth that has been accumulated by their aging parents in fact between 2016 and 2026 the largest wealth transfer in history is expected to take place as older generations pass on as much as 1 trillion to younger generations in canada according to toronto based research firm strategic insight but foster pointed out one critical problem with the upcoming windfall the expected transfer of wealth will only benefit those people who come from families that are already wealthy it will also affect people from major canadian cities where property prices have been steadily rising in a much different way than those people from less populated towns if your family is from somewhere such as moncton n b moose jaw sask or sudbury ont you won t see the same windfall when it comes time to collect an inheritance advertisement 23 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content people who are set to inherit money from their parents or in a sense have been inheriting it their whole lives through various kinds of support that s where the real inequality happens she said adding that millennials are looking to completely upend the status quo that really comes down to a restructuring of the tax system we need to be taxing wealth and high incomes and corporate profits more in order to redistribute wealth across the demographics foster predicts that millennials are likely to push for things such as increased estate taxes in order to ensure that some of the wealth that is transferred from older generations is redistributed throughout all of society the idea is being spearheaded in the united states by recently elected democrat congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez ocasio cortez who at 29 is also a millennial is lobbying for the introduction of a tax on the wealthiest americans in the country she believes that every dollar of income over 10 million should be taxed at 70 per cent advertisement 24 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content there will of course be pushback to that idea it s been panned by the audience at the world economic forum in davos switzerland as recently as last week with attendees including michael dell founder of dell technologies and microsoft corp founder bill gates expressing objections the call for higher estate taxes in canada was recently reinforced in a study released by the canadian centre for policy alternatives ccpa you d expect canada s tax regime would try to counteract this concentration of wealth at the very top where it s needed the least but in fact federal policies encourage it said the centre s senior economist david macdonald in a release canada is the only country in the g7 without an inheritance estate or gift tax on tremendous family wealth advertisement 25 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the ccpa s report said canada s wealthiest families saw their net worth grow on average by 37 per cent between 2012 and 2016 middle class families saw their net worth grow by only 16 per cent during the same time frame the study calls for high estate taxes eliminating tax preferences for capital gains and dividend income in a bid to better distribute wealth across demographics that may sound like a scary scenario to older generations who have amassed wealth throughout their lifetimes and typically been more conservative when it comes to political fiscal policies but for the millennial generation it s only the tip of the iceberg bring the big government according to abacus data millennials are looking to government to take big steps to fix their problems this generation is more comfortable with big interventionist government than allowing market forces to play their part surveys suggest many millennials truly believe that the economic system that has been in place for hundreds of years fails to work for them advertisement 26 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the company s research suggests that millennials clearly prioritize increased government spending over balanced budgets in order to tackle issues such as alleviating income inequality they believe corporations don t pay their fair share of taxes and that government has a big role to play in redistributing that money having lived through the 2008 financial crisis and a rise in housing costs many are outright skeptical of the free market when asked to indicate if they lean more towards one perspective or the other only 46 per cent suggested that capitalism is the best economic model we have while 54 per cent believe canada would be better off with a more socialist system reads an abacus data survey released last year perhaps the most pertinent fact millennials are now the largest block of voters in the country and have the ability to swing an election toward the party or platform of their choice provided the generation gets out the vote so far they have remained relatively quiet in most elections politicians aren t talking about issues that they care about they aren t very compelling they

refusal to leave the workforce if the millennials are stuck in a bottleneck fighting for career advancement right now the baby boomers are acting like a cork preventing any movement whereas the age 65 was once marked by a person s announcing their retirement today s senior citizens are opting to soldier on the idea of freedom at 55 seems long forgotten extended life spans better health and in some cases continued financial responsibilities are seeing many people in the baby boomer demographic work well into their 70s before opting for retirement boomers have significant expenses that perhaps they didn t anticipate plus they love their jobs and they re healthy they think what am i going to do for the next 25 years said duxbury advertisement 20 story continues below this advertisement has

aging parents many also find themselves sandwiched in between paying for their parents while also supporting their millennial children who have returned to the family home the millennials can t afford to leave their parents homes because they don t have the opportunity or means to do so but their parents can t afford to retire which would open spaces in the workforce for millennials because they are still supporting those kids at home it is a problem that the boomers aren t leaving that s absolutely true said duxbury so what comes next the awakening of the millennial tectonic plates are beginning to shift advertisement 21 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content that s the opinion at least of karen foster assistant professor at dalhousie university and canada research chair in sustainable rural futures for atlantic canada one of foster s areas of expertise is in researching generational divisions at work she said there is no doubt millennials are upset and that their complaints have been falling on deaf ears however one of the larger issues that millennials are facing is a growing wealth gap between themselves and older generations due to the fact that major life milestones have been delayed investments in real estate or other financial transactions aren t yielding the same return for the younger generation foster said sure property values have skyrocketed for older generations who bought when prices were affordable and have been hanging onto the property but the millennial who just purchased is seeing bigger mortgages than ever before and interest rates that are steadily rising advertisement 22 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content critics of millennial concerns have often pointed out that are next in line to inherit massive amounts of wealth that has been accumulated by their aging parents in fact between 2016 and 2026 the largest wealth transfer in history is expected to take place as older generations pass on as much as 1 trillion to younger generations in canada according to toronto based research firm strategic insight but foster pointed out one critical problem with the upcoming windfall the expected transfer of wealth will only benefit those people who come from families that are already wealthy it will also affect people from major canadian cities where property prices have been steadily rising in a much different way than those people from less populated towns if your family is from somewhere such as moncton n b moose jaw sask or sudbury ont you won t see the same windfall when it comes time to collect an inheritance advertisement 23 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content people who are set to inherit money from their parents or in a sense have been inheriting it their whole lives through various kinds of support that s where the real inequality happens she said adding that millennials are looking to completely upend the status quo that really comes down to a restructuring of the tax system we need to be taxing wealth and high incomes and corporate profits more in order to redistribute wealth across the demographics foster predicts that millennials are likely to push for things such as increased estate taxes in order to ensure that some of the wealth that is transferred from older generations is redistributed throughout all of society the idea is being spearheaded in the united states by recently elected democrat congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez ocasio cortez who at 29 is also a millennial is lobbying for the introduction of a tax on the wealthiest americans in the country she believes that every dollar of income over 10 million should be taxed at 70 per cent advertisement 24 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content there will of course be pushback to that idea it s been panned by the audience at the world economic forum in davos switzerland as recently as last week with attendees including michael dell founder of dell technologies and microsoft corp founder bill gates expressing objections the call for higher estate taxes in canada was recently reinforced in a study released by the canadian centre for policy alternatives ccpa you d expect canada s tax regime would try to counteract this concentration of wealth at the very top where it s needed the least but in fact federal policies encourage it said the centre s senior economist david macdonald in a release canada is the only country in the g7 without an inheritance estate or gift tax on tremendous family wealth advertisement 25 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the ccpa s report said canada s wealthiest families saw their net worth grow on average by 37 per cent between 2012 and 2016 middle class families saw their net worth grow by only 16 per cent during the same time frame the study calls for high estate taxes eliminating tax preferences for capital gains and dividend income in a bid to better distribute wealth across demographics that may sound like a scary scenario to older generations who have amassed wealth throughout their lifetimes and typically been more conservative when it comes to political fiscal policies but for the millennial generation it s only the tip of the iceberg bring the big government according to abacus data millennials are looking to government to take big steps to fix their problems this generation is more comfortable with big interventionist government than allowing market forces to play their part surveys suggest many millennials truly believe that the economic system that has been in place for hundreds of years fails to work for them advertisement 26 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the company s research suggests that millennials clearly prioritize increased government spending over balanced budgets in order to tackle issues such as alleviating income inequality they believe corporations don t pay their fair share of taxes and that government has a big role to play in redistributing that money having lived through the 2008 financial crisis and a rise in housing costs many are outright skeptical of the free market when asked to indicate if they lean more towards one perspective or the other only 46 per cent suggested that capitalism is the best economic model we have while 54 per cent believe canada would be better off with a more socialist system reads an abacus data survey released last year perhaps the most pertinent fact millennials are now the largest block of voters in the country and have the ability to swing an election toward the party or platform of their choice provided the generation gets out the vote so far they have remained relatively quiet in most elections politicians aren t talking about issues that they care about they aren t very compelling they aren t giving them a reason to get engaged said abacus s coletto millennials are unique from previous generations particularly the boomers and those who came before the boomers in that voting is not considered a duty we don t do it because we have to we do it because we have a reason to reasons seem to be emerging according to elections canada 38 8 per cent of eligible voters between the ages of 18 and 24 years of age voted in the 2011 federal election of those between 25 and 34 years of age 45 1 per cent cast their ballot by comparison a total of 64 5 per cent of canadians between the ages of 45 and 54 voted in that election when it came to canadians between the ages of 65 and 74 a total of 75 1 per cent of eligible voters participated the federal election in 2015 saw better turnout by millennials more than 57 1 per cent of eligible voters between 18 and 24 years of age cast a ballot the number was similar in the 25 through 34 year old age group where 57 4 per cent of eligible voters participated one of the big issues during the 2015 election was the liberal party s promise to legalize cannabis sales in canada which is something that appeals specifically to the millennial generation s interests more than 60 per cent of canadians between the ages of 18 and 34 supported legalizing cannabis according to a study released by nrg research group and peak communicators in march 2017 photo by chris young the canadian press it s expected that more politicians will be looking to woo the millennial vote heading into october s federal election last week finance minister bill morneau said the federal government is looking at ways to make housing purchases more affordable for millennials in the months ahead he called the issue a priority but didn t elaborate ndp leader jagmeet singh has said his party would propose measures to help build as many as 500 000 affordable housing units across the country if elected with more politicians tuning into the fact that the millennial generation will vote for political platforms that speak to their agenda the 18 through 35 demographic looks as though it will soon find itself in an unfamiliar position instead of taking a back seat while older generations plot the course millennials are poised to grab the wheel and take a drastic detour it hasn t boiled over yet but the pot is starting to get warm said coletto there are more millennials than there are boomers more millennials are eligible to vote than any other generation more politicians are mindful of the shift that millennials could bring meanwhile barrett is

more expensive so they have to compromise on either renting or they have to switch to condominiums or smart houses or they might buy a car and stay with their parents in the 1960s census data suggest as few as eight per cent of canadians ages 18 to 35 were living with parents today as has been well documented those numbers have skyrocketed come 2016 a total of 34 7 per cent of canadians between

that is helping them is their parents said tal from the cibc the education system basically failed them they are highly educated but they are not educated in what s relevant there is a mismatch

post graduate certificates and diplomas in the 2016 census but the degree by itself isn t proving to be enough it s not an option about whether or not they re going to have an education that s like an

situation like an arms race for qualifications to set a candidate apart from their competitors so they can land a good job and start their lives the problem is the process is forcing them to put their actual life on hold the thing about this generation is that everything is delayed said duxbury they stay in school longer they get married later if you start comparing the average age of marriage the average age of their first kid the average age of their first permanent full time job it s also forcing those within the generation to compete with one another in ways that are specifically benefitting employers with so much talent available competition for available entry levels jobs is fierce this allows employers to pay less for the workers they need some are even getting away with not paying their employees at all advertisement 11 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content according to the canadian federation of students as many as 300 000 millennials were working in unpaid internships in a bid to further their careers by collecting relevant on the job experience in 2016 the issue with unpaid internships is that most millennials in those jobs are also working in another position likely one that pays minimum wage in order to make ends meet according to the cfs the organization which lobbies on behalf of students also pointed to statistics canada data that shows in 1997 the first year that wage data was collected only 640 000 canadians were making the minimum wage or less in 2017 that number sat at 1 02 million almost double the number previously recorded further compounding the issues facing the millennials is the steady drop in government support offered to post secondary institutions according to the cfs government provided more than 80 per cent of university operating revenues in 1982 that figure fell below 60 per cent in 2012 the most recent year for which statistics are available the cfs says government support has continued to fall in more recent years advertisement 12 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content as

record amounts of debt using data from statistics canada the cfs said that average student debt levels have increased more than 40 per cent between 1999 and 2012 those levels have continued to climb in more recent years the increased cost of education at a time when obtaining a degree has never been more important is another hot button issue for millennials the underemployed generation

health care experience so where am i supposed to get that hypothetically what i m doing now could count but most people applying to that it s their second career they re going to be older in america

of underemployment is wages which would be reflected in the rise of minimum wage workers but the other big indicator is the benefits offered by employers self employed people largely don t have access to benefits people making minimum wage get a minimum amount of benefits from their employers only 55 per cent of millennials have access to a prescription drug plan 53 per cent to dental insurance 36

generation is really really stuck in many ways said benjamin tal managing director and deputy chief economist at cibc this is really the story of this cohort we have a situation where housing is much more expensive so they have to compromise on either renting or they have to switch to condominiums or smart houses or they might buy a car and stay with their parents in the 1960s census data suggest as few as eight per cent of canadians ages 18 to 35 were living with parents today as has been well documented those numbers have skyrocketed come 2016 a total of 34 7 per cent of canadians between

released in 2017 found 37 per cent of millennials who have purchased a home received some of the money for the purchase from their parents the education system basically failed them the only thing that is helping them is their parents said tal from the cibc the education system basically failed them they are highly educated but they are not educated in what s relevant there is a mismatch between the skills that they have and what the economy needs and therefore you have many people underemployed and or trying to compromise there is no denying that millennials are highly educated a study released by the pew research center in the u s suggests that they make up the most highly educated generation ever produced more than 3 5 million canadians between the ages of 20 and 34 reported having some sort of post secondary education including bachelor degrees and post graduate certificates and diplomas in the 2016 census advertisement 7 story continues below this advertisement has not

an invitation card to the party said carleton university s linda duxbury a professor in management sciences at the sprott school of business who specializes in demographic trends she s also a member of the baby boomer generation people who are now 54 to 73 years of age you don t have the skills you don t have post graduate education today be it college or university you aren t even going to be looked at photo by darren brown ottawa citizen duxbury described the situation like an arms race for qualifications to set a candidate apart from their competitors so they can land a good job and start their lives the problem is the process is forcing them to put their actual life on hold the thing about this generation is that everything is delayed said duxbury they stay in school longer they get married later if you start comparing the average age of marriage the average age of their first kid the average age of their first permanent full time job advertisement 8 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content it s also forcing those within the generation to compete with one another in ways that are specifically benefitting employers with so much talent available competition for available entry levels jobs is fierce this allows employers to pay less for the workers they need some are even getting away with not paying their employees at all according to the canadian federation of students as many as 300 000 millennials were working in unpaid internships in a bid to further their careers by collecting relevant on the job experience in 2016 the issue with unpaid internships is that most millennials in those jobs are also working in another position likely one that pays minimum wage in order to make ends meet according to the cfs the organization which lobbies on behalf of students also pointed to statistics canada data that shows in 1997 the first year that wage data was collected only 640 000 canadians were making the minimum wage or less in 2017 that number sat at 1 02 million almost double the number previously recorded further compounding the issues facing the millennials is the steady drop in government support offered to post secondary institutions according to the cfs government provided more than 80 per cent of university operating revenues in 1982 that figure fell below 60 per cent in 2012 the most recent year for which statistics are available the cfs says government support has continued to fall in more recent years advertisement 9 story continues below this advertisement

education that has led to students exiting post secondary institutions with record amounts of debt using data from statistics canada the cfs said that average student debt levels have increased more than 40 per cent between 1999 and 2012 those levels have continued to climb in more recent years the increased cost of education at a time when obtaining a degree has never been more important is another hot button issue for millennials the underemployed generation underemployment a term used to describe people who are overqualified for the positions they find themselves in is also rising rapidly for ottawa s barrett it means her bachelor of science degree isn t enough for her to start a career she is working at a family health clinic on a part time basis and as a goaltending instructor at two different businesses in the nation s capital she is hoping the work will help to save up enough to help pay for a graduate degree there is no getting anywhere with just a bachelor of science anymore she said i graduated i played varsity hockey at dalhousie university academic all canadian all five years i was there i had a good gpa that doesn t matter in terms of getting a job i need to get another degree in order to get a job in a desired field advertisement 10 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content she has applied to get into a program to become a physician assistant but hasn t been successful in getting into the program so far photo by julie oliver postmedia it s tough and competitive she said even for a lot of the programs you are looking at applying to to get an actual career the amount of hours of experience you need for example the physician assistant program that i applied to it s only offered by three universities in canada and i couldn t apply to the third which is the university of toronto because they require almost 1 000 hours of health care experience so where am i supposed to get that hypothetically what i m doing now could count but most people applying to that it s their second career they re going to be older in america where numbers are more readily available underemployment held steady at around 33 per cent of all post secondary graduates between the 1980s and 2010 however that figure jumped to more than 44 per cent of all graduates in 2012 the most

up financially advertisement 11 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content income inequality has become more entrenched as lower income ontarians are increasingly staying in low income and higher income ontarians are increasingly staying in high income said peter weltman the province s financial accountability officer in a report released thursday he highlighted significant structural changes in ontario s economy and labour market including a rise in part time and temporary work these trends in ontario incomes raise important questions about the role of government in ensuring that all individuals have access to similar economic opportunities he said abacus s coletto is seeing signs that the trend exists here in canada too one of the key indicators of underemployment is wages which would be reflected in the rise of minimum wage workers but the other big indicator is the benefits offered by employers self employed people largely don t have access to benefits people making minimum wage get a minimum amount of benefits from their employers only 55 per cent of millennials have access to a prescription drug plan 53 per cent to dental insurance 36 per cent to an rrsp and only 29 per cent to an employer provided pension plan according to a recent study released by abacus data advertisement 12 story

graduated 10 or 15 years ago are finding the education that they worked so hard to receive and paid good money for is no longer relevant to the work they are expected to be doing in 1980 there were a total of 2 080 000 people employed in canada s manufacturing industry according to statistics canada by 2016 that number dropped by more than half to 1 032 900 people the professional scientific and technical industry which includes high technology workers employed 393 400 people in 1980 that swelled to more than 1 393 700 by 2016 today s employers are less likely to train existing employees to

jobs are taking over as we move to ai artificial intelligence robotics all these kinds of things certainly jobs are going to be replaced new jobs are going to be created mostly at the high scale end

is currently working for them advertisement 13 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content my father when he came back from the war had a grade 12 education when he retired he was vice president at 3m why because there was a different attitude then is it harder to buy a home yes are we taking on higher student debt yes have we been trained and educated in the wrong things many of us yes said abacus s coletto we ve been raised around these expectations go do what you want to do the world is your oyster dream big those expectations were set quite high when you enter a world where it s not possible to achieve the things that your parents and your teachers and society has been saying is going to be there it creates further tension baby boomers won t go can t go the tension is being compounded by the baby boomer generation s refusal to leave the workforce if the millennials are stuck in a bottleneck fighting for career advancement right now the baby boomers are acting like a cork preventing any movement whereas the age 65 was once marked by a person s announcing their retirement today s senior citizens are opting to soldier on the idea of freedom at 55 seems long forgotten advertisement 14 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content extended life spans better health and in some cases continued financial responsibilities are seeing many people in the baby boomer demographic work well into their 70s before opting for retirement boomers have significant expenses that perhaps they didn t anticipate plus they love their jobs and they re healthy they think what am i going to do for the next 25 years said duxbury duxbury also said that baby boomers are now finding themselves in a situation where they are caring for or paying for the care of their aging parents many also find themselves sandwiched in between paying for their parents while also supporting their millennial children who have returned to the family home the millennials can t afford to leave their parents homes because they don t have the opportunity or means to do so but their parents can t afford to retire which would open spaces in the workforce for millennials because they are still supporting those kids at home it is a problem that the boomers aren t leaving that s absolutely true said duxbury so what comes next advertisement 15 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the awakening of the millennial tectonic plates are beginning to shift that s the opinion at least of karen foster assistant professor at dalhousie university and canada research chair in sustainable rural futures for atlantic canada one of foster s areas of expertise is in researching generational divisions at work she said there is no doubt millennials are upset and that their complaints have been falling on deaf ears however one of the larger issues that millennials are facing is a growing wealth gap between themselves and older generations due to the fact that major life milestones have been delayed investments in real estate or other financial transactions aren t yielding the same return for the younger generation foster said sure property values have skyrocketed for older generations who bought when prices were affordable and have been hanging onto the property but the millennial who just purchased is seeing bigger mortgages than ever before and interest rates that are steadily rising critics of millennial concerns have often pointed out that are next in line to inherit massive amounts of wealth that has been accumulated by their aging parents in fact between 2016 and 2026 the largest wealth transfer in history is expected to take place as older generations pass on as much as 1 trillion to younger generations in canada according to toronto based research firm strategic insight advertisement 16 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content but foster pointed out one critical problem with the upcoming windfall the expected transfer of wealth will only benefit those people who come from families that are already wealthy it will also affect people from major canadian cities where property prices have been steadily rising in a much different way than those people from less populated towns if your family is from somewhere such as moncton n b moose jaw sask or sudbury ont you won t see the same windfall when it comes time to collect an inheritance people who are set to inherit money from their parents or in a sense have been inheriting it their whole lives through various kinds of support that s where the real inequality happens she said adding that millennials are looking to completely upend the status quo that really comes down to a restructuring of the tax system we need to be taxing wealth and high incomes and corporate profits more in order to redistribute wealth across the demographics foster predicts that millennials are likely to push for things such as increased estate taxes in order to ensure that some of the wealth that is transferred from older generations is redistributed throughout all of society the idea is being spearheaded in the united states by recently elected democrat congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez ocasio cortez who at 29 is also a millennial is lobbying for the introduction of a tax on the wealthiest americans in the country she believes that every dollar of income over 10 million should be taxed at 70 per cent advertisement 17 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content there will of course be pushback to that idea it s been panned by the audience at the world economic forum in davos switzerland as recently as last week with attendees including michael dell founder of dell technologies and microsoft corp founder bill gates expressing objections the call for higher estate taxes in canada was recently reinforced in a study released by the canadian centre for policy alternatives ccpa you d expect canada s tax regime would try to counteract this concentration of wealth at the very top where it s needed the least but in fact federal policies encourage it said the centre s senior economist david macdonald in a release canada is the only country in the g7 without an inheritance estate or gift tax on tremendous family wealth the ccpa s report said canada s wealthiest families saw their net worth grow on average by 37 per cent between 2012 and 2016 middle class families saw their net worth grow by only 16 per cent during the same time frame the study calls for high estate taxes eliminating tax preferences for capital gains and dividend income in a bid to better distribute wealth across demographics advertisement 18 story

their lifetimes and typically been more conservative when it comes to political fiscal policies but for the millennial generation it s only the tip of the iceberg bring the big government according to abacus data millennials are looking to government to take big steps to fix their problems this generation is more comfortable with big interventionist government than allowing market forces to play their part surveys suggest many millennials truly believe that the economic system that has been in place for hundreds of years fails to work for them the company s research suggests that millennials clearly prioritize increased government spending over balanced budgets in order to tackle issues such as alleviating income inequality they believe corporations don t pay their fair share of taxes and that government has a big role to play in redistributing that money having lived through the 2008 financial crisis and a rise in housing costs many are outright skeptical of the free market when asked to indicate if they lean more towards one perspective or the other only 46 per cent suggested that capitalism is the best economic model we have while 54 per cent believe canada would be better off

content perhaps the most pertinent fact millennials are now the largest block of voters in the country and have the ability to swing an election toward the party or platform of their choice provided the generation gets out the vote so far they have remained relatively quiet in most elections politicians aren t talking about issues that they care about they aren t very compelling they aren t giving them a reason to get engaged said abacus s coletto millennials are unique from previous generations particularly the boomers and those who came before the boomers in that voting is not considered a duty we don t do it because we have to we do it because we have a reason to reasons seem to be emerging according to elections canada 38 8 per cent of eligible voters between the ages of

to leave their parents homes because they don t have the opportunity or means to do so but their parents can t afford to retire which would open spaces in the workforce for millennials because they are still supporting those kids at home it is a problem that the boomers aren t leaving that s absolutely true said duxbury so what comes next the awakening of the millennial tectonic plates are beginning to shift advertisement 21 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content that s the opinion at least of karen foster assistant professor at dalhousie university and canada research chair in sustainable rural futures for atlantic canada one of foster s areas of expertise is in researching generational divisions at work she said there is no doubt millennials are upset and that their complaints have been falling on deaf ears however one of the larger issues that millennials are facing is a growing wealth gap between themselves and older generations due to the fact that major life milestones have been delayed investments in real estate or other financial transactions aren t yielding the same return for the younger generation foster said sure property values have skyrocketed for older generations who bought when prices were affordable and have been hanging onto the property but the millennial who just purchased is seeing bigger mortgages than ever before and interest rates that are steadily rising advertisement 22 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content critics of millennial concerns have often pointed out that are next in line to inherit massive amounts of wealth that has been accumulated by their aging parents in fact between 2016 and 2026 the largest wealth transfer in history is expected to take place as older generations pass on as much as 1 trillion to younger generations in canada according to toronto based research firm strategic insight but foster pointed out one critical problem with the upcoming windfall the expected transfer of wealth will only benefit those people who come from families that are already wealthy it will also affect people from major canadian cities where property prices have been steadily rising in a much different way than those people from less populated towns if your family is from somewhere such as moncton n b moose jaw sask or sudbury ont you won t see the same windfall when it comes time to collect an inheritance advertisement 23 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content people who are set to inherit money from their parents or in a sense have been inheriting it their whole lives through various kinds of support that s where the real inequality happens she said adding that millennials are looking to completely upend the status quo that really comes down to a restructuring of the tax system we need to be taxing wealth and high incomes and corporate profits more in order to redistribute wealth across the demographics foster predicts that millennials are likely to push for things such as increased estate taxes in order to ensure that some of the wealth that is transferred from older generations is redistributed throughout all of society the idea is being spearheaded in the united states by recently elected democrat congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez ocasio cortez who at 29 is also a millennial is lobbying for the introduction of a tax on the wealthiest americans in the country she believes that every dollar of income over 10 million should be taxed at 70 per cent advertisement 24 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content there will of course be pushback to that idea it s been panned by the audience at the world economic forum in davos switzerland as recently as last week with attendees including michael dell founder of dell technologies and microsoft corp founder bill gates expressing objections the call for higher estate taxes in canada was recently reinforced in a study released by the canadian centre for policy alternatives ccpa you d expect canada s tax regime would try to counteract this concentration of wealth at the very top where it s needed the least but in fact federal policies encourage it said the centre s senior economist david macdonald in a release canada is the only country in the g7 without an inheritance estate or gift tax on tremendous family wealth advertisement 25 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the ccpa s report said canada s wealthiest families saw their net worth grow on average by 37 per cent between 2012 and 2016 middle class families saw their net worth grow by only 16 per cent during the same time frame the study calls for high estate taxes eliminating tax preferences for capital gains and dividend income in a bid to better distribute wealth across demographics that may sound like a scary scenario to older generations who have amassed wealth throughout their lifetimes and typically been more conservative when it comes to political fiscal policies but for the millennial generation it s only the tip of the iceberg bring the big government according to abacus data millennials are looking to government to take big steps to fix their problems this generation is more comfortable with big interventionist government than allowing market forces to play their part surveys suggest many millennials truly believe that the economic system that has been in place for hundreds of years fails to work for them advertisement 26 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the company s research suggests that millennials clearly prioritize increased government spending over balanced budgets in order to tackle issues such as alleviating income inequality they believe corporations don t pay their fair share of taxes and that government has a big role to play in redistributing that money having lived through the 2008 financial crisis and a rise in housing costs many are outright skeptical of the free market when asked to indicate if they lean more towards one perspective or the other only 46 per cent suggested that capitalism is the best economic model we have while 54 per cent believe canada would be better off with a more socialist system reads an abacus data survey released last year perhaps the most pertinent fact millennials are now the largest block of voters in the country and have the ability to swing an election toward the party or platform of their choice provided the generation gets out the vote so far they have remained relatively quiet in most elections politicians aren t talking about issues that they care about they aren t very compelling they aren t giving them a reason to get engaged said abacus s coletto millennials are unique from previous generations particularly the boomers and those who came before the boomers in that voting is not considered a duty we don t do it because we have to we do it because we have a reason to reasons seem to be emerging according to elections canada 38 8 per cent of eligible voters between the ages of 18 and 24 years of age voted in the 2011 federal election of those between 25 and 34 years of age 45 1 per cent cast their ballot by comparison a total of 64 5 per cent of canadians between the ages of 45 and 54 voted in that election when it came to canadians between the ages of 65 and 74 a total of 75 1 per cent of eligible voters participated the federal election in 2015 saw better turnout by millennials more than 57 1 per cent of eligible voters between 18 and 24 years of age cast a ballot the number was similar in the 25 through 34 year old age group where 57 4 per cent of eligible voters participated one of the big issues during the 2015 election was the liberal party s promise to legalize cannabis sales in canada which is something that appeals specifically to the millennial generation s interests more than 60 per cent of canadians between the ages of 18 and 34 supported legalizing cannabis according to a study released by nrg research group and peak communicators in march 2017 photo by chris young the canadian press it s expected that more politicians will be looking to woo the millennial vote heading into october s federal election last week finance minister bill morneau said the federal government is looking at ways to make housing purchases more affordable for millennials in the months ahead he called the issue a priority but didn t elaborate ndp leader jagmeet singh has said his party would propose measures to help build as many as 500 000 affordable housing units across the country if elected with more politicians tuning into the fact that the millennial generation will vote for political platforms that speak to their agenda the 18 through 35 demographic looks as though it will soon find itself in an unfamiliar position instead of taking a back seat while older generations plot the course millennials are poised to grab the wheel and take a drastic detour it hasn t boiled over yet but the pot is starting to get warm said coletto there are more millennials than there are boomers more millennials are eligible to vote than any other generation more politicians are mindful of the shift that millennials could bring meanwhile barrett is

themselves and older generations due to the fact that major life milestones have been delayed investments in real estate or other financial transactions aren t yielding the same return for the younger

strategic insight but foster pointed out one critical problem with the upcoming windfall the expected transfer of wealth will only benefit those people who come from families that are already wealthy it will also affect people from major canadian cities where property prices have been steadily rising in a much different way than those people from less populated towns if your family is from

be taxing wealth and high incomes and corporate profits more in order to redistribute wealth across the demographics foster predicts that millennials are likely to push for things such as increased estate taxes in order to ensure that some of the wealth that is transferred from older generations is redistributed throughout all of society the idea is being spearheaded in the united states by

preferences for capital gains and dividend income in a bid to better distribute wealth across demographics that may sound like a scary scenario to older generations who have amassed wealth throughout their lifetimes and typically been more conservative when it comes to political fiscal policies but for the millennial generation it s only the tip of the iceberg bring the big government according to abacus data millennials are looking to government to take big steps to fix their problems this generation is more comfortable with big interventionist government than allowing market forces to play their part surveys suggest many millennials truly believe that the economic system that has been in place for hundreds of years fails to work for them advertisement 26 story continues below this

other only 46 per cent suggested that capitalism is the best economic model we have while 54 per cent believe canada would be better off with a more socialist system reads an abacus data survey released last year perhaps the most pertinent fact millennials are now the largest block of voters in the country and have the ability to swing an election toward the party or platform of their choice provided the generation gets out the vote so far they have remained relatively quiet in most elections politicians aren t talking about issues that they care about they aren t very compelling they aren t giving them a reason to get engaged said abacus s coletto millennials are unique from previous generations particularly the boomers and those who came before the boomers in that voting is not considered a duty we don t do it because we have to we do it because we have a reason to reasons seem to be emerging according to elections canada 38 8 per cent of eligible voters between the ages of 18 and 24 years of age voted in the 2011 federal election of those between 25 and 34 years of age 45 1 per cent cast their ballot by comparison a total of 64 5 per cent of canadians between the ages of 45 and 54 voted in that election when it came to canadians between the ages of 65 and 74 a total of 75 1 per cent of eligible voters participated the federal election in 2015 saw better turnout by millennials more than 57 1 per cent of eligible voters between 18 and 24 years of age cast a ballot the number was similar in the 25 through 34 year old age group where 57 4 per cent of eligible voters participated one of the big issues during the 2015 election was the liberal party s promise to legalize cannabis sales in canada which is something that appeals specifically to the millennial generation s interests more than 60 per cent of canadians between the ages of 18 and 34 supported legalizing cannabis according to a study released by nrg research group and peak communicators in march 2017 photo by chris young the canadian press it s expected that more politicians will be looking to woo the millennial vote heading into october s federal election last week finance minister bill morneau said the federal government is looking at ways to make housing purchases more affordable for millennials in the months ahead he called the issue a priority but didn t elaborate ndp leader jagmeet singh has said his party would propose measures to help build as many as 500 000 affordable housing units across the country if elected with more politicians tuning into the fact that the millennial generation will vote for political platforms that speak to their agenda the 18 through 35 demographic looks as though it will soon find itself in an unfamiliar position instead of taking a back seat while older generations plot the course millennials are poised to grab the wheel and take a drastic detour it hasn t boiled over yet but the pot is starting to get warm said coletto there are more millennials than there are boomers more millennials are eligible to vote than any other generation more politicians are mindful of the shift that millennials could bring meanwhile barrett is taking things in stride i ve seen a fair amount of challenges our generation may seem to think that we go through more but i think that every generation goes through some kind of hardships when it

actual life on hold the thing about this generation is that everything is delayed said duxbury they stay in school longer they get married later if you start comparing the average age of marriage the average age of their first kid the average age of their first permanent full time job it s also forcing those within the generation to compete with one another in ways that are specifically

more expensive so they have to compromise on either renting or they have to switch to condominiums or smart houses or they might buy a car and stay with their parents in the 1960s census data suggest as few as eight per cent of canadians ages 18 to 35 were living with parents today as has been well documented those numbers have skyrocketed come 2016 a total of 34 7 per cent of canadians between

that is helping them is their parents said tal from the cibc the education system basically failed them they are highly educated but they are not educated in what s relevant there is a mismatch

up the most highly educated generation ever produced more than 3 5 million canadians between the ages of 20 and 34 reported having some sort of post secondary education including bachelor degrees and post graduate certificates and diplomas in the 2016 census but the degree by itself isn t proving to be enough it s not an option about whether or not they re going to have an education that s like an invitation card to the party said carleton university s linda duxbury a professor in management sciences at the sprott school of business who specializes in demographic trends she s also a member of

situation like an arms race for qualifications to set a candidate apart from their competitors so they can land a good job and start their lives the problem is the process is forcing them to put their actual life on hold the thing about this generation is that everything is delayed said duxbury they stay in school longer they get married later if you start comparing the average age of marriage the average age of their first kid the average age of their first permanent full time job it s also forcing those within the generation to compete with one another in ways that are specifically benefitting employers with so much talent available competition for available entry levels jobs is fierce this allows employers to pay less for the workers they need some are even getting away with not paying their employees at all advertisement 11 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content according to the canadian federation of students as many as 300 000 millennials were working in unpaid internships in a bid to further their careers by collecting relevant on the job experience in 2016 the issue with unpaid internships is that most millennials in those jobs are also working in another position likely one that pays minimum wage in order to make ends meet according to the cfs the organization which lobbies on behalf of students also pointed to statistics canada data that shows in 1997 the first year that wage data was collected only 640 000 canadians were making the minimum wage or less in 2017 that number sat at 1 02 million almost double the number previously recorded further compounding the issues facing the millennials is the steady drop in government support offered to post secondary institutions according to the cfs government provided more than 80 per cent of university operating revenues in 1982 that figure fell below 60 per cent in 2012 the most recent year for which statistics are available the cfs says government support has continued to fall in more recent years advertisement 12 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content as government support has decreased students have been forced to shoulder more of the financial burden when obtaining their education that has led to students exiting post secondary institutions with record amounts of debt using data from statistics canada the cfs said that average student debt levels have increased more than 40 per cent between 1999 and 2012 those levels have continued to climb in more recent years the increased cost of education at a time when obtaining a degree has never been more important is another hot button issue for millennials the underemployed generation

health care experience so where am i supposed to get that hypothetically what i m doing now could count but most people applying to that it s their second career they re going to be older in america

of government in ensuring that all individuals have access to similar economic opportunities he said abacus s coletto is seeing signs that the trend exists here in canada too one of the key indicators of underemployment is wages which would be reflected in the rise of minimum wage workers but the other big indicator is the benefits offered by employers self employed people largely don t have access to benefits people making minimum wage get a minimum amount of benefits from their employers only 55 per cent of millennials have access to a prescription drug plan 53 per cent to dental insurance 36

he was vice president at 3m why because there was a different attitude then is it harder to buy a home yes are we taking on higher student debt yes have we been trained and educated in the wrong things many of us yes said abacus s coletto we ve been raised around these expectations go do what you want to do the world is your oyster dream big those expectations were set quite high when you

refusal to leave the workforce if the millennials are stuck in a bottleneck fighting for career advancement right now the baby boomers are acting like a cork preventing any movement whereas the age 65 was once marked by a person s announcing their retirement today s senior citizens are opting to soldier on the idea of freedom at 55 seems long forgotten extended life spans better health and in some cases continued financial responsibilities are seeing many people in the baby boomer demographic work well into their 70s before opting for retirement boomers have significant expenses that perhaps they didn t anticipate plus they love their jobs and they re healthy they think what am i going to do for the next 25 years said duxbury advertisement 20 story continues below this advertisement has

aging parents many also find themselves sandwiched in between paying for their parents while also supporting their millennial children who have returned to the family home the millennials can t afford to leave their parents homes because they don t have the opportunity or means to do so but their parents can t afford to retire which would open spaces in the workforce for millennials because they are still supporting those kids at home it is a problem that the boomers aren t leaving that s absolutely true said duxbury so what comes next the awakening of the millennial tectonic plates are beginning to shift advertisement 21 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content that s the opinion at least of karen foster assistant professor at dalhousie university and canada research chair in sustainable rural futures for atlantic canada one of foster s areas of expertise is in researching generational divisions at work she said there is no doubt millennials are upset and that their complaints have been falling on deaf ears however one of the larger issues that millennials are facing is a growing wealth gap between themselves and older generations due to the fact that major life milestones have been delayed investments in real estate or other financial transactions aren t yielding the same return for the younger generation foster said sure property values have skyrocketed for older generations who bought when prices were affordable and have been hanging onto the property but the millennial who just purchased is seeing bigger mortgages than ever before and interest rates that are steadily rising advertisement 22 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content critics of millennial concerns have often pointed out that are next in line to inherit massive amounts of wealth that has been accumulated by their aging parents in fact between 2016 and 2026 the largest wealth transfer in history is expected to take place as older generations pass on as much as 1 trillion to younger generations in canada according to toronto based research firm strategic insight but foster pointed out one critical problem with the upcoming windfall the expected transfer of wealth will only benefit those people who come from families that are already wealthy it will also affect people from major canadian cities where property prices have been steadily rising in a much different way than those people from less populated towns if your family is from somewhere such as moncton n b moose jaw sask or sudbury ont you won t see the same windfall when it comes time to collect an inheritance advertisement 23 story continues below this advertisement has

support that s where the real inequality happens she said adding that millennials are looking to completely upend the status quo that really comes down to a restructuring of the tax system we need to be taxing wealth and high incomes and corporate profits more in order to redistribute wealth across the demographics foster predicts that millennials are likely to push for things such as increased estate taxes in order to ensure that some of the wealth that is transferred from older generations is redistributed throughout all of society the idea is being spearheaded in the united states by recently elected democrat congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez ocasio cortez who at 29 is also a millennial is lobbying for the introduction of a tax on the wealthiest americans in the country she

michael dell founder of dell technologies and microsoft corp founder bill gates expressing objections the call for higher estate taxes in canada was recently reinforced in a study released by the canadian centre for policy alternatives ccpa you d expect canada s tax regime would try to counteract this concentration of wealth at the very top where it s needed the least but in fact federal policies encourage it said the centre s senior economist david macdonald in a release canada is the only country in the g7 without an inheritance estate or gift tax on tremendous family wealth advertisement 25 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the ccpa s report said canada s wealthiest families saw their net worth grow on average by 37 per cent between 2012 and 2016 middle class families saw their net worth grow by only 16 per cent during the same time frame the study calls for high estate taxes eliminating tax preferences for capital gains and dividend income in a bid to better distribute wealth across demographics that may sound like a scary scenario to older generations who have amassed wealth throughout their lifetimes and typically been more conservative when it comes to political fiscal policies but for the millennial generation it s only the tip of the iceberg bring the big government according to abacus data millennials are looking to government to take big steps to fix their problems this generation is more comfortable with big interventionist government than allowing market forces to play

refusal to leave the workforce if the millennials are stuck in a bottleneck fighting for career advancement right now the baby boomers are acting like a cork preventing any movement whereas the age 65 was once marked by a person s announcing their retirement today s senior citizens are opting to soldier on the idea of freedom at 55 seems long forgotten extended life spans better health and in some cases continued financial responsibilities are seeing many people in the baby boomer demographic work well into their 70s before opting for retirement boomers have significant expenses that perhaps they didn t anticipate plus they love their jobs and they re healthy they think what am i going to do for the next 25 years said duxbury advertisement 20 story continues below this advertisement has

aging parents many also find themselves sandwiched in between paying for their parents while also supporting their millennial children who have returned to the family home the millennials can t afford to leave their parents homes because they don t have the opportunity or means to do so but their parents can t afford to retire which would open spaces in the workforce for millennials because they are still supporting those kids at home it is a problem that the boomers aren t leaving that s absolutely true said duxbury so what comes next the awakening of the millennial tectonic plates are beginning to shift advertisement 21 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content that s the opinion at least of karen foster assistant professor at dalhousie university and canada research chair in sustainable rural futures for atlantic canada one of foster s areas of expertise is in researching generational divisions at work she said there is no doubt millennials are upset and that their complaints have been falling on deaf ears however one of the larger issues that millennials are facing is a growing wealth gap between themselves and older generations due to the fact that major life milestones have been delayed investments in real estate or other financial transactions aren t yielding the same return for the younger generation foster said sure property values have skyrocketed for older generations who bought when prices were affordable and have been hanging onto the property but the millennial who just purchased is seeing bigger mortgages than ever before and interest rates that are steadily rising advertisement 22 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content critics of millennial concerns have often pointed out that are next in line to inherit massive amounts of wealth that has been accumulated by their aging parents in fact between 2016 and 2026 the largest wealth transfer in history is expected to take place as older generations pass on as much as 1 trillion to younger generations in canada according to toronto based research firm strategic insight but foster pointed out one critical problem with the upcoming windfall the expected transfer of wealth will only benefit those people who come from families that are already wealthy it will also affect people from major canadian cities where property prices have been steadily rising in a much different way than those people from less populated towns if your family is from somewhere such as moncton n b moose jaw sask or sudbury ont you won t see the same windfall when it comes time to collect an inheritance advertisement 23 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content people who are set to inherit money from their parents or in a sense have been inheriting it their whole lives through various kinds of support that s where the real inequality happens she said adding that millennials are looking to completely upend the status quo that really comes down to a restructuring of the tax system we need to be taxing wealth and high incomes and corporate profits more in order to redistribute wealth across the demographics foster predicts that millennials are likely to push for things such as increased estate taxes in order to ensure that some of the wealth that is transferred from older generations is redistributed throughout all of society the idea is being spearheaded in the united states by recently elected democrat congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez ocasio cortez who at 29 is also a millennial is lobbying for the introduction of a tax on the wealthiest americans in the country she believes that every dollar of income over 10 million should be taxed at 70 per cent advertisement 24 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content there will of course be pushback to that idea it s been panned by the audience at the world economic forum in davos switzerland as recently as last week with attendees including michael dell founder of dell technologies and microsoft corp founder bill gates expressing objections the call for higher estate taxes in canada was recently reinforced in a study released by the canadian centre for policy alternatives ccpa you d expect canada s tax regime would try to counteract this concentration of wealth at the very top where it s needed the least but in fact federal policies encourage it said the centre s senior economist david macdonald in a release canada is the only country in the g7 without an inheritance estate or gift tax on tremendous family wealth advertisement 25 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the ccpa s report said canada s wealthiest families saw their net worth grow on average by 37 per cent between 2012 and 2016 middle class families saw their net worth grow by only 16 per cent during the same time frame the study calls for high estate taxes eliminating tax preferences for capital gains and dividend income in a bid to better distribute wealth across demographics that may sound like a scary scenario to older generations who have amassed wealth throughout their lifetimes and typically been more conservative when it comes to political fiscal policies but for the millennial generation it s only the tip of the iceberg bring the big government according to abacus data millennials are looking to government to take big steps to fix their problems this generation is more comfortable with big interventionist government than allowing market forces to play their part surveys suggest many millennials truly believe that the economic system that has been in place for hundreds of years fails to work for them advertisement 26 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the company s research suggests that millennials clearly prioritize increased government spending over balanced budgets in order to tackle issues such as alleviating income inequality they believe corporations don t pay their fair share of taxes and that government has a big role to play in redistributing that money having lived through the 2008 financial crisis and a rise in housing costs many are outright skeptical of the free market when asked to indicate if they lean more towards one perspective or the other only 46 per cent suggested that capitalism is the best economic model we have while 54 per cent believe canada would be better off with a more socialist system reads an abacus data survey released last year perhaps the most pertinent fact millennials are now the largest block of voters in the country and have the ability to swing an election toward the party or platform of their choice provided the generation gets out the vote so far they have remained relatively quiet in most elections politicians aren t talking about issues that they care about they aren t very compelling they aren t giving them a reason to get engaged said abacus s coletto millennials are unique from previous generations particularly the boomers and those who came before the boomers in that voting is not considered a duty we don t do it because we have to we do it because we have a reason to reasons seem to be emerging according to elections canada 38 8 per cent of eligible voters between the ages of 18 and 24 years of age voted in the 2011 federal election of those between 25 and 34 years of age 45 1 per cent cast their ballot by comparison a total of 64 5 per cent of canadians between the ages of 45 and 54 voted in that election when it came to canadians between the ages of 65 and 74 a total of 75 1 per cent of eligible voters participated the federal election in 2015 saw better turnout by millennials more than 57 1 per cent of eligible voters between 18 and 24 years of age cast a ballot the number was similar in the 25 through 34 year old age group where 57 4 per cent of eligible voters participated one of the big issues during the 2015 election was the liberal party s promise to legalize cannabis sales in canada which is something that appeals specifically to the millennial generation s interests more than 60 per cent of canadians between the ages of 18 and 34 supported legalizing cannabis according to a study released by nrg research group and peak communicators in march 2017 photo by chris young the canadian press it s expected that more politicians will be looking to woo the millennial vote heading into october s federal election last week finance minister bill morneau said the federal government is looking at ways to make housing purchases more affordable for millennials in the months ahead he called the issue a priority but didn t elaborate ndp leader jagmeet singh has said his party would propose measures to help build as many as 500 000 affordable housing units across the country if elected with more politicians tuning into the fact that the millennial generation will vote for political platforms that speak to their agenda the 18 through 35 demographic looks as though it will soon find itself in an unfamiliar position instead of taking a back seat while older generations plot the course millennials are poised to grab the wheel and take a drastic detour it hasn t boiled over yet but the pot is starting to get warm said coletto there are more millennials than there are boomers more millennials are eligible to vote than any other generation more politicians are mindful of the shift that millennials could bring meanwhile barrett is

more expensive so they have to compromise on either renting or they have to switch to condominiums or smart houses or they might buy a car and stay with their parents in the 1960s census data suggest as few as eight per cent of canadians ages 18 to 35 were living with parents today as has been well documented those numbers have skyrocketed come 2016 a total of 34 7 per cent of canadians between

that is helping them is their parents said tal from the cibc the education system basically failed them they are highly educated but they are not educated in what s relevant there is a mismatch

up the most highly educated generation ever produced more than 3 5 million canadians between the ages of 20 and 34 reported having some sort of post secondary education including bachelor degrees and post graduate certificates and diplomas in the 2016 census but the degree by itself isn t proving to be enough it s not an option about whether or not they re going to have an education that s like an invitation card to the party said carleton university s linda duxbury a professor in management sciences at the sprott school of business who specializes in demographic trends she s also a member of

situation like an arms race for qualifications to set a candidate apart from their competitors so they can land a good job and start their lives the problem is the process is forcing them to put their actual life on hold the thing about this generation is that everything is delayed said duxbury they stay in school longer they get married later if you start comparing the average age of marriage the average age of their first kid the average age of their first permanent full time job it s also forcing those within the generation to compete with one another in ways that are specifically benefitting employers with so much talent available competition for available entry levels jobs is fierce this allows employers to pay less for the workers they need some are even getting away with not paying their employees at all advertisement 11 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content according to the canadian federation of students as many as 300 000 millennials were working in unpaid internships in a bid to further their careers by collecting relevant on the job experience in 2016 the issue with unpaid internships is that most millennials in those jobs are also working in another position likely one that pays minimum wage in order to make ends meet according to the cfs the organization which lobbies on behalf of students also pointed to statistics canada data that shows in 1997 the first year that wage data was collected only 640 000 canadians were making the minimum wage or less in 2017 that number sat at 1 02 million almost double the number previously recorded further compounding the issues facing the millennials is the steady drop in government support offered to post secondary institutions according to the cfs government provided more than 80 per cent of university operating revenues in 1982 that figure fell below 60 per cent in 2012 the most recent year for which statistics are available the cfs says government support has continued to fall in more recent years advertisement 12 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content as government support has decreased students have been forced to shoulder more of the financial burden when obtaining their education that has led to students exiting post secondary institutions with record amounts of debt using data from statistics canada the cfs said that average student debt levels have increased more than 40 per cent between 1999 and 2012 those levels have continued to climb in more recent years the increased cost of education at a time when obtaining a degree has never been more important is another hot button issue for millennials the underemployed generation

health care experience so where am i supposed to get that hypothetically what i m doing now could count but most people applying to that it s their second career they re going to be older in america where numbers are more readily available underemployment held steady at around 33 per cent of all post secondary graduates between the 1980s and 2010 advertisement 15 story continues below this

of government in ensuring that all individuals have access to similar economic opportunities he said abacus s coletto is seeing signs that the trend exists here in canada too one of the key indicators of underemployment is wages which would be reflected in the rise of minimum wage workers but the other big indicator is the benefits offered by employers self employed people largely don t have access to benefits people making minimum wage get a minimum amount of benefits from their employers only 55 per cent of millennials have access to a prescription drug plan 53 per cent to dental insurance 36

up the most highly educated generation ever produced more than 3 5 million canadians between the ages of 20 and 34 reported having some sort of post secondary education including bachelor degrees and post graduate certificates and diplomas in the 2016 census but the degree by itself isn t proving to be enough it s not an option about whether or not they re going to have an education that s like an invitation card to the party said carleton university s linda duxbury a professor in management sciences at the sprott school of business who specializes in demographic trends she s also a member of

situation like an arms race for qualifications to set a candidate apart from their competitors so they can land a good job and start their lives the problem is the process is forcing them to put their actual life on hold the thing about this generation is that everything is delayed said duxbury they stay in school longer they get married later if you start comparing the average age of marriage the average age of their first kid the average age of their first permanent full time job it s also forcing those within the generation to compete with one another in ways that are specifically benefitting employers with so much talent available competition for available entry levels jobs is fierce this allows employers to pay less for the workers they need some are even getting away with not paying their employees at all advertisement 11 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content according to the canadian federation of students as many as 300 000 millennials were working in unpaid internships in a bid to further their careers by collecting relevant on the job experience in 2016 the issue with unpaid internships is that most millennials in those jobs are also working in another position likely one that pays minimum wage in order to make ends meet according to the cfs the organization which lobbies on behalf of students also pointed to statistics canada data that shows in 1997 the first year that wage data was collected only 640 000 canadians were making the minimum wage or less in 2017 that number sat at 1 02 million almost double the number previously recorded further compounding the issues facing the millennials is the steady drop in government support offered to post secondary institutions according to the cfs government provided more than 80 per cent of university operating revenues in 1982 that figure fell below 60 per cent in 2012 the most recent year for which statistics are available the cfs says government support has continued to fall in more recent years advertisement 12 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content as government support has decreased students have been forced to shoulder more of the financial burden when obtaining their education that has led to students exiting post secondary institutions with record amounts of debt using data from statistics canada the cfs said that average student debt levels have increased more than 40 per cent between 1999 and 2012 those levels have continued to climb in more recent years the increased cost of education at a time when obtaining a degree has never been more important is another hot button issue for millennials the underemployed generation

postmedia it s tough and competitive she said even for a lot of the programs you are looking at applying to to get an actual career the amount of hours of experience you need for example the physician assistant program that i applied to it s only offered by three universities in canada and i couldn t apply to the third which is the university of toronto because they require almost 1 000 hours of health care experience so where am i supposed to get that hypothetically what i m doing now could count but most people applying to that it s their second career they re going to be older in america where numbers are more readily available underemployment held steady at around 33 per cent of all post secondary graduates between the 1980s and 2010 advertisement 15 story continues below this

has become more entrenched as lower income ontarians are increasingly staying in low income and higher income ontarians are increasingly staying in high income said peter weltman the province s financial accountability officer in a report released thursday he highlighted significant structural changes in ontario s economy and labour market including a rise in part time and temporary work

of government in ensuring that all individuals have access to similar economic opportunities he said abacus s coletto is seeing signs that the trend exists here in canada too one of the key indicators of underemployment is wages which would be reflected in the rise of minimum wage workers but the other big indicator is the benefits offered by employers self employed people largely don t have access to benefits people making minimum wage get a minimum amount of benefits from their employers only 55 per cent of millennials have access to a prescription drug plan 53 per cent to dental insurance 36 per cent to an rrsp and only 29 per cent to an employer provided pension plan according to a recent study released by abacus data advertisement 17 story continues below this advertisement has not

rather have someone coming in with the credentials then they would training somebody who is currently working for them my father when he came back from the war had a grade 12 education when he retired he was vice president at 3m why because there was a different attitude then is it harder to buy a home yes are we taking on higher student debt yes have we been trained and educated in the wrong things many of us yes said abacus s coletto we ve been raised around these expectations go do what you want to do the world is your oyster dream big those expectations were set quite high when you enter a world where it s not possible to achieve the things that your parents and your teachers and society has been saying is going to be there it creates further tension advertisement 19 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content baby boomers won t go can t go the tension is being compounded by the baby boomer generation s refusal to leave the workforce if the millennials are stuck in a bottleneck fighting for career advancement right now the baby boomers are acting like a cork preventing any movement whereas the age 65 was once marked by a person s announcing their retirement today s senior citizens are opting to soldier on the idea of freedom at 55 seems long forgotten extended life spans better health and in some cases continued financial responsibilities are seeing many people in the baby boomer demographic work well into their 70s before opting for retirement boomers have significant expenses that perhaps they didn t anticipate plus they love their jobs and they re healthy they think what am i going to do for the next 25 years said duxbury advertisement 20 story continues below this advertisement has

aging parents many also find themselves sandwiched in between paying for their parents while also supporting their millennial children who have returned to the family home the millennials can t afford to leave their parents homes because they don t have the opportunity or means to do so but their parents can t afford to retire which would open spaces in the workforce for millennials because they are still supporting those kids at home it is a problem that the boomers aren t leaving that s absolutely true said duxbury so what comes next the awakening of the millennial tectonic plates are beginning to shift advertisement 21 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content that s the opinion at least of karen foster assistant professor at dalhousie university and canada research chair in sustainable rural futures for atlantic canada one of foster s areas of expertise is in researching generational divisions at work she said there is no doubt millennials are upset and that their complaints have been falling on deaf ears however one of the larger issues that millennials are facing is a growing wealth gap between themselves and older generations due to the fact that major life milestones have been delayed investments in real estate or other financial transactions aren t yielding the same return for the younger generation foster said sure property values have skyrocketed for older generations who bought when prices were affordable and have been hanging onto the property but the millennial who just purchased is seeing bigger mortgages than ever before and interest rates that are steadily rising advertisement 22 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content critics of millennial concerns have often pointed out that are next in line to inherit massive amounts of wealth that has been accumulated by their aging parents in fact between 2016 and 2026 the largest wealth transfer in history is expected to take place as older generations pass on as much as 1 trillion to younger generations in canada according to toronto based research firm strategic insight but foster pointed out one critical problem with the upcoming windfall the expected transfer of wealth will only benefit those people who come from families that are already wealthy it will also affect people from major canadian cities where property prices have been steadily rising in a much different way than those people from less populated towns if your family is from somewhere such as moncton n b moose jaw sask or sudbury ont you won t see the same windfall when it comes time to collect an inheritance advertisement 23 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content people who are set to inherit money from their parents or in a sense have been inheriting it their whole lives through various kinds of support that s where the real inequality happens she said adding that millennials are looking to completely upend the status quo that really comes down to a restructuring of the tax system we need to be taxing wealth and high incomes and corporate profits more in order to redistribute wealth across the demographics foster predicts that millennials are likely to push for things such as increased estate taxes in order to ensure that some of the wealth that is transferred from older generations is redistributed throughout all of society the idea is being spearheaded in the united states by recently elected democrat congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez ocasio cortez who at 29 is also a millennial is lobbying for the introduction of a tax on the wealthiest americans in the country she believes that every dollar of income over 10 million should be taxed at 70 per cent advertisement 24 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content there will of course be pushback to that idea it s been panned by the audience at the world economic forum in davos switzerland as recently as last week with attendees including michael dell founder of dell technologies and microsoft corp founder bill gates expressing objections the call for higher estate taxes in canada was recently reinforced in a study released by the canadian centre for policy alternatives ccpa you d expect canada s tax regime would try to counteract this concentration of wealth at the very top where it s needed the least but in fact federal policies encourage it said the centre s senior economist david macdonald in a release canada is the only country in the g7 without an inheritance estate or gift tax on tremendous family wealth advertisement 25 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the ccpa s report said canada s wealthiest families saw their net worth grow on average by 37 per cent between 2012 and 2016 middle class families saw their net worth grow by only 16 per cent during the same time frame the study calls for high estate taxes eliminating tax preferences for capital gains and dividend income in a bid to better distribute wealth across demographics that may sound like a scary scenario to older generations who have amassed wealth throughout their lifetimes and typically been more conservative when it comes to political fiscal policies but for the millennial generation it s only the tip of the iceberg bring the big government according to abacus data millennials are looking to government to take big steps to fix their problems this generation is more comfortable with big interventionist government than allowing market forces to play their part surveys suggest many millennials truly believe that the economic system that has been in place for hundreds of years fails to work for them advertisement 26 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the company s research suggests that millennials clearly prioritize increased government spending over balanced budgets in order to tackle issues such as alleviating income inequality they believe corporations don t pay their fair share of taxes and that government has a big role to play in redistributing that money having lived through the 2008 financial crisis and a rise in housing costs many are outright skeptical of the free market when asked to indicate if they lean more towards one perspective or the other only 46 per cent suggested that capitalism is the best economic model we have while 54 per cent believe canada would be better off with a more socialist system reads an abacus data survey released last year perhaps the most pertinent fact millennials are now the largest block of voters in the country and have the ability to swing an election toward the party or platform of their choice provided the generation gets out the vote so far they have remained relatively quiet in most elections politicians aren t talking about issues that they care about they aren t very compelling they aren t giving them a reason to get engaged said abacus s coletto millennials are unique from previous generations particularly the boomers and those who came before the boomers in that voting is not considered a duty we don t do it because we have to we do it because we have a reason to reasons seem to be emerging according to elections canada 38 8 per cent of eligible voters between the ages of 18 and 24 years of age voted in the 2011 federal election of those between 25 and 34 years of age 45 1 per cent cast their ballot by comparison a total of 64 5 per cent of canadians between the ages of 45 and 54 voted in that election when it came to canadians between the ages of 65 and 74 a total of 75 1 per cent of eligible voters participated the federal election in 2015 saw better turnout by millennials more than 57 1 per cent of eligible voters between 18 and 24 years of age cast a ballot the number was similar in the 25 through 34 year old age group where 57 4 per cent of eligible voters participated one of the big issues during the 2015 election was the liberal party s promise to legalize cannabis sales in canada which is something that appeals specifically to the millennial

afford to retire which would open spaces in the workforce for millennials because they are still supporting those kids at home it is a problem that the boomers aren t leaving that s absolutely true said duxbury so what comes next the awakening of the millennial tectonic plates are beginning to shift advertisement 21 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content that s the opinion at least of karen foster assistant professor at dalhousie university and canada research chair in sustainable rural futures for atlantic canada one of foster s areas of expertise is in researching generational divisions at work she said there is no doubt millennials are upset and that their complaints have been falling on deaf ears however one of the larger issues that millennials are facing is a growing wealth gap between themselves and older generations due to the fact that major life milestones have been delayed investments in real estate or other financial transactions aren t yielding the same return for the younger generation foster said sure property values have skyrocketed for older generations who bought when prices were affordable and have been hanging onto the property but the millennial who just purchased is seeing bigger mortgages than ever before and interest rates that are steadily rising advertisement 22 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content critics of millennial concerns have often pointed out that are next in line to inherit massive amounts of wealth that has been accumulated by their aging parents in fact between 2016 and 2026 the largest wealth transfer in history is expected to take place as older generations pass on as much as 1 trillion to younger generations in canada according to toronto based research firm strategic insight but foster pointed out one critical problem with the upcoming windfall the expected transfer of wealth will only benefit those people who come from families that are already wealthy it will also affect people from major canadian cities where property prices have been steadily rising in a much different way than those people from less populated towns if your family is from somewhere such as moncton n b moose jaw sask or sudbury ont you won t see the same windfall when it comes time to collect an inheritance advertisement 23 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content people who are set to inherit money from their parents or in a sense have been inheriting it their whole lives through various kinds of support that s where the real inequality happens she said adding that millennials are looking to completely upend the status quo that really comes down to a restructuring of the tax system we need to be taxing wealth and high incomes and corporate profits more in order to redistribute wealth across the demographics foster predicts that millennials are likely to push for things such as increased estate taxes in order to ensure that some of the wealth that is transferred from older generations is redistributed throughout all of society the idea is being spearheaded in the united states by recently elected democrat congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez ocasio cortez who at 29 is also a millennial is lobbying for the introduction of a tax on the wealthiest americans in the country she believes that every dollar of income over 10 million should be taxed at 70 per cent advertisement 24

economic forum in davos switzerland as recently as last week with attendees including michael dell founder of dell technologies and microsoft corp founder bill gates expressing objections the call for higher estate taxes in canada was recently reinforced in a study released by the canadian centre for policy alternatives ccpa you d expect canada s tax regime would try to counteract this concentration of wealth at the very top where it s needed the least but in fact federal policies encourage it said the centre s senior economist david macdonald in a release canada is the only country in the g7 without an inheritance estate or gift tax on tremendous family wealth advertisement 25 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the ccpa s report said canada s wealthiest families saw their net worth grow on average by 37 per cent between 2012 and 2016 middle class families saw their net worth grow by only 16 per cent during the same time frame the study calls for high estate taxes eliminating tax preferences for capital gains and dividend income in a bid to better distribute wealth across demographics that may sound like a scary scenario to older generations who have amassed wealth throughout their lifetimes and typically been more conservative when it comes to political fiscal policies but for the millennial generation it s only the tip of the iceberg bring the big government according to abacus data millennials are looking to government to take big steps to fix their problems this generation is more comfortable with big interventionist government than allowing market forces to play their part surveys suggest many millennials truly believe that the economic system that has been in place for hundreds of years fails to work for them advertisement 26 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the company s research suggests that millennials clearly prioritize increased government spending over balanced budgets in order to tackle issues such as alleviating income inequality they believe corporations don t pay their fair share of taxes and that government has a big role to play in redistributing that money having lived through the 2008 financial crisis and a rise in housing costs many are outright skeptical of the free market when asked to indicate if they lean more towards one perspective or the other only 46 per cent suggested that capitalism is the best economic model we have while 54 per cent believe canada would be better off with a more socialist system reads an abacus data survey released last year perhaps the most pertinent fact millennials are now the largest block of voters in the country and have the ability to swing an election toward the party or platform of their choice provided the generation gets out the vote so far they have remained relatively quiet in most elections politicians aren t talking about issues that they care about they aren t very compelling they aren t giving them a reason to get engaged said abacus s coletto millennials are unique from previous generations particularly the boomers and those who came before the boomers in that voting is not considered a duty we don t do it because we have to we do it because we have a reason to reasons seem to be emerging according to elections canada 38 8 per cent of eligible voters between the ages of 18 and 24 years of age voted in the 2011 federal election of those between 25 and 34 years of age 45 1 per cent cast their ballot by comparison a total of 64 5 per cent of canadians between the ages of 45 and 54 voted in that election when it came to canadians between the ages of 65 and 74 a total of 75 1 per cent of eligible voters participated the federal election in 2015 saw better turnout by millennials more than 57 1 per cent of eligible voters between 18 and 24 years of age cast a ballot the number was similar in the 25 through 34 year old age group where 57 4 per cent of eligible voters participated one of the big issues during the 2015 election was the liberal party s promise to legalize cannabis sales in canada which is something that appeals specifically to the millennial generation s interests more than 60 per cent of canadians between the ages of 18 and 34 supported legalizing cannabis according to a study released by nrg research group and peak communicators in march 2017 photo by chris young the canadian press it s expected that more politicians will be looking to woo the millennial vote heading into october s federal election last week finance minister bill morneau said the federal government is looking at ways to make housing purchases more affordable for millennials in the months ahead he called the issue a priority but didn t elaborate ndp leader jagmeet singh has said his party would propose measures to help build as many as 500 000 affordable housing units across the country if elected with more politicians tuning into the fact that the millennial generation will vote for political platforms that speak to their agenda the 18 through 35 demographic looks as though it will soon find itself in an unfamiliar position instead of taking a back seat while older generations plot the course millennials are poised to grab the wheel and take a drastic detour it hasn t boiled over yet but the pot is starting to get warm said coletto there are more millennials than there are boomers more millennials are eligible to vote than any other generation more politicians are mindful of the shift that millennials could bring meanwhile barrett is taking things in stride i ve seen a fair amount of challenges our generation may seem to think

generation is really really stuck in many ways said benjamin tal managing director and deputy chief economist at cibc this is really the story of this cohort we have a situation where housing is much more expensive so they have to compromise on either renting or they have to switch to condominiums or smart houses or they might buy a car and stay with their parents in the 1960s census data suggest as few as eight per cent of canadians ages 18 to 35 were living with parents today as has been well documented those numbers have skyrocketed come 2016 a total of 34 7 per cent of canadians between

that is helping them is their parents said tal from the cibc the education system basically failed them they are highly educated but they are not educated in what s relevant there is a mismatch between the skills that they have and what the economy needs and therefore you have many people underemployed and or trying to compromise advertisement 9 story continues below this advertisement has

up the most highly educated generation ever produced more than 3 5 million canadians between the ages of 20 and 34 reported having some sort of post secondary education including bachelor degrees and post graduate certificates and diplomas in the 2016 census but the degree by itself isn t proving to be enough it s not an option about whether or not they re going to have an education that s like an invitation card to the party said carleton university s linda duxbury a professor in management sciences at the sprott school of business who specializes in demographic trends she s also a member of

situation like an arms race for qualifications to set a candidate apart from their competitors so they can land a good job and start their lives the problem is the process is forcing them to put their actual life on hold the thing about this generation is that everything is delayed said duxbury they stay in school longer they get married later if you start comparing the average age of marriage the average age of their first kid the average age of their first permanent full time job it s also forcing those within the generation to compete with one another in ways that are specifically benefitting employers with so much talent available competition for available entry levels jobs is fierce this allows employers to pay less for the workers they need some are even getting away with not paying their employees at all advertisement 11 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content according to the canadian federation of students as many as 300 000 millennials were working in unpaid internships in a bid to further their careers by collecting relevant on the job experience in 2016 the issue with unpaid internships is that most millennials in those jobs are also working in another position likely one that pays minimum wage in order to make ends meet according to the cfs the organization which lobbies on behalf of students also pointed to statistics canada data that shows in 1997 the first year that wage data was collected only 640 000 canadians were making the minimum wage or less in 2017 that number sat at 1 02 million almost double the number previously recorded further compounding the issues facing the millennials is the steady drop in government support offered to post secondary institutions according to the cfs government provided more than 80 per cent of university operating revenues in 1982 that figure fell below 60 per cent in 2012 the most recent year for which statistics are available the cfs says government support has continued to fall in more recent years advertisement 12 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content as government support has decreased students have been forced to shoulder more of the financial burden when obtaining their education that has led to students exiting post secondary institutions with record amounts of debt using data from statistics canada the cfs said that average student debt levels have increased more than 40 per cent between 1999 and 2012 those levels have continued to climb in more recent years the increased cost of education at a time when obtaining a degree has never been more important is another hot button issue for millennials the underemployed generation

postmedia it s tough and competitive she said even for a lot of the programs you are looking at applying to to get an actual career the amount of hours of experience you need for example the physician assistant program that i applied to it s only offered by three universities in canada and i couldn t apply to the third which is the university of toronto because they require almost 1 000 hours of health care experience so where am i supposed to get that hypothetically what i m doing now could count but most people applying to that it s their second career they re going to be older in america where numbers are more readily available underemployment held steady at around 33 per cent of all post secondary graduates between the 1980s and 2010 advertisement 15 story continues below this

of government in ensuring that all individuals have access to similar economic opportunities he said abacus s coletto is seeing signs that the trend exists here in canada too one of the key indicators of underemployment is wages which would be reflected in the rise of minimum wage workers but the other big indicator is the benefits offered by employers self employed people largely don t have access to benefits people making minimum wage get a minimum amount of benefits from their employers only 55 per cent of millennials have access to a prescription drug plan 53 per cent to dental insurance 36

for that demographic were at 46 700 in 1980 and had jumped to 54 700 by 2016 an 8 000 increase the millennial salary stagnation is also happening at a time when benefits such as dental care and defined benefit pension plans are being pared back or even eliminated by employers giving those older generations an even bigger financial leg up laziness isn t the culprit here millennials are working and working hard in fact they re actually participating in the labour force more and by some measures working harder than previous generations did in 1980 78 9 per cent of all canadians

million people now in the millennial generation accounting for 27 5 per cent of canada s population that sheer size makes them the largest generational demographic in the country it also suggests there are more people between the ages of 18 and 35 working in the labour force today than ever before still there seem to be major hurdles in their path play for the home team housing was the top issue cited by millennials in six surveys done by abacus last year coletto says of those who don t own a home currently 86 per cent want to he said in 1980 the average price of a house in canada was

generation is really really stuck in many ways said benjamin tal managing director and deputy chief economist at cibc this is really the story of this cohort we have a situation where housing is much more expensive so they have to compromise on either renting or they have to switch to condominiums or smart houses or they might buy a car and stay with their parents in the 1960s census data suggest as few as eight per cent of canadians ages 18 to 35 were living with parents today as has been well documented those numbers have skyrocketed come 2016 a total of 34 7 per cent of canadians between the ages of 20 and 34 were living at home with their parents that s as many as 3 5 million canadians the highest number recorded to that point and ontario had the highest percentage of millennials still living at home 42 1 per cent advertisement 8 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the situation hasn t necessarily changed aspirations though last year 94 per cent of the millennials living at home or with family planned to buy a home a cibc survey found how will they do it a national survey by hsbc bank of canada released in 2017 found 37 per cent of millennials who have purchased a home received some of the money for the purchase from their parents the education system basically failed them the only thing that is helping them is their parents said tal from the cibc the education system basically failed them they are highly educated but they are not educated in what s relevant there is a mismatch between the skills that they have and what the economy needs and therefore you have many people underemployed and or trying to compromise advertisement 9 story continues below this advertisement has

up the most highly educated generation ever produced more than 3 5 million canadians between the ages of 20 and 34 reported having some sort of post secondary education including bachelor degrees and post graduate certificates and diplomas in the 2016 census but the degree by itself isn t proving to be enough it s not an option about whether or not they re going to have an education that s like an invitation card to the party said carleton university s linda duxbury a professor in management sciences at the sprott school of business who specializes in demographic trends she s also a member of the baby boomer generation people who are now 54 to 73 years of age advertisement 10 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content you don t have the skills you don t have post graduate education today be it college or university you aren t even going to be looked at photo by darren brown ottawa citizen duxbury described the situation like an arms race for qualifications to set a candidate apart from their competitors so they can land a good job and start their lives the problem is the process is forcing them to put their actual life on hold the thing about this generation is that everything is delayed said duxbury they stay in school longer they get married later if you start comparing the average age of marriage the average age of their first kid the average age of their first permanent full time job it s also forcing those within the generation to compete with one another in ways that are specifically benefitting employers with so much talent available competition for available entry levels jobs is fierce this allows employers to pay less for the workers they need some are even getting away with not paying their employees at all advertisement 11 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content according to the canadian federation of students as many as 300 000 millennials were working in unpaid internships in a bid to further their careers by collecting relevant on the job experience in 2016 the issue with unpaid internships is that most millennials in those jobs are also working in another position likely one that pays minimum wage in order to make ends meet according to the cfs the organization which lobbies on behalf of students also pointed to statistics canada data that shows in 1997 the first year that wage data was collected only 640 000 canadians were making the minimum wage or less in 2017 that number sat at 1 02 million almost double the number previously recorded further compounding the issues facing the millennials is the steady drop in government support offered to post secondary institutions according to the cfs government provided more than 80 per cent of university operating revenues in 1982 that figure fell below 60 per cent in 2012 the most recent year for which statistics are available the cfs says government support has continued to fall in more recent years advertisement 12 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content as government support has decreased students have been forced to shoulder more of the financial burden when obtaining their education that has led to students exiting post secondary institutions with record amounts of debt using data from statistics canada the cfs said that average student debt levels have increased more than 40 per cent between 1999 and 2012 those levels have continued to climb in more recent years the increased cost of education at a time when obtaining a degree has never been more important is another hot button issue for millennials the underemployed generation underemployment a term used to describe people who are overqualified for the positions they find themselves in is also rising rapidly advertisement 13 story continues below this advertisement has not

no getting anywhere with just a bachelor of science anymore she said i graduated i played varsity hockey at dalhousie university academic all canadian all five years i was there i had a good gpa that

postmedia it s tough and competitive she said even for a lot of the programs you are looking at applying to to get an actual career the amount of hours of experience you need for example the physician assistant program that i applied to it s only offered by three universities in canada and i couldn t apply to the third which is the university of toronto because they require almost 1 000 hours of health care experience so where am i supposed to get that hypothetically what i m doing now could count but most people applying to that it s their second career they re going to be older in america where numbers are more readily available underemployment held steady at around 33 per cent of all post secondary graduates between the 1980s and 2010 advertisement 15 story continues below this

has become more entrenched as lower income ontarians are increasingly staying in low income and higher income ontarians are increasingly staying in high income said peter weltman the province s financial accountability officer in a report released thursday he highlighted significant structural changes in ontario s economy and labour market including a rise in part time and temporary work

of government in ensuring that all individuals have access to similar economic opportunities he said abacus s coletto is seeing signs that the trend exists here in canada too one of the key indicators of underemployment is wages which would be reflected in the rise of minimum wage workers but the other big indicator is the benefits offered by employers self employed people largely don t have access to benefits people making minimum wage get a minimum amount of benefits from their employers only 55 per cent of millennials have access to a prescription drug plan 53 per cent to dental insurance 36 per cent to an rrsp and only 29 per cent to an employer provided pension plan according to a recent study released by abacus data advertisement 17 story continues below this advertisement has not

rather have someone coming in with the credentials then they would training somebody who is currently working for them my father when he came back from the war had a grade 12 education when he retired he was vice president at 3m why because there was a different attitude then is it harder to buy a home yes are we taking on higher student debt yes have we been trained and educated in the wrong things many of us yes said abacus s coletto we ve been raised around these expectations go do what you want to do the world is your oyster dream big those expectations were set quite high when you enter a world where it s not possible to achieve the things that your parents and your teachers and society has been saying is going to be there it creates further tension advertisement 19 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content baby boomers won t go can t go the tension is being compounded by the baby boomer generation s refusal to leave the workforce if the millennials are stuck in a bottleneck fighting for career advancement right now the baby boomers are acting like a cork preventing any movement whereas the age 65 was once marked by a person s announcing their retirement today s senior citizens are opting to soldier on the idea of freedom at 55 seems long forgotten extended life spans better health and in some cases continued financial responsibilities are seeing many people in the baby boomer demographic work well into their 70s before opting for retirement boomers have significant expenses that perhaps they didn t anticipate plus they love their jobs and they re healthy they think what am i going to do for the next 25 years said duxbury advertisement 20 story continues below this advertisement has

aging parents many also find themselves sandwiched in between paying for their parents while also supporting their millennial children who have returned to the family home the millennials can t afford to leave their parents homes because they don t have the opportunity or means to do so but their parents can t afford to retire which would open spaces in the workforce for millennials because they are still supporting those kids at home it is a problem that the boomers aren t leaving that s absolutely true said duxbury so what comes next the awakening of the millennial tectonic plates are beginning to shift advertisement 21 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content that s the opinion at least of karen foster assistant professor at dalhousie university and canada research chair in sustainable rural futures for atlantic canada one of foster s areas of expertise is in researching generational divisions at work she said there is no doubt millennials are upset and that their complaints have been falling on deaf ears however one of the larger issues that millennials are facing is a growing wealth gap between themselves and older generations due to the fact that major life milestones have been delayed investments in real estate or other financial transactions aren t yielding the same return for the younger generation foster said sure property values have skyrocketed for older generations who bought when prices were affordable and have been hanging onto the property but the millennial who just purchased is seeing bigger mortgages than ever before and interest rates that are steadily rising advertisement 22 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content critics of millennial concerns have often pointed out that are next in line to inherit massive amounts of wealth that has been accumulated by their aging parents in fact between 2016 and 2026 the largest wealth transfer in history is expected to take place as older generations pass on as much as 1 trillion to younger generations in canada according to toronto based research firm strategic insight but foster pointed out one critical problem with the upcoming windfall the expected transfer of wealth will only benefit those people who come from families that are already wealthy it will also affect people from major canadian cities where property prices have been steadily rising in a much different way than those people from less populated towns if your family is from somewhere such as moncton n b moose jaw sask or sudbury ont you won t see the same windfall when it comes time to collect an inheritance advertisement 23 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content people who are set to inherit money from their parents or in a sense have been inheriting it their whole lives through various kinds of support that s where the real inequality happens she said adding that millennials are looking to completely upend the status quo that really comes down to a restructuring of the tax system we need to be taxing wealth and high incomes and corporate profits more in order to redistribute wealth across the demographics foster predicts that millennials are likely to push for things such as increased estate taxes in order to ensure that some of the wealth that is transferred from older generations is redistributed throughout all of society the idea is being spearheaded in the united states by recently elected democrat congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez ocasio cortez who at 29 is also a millennial is lobbying for the introduction of a tax on the wealthiest americans in the country she believes that every dollar of income over 10 million should be taxed at 70 per cent advertisement 24 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content there will of course be pushback to that idea it s been panned by the audience at the world economic forum in davos switzerland as recently as last week with attendees including michael dell founder of dell technologies and microsoft corp founder bill gates expressing objections the call for higher estate taxes in canada was recently reinforced in a study released by the canadian centre for policy alternatives ccpa you d expect canada s tax regime would try to counteract this concentration of wealth at the very top where it s needed the least but in fact federal policies encourage it said the centre s senior economist david macdonald in a release canada is the only country in the g7 without an inheritance estate or gift tax on tremendous family wealth advertisement 25 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the ccpa s report said canada s wealthiest families saw their net worth grow on average by 37 per cent between 2012 and 2016 middle class families saw their net worth grow by only 16 per cent during the same time frame the study calls for high estate taxes eliminating tax preferences for capital gains and dividend income in a bid to better distribute wealth across demographics that may sound like a scary scenario to older generations who have amassed wealth throughout their lifetimes and typically been more conservative when it comes to political fiscal policies but for the millennial generation it s only the tip of the iceberg bring the big government according to abacus data millennials are looking to government to take big steps to fix their problems this generation is more comfortable with big interventionist government than allowing market forces to play their part surveys suggest many millennials truly believe that the economic system that has been in place for hundreds of years fails to work for them advertisement 26 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the company s research suggests that millennials clearly prioritize increased government spending over balanced budgets in order to tackle issues such as alleviating income inequality they believe corporations don t pay their fair share of taxes and that government has a big role to play in redistributing that money having lived through the 2008 financial crisis and a rise in housing costs many are outright skeptical of the free market when asked to indicate if they lean more towards one perspective or the other only 46 per cent suggested that capitalism is the best economic model we have while 54 per cent believe canada would be better off with a more socialist system reads an abacus data survey released last year perhaps the most pertinent fact millennials are now the largest block of voters in the country and have the ability to swing an election toward the party or platform of their choice provided the generation gets out the vote so far they have remained relatively quiet in most elections politicians aren t talking about issues that they care about they aren t very compelling they aren t giving them a reason to get engaged said abacus s coletto millennials are unique from previous generations particularly the boomers and those who came before the boomers in that voting is not considered a duty we don t do it because we have to we do it because we have a reason to reasons seem to be emerging according to elections canada 38 8 per cent of eligible voters between the ages of 18 and 24 years of age voted in the 2011 federal election of those between 25 and 34 years of age 45 1 per cent cast their ballot by comparison a total of 64 5 per cent of canadians between the ages of 45 and 54 voted in that election when it came to canadians between the ages of 65 and 74 a total of 75 1 per cent of eligible voters participated the federal election in 2015 saw better turnout by millennials more than 57 1 per cent of eligible voters between 18 and 24 years of age cast a ballot the number was similar in the 25 through 34 year old age group where 57 4 per cent of eligible voters participated one of the big issues during the 2015 election was the liberal party s promise to legalize cannabis sales in canada which is something that appeals specifically to the millennial generation s interests more than 60 per cent of canadians between the ages of 18 and 34 supported legalizing cannabis according to a study released by nrg research group and peak communicators in march 2017 photo by chris young the canadian press it s expected that more politicians will be looking to woo the millennial vote heading into october s federal election last week finance minister bill morneau said the federal government is looking at ways to make housing purchases more affordable for millennials in the months ahead he called the issue a priority but didn t elaborate ndp leader jagmeet singh has said his party would propose measures to help build as many as 500 000 affordable housing units across the country if elected with more politicians tuning into the fact that the millennial generation will vote for political platforms that speak to their agenda the 18 through 35 demographic looks as though it will soon find itself in an unfamiliar position instead of taking a back seat while older generations plot the course millennials are poised to grab the wheel and take a drastic detour it hasn t boiled over yet but the pot is starting to get warm said coletto there are more millennials than there are boomers more millennials are eligible to vote than any other generation more politicians are mindful of the shift that millennials could bring meanwhile barrett is taking things in stride i ve seen a fair amount of challenges our generation may seem to think that we go through more but i think that every generation goes through some kind of hardships when it comes to finance or jobs it doesn t make things worthwhile if they re just handed to you it s tough but once you get what you re going for you appreciate it more vpilieci postmedia com also in the

as a new month got underway investors had their second helping of big economic news this week in the form of the government s jobs report for january which came after the fed meeting earlier this week helped boost the market for the second month in a row job creation in the united states blew past expectations with a surge of more than 300 000 new nonfarm payrolls positions a briefing com consensus estimate had forecast a gain of 160 000 jobs in january but the actual figure from the labor department ended up showing a rise of 304 000 advertisement advertisement still there may be some factors that could temper enthusiasm about the bumper report first the 312 000 reading that had exceeded expectations in december was revised down to 222 000 that s still above what wall street was expecting in last month s initial report but it takes some of the shine off also the jobs data that show strength in the economy also point to potentially heightened inflationary pressure which could along with other data prompt the fed to revise its recently taken dovish stance indeed the government said that annual average hourly earnings a key component of inflation increased by 3 2 ahead of the jobs

advertisement advertisement in corporate earnings news friday morning exxon mobil corporation nyse xom shares gained ground after the company reported earnings that beat wall street estimates even as revenue fell short of expectations capex concerns although the u s china trade war has been a market overhang for months now the extent to which the tariff tussle is holding back company executives in terms of making plans may be underrated one notable issue during this earning season has been a relative absence of talk about capital expenditure plans it seems likely that is because of the tariff uncertainty so if the china u s trade dispute gets solved it s a possibility that capex may ramp up while one quarter with a dearth of capex is not too alarming an extended absence of company spending

to be coming from optimism about the fed and strong corporate earnings it s also possible that some companies may have gotten oversold creating what some see as a buying opportunity advertisement

strength for the dollar with the deadline for brexit approaching in march one of the questions that has been hanging over the market is how that might affect britain s economy and that of the european union britain hasn t yet passed a plan for the split while no one knows exactly how a no deal brexit would play out it s arguable that the results wouldn t be good for either economy or at least not as good as they would be in a negotiated divorce if the economies of britain and the eu deteriorate meaningfully as a result of brexit that could weaken their currencies compared with the u s dollar

of government in ensuring that all individuals have access to similar economic opportunities he said abacus s coletto is seeing signs that the trend exists here in canada too one of the key indicators of underemployment is wages which would be reflected in the rise of minimum wage workers but the other big indicator is the benefits offered by employers self employed people largely don t have access to benefits people making minimum wage get a minimum amount of benefits from their employers only 55 per cent of millennials have access to a prescription drug plan 53 per cent to dental insurance 36

he was vice president at 3m why because there was a different attitude then is it harder to buy a home yes are we taking on higher student debt yes have we been trained and educated in the wrong things many of us yes said abacus s coletto we ve been raised around these expectations go do what you want to do the world is your oyster dream big those expectations were set quite high when you enter a world where it s not possible to achieve the things that your parents and your teachers and society has been saying is going to be there it creates further tension advertisement 19 story

refusal to leave the workforce if the millennials are stuck in a bottleneck fighting for career advancement right now the baby boomers are acting like a cork preventing any movement whereas the age 65 was once marked by a person s announcing their retirement today s senior citizens are opting to soldier on the idea of freedom at 55 seems long forgotten extended life spans better health and in some cases continued financial responsibilities are seeing many people in the baby boomer demographic work well into their 70s before opting for retirement boomers have significant expenses that perhaps they didn t anticipate plus they love their jobs and they re healthy they think what am i going to do for the next 25 years said duxbury advertisement 20 story continues below this advertisement has

aging parents many also find themselves sandwiched in between paying for their parents while also supporting their millennial children who have returned to the family home the millennials can t afford to leave their parents homes because they don t have the opportunity or means to do so but their parents can t afford to retire which would open spaces in the workforce for millennials because they are still supporting those kids at home it is a problem that the boomers aren t leaving that s absolutely true said duxbury so what comes next the awakening of the millennial tectonic plates are beginning to shift advertisement 21 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content that s the opinion at least of karen foster assistant professor at dalhousie university and canada research chair in sustainable rural futures for atlantic canada one of foster s areas of expertise is in researching generational divisions at work she said there is no doubt millennials are upset and that their complaints have been falling on deaf ears however one of the larger issues that millennials are facing is a growing wealth gap between themselves and older generations due to the fact that major life milestones have been delayed investments in real estate or other financial transactions aren t yielding the same return for the younger generation foster said sure property values have skyrocketed for older generations who bought when prices were affordable and have been hanging onto the property but the millennial who just purchased is seeing bigger mortgages than ever before and interest rates that are steadily rising advertisement 22 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content critics of millennial concerns have often pointed out that are next in line to inherit massive amounts of wealth that has been accumulated by their aging parents in fact between 2016 and 2026 the largest wealth transfer in history is expected to take place as older generations pass on as much as 1 trillion to younger generations in canada according to toronto based research firm strategic insight but foster pointed out one critical problem with the upcoming windfall the expected transfer of wealth will only benefit those people who come from families that are already wealthy it will also affect people from major canadian cities where property prices have been steadily rising in a much different way than those people from less populated towns if your family is from somewhere such as moncton n b moose jaw sask or sudbury ont you won t see the same windfall when it comes time to collect an inheritance advertisement 23 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content people who are set to inherit money from their parents or in a sense have been inheriting it their whole lives through various kinds of support that s where the real inequality happens she said adding that millennials are looking to completely upend the status quo that really comes down to a restructuring of the tax system we need to be taxing wealth and high incomes and corporate profits more in order to redistribute wealth across the demographics foster predicts that millennials are likely to push for things such as increased estate taxes in order to ensure that some of the wealth that is transferred from older generations is redistributed throughout all of society the idea is being spearheaded in the united states by recently elected democrat congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez ocasio cortez who at 29 is also a millennial is lobbying for the introduction of a tax on the wealthiest americans in the country she believes that every dollar of income over 10 million should be taxed at 70 per cent advertisement 24 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content there will of course be pushback to that idea it s been panned by the audience at the world economic forum in davos switzerland as recently as last week with attendees including michael dell founder of dell technologies and microsoft corp founder bill gates expressing objections the call for higher estate taxes in canada was recently reinforced in a study released by the canadian centre for policy alternatives ccpa you d expect canada s tax regime would try to counteract this concentration of wealth at the very top where it s needed the least but in fact federal policies encourage it said the centre s senior economist david macdonald in a release canada is the only country in the g7 without an inheritance estate or gift tax on tremendous family wealth advertisement 25 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the ccpa s report said canada s wealthiest families saw their net worth grow on average by 37 per cent between 2012 and 2016 middle class families saw their net worth grow by only 16 per cent during the same time frame the study calls for high estate taxes eliminating tax preferences for capital gains and dividend income in a bid to better distribute wealth across demographics that may sound like a scary scenario to older generations who have amassed wealth throughout their lifetimes and typically been more conservative when it comes to political fiscal policies but for the millennial generation it s only the tip of the iceberg bring the big government according to abacus data millennials are looking to government to take big steps to fix their problems this generation is more comfortable with big interventionist government than allowing market forces to play their part surveys suggest many millennials truly believe that the economic system that has been in place for hundreds of years fails to work for them advertisement 26 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the company s research suggests that millennials clearly prioritize increased government spending over balanced budgets in order to tackle issues such as alleviating income inequality they believe corporations don t pay their fair share of taxes and that government has a big role to play in redistributing that money having lived through the 2008 financial crisis and a rise in housing costs many are outright skeptical of the free market when asked to indicate if they lean more towards one perspective or the other only 46 per cent suggested that capitalism is the best economic model we have while 54 per cent believe canada would be better off with a more socialist system reads an abacus data survey released last year perhaps the most pertinent fact millennials are now the largest block of voters in the country and have the ability to swing an election toward the party or platform of their choice provided the generation gets out the vote so far they have remained relatively quiet in most elections politicians aren t talking about issues that they care about they aren t very compelling they aren t giving them a reason to get engaged said abacus s coletto millennials are unique from previous generations particularly the boomers and those who came before the boomers in that voting is not considered a duty we don t do it because we have to we do it because we have a reason to reasons seem to be emerging according to elections canada 38 8 per cent of eligible voters between the ages of 18 and 24 years of age voted in the 2011 federal election of those between 25 and 34 years of age 45 1 per cent cast their ballot by comparison a total of 64 5 per cent of canadians between the ages of 45 and 54 voted in that election when it came to canadians between the ages of 65 and 74 a total of 75 1 per cent of eligible voters participated the federal election in 2015 saw better turnout by millennials more than 57 1 per cent of eligible voters between 18 and 24 years of age cast a ballot the number was similar in the 25 through 34 year old age group where 57 4 per cent of eligible voters participated one of the big issues during the 2015 election was the liberal party s promise to legalize cannabis sales in canada which is something that appeals specifically to the millennial generation s interests more than 60 per cent of canadians between the ages of 18 and 34 supported legalizing cannabis according to a study released by nrg research group and peak communicators in march 2017 photo by chris young the canadian press it s expected that more politicians will be looking to woo the millennial vote heading into october s federal election last week finance minister bill morneau said the federal government is looking at ways to make housing purchases more affordable for millennials in the months ahead he called the issue a priority but didn t elaborate ndp leader jagmeet singh has said his party would propose measures to help build as many as 500 000 affordable housing units across the country if elected with more politicians tuning into the fact that the millennial generation will vote for political platforms that speak to their agenda the 18 through 35 demographic looks as though it will soon find itself in an unfamiliar position instead of taking a back seat while older generations plot the course millennials are poised to grab the wheel and take a drastic detour it hasn t boiled over yet but the pot is starting to get warm said coletto there are more millennials than there are boomers more millennials are eligible to vote than any other generation more politicians are mindful of the shift that millennials could bring meanwhile barrett is

preferences for capital gains and dividend income in a bid to better distribute wealth across demographics that may sound like a scary scenario to older generations who have amassed wealth throughout their lifetimes and typically been more conservative when it comes to political fiscal policies but for the millennial generation it s only the tip of the iceberg bring the big government according to abacus data millennials are looking to government to take big steps to fix their problems this generation is more comfortable with big interventionist government than allowing market forces to play their part surveys suggest many millennials truly believe that the economic system that has been in place for hundreds of years fails to work for them advertisement 26 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the company s research suggests that millennials clearly prioritize increased government spending over balanced budgets in order to tackle issues such as alleviating income inequality they believe corporations don t pay their fair share of taxes and that government has a big role to play in redistributing that money having lived through the 2008 financial crisis and a rise in housing costs many are outright skeptical of the free market when asked to indicate if they lean more towards one perspective or the other only 46 per cent suggested that capitalism is the best economic model we have while 54 per cent believe canada would be better off with a more socialist system reads an abacus data survey released last year perhaps the most pertinent fact millennials are now the largest block of voters in the country and have the ability to swing an election toward the party or platform of their choice provided the generation gets out the vote so far they have remained relatively quiet in most elections politicians aren t talking about issues that they care about they aren t very compelling they aren t giving them a reason to get engaged said abacus s coletto millennials are unique from previous generations particularly the boomers and those who came before the boomers in that voting is not considered a duty we don t do it because we have to we do it because we have a reason to reasons seem to be emerging according to elections canada 38 8 per cent of eligible voters between the ages of 18 and 24 years of age voted in the 2011 federal election of those between 25 and 34 years of age 45 1 per cent cast their ballot by comparison a total of 64 5 per cent of canadians between the ages of 45 and 54 voted in that election when it came to canadians between the ages of 65 and 74 a total of 75 1 per cent of eligible voters participated the federal election in 2015 saw better turnout by millennials more than 57 1 per cent of eligible voters between 18 and 24 years of age cast a ballot the number was similar in the 25 through 34 year old age group where 57 4 per cent of eligible voters participated one of the big issues during the 2015 election was the liberal party s promise to legalize cannabis sales in canada which is something that appeals specifically to the millennial generation s interests more than 60 per cent of canadians between the ages of 18 and 34 supported legalizing cannabis according to a study released by nrg research group and peak communicators in march 2017 photo by chris young the canadian press it s expected that more politicians will be looking to woo the millennial vote heading into october s federal election last week finance minister bill morneau said the federal government is looking at ways to make housing purchases more affordable for millennials in the months ahead he called the issue a priority but didn t elaborate ndp leader jagmeet singh has said his party would propose measures to help build as many as 500 000 affordable housing units across the country if elected with more politicians tuning into the fact that the millennial generation will vote for political platforms that speak to their agenda the 18 through 35 demographic looks as though it will soon find itself in an unfamiliar position instead of taking a back seat while older generations plot the course millennials are poised to grab the wheel and take a drastic detour it hasn t boiled over yet but the pot is starting to get warm said coletto there are more millennials than there are boomers more millennials are eligible to vote than any other generation more politicians are mindful of the shift that millennials could bring meanwhile barrett is

more expensive so they have to compromise on either renting or they have to switch to condominiums or smart houses or they might buy a car and stay with their parents in the 1960s census data suggest as few as eight per cent of canadians ages 18 to 35 were living with parents today as has been well documented those numbers have skyrocketed come 2016 a total of 34 7 per cent of canadians between

that is helping them is their parents said tal from the cibc the education system basically failed them they are highly educated but they are not educated in what s relevant there is a mismatch

post graduate certificates and diplomas in the 2016 census but the degree by itself isn t proving to be enough it s not an option about whether or not they re going to have an education that s like an invitation card to the party said carleton university s linda duxbury a professor in management sciences at the sprott school of business who specializes in demographic trends she s also a member of

situation like an arms race for qualifications to set a candidate apart from their competitors so they can land a good job and start their lives the problem is the process is forcing them to put their actual life on hold the thing about this generation is that everything is delayed said duxbury they stay in school longer they get married later if you start comparing the average age of marriage the average age of their first kid the average age of their first permanent full time job it s also forcing those within the generation to compete with one another in ways that are specifically benefitting employers with so much talent available competition for available entry levels jobs is fierce this allows employers to pay less for the workers they need some are even getting away with not paying their employees at all advertisement 11 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content according to the canadian federation of students as many as 300 000 millennials were working in unpaid internships in a bid to further their careers by collecting relevant on the job experience in 2016 the issue with unpaid internships is that most millennials in those jobs are also working in another position likely one that pays minimum wage in order to make ends meet according to the cfs the organization which lobbies on behalf of students also pointed to statistics canada data that shows in 1997 the first year that wage data was collected only 640 000 canadians were making the minimum wage or less in 2017 that number sat at 1 02 million almost double the number previously recorded further compounding the issues facing the millennials is the steady drop in government support offered to post secondary institutions according to the cfs government provided more than 80 per cent of university operating revenues in 1982 that figure fell below 60 per cent in 2012 the most recent year for which statistics are available the cfs says government support has continued to fall in more recent years advertisement 12 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content as

record amounts of debt using data from statistics canada the cfs said that average student debt levels have increased more than 40 per cent between 1999 and 2012 those levels have continued to climb

canadian centre for policy alternatives ccpa you d expect canada s tax regime would try to counteract this concentration of wealth at the very top where it s needed the least but in fact federal policies encourage it said the centre s senior economist david macdonald in a release canada is the only country in the g7 without an inheritance estate or gift tax on tremendous family wealth advertisement 25 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the ccpa s report said canada s wealthiest families saw their net worth grow on average by 37 per cent between 2012 and 2016 middle class families saw their net worth grow by only 16 per cent during the same time frame the study calls for high estate taxes eliminating tax preferences for capital gains and dividend income in a bid to better distribute wealth across demographics that may sound like a scary scenario to older generations who have amassed wealth throughout their lifetimes and typically been more conservative when it comes to political fiscal policies but for the millennial generation it s only the tip of the iceberg bring the big government according to abacus data millennials are looking to government to take big steps to fix their problems this generation is more comfortable with big interventionist government than allowing market forces to play their part surveys suggest many millennials truly believe that the economic system that has been in place for hundreds of years fails to work for them advertisement 26 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the company s research suggests that millennials clearly prioritize increased government spending over balanced budgets in order to tackle issues such as alleviating income inequality they believe corporations don t pay their fair share of taxes and that government has a big role to play in redistributing that money having lived through the 2008 financial crisis and a rise in housing costs many are outright skeptical of the free market when asked to indicate if they lean more towards one perspective or the other only 46 per cent suggested that capitalism is the best economic model we have while 54 per cent believe canada would be better off with a more socialist system reads an abacus data survey released last year perhaps the most pertinent fact millennials are now the largest block of voters in the country and have the ability to swing an election toward the party or platform of their choice provided the generation gets out the vote so far they have remained relatively quiet in most elections politicians aren t talking about issues that they care about they aren t very compelling they aren t giving them a reason to get engaged said abacus s coletto millennials are unique from previous generations particularly the boomers and those who came before the boomers in that voting is not considered a duty we don t do it because we have to we do it because we have a reason to reasons seem to be emerging according to elections canada 38 8 per cent of eligible voters between the ages of 18 and 24 years of age voted in the 2011 federal election of those between 25 and 34 years of age 45 1 per cent cast their ballot by comparison a total of 64 5 per cent of canadians between the ages of 45 and 54 voted in that election when it came to canadians between the ages of 65 and 74 a total of 75 1 per cent of eligible voters participated the federal election in 2015 saw better turnout by millennials more than 57 1 per cent of eligible voters between 18 and 24 years of age cast a ballot the number was similar in the 25 through 34 year old age group where 57 4 per cent of eligible voters participated one of the big issues during the 2015 election was the liberal party s promise to legalize cannabis sales in canada which is something that appeals specifically to the millennial generation s interests more than 60 per cent of canadians between the ages of 18 and 34 supported legalizing cannabis according to a study released by nrg research group and peak communicators in march 2017 photo by chris young the canadian press it s expected that more politicians will be looking to woo the millennial vote heading into october s federal election last week finance minister bill morneau said the federal government is looking at ways to make housing purchases more affordable for millennials in the months ahead he called the issue a priority but didn t elaborate ndp leader jagmeet singh has said his party would propose measures to help build as many as 500 000 affordable housing units across the country if elected with more politicians tuning into the fact that the millennial generation will vote for political platforms that speak to their agenda the 18 through 35 demographic looks as though it will soon find itself in an unfamiliar position instead of taking a back seat while older generations plot the course millennials are poised to grab the wheel and take a drastic detour it hasn t boiled over yet but the pot is starting to get warm said coletto there are more millennials than there are boomers more millennials are eligible to vote than any other generation more politicians are mindful of the shift that millennials could bring meanwhile barrett is taking things in stride i ve seen a fair amount of challenges our generation may seem to think that we go through more but i think that every generation goes through some kind of hardships when it comes to finance or jobs it doesn t make things worthwhile if they re just handed to you it s tough but once you get what you re going for you appreciate it more vpilieci postmedia com also in the

by a major question remains unanswered when it comes to the state of main street not just here but across the planet if the global economy really is booming as many politicians claim why are leaders and their parties around the world continuing to get booted out of office in such a sweeping fashion one obvious answer the post great recession economic recovery was largely reserved for the few who could participate in the rising financial markets of those years not the majority who continued to work longer hours sometimes at multiple jobs to stay afloat in other words the good times have left out so many people like those struggling to keep even a few hundred dollars in their bank accounts to cover an emergency or the 80 of american workers who live paycheck to paycheck in today s global economy financial security is increasingly the property of the 1 no surprise then that as a sense of economic instability continued to grow over the past decade angst turned to anger a transition that from the u s to the philippines hungary to brazil poland to mexico has provoked a plethora of voter upheavals in the process a 1930s style brew of rising nationalism and blaming the other whether that other was an immigrant a religious group a country or the rest of the world emerged this phenomenon offered a series of trumpian figures including of course the donald himself an opening to ride a wave of populism to the heights of the political system that the backgrounds and records of none of them whether you re talking about donald trump viktor orbán rodrigo duterte or jair bolsonaro among others reflected the daily concerns of the common people as the classic definition of populism might have it hardly mattered even a billionaire could it turned out exploit economic insecurity effectively and use it to rise to ultimate power ironically as that american master at evoking the fears of apprentices everywhere showed to assume the highest office in the land was only to begin a process of creating yet more fear and insecurity trump s trade wars for instance have typically infused the world with increased anxiety and distrust toward the u s even as they thwarted the ability of domestic business leaders and ordinary people to plan for the future meanwhile just under the surface of the reputed good times the damage to that future only intensified in other words the groundwork has already been laid for what could be a frightening transformation both domestically and globally that old financial crisis to understand how we got here let s take a step back only a decade ago the world experienced a genuine global financial crisis a meltdown of the first order economic growth ended shrinking economies threatened to collapse countless jobs were cut homes were foreclosed upon and lives wrecked for regular people access to credit suddenly disappeared no wonder fears rose no wonder for so many a brighter tomorrow ceased to exist the details of just why the great recession happened have since been glossed over by time and partisan spin this september when the 10th anniversary of the collapse of the global financial services firm lehman brothers came around major business news channels considered whether the world might be at risk of another such crisis however coverage of such fears like so many other topics was quickly tossed aside in favor of paying yet more attention to donald trump s latest tweets complaints insults and lies why because such a crisis was so 2008 in a year in which it was claimed we were enjoying a first class economic high and edging toward the longest bull market in wall street history when it came to boom versus gloom boom won hands down none of that changed one thing though most people still feel left behind both in the u s and globally thanks to the massive accumulation of wealth by a 1 skilled at gaming the system the roots of a crisis that didn t end with the end of the great recession have spread across the planet while the dividing line between the have nots and the have a lots only sharpened and widened though the media hasn t been paying much attention to the resulting inequality the statistics when you see them on that ever widening wealth gap are mind boggling according toinequality org for instance those with at least 30 million in wealth globally had the fastest growth rate of any group between 2016 and 2017 the size of that club rose by 25 5 during those years to 174 800 members or if you really want to grasp what s been happening consider that between 2009 and 2017 the number of billionaires whose combined wealth was greater than that of the world s poorest 50 fell from 380 to just eight and by the way despite claims by the president that every other country is screwing america the u s leads the pack when it comes to the growth of inequality as inequality org notes it has much greater shares of national wealth and income going to the richest 1 than any other country that in part is due to an institution many in the u s normally pay little attention to the u s central bank the federal reserve it helped spark that increase in wealth disparity domestically and globally by adopting a post crisis monetary policy in which electronically fabricated money via a program called quantitative easing or qe was offered to banks and corporations at significantly cheaper rates than to ordinary americans pumped into financial markets that money sent stock prices soaring which naturally ballooned the wealth of the small percentage of the population that actually owned stocks according to economist stephen roach considering the fed s survey of consumer finances it is hardly a stretch to conclude that qe exacerbated america s already severe income disparities wall street central banks and everyday people what has since taken place around the world seems right out of the 1930s at that time as the world was emerging from the great depression a sense of broad economic security was slow to return instead fascism and other forms of nationalism only gained steam as people turned on the usual cast of politicians on other countries and on each other if that sounds faintly trumpian to you it should in our post 2008 era people have witnessed trillions of dollars flowing into bank bailouts and other financial subsidies not just from governments but from the world s major central banks theoretically private banks as a result would have more money and pay less interest to get it they would then lend that money to main street businesses big and small would tap into those funds and in turn produce real economic growth through expansion hiring sprees and wage increases people would then have more dollars in their pockets and feeling more financially secure would spend that money driving the economy to new heights and all of course would then be well that fairy tale was pitched around the globe in fact cheap money also pushed debt to epic levels while the share prices of banks rose as did those of all sorts of other firms to record shattering heights even in the u s however where a magnificent recovery was supposed to have been in place for years actual economic growth simply didn t materialize at the levels promised at 2 per year the average growth of the american gross domestic product over the past decade for instance has been half the average of 4 before the 2008 crisis similar numbers were repeated throughout the developed world and most emerging markets in the meantime total global debt hit 247 trillion in the first quarter of 2018 as the institute of international finance found countries were on average borrowing about three dollars for every dollar of goods or services created global consequences what the fed along with central banks from europe to japan ignited in fact was a disproportionate rise in the stock and bond markets with the money they created that capital sought higher and faster returns than could be achieved in crucial infrastructure or social strengthening projects like building roads high speed railways hospitals or schools what followed was anything but fair as former federal reserve chair janet yellen noted four years ago it is no secret that the past few decades of widening inequality can be summed up as significant income and wealth gains for those at the very top and stagnant living standards for the majority and of course continuing to pour money into the highest levels of the private banking system was anything but a formula for walking that back instead as more citizens fell behind a sense of disenfranchisement and bitterness with existing governments only grew in the u s that meant donald trump in the united kingdom similar discontent was reflected in the june 2016 brexit vote to leave the european union eu which those who felt economically squeezed to death clearly meant as a slap at both the establishment domestically and eu leaders abroad since then multiple governments in the european union too have shifted toward the populist right in germany recent elections swung both right and left just six years after in july 2012 european central bank ecb head mario draghi exuded optimism over the ability of such banks to protect the financial system the euro and generally hold things together like the fed in the u s the ecb went on to manufacture money adding another 3 trillion to its books that would be deployed to buy bonds from favored countries and companies that artificial stimulus too only increased inequality within and between countries in europe meanwhile brexit negotiations remain ruinously divisive threatening to rip great britain apart nor was such a story the captive of the north atlantic in brazil where left wing president dilma rouseff was ousted from power in 2016 her successor michel temer oversaw plummeting economic growth and escalating unemployment that in turn led to the election of that country s own donald trump nationalistic far right candidate jair bolsonaro who won a striking 55 2 of the vote against a backdrop of popular discontent in true trumpian style he is disposed against both the very idea of climate change and multilateral trade agreements in mexico dissatisfied voters similarly rejected the political known but by swinging left for the first time in 70 years new president andrés manuel lópez obrador popularly known by his initials amlo promised to put the needs of ordinary mexicans first however he has the u s and the whims of donald trump and his great wall to contend with which could hamper those efforts as amlo took office on december 1st the g20 summit of world leaders was unfolding in argentina there amid a glittering backdrop of power and influence the trade war between the u s and the world s rising superpower china came even more clearly into focus while its president xi jinping having fully consolidated power amid a wave of chinese nationalism could become his country s longest serving leader he faces an international landscape that would have amazed and befuddled mao zedong though trump declared his meeting with xi a success because the two sides agreed on a 90 day tariff truce his prompt appointmentof an anti chinese hardliner robert lighthizer to head negotiations a tweet in which he referred to himself in superhero fashion as a tariff man and news that the u s had requested that canada arrest and extradite an executive of a key chinese tech company caused the dow to take its fourth largest plunge in history and then fluctuate wildly as economic fears of a future great something rose more uncertainty and distrust were the true product of that meeting in fact we are now in a world whose key leaders especially the president of the united states remain willfully oblivious to its long term problems putting policies like deregulation fake nationalist solutions and profits for the already grotesquely wealthy ahead of the future lives of the mass of citizens consider the yellow vest protests that have broken out in france where protestors identifying with left and right political parties are calling for the resignation of neoliberal french president emmanuel macron many of them from financially starved provincial towns are angry that their purchasing power has dropped so low they can barely make ends meet ultimately what transcends geography and geopolitics is an underlying level of economic discontent sparked by twenty first century economics and a resulting grand canyon sized global inequality gap that is still widening whether the protests go left or right what continues to lie at the heart of the matter is the way failed policies and stop gap measures put in place around the world are no longer working not when it comes to the non 1 anyway people from washington to paris london to beijing increasingly grasp that their economic circumstances are not getting better and are not likely to in any presently imaginable future given those now in power a dangerous recipe the financial crisis of 2008 initially fostered a policy of bailing out banks with cheap money that went not into main street economies but into markets enriching the few as a result large numbers of people increasingly felt that they were being left behind and so turned against their leaders and sometimes each other as well this situation was then exploited by a set of self appointed politicians of the people including a billionaire tv personality who capitalized on an increasingly widespread fear of a future at risk their promises of economic prosperity were wrapped in populist platitudes normally but not always of a right wing sort lost in this shift away from previously dominant political parties and the systems that went with them was a true form of populism which would genuinely put the needs of the majority of people over the elite few build real things including infrastructure foster organic wealth distribution and stabilize economies above financial markets in the meantime what we have is of course a recipe for an increasingly unstable and vicious world this article originally appeared on le

this article is more than 5 years old 2016 bloomberg finance lp as a new month got underway investors had their second helping of big economic news this week in the form of the government s jobs report for january which came after the fed meeting earlier this week helped boost the market for the second month in a row job creation in the united states blew past expectations with a surge of more than 300 000 new nonfarm payrolls positions a briefing com consensus estimate had forecast a gain of 160 000 jobs in january but the actual figure from the labor department ended up showing a rise of 304 000 still there may be some factors that could temper enthusiasm about the bumper report first the 312 000 reading that had exceeded expectations in december was revised down to 222 000 that s still above what wall street was expecting in last month s initial report but it takes some of the shine off also the jobs data that show strength in the economy also point to potentially heightened inflationary pressure which could along with other data prompt the fed to revise its recently taken dovish stance indeed the government said that annual average hourly earnings a key component of inflation increased by 3 2 ahead of the jobs report manufacturing data out of china seemed to temper the bullish tone from the fed s stance and a strong earnings season a bit after the january caixin markit manufacturing purchasing managers index came in below expectations and posted its worst reading since february 2016 asian markets were mixed after the news as hopefulness about a u s china trade deal helped buoy sentiment president trump told reporters thursday that he hoped to get a deal done before the march deadline and chinese state media said negotiators from both sides have made important progress in solving an issue that has been a headwind for markets for months market digests fed news earnings continue thursday was the first full trading day after the fed stood pat on interest rates removed the words further gradual increases from its statement and reiterated the central bank s more dovish stance amid its willingness to be patient about potential further rate hikes after cheering the move following the announcement wednesday the u s stock market finished mostly higher thursday while the fed s monetary policy stance is important as we ve said before earnings drive markets and generally earnings have been showing positive signs facebook shares surged after the social media giant easily beat third party consensus earnings and revenue expectations facebook said daily active user growth climbed 9 in the quarter to 1 52 billion while monthly active user growth also rose 9 the company did say it expects revenue growth to slow but revenue rose at about a 30 clip in q4 beating the company s own guidance range while facebook was helping the s p 500 communication services sector post the day s best sector gains general electric was leading the industrials sector higher general electric added to the generally positive tone to the market after it reported stronger than expected revenue although its earnings per share came in under expectations the rally in those two companies shares comes after apple aap and boeing ba surprised to the upside seeming to help alleviate some worry about slowing growth in china in corporate earnings news friday morning exxon mobil xom shares gained ground after the company reported earnings that beat wall street estimates even as revenue fell short of expectations capex concerns although the u s china trade war has been a market overhang for months now the extent to which the tariff tussle is holding back company executives in terms of making plans may be underrated one notable issue during this earning season has been a relative absence of talk about capital expenditure plans it seems likely that is because of the tariff uncertainty so if the china u s trade dispute gets solved it s a possibility that capex may ramp up while one quarter with a dearth of capex is not too alarming an extended absence of company spending would be some earnings season clouds not all of this earnings season has been positive the dow jones industrial average dji ended just shy of the break even mark on thursday weighed down by a hefty drop in dowdupont s dwdp shares after earnings came in slightly ahead of expectations but revenue missed analysts forecast and after the closing bell amazon s amzn shared dipped substantially in extended trading hours thursday after the online retailing giant provided an outlook that disappointed investors even though it beat top and bottom line expectations after a bumper holiday season revenue at amazon web services the company s cloud computing platform also beat expectations while much of the market s strength at the moment appears to be coming from optimism about the fed and strong corporate earnings it s also possible that some companies may have gotten oversold creating what some see as a buying opportunity but last month s strength also brings to mind january 2018 when the market was on fire but then the bulls got doused in cold water amid a sharp pullback that carried into last february one thing to potentially watch for is earnings reports from retailers they could prove to be a headwind and a test for the resiliency of the current bullish momentum data source ice futures u s chart source the thinkorswim platform from td ameritrade more strength for the dollar with the deadline for brexit approaching in march one of the questions that has been hanging over the market is how that might affect britain s economy and that of the european union britain hasn t yet passed a plan for the split while no one knows exactly how a no deal brexit would play out it s arguable that the results wouldn t be good for either economy or at least not as good as they would be in a negotiated divorce if the economies of britain and the eu deteriorate meaningfully as a result of brexit that could weaken their currencies compared with the u s dollar after strengthening though much of last year see chart above an even more muscular greenback could create a stronger headwind for u s multinationals by making the goods they sell more expensive for buyers using other currencies from supply to demand oil prices took a beating last year in part on concerns about oversupply amid a glut of production but a deal from opec and russia on curtailing production has helped prices rally boosting the spx energy sector more than 10 this year through wednesday according to investment research firm cfra that s a sharp contrast to last year when according to the research firm the sector fell more than 20 but the sector isn t out of the woods yet as the international monetary fund has reduced its global economic growth expectations the uncertainty in the oil market has shifted from a supply side concern to a demand side question cfra said consumers less confident earlier this week a reading on the confidence of the u s consumer dropped more than expected the conference board s consumer confidence index fell to 120 2 in january from a downwardly revised 126 6 in december a briefing com consensus had expected the reading for last month to come in at 126 1 the mindset of consumers is a big deal because consumer spending represents the single largest contributor to the u s economy the outlook among consumers was dampened by the volatility in financial markets and the government shutdown which threatens to register in

more expensive so they have to compromise on either renting or they have to switch to condominiums or smart houses or they might buy a car and stay with their parents in the 1960s census data suggest as few as eight per cent of canadians ages 18 to 35 were living with parents today as has been well documented those numbers have skyrocketed come 2016 a total of 34 7 per cent of canadians between

post graduate certificates and diplomas in the 2016 census but the degree by itself isn t proving to be enough it s not an option about whether or not they re going to have an education that s like an

actual life on hold the thing about this generation is that everything is delayed said duxbury they stay in school longer they get married later if you start comparing the average age of marriage the average age of their first kid the average age of their first permanent full time job it s also forcing those within the generation to compete with one another in ways that are specifically benefitting employers with so much talent available competition for available entry levels jobs is fierce this allows employers to pay less for the workers they need some are even getting away with not paying their employees at all advertisement 11 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content according to the canadian federation of students as many as 300 000 millennials were working in unpaid internships in a bid to further their careers by collecting relevant on the job experience in 2016 the issue with unpaid internships is that most millennials in those jobs are also working in another position likely one that pays minimum wage in order to make ends meet according to the cfs the organization which lobbies on behalf of students also pointed to statistics canada data that shows in 1997 the first year that wage data was collected only 640 000 canadians were making the minimum wage or less in 2017 that number sat at 1 02 million almost double the number previously recorded further compounding the issues facing the millennials is the steady drop in government support offered to post secondary institutions according to the cfs government provided more than 80 per cent of university operating revenues in 1982 that figure fell below 60 per cent in 2012 the most recent year for which statistics are available the cfs says government support has continued to fall in more recent years advertisement 12 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content as

preferences for capital gains and dividend income in a bid to better distribute wealth across demographics that may sound like a scary scenario to older generations who have amassed wealth throughout their lifetimes and typically been more conservative when it comes to political fiscal policies but for the millennial generation it s only the tip of the iceberg bring the big government according to abacus data millennials are looking to government to take big steps to fix their problems this generation is more comfortable with big interventionist government than allowing market forces to play their part surveys suggest many millennials truly believe that the economic system that has been in place for hundreds of years fails to work for them advertisement 26 story continues below this

budgets in order to tackle issues such as alleviating income inequality they believe corporations don t pay their fair share of taxes and that government has a big role to play in redistributing that money having lived through the 2008 financial crisis and a rise in housing costs many are outright skeptical of the free market when asked to indicate if they lean more towards one perspective or the other only 46 per cent suggested that capitalism is the best economic model we have while 54 per cent believe canada would be better off with a more socialist system reads an abacus data survey released last year perhaps the most pertinent fact millennials are now the largest block of voters in the country and have the ability to swing an election toward the party or platform of their choice provided the generation gets out the vote so far they have remained relatively quiet in most elections politicians aren t talking about issues that they care about they aren t very compelling they aren t giving them a reason to get engaged said abacus s coletto millennials are unique from previous generations particularly the boomers and those who came before the boomers in that voting is not considered a duty we don t do it because we have to we do it because we have a reason to reasons seem to be emerging according to elections canada 38 8 per cent of eligible voters between the ages of 18 and 24 years of age voted in the 2011 federal election of those between 25 and 34 years of age 45 1 per cent cast their ballot by comparison a total of 64 5 per cent of canadians between the ages of 45 and 54 voted in that election when it came to canadians between the ages of 65 and 74 a total of 75 1 per cent of eligible voters participated the federal election in 2015 saw better turnout by millennials more than 57 1 per cent of eligible voters between 18 and 24 years of age cast a ballot the number was similar in the 25 through 34 year old age group where 57 4 per cent of eligible voters participated one of the big issues during the 2015 election was the liberal party s promise to legalize cannabis sales in canada which is something that appeals specifically to the millennial generation s interests more than 60 per cent of canadians between the ages of 18 and 34 supported legalizing cannabis according to a study released by nrg research group and peak communicators in march 2017 photo by chris young the canadian press it s expected that more politicians will be looking to woo the millennial vote heading into october s federal election last week finance minister bill morneau said the federal government is looking at ways to make housing purchases more affordable for millennials in the months ahead he called the issue a priority but didn t elaborate ndp leader jagmeet singh has said his party would propose measures to help build as many as 500 000 affordable housing units across the country if elected with more politicians tuning into the fact that the millennial generation will vote for political platforms that speak to their agenda the 18 through 35 demographic looks as though it will soon find itself in an unfamiliar position instead of taking a back seat while older generations plot the course millennials are poised to grab the wheel and take a drastic detour it hasn t boiled over yet but the pot is starting to get warm said coletto there are more millennials than there are boomers more millennials are eligible to vote than any other generation more politicians are mindful of the shift that millennials could bring meanwhile barrett is

more expensive so they have to compromise on either renting or they have to switch to condominiums or smart houses or they might buy a car and stay with their parents in the 1960s census data suggest as few as eight per cent of canadians ages 18 to 35 were living with parents today as has been well documented those numbers have skyrocketed come 2016 a total of 34 7 per cent of canadians between

that is helping them is their parents said tal from the cibc the education system basically failed them they are highly educated but they are not educated in what s relevant there is a mismatch

post graduate certificates and diplomas in the 2016 census but the degree by itself isn t proving to be enough it s not an option about whether or not they re going to have an education that s like an

situation like an arms race for qualifications to set a candidate apart from their competitors so they can land a good job and start their lives the problem is the process is forcing them to put their actual life on hold the thing about this generation is that everything is delayed said duxbury they stay in school longer they get married later if you start comparing the average age of marriage the average age of their first kid the average age of their first permanent full time job it s also forcing those within the generation to compete with one another in ways that are specifically benefitting employers with so much talent available competition for available entry levels jobs is fierce this allows employers to pay less for the workers they need some are even getting away with not paying their employees at all advertisement 11 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content according to the canadian federation of students as many as 300 000 millennials were working in unpaid internships in a bid to further their careers by collecting relevant on the job experience in 2016 the issue with unpaid internships is that most millennials in those jobs are also working in another position likely one that pays minimum wage in order to make ends meet according to the cfs the organization which lobbies on behalf of students also pointed to statistics canada data that shows in 1997 the first year that wage data was collected only 640 000 canadians were making the minimum wage or less in 2017 that number sat at 1 02 million almost double the number previously recorded further compounding the issues facing the millennials is the steady drop in government support offered to post secondary institutions according to the cfs government provided more than 80 per cent of university operating revenues in 1982 that figure fell below 60 per cent in 2012 the most recent year for which statistics are available the cfs says government support has continued to fall in more recent years advertisement 12 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content as

record amounts of debt using data from statistics canada the cfs said that average student debt levels have increased more than 40 per cent between 1999 and 2012 those levels have continued to climb

generation is really really stuck in many ways said benjamin tal managing director and deputy chief economist at cibc this is really the story of this cohort we have a situation where housing is much more expensive so they have to compromise on either renting or they have to switch to condominiums or smart houses or they might buy a car and stay with their parents in the 1960s census data suggest as few as eight per cent of canadians ages 18 to 35 were living with parents today as has been well documented those numbers have skyrocketed come 2016 a total of 34 7 per cent of canadians between

that is helping them is their parents said tal from the cibc the education system basically failed them they are highly educated but they are not educated in what s relevant there is a mismatch between the skills that they have and what the economy needs and therefore you have many people underemployed and or trying to compromise advertisement 9 story continues below this advertisement has

up the most highly educated generation ever produced more than 3 5 million canadians between the ages of 20 and 34 reported having some sort of post secondary education including bachelor degrees and post graduate certificates and diplomas in the 2016 census but the degree by itself isn t proving to be enough it s not an option about whether or not they re going to have an education that s like an invitation card to the party said carleton university s linda duxbury a professor in management sciences at the sprott school of business who specializes in demographic trends she s also a member of the baby boomer generation people who are now 54 to 73 years of age advertisement 10 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content you

situation like an arms race for qualifications to set a candidate apart from their competitors so they can land a good job and start their lives the problem is the process is forcing them to put their actual life on hold the thing about this generation is that everything is delayed said duxbury they stay in school longer they get married later if you start comparing the average age of marriage the average age of their first kid the average age of their first permanent full time job it s also forcing those within the generation to compete with one another in ways that are specifically benefitting employers with so much talent available competition for available entry levels jobs is fierce this allows employers to pay less for the workers they need some are even getting away with not paying their employees at all advertisement 11 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content according to the canadian federation of students as many as 300 000 millennials were working in unpaid internships in a bid to further their careers by collecting relevant on the job experience in 2016 the issue with unpaid internships is that most millennials in those jobs are also working in another position likely one that pays minimum wage in order to make ends meet according to the cfs the organization which lobbies on behalf of students also pointed to statistics canada data that shows in 1997 the first year that wage data was collected only 640 000 canadians were making the minimum wage or less in 2017 that number sat at 1 02 million almost double the number previously recorded further compounding the issues facing the millennials is the steady drop in government support offered to post secondary institutions according to the cfs government provided more than 80 per cent of university operating revenues in 1982 that figure fell below 60 per cent in 2012 the most recent year for which statistics are available the cfs says government support has continued to fall in more recent years advertisement 12 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content as government support has decreased students have been forced to shoulder more of the financial burden when obtaining their education that has led to students exiting post secondary institutions with record amounts of debt using data from statistics canada the cfs said that average student debt levels have increased more than 40 per cent between 1999 and 2012 those levels have continued to climb in more recent years the increased cost of education at a time when obtaining a degree has never been more important is another hot button issue for millennials the underemployed generation

postmedia it s tough and competitive she said even for a lot of the programs you are looking at applying to to get an actual career the amount of hours of experience you need for example the physician assistant program that i applied to it s only offered by three universities in canada and i couldn t apply to the third which is the university of toronto because they require almost 1 000 hours of health care experience so where am i supposed to get that hypothetically what i m doing now could count but most people applying to that it s their second career they re going to be older in america where numbers are more readily available underemployment held steady at around 33 per cent of all post secondary graduates between the 1980s and 2010 advertisement 15 story continues below this

has become more entrenched as lower income ontarians are increasingly staying in low income and higher income ontarians are increasingly staying in high income said peter weltman the province s financial accountability officer in a report released thursday he highlighted significant structural changes in ontario s economy and labour market including a rise in part time and temporary work

of government in ensuring that all individuals have access to similar economic opportunities he said abacus s coletto is seeing signs that the trend exists here in canada too one of the key indicators of underemployment is wages which would be reflected in the rise of minimum wage workers but the other big indicator is the benefits offered by employers self employed people largely don t have access to benefits people making minimum wage get a minimum amount of benefits from their employers only 55 per cent of millennials have access to a prescription drug plan 53 per cent to dental insurance 36

he was vice president at 3m why because there was a different attitude then is it harder to buy a home yes are we taking on higher student debt yes have we been trained and educated in the wrong things many of us yes said abacus s coletto we ve been raised around these expectations go do what you want to do the world is your oyster dream big those expectations were set quite high when you enter a world where it s not possible to achieve the things that your parents and your teachers and society has been saying is going to be there it creates further tension advertisement 19 story

refusal to leave the workforce if the millennials are stuck in a bottleneck fighting for career advancement right now the baby boomers are acting like a cork preventing any movement whereas the age 65 was once marked by a person s announcing their retirement today s senior citizens are opting to soldier on the idea of freedom at 55 seems long forgotten extended life spans better health and in some cases continued financial responsibilities are seeing many people in the baby boomer demographic work well into their 70s before opting for retirement boomers have significant expenses that perhaps they didn t anticipate plus they love their jobs and they re healthy they think what am i going to do for the next 25 years said duxbury advertisement 20 story continues below this advertisement has

aging parents many also find themselves sandwiched in between paying for their parents while also supporting their millennial children who have returned to the family home the millennials can t afford to leave their parents homes because they don t have the opportunity or means to do so but their parents can t afford to retire which would open spaces in the workforce for millennials because they are still supporting those kids at home it is a problem that the boomers aren t leaving that s absolutely true said duxbury so what comes next the awakening of the millennial tectonic plates are beginning to shift advertisement 21 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content that s the opinion at least of karen foster assistant professor at dalhousie university and canada research chair in sustainable rural futures for atlantic canada one of foster s areas of expertise is in researching generational divisions at work she said there is no doubt millennials are upset and that their complaints have been falling on deaf ears however one of the larger issues that millennials are facing is a growing wealth gap between themselves and older generations due to the fact that major life milestones have been delayed investments in real estate or other financial transactions aren t yielding the same return for the younger generation foster said sure property values have skyrocketed for older generations who bought when prices were affordable and have been hanging onto the property but the millennial who just purchased is seeing bigger mortgages than ever before and interest rates that are steadily rising advertisement 22 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content critics of millennial concerns have often pointed out that are next in line to inherit massive amounts of wealth that has been accumulated by their aging parents in fact between 2016 and 2026 the largest wealth transfer in history is expected to take place as older generations pass on as much as 1 trillion to younger generations in canada according to toronto based research firm strategic insight but foster pointed out one critical problem with the upcoming windfall the expected transfer of wealth will only benefit those people who come from families that are already wealthy it will also affect people from major canadian cities where property prices have been steadily rising in a much different way than those people from less populated towns if your family is from somewhere such as moncton n b moose jaw sask or sudbury ont you won t see the same windfall when it comes time to collect an inheritance advertisement 23 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content people who are set to inherit money from their parents or in a sense have been inheriting it their whole lives through various kinds of support that s where the real inequality happens she said adding that millennials are looking to completely upend the status quo that really comes down to a restructuring of the tax system we need to be taxing wealth and high incomes and corporate profits more in order to redistribute wealth across the demographics foster predicts that millennials are likely to push for things such as increased estate taxes in order to ensure that some of the wealth that is transferred from older generations is redistributed throughout all of society the idea is being spearheaded in the united states by recently elected democrat congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez ocasio cortez who at 29 is also a millennial is lobbying for the introduction of a tax on the wealthiest americans in the country she

cases continued financial responsibilities are seeing many people in the baby boomer demographic work well into their 70s before opting for retirement boomers have significant expenses that perhaps

to leave their parents homes because they don t have the opportunity or means to do so but their parents can t afford to retire which would open spaces in the workforce for millennials because they are still supporting those kids at home it is a problem that the boomers aren t leaving that s absolutely true said duxbury so what comes next the awakening of the millennial tectonic plates are beginning to shift advertisement 21 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content that s the opinion at least of karen foster assistant professor at dalhousie university and canada research chair in sustainable rural futures for atlantic canada one of foster s areas of expertise is in researching generational divisions at work she said there is no doubt millennials are upset and that their complaints have been falling on deaf ears however one of the larger issues that millennials are facing is a growing wealth gap between themselves and older generations due to the fact that major life milestones have been delayed investments in real estate or other financial transactions aren t yielding the same return for the younger generation foster said sure property values have skyrocketed for older generations who bought when prices were affordable and have been hanging onto the property but the millennial who just purchased is seeing bigger mortgages than ever before and interest rates that are steadily rising advertisement 22 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content critics of millennial concerns have often pointed out that are next in line to inherit massive amounts of wealth that has been accumulated by their aging parents in fact between 2016 and 2026 the largest wealth transfer in history is expected to take place as older generations pass on as much as 1 trillion to younger generations in canada according to toronto based research firm strategic insight but foster pointed out one critical problem with the upcoming windfall the expected transfer of wealth will only benefit those people who come from families that are already wealthy it will also affect people from major canadian cities where property prices have been steadily rising in a much different way than those people from less populated towns if your family is from somewhere such as moncton n b moose jaw sask or sudbury ont you won t see the same windfall when it comes time to collect an inheritance advertisement 23 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content people who are set to inherit money from their parents or in a sense have been inheriting it their whole lives through various kinds of support that s where the real inequality happens she said adding that millennials are looking to completely upend the status quo that really comes down to a restructuring of the tax system we need to be taxing wealth and high incomes and corporate profits more in order to redistribute wealth across the demographics foster predicts that millennials are likely to push for things such as increased estate taxes in order to ensure that some of the wealth that is transferred from older generations is redistributed throughout all of society the idea is being spearheaded in the united states by recently elected democrat congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez ocasio cortez who at 29 is also a millennial is lobbying for the introduction of a tax on the wealthiest americans in the country she believes that every dollar of income over 10 million should be taxed at 70 per cent advertisement 24 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content there will of course be pushback to that idea it s been panned by the audience at the world economic forum in davos switzerland as recently as last week with attendees including michael dell founder of dell technologies and microsoft corp founder bill gates expressing objections the call for higher estate taxes in canada was recently reinforced in a study released by the canadian centre for policy alternatives ccpa you d expect canada s tax regime would try to counteract this concentration of wealth at the very top where it s needed the least but in fact federal policies encourage it said the centre s senior economist david macdonald in a release canada is the only country in the g7 without an inheritance estate or gift tax on tremendous family wealth advertisement 25 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the ccpa s report said canada s wealthiest families saw their net worth grow on average by 37 per cent between 2012 and 2016 middle class families saw their net worth grow by only 16 per cent during the same time frame the study calls for high estate taxes eliminating tax preferences for capital gains and dividend income in a bid to better distribute wealth across demographics that may sound like a scary scenario to older generations who have amassed wealth throughout their lifetimes and typically been more conservative when it comes to political fiscal policies but for the millennial generation it s only the tip of the iceberg bring the big government according to abacus data millennials are looking to government to take big steps to fix their problems this generation is more comfortable with big interventionist government than allowing market forces to play their part surveys suggest many millennials truly believe that the economic system that has been in place for hundreds of years fails to work for them advertisement 26 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the company s research suggests that millennials clearly prioritize increased government spending over balanced budgets in order to tackle issues such as alleviating income inequality they believe corporations don t pay their fair share of taxes and that government has a big role to play in redistributing that money having lived through the 2008 financial crisis and a rise in housing costs many are outright skeptical of the free market when asked to indicate if they lean more towards one perspective or the other only 46 per cent suggested that capitalism is the best economic model we have while 54 per cent believe canada would be better off with a more socialist system reads an abacus data survey released last year perhaps the most pertinent fact millennials are now the largest block of voters in the country and have the ability to swing an election toward the party or platform of their choice provided the generation gets out the vote so far they have remained relatively quiet in most elections politicians aren t talking about issues that they care about they aren t very compelling they aren t giving them a reason to get engaged said abacus s coletto millennials are unique from previous generations particularly the boomers and those who came before the boomers in that voting is not considered a duty we don t do it because we have to we do it because we have a reason to reasons seem to be emerging according to elections canada 38 8 per cent of eligible voters between the ages of 18 and 24 years of age voted in the 2011 federal election of those between 25 and 34 years of age 45 1 per cent cast their ballot by comparison a total of 64 5 per cent of canadians between the ages of 45 and 54 voted in that election when it came to canadians between the ages of 65 and 74 a total of 75 1 per cent of eligible voters participated the federal election in 2015 saw better turnout by millennials more than 57 1 per cent of eligible voters between 18 and 24 years of age cast a ballot the number was similar in the 25 through 34 year old age group where 57 4 per cent of eligible voters participated one of the big issues during the 2015 election was the liberal party s promise to legalize cannabis sales in canada which is something that appeals specifically to the millennial generation s interests more than 60 per cent of canadians between the ages of 18 and 34 supported legalizing cannabis according to a study released by nrg research group and peak communicators in march 2017 photo by chris young the canadian press it s expected that more politicians will be looking to woo the millennial vote heading into october s federal election last week finance minister bill morneau said the federal government is looking at ways to make housing purchases more affordable for millennials in the months ahead he called the issue a priority but didn t elaborate ndp leader jagmeet singh has said his party would propose measures to help build as many as 500 000 affordable housing units across the country if elected with more politicians tuning into the fact that the millennial generation will vote for political platforms that speak to their agenda the 18 through 35 demographic looks as though it will soon find itself in an unfamiliar position instead of taking a back seat while older generations plot the course millennials are poised to grab the wheel and take a drastic detour it hasn t boiled over yet but the pot is starting to get warm said coletto there are more millennials than there are boomers more millennials are eligible to vote than any other generation more politicians are mindful of the shift that millennials could bring meanwhile barrett is

more expensive so they have to compromise on either renting or they have to switch to condominiums or smart houses or they might buy a car and stay with their parents in the 1960s census data suggest as few as eight per cent of canadians ages 18 to 35 were living with parents today as has been well documented those numbers have skyrocketed come 2016 a total of 34 7 per cent of canadians between

that is helping them is their parents said tal from the cibc the education system basically failed them they are highly educated but they are not educated in what s relevant there is a mismatch

post graduate certificates and diplomas in the 2016 census but the degree by itself isn t proving to be enough it s not an option about whether or not they re going to have an education that s like an

situation like an arms race for qualifications to set a candidate apart from their competitors so they can land a good job and start their lives the problem is the process is forcing them to put their actual life on hold the thing about this generation is that everything is delayed said duxbury they stay in school longer they get married later if you start comparing the average age of marriage the average age of their first kid the average age of their first permanent full time job it s also forcing those within the generation to compete with one another in ways that are specifically benefitting employers with so much talent available competition for available entry levels jobs is fierce this allows employers to pay less for the workers they need some are even getting away with not paying their employees at all advertisement 11 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content according to the canadian federation of students as many as 300 000 millennials were working in unpaid internships in a bid to further their careers by collecting relevant on the job experience in 2016 the issue with unpaid internships is that most millennials in those jobs are also working in another position likely one that pays minimum wage in order to make ends meet according to the cfs the organization which lobbies on behalf of students also pointed to statistics canada data that shows in 1997 the first year that wage data was collected only 640 000 canadians were making the minimum wage or less in 2017 that number sat at 1 02 million almost double the number previously recorded further compounding the issues facing the millennials is the steady drop in government support offered to post secondary institutions according to the cfs government provided more than 80 per cent of university operating revenues in 1982 that figure fell below 60 per cent in 2012 the most recent year for which statistics are available the cfs says government support has continued to fall in more recent years advertisement 12 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content as

record amounts of debt using data from statistics canada the cfs said that average student debt levels have increased more than 40 per cent between 1999 and 2012 those levels have continued to climb

in today s dollars adjusted not what was on their paycheque according statistics canada in 2016 as we were downloading drake s one dance and streaming star wars rogue one the average canadian between 18 and 35 was making 34 300 a difference of 100 average wages for people between the ages of 18 and 35 have remained stagnant for nearly four decades by comparison people in the 35 through 50 year old

700 by 2016 an 8 000 increase the millennial salary stagnation is also happening at a time when benefits such as dental care and defined benefit pension plans are being pared back or even eliminated by employers giving those older generations an even bigger financial leg up laziness isn t the culprit here millennials are working and working hard in fact they re actually participating in the labour force more and by some measures working harder than previous generations did in 1980 78 9 per cent of all canadians between the ages of 18 and 35 were employed in some sort of job according to statistics canada in 2016 it was 81 2 per cent advertisement 6 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content photo by punit paranjpe afp getty images that increase is even more impressive considering the size of the demographic today there are as many as 10 million people now in the millennial generation accounting for 27 5 per cent of canada s population that sheer size makes them the largest generational demographic in the country it also suggests there are more people between the ages of 18 and 35 working in the labour force today than ever before still there seem to be major hurdles in their path play for the home team housing was the top issue cited by millennials in six surveys done by abacus last year coletto says of those who don t own a home currently 86 per cent want to he said in 1980 the average price of a house in canada was 203 972 86 or about six times average annual salaries once adjusted to account for

average home price hit 506 760 01 or 14 8 times average annual wages we have a situation where this generation is really really stuck in many ways said benjamin tal managing director and deputy chief economist at cibc this is really the story of this cohort we have a situation where housing is much more expensive so they have to compromise on either renting or they have to switch to condominiums or smart houses or they might buy a car and stay with their parents in the 1960s census data suggest as few as eight per cent of canadians ages 18 to 35 were living with parents today as has been well documented those numbers have skyrocketed come 2016 a total of 34 7 per cent of canadians between the ages of 20 and 34 were living at home with their parents that s as many as 3 5 million canadians the highest number recorded to that point and ontario had the highest percentage of millennials still living at home 42 1 per cent advertisement 8 story continues below this advertisement has not

to buy a home a cibc survey found how will they do it a national survey by hsbc bank of canada released in 2017 found 37 per cent of millennials who have purchased a home received some of the money for the purchase from their parents the education system basically failed them the only thing that is helping them is their parents said tal from the cibc the education system basically failed them they are highly educated but they are not educated in what s relevant there is a mismatch between the skills that they have and what the economy needs and therefore you have many people underemployed and or trying to compromise advertisement 9 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content there is no denying that millennials are highly educated a study released by the pew research center in the u s suggests that they make up the most highly educated generation ever produced more than 3 5 million canadians between the ages of 20 and 34 reported having some sort of post secondary education including bachelor degrees and post graduate certificates and diplomas in the 2016 census but the degree by itself isn t proving to be enough it s not an option about whether or not they re going to have an education that s like an invitation card to the party said carleton university s linda duxbury a professor in management sciences at the sprott school of business who specializes in demographic trends she s also a member of the baby boomer generation people who are now 54 to 73 years of age advertisement 10 story continues below

even going to be looked at photo by darren brown ottawa citizen duxbury described the situation like an arms race for qualifications to set a candidate apart from their competitors so they can land a good job and start their lives the problem is the process is forcing them to put their actual life on hold the thing about this generation is that everything is delayed said duxbury they stay in school longer they get married later if you start comparing the average age of marriage the average age of their first kid the average age of their first permanent full time job it s also forcing those within the generation to compete with one another in ways that are specifically benefitting employers with so much talent available competition for available entry levels jobs is fierce this allows employers to pay less for the workers they need some are even getting away with not paying their employees at all advertisement 11 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content according to the canadian federation of students as many as 300 000 millennials were working in unpaid internships in a bid to further their careers by collecting relevant on the job experience in 2016 the issue with unpaid internships is that most millennials in those jobs are also working in another position likely one that pays minimum wage in order to make ends meet according to the cfs the organization which lobbies on behalf of students also pointed to statistics canada data that shows in 1997 the first year that wage data was collected only 640 000 canadians were making the minimum wage or less in 2017 that number sat at 1 02 million almost double the number previously recorded further compounding the issues facing the millennials is the steady drop in government support offered to post secondary institutions according to the cfs government provided more than 80 per cent of university operating revenues in 1982 that figure fell below 60 per cent in 2012 the most recent year for which statistics are available the cfs says government support has continued to fall in more recent years advertisement 12 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content as government support has decreased students have been forced to shoulder more of the financial burden when obtaining their education that has led to students exiting post secondary institutions with record amounts of debt using data from statistics canada the cfs said that average student debt levels have increased more than 40 per cent between 1999 and 2012 those levels have continued to climb in more recent years the increased cost of education at a time when obtaining a degree has never been more important is another hot button issue for millennials the underemployed generation underemployment a term used to describe people who are overqualified for the positions they find themselves in is also rising rapidly advertisement 13 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content for ottawa s barrett it means her bachelor of science degree isn t enough for her to start a career she is working at a family health clinic on a part time basis and as a goaltending instructor at two different businesses in the nation s capital she is hoping the work will help to save up enough to help pay for a graduate degree there is no getting anywhere with just a bachelor of science anymore she said i graduated i played varsity hockey at dalhousie university academic all canadian all five years i was there i had a good gpa that doesn t matter in terms of getting a job i need to get another degree in order to get a job in a desired field she has applied to get into a program to become a physician assistant but hasn t been successful in getting into the program so far advertisement 14 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content photo by julie oliver postmedia it s tough and competitive she said even for a lot of the programs you are looking at applying to to get an actual career the amount of hours of experience you need for example the physician assistant program that i applied to it s only offered by three universities in canada and i couldn t apply to the third which is the university of toronto because they require almost 1 000 hours of health care experience so where am i supposed to get that hypothetically what i m doing now could count but most people applying to that it s their second career they re going to be older in america where numbers are more readily available underemployment held steady at around 33 per cent of all post secondary graduates between the 1980s and 2010 advertisement 15 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content however that figure jumped to more than 44 per cent of all graduates in 2012 the most recent year for which statistics were available this week ontario s financial accountability office flagged underemployment as an issue that is affecting certain demographics and their ability to keep up financially income inequality has become more entrenched as lower income ontarians are increasingly staying in low income and higher income ontarians are increasingly staying in high income said peter weltman the province s financial accountability officer in a report released thursday he highlighted significant structural changes in ontario s economy and labour market including a rise in part time and temporary work advertisement 16 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content these trends in ontario incomes raise important questions about the role of government in ensuring that all individuals have access to similar economic opportunities he said abacus s coletto is seeing signs that the trend exists here in canada too one of the key indicators of underemployment is wages which would be reflected in the rise of minimum wage workers but the other big indicator is the benefits offered by employers self employed people largely don t have access to benefits people making minimum wage get a minimum amount of benefits from their employers only 55 per cent of millennials have access to a prescription drug plan 53 per cent to dental insurance 36 per cent to an rrsp and only 29 per cent to an employer provided pension plan according to a recent study released by abacus data advertisement 17 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the workforce evolve or die careers are also changing older millennials in the demographic who graduated 10 or 15 years ago are finding the education that they worked so hard to receive and paid good money for is no longer relevant to the work they are expected to be doing in 1980 there were a total of 2 080 000 people employed in canada s manufacturing industry according to statistics canada by 2016 that number dropped by more than half to 1 032 900 people the professional scientific and technical industry which includes high technology workers employed 393 400 people in 1980 that swelled to more than 1 393 700 by 2016 today s employers are less likely to train existing employees to meet modern demands choosing instead to hire younger cheaper talent that is now exiting school with the skills they need advertisement 18 story continues

to ai artificial intelligence robotics all these kinds of things certainly jobs are going to be replaced new jobs are going to be created mostly at the high scale end said carleton s duxbury employers don t spend the money on training and development that they should and they d rather have someone coming in with the credentials then they would training somebody who is currently working for them my father when he came back from the war had a grade 12 education when he retired he was vice president at 3m why because there was a different attitude then is it harder to buy a home yes are we taking on higher student debt yes have we been trained and educated in the wrong things many of us yes said abacus s coletto we ve been raised around these expectations go do what you want to do the world is your oyster dream big those expectations were set quite high when you enter a world where it s not possible to achieve the things that your parents and your teachers and society has been saying is going to be there it creates further tension advertisement 19 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content baby boomers won t go can t go the tension is being compounded by the baby boomer generation s refusal to leave the workforce if the millennials are stuck in a bottleneck fighting for career advancement right now the baby boomers are acting like a cork preventing any movement whereas the age 65 was once marked by a person s announcing their retirement today s senior citizens are opting to soldier on the idea of freedom at 55 seems long forgotten extended life spans better health and in some cases continued financial responsibilities are seeing many people in the baby boomer demographic work well into their 70s before opting for retirement boomers have significant expenses that perhaps they didn t anticipate plus they love their jobs and they re healthy they think what am i going to do for the next 25 years said duxbury advertisement 20 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content duxbury also said that baby boomers are now finding themselves in a situation where they are caring for or paying for the care of their aging parents many also find themselves sandwiched in between paying for their parents while also supporting their millennial children who have returned to the family home the millennials can t afford to leave their parents homes because they don t have the opportunity or means to do so but their parents can t afford to retire which would open spaces in the workforce for millennials because they are still supporting those kids at home it is a problem that the boomers aren t leaving that s absolutely true said duxbury so what comes next the awakening of the millennial tectonic plates are beginning to shift advertisement 21 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content that s the opinion at least of karen foster assistant professor at dalhousie university and canada research chair in sustainable rural futures for atlantic canada one of foster s areas of expertise is in researching generational divisions at work she said there is no doubt millennials are upset and that their complaints have been falling on deaf ears however one of the larger issues that millennials are facing is a growing wealth gap between themselves and older generations due to the fact that major life milestones have been delayed investments in real estate or other financial transactions aren t yielding the same return for the younger generation foster said sure property values have skyrocketed for older generations who bought when prices were affordable and have been hanging onto the property but the millennial who just purchased is seeing bigger mortgages than ever before and interest rates that are steadily rising advertisement 22 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content critics of millennial concerns have often pointed out that are next in line to inherit massive amounts of wealth that has been accumulated by their aging parents in fact between 2016 and 2026 the largest wealth transfer in history is expected to take place as older generations pass on as much as 1 trillion to younger generations in canada according to toronto based research firm strategic insight but foster pointed out one critical problem with the upcoming windfall the expected transfer of wealth will only benefit those people who come from families that are already wealthy it will also affect people from major canadian cities where property prices have been steadily rising in a much different way than those people from less populated towns if your family is from somewhere such as moncton n b moose jaw sask or sudbury ont you won t see the same windfall when it comes time to collect an inheritance advertisement 23 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content people who are set to inherit money from their parents or in a sense have been inheriting it their whole lives through various kinds of support that s where the real inequality happens she said adding that millennials are looking to completely upend the status quo that really comes down to a restructuring of the tax system we need to be taxing wealth and high incomes and corporate profits more in order to redistribute wealth across the demographics foster predicts that millennials are likely to push for things such as increased estate taxes in order to ensure that some of the wealth that is transferred from older generations is redistributed throughout all of society the idea is being spearheaded in the united states by recently elected democrat congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez ocasio cortez who at 29 is also a millennial is lobbying for the introduction of a tax on the wealthiest americans in the country she believes that every dollar of income over 10 million should be taxed at 70 per cent advertisement 24 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content there will of course be pushback to that idea it s been panned by the audience at the world economic forum in davos switzerland as recently as last week with attendees including michael dell founder of dell technologies and microsoft corp founder bill gates expressing objections the call for higher estate taxes in canada was recently reinforced in a study released by the canadian centre for policy alternatives ccpa you d expect canada s tax regime would try to counteract this concentration of wealth at the very top where it s needed the least but in fact federal policies encourage it said the centre s senior economist david macdonald in a release canada is the only country in the g7 without an inheritance estate or gift tax on tremendous family wealth advertisement 25 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the ccpa s report said canada s wealthiest families saw their net worth grow on average by 37 per cent between 2012 and 2016 middle class families saw their net worth grow by only 16 per cent during the same time frame the study calls for high estate taxes eliminating tax preferences for capital gains and dividend income in a bid to better distribute wealth across demographics that may sound like a scary scenario to older generations who have amassed wealth throughout their lifetimes and typically been more conservative when it comes to political fiscal policies but for the millennial generation it s only the tip of the iceberg bring the big government according to abacus data millennials are looking to government to take big steps to fix their problems this generation is more comfortable with big interventionist government than allowing market forces to play their part surveys suggest many millennials truly believe that the economic system that has been in place for hundreds of years fails to work for them advertisement 26 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the company s research suggests that millennials clearly prioritize increased government spending over balanced budgets in order to tackle issues such as alleviating income inequality they believe corporations don t pay their fair share of taxes and that government has a big role to play in redistributing that money having lived through the 2008 financial crisis and a rise in housing costs many are outright skeptical of the free market when asked to indicate if they lean more towards one perspective or the other only 46 per cent suggested that capitalism is the best economic model we have while 54 per cent believe canada would be better off with a more socialist system reads an abacus data survey released last year perhaps the most pertinent fact millennials are now the largest block of voters in the country and have the ability to swing an election toward the party or platform of their choice provided the generation gets out the vote so far they have remained relatively quiet in most elections politicians aren t talking about issues that they care about they aren t very compelling they aren t giving them a reason to get engaged said abacus s coletto millennials are unique from previous generations particularly the boomers and those who came before the boomers in that voting is not considered a duty we don t do it because we have to we do it because we have a reason to reasons seem
