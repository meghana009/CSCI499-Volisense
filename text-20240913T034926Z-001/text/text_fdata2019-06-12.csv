premium or discount gearing and ongoing charges 2 source refinitiv 3 key performance indicator 4 based on year end figures chairman s statement dear shareholder as you will read in the performance section below the company had a disappointing year the third year of underperformance relative to our benchmark mark barnett the portfolio manager has reported on the performance in detail in his portfolio manager s report which follows but i would like to make a few observations here as stated on page 1 the company has two objectives for the medium to long term the first is to outperform the ftse all share index over the long term on a net asset value nav capital return basis and second to produce dividend growth in excess of uk inflation by investing primarily in a portfolio of uk listed shares the board has delegated discretion to mark to manage the portfolio subject to certain prudential restrictions and we meet regularly with him to discuss challenge and oversee his actions as shown in the table below over the past five years both these objectives have been met in that period the company s nav capital return with debt at market was 13 6 cumulatively whilst the company s benchmark over the same period returned 11 9 in addition annualised dividend growth of 3 6 over the past five years compares favourably with annualised inflation measured in term of the retail prices index of 2 3 mark s approach to investment is based on fundamental research and he builds his portfolios based on the convictions that result from his research as a result the portfolio tends to be concentrated in a number of sectors and holdings this approach has the potential to deliver significant outperformance over the medium to long term but a concentrated portfolio of this kind may also result in periods of underperformance as has been the case in the past three years in the light of the company s underperformance during the past three years the board stepped up its scrutiny of the way that the portfolio is managed probing once again the nature of investment risk management and challenge processes we continue to believe that mark s approach accompanied by appropriate invesco and board support oversight and challenge is the right one to meet the company s objectives performance the table below shows the track record on the basis of the nav capital return i e excluding dividends paid which is one of the company s objectives and on the basis of the nav total return which includes the dividends reinvested for the year ended 31 march 2019 the company s net asset value nav total return was 2 9 with debt at market value whilst the company s benchmark index returned 6 4 the portfolio was adversely affected by the exposure to domestic stocks in a year when more global stocks have outperformed as well as to particular issues at a number of companies a more detailed explanation is set out in the portfolio manager s report over the past three years the company s nav total return has been 11 6 cumulatively with the company s benchmark index returning 31 3 over the same period over the past five years the company s nav total return with debt at market value has been 35 9 cumulatively with the company s benchmark index returning 34 5 over that period returns to 31 march 2019 capital returns total returns excluding dividends paid with dividends reinvested nav

share price ended the year at 644p an increase of 0 3 from the previous year s closing price of 642p this reflects the increase in nav but also a modest narrowing of the discount with debt at market value the discount narrowed to 7 6 from 8 7 at the end of the previous year the board has in place the authority to buy back shares and in exercising this power considers a variety of factors including the degree of resulting nav enhancement the general market environment the pattern of supply and demand and the rating of the peer group during the year the company s discount traded in a range of 6 3 to 10 7 and the average discount was 8 6 in the third quarter of the calendar year the company s discount widened along with that of the peer group and the board bought back 185 000 shares the discount subsequently narrowed since the company s year end the peer group and the company s discounts have again widened and the board has again exercised its buy back powers at 11 june 2019 the latest practical date before the signing of this report the nav and share price had fallen and were respectively 685 8p and 592p and the resultant discount has widened to 13 7 with debt at market value dividend in line with our policy of recent years to rebalance the interim and final dividend towards the interim dividend in the year to 31 march 2019 the board has declared three interim dividends of 6 25p 2018 5 80p and is proposing a final dividend of 9 25p 2018 9 20p per share this results in a total dividend of 28 0p for the year an increase of 1 40p this represents an increase of 5 3 in the total dividend over the previous year which is in excess of the 2 4 annual increase in the retail price index reflecting the board s commitment to providing income growth which exceeds the rate of inflation the final dividend which is subject to approval by shareholders will be paid on 31 july 2019 to shareholders on the register on 21 june 2019 borrowings and gearing the company has in place a mixture of fixed and floating rate debt comprising of the company s 7Â¾ 2022 debenture and a 150 million 364 day committed credit facility by these means mark has the ability to vary the gearing level of the portfolio depending on his view of the market borrowings at the start of the year were 143 9 million equivalent to gross gearing with debt at market of 12 1 aggregate borrowings during the year ranged between 100 million and 177 6 million and ended the year at 130 8 million equivalent to gross gearing with debt at market of 11 0 reflecting the manager s more cautious outlook costs the ongoing charges ratio fell marginally from 0 57 to 0 56 a significant proportion of the ongoing charges are paid to invesco for a variety of services including portfolio management administration regulation and compliance shareholder communication support services and supervision of the arrangements with other key service providers the board continues to look for ways to reduce the impact of charges further board composition and succession planning after serving on the board for over 14 years sir nigel wicks will retire as a director of the company at the forthcoming agm sir nigel has made a very significant contribution to the company which has benefited from his knowledge and commitment the board would like to record its thanks to him for his services to the company and shareholders during the year the nomination committee carried out a review of the composition and skills of the board and the company s succession plan following this the board appointed odgers berndtson an external search consultant to conduct the search for two new directors and as a result the board is pleased to propose the election of steven baldwin and elisabeth stheeman as non

invesco co uk edinburgh glen suarez chairman 12 june 2019 portfolio manager s report for the year ended 31 march 2019 market review the uk equity market provided a positive return over the twelve month period to 31 march 2019 however the market s mid single digit rise masks periods of significant volatility the uk equity market rallied strongly in the second quarter of 2018 and having peaked in may the ftse all share index sold off sharply in the second half of 2018 the principal causes of this change were the outlook for us interest rates heightened fears of a global economic slowdown and the escalation of us sino trade tensions against a backdrop of declining global equity markets the uk equity market fell to an eighteen month low in december 2018 however a shift in the stance on interest rate policy from the us federal reserve and a cooling of the previously negative trade rhetoric between the us and china laid the foundations for a strong equity market rally during the first quarter of 2019 this resulted in a positive uk equity market return for the period under review against this challenging global backdrop the question of the uk s exit from the european union continued to dominate the domestic agenda the extended political uncertainty saw the value of sterling fall materially through the year reaching a twenty month low of us 1 23 in december 2018 as a vote of no confidence against theresa may was called over the terms of the negotiated eu withdrawal agreement the bank of england s boe monetary policy committee voted to increase the uk s base interest rate by 0 25 at its august 2018 meeting but kept rates on hold for the rest of the period as the political impasse continued in february 2019 the boe cut its uk growth forecast from 1 7 to 1 2 for the year despite this economic data proved remarkably robust in 2018 we saw a return to real wage growth whilst the number of people in work increased by 350 000 more than three times the increase in the size of the working age population portfolio strategy and review the company s net asset value including reinvested dividends provided a return of 2 9 during the period under review compared with a return of 6 4 total return by the ftse all share index the portfolio s themes have remained broadly consistent over the past year the tilt towards uk domestic opportunities has been emphasised as persistent negativity towards domestic sectors has created further opportunities whilst exposure to more internationally orientated growth stocks has been modestly reduced exposure to the tobacco sector remains prominent and a significant proportion of the portfolio is invested in non correlated financials a theme which offers the portfolio both risk diversification benefits and diversified sources of income the portfolio s exposure to uk domestic opportunities supported absolute performance over the period as stock selection proved crucial across a range of sectors most notable was the holding in next which defied the well publicised crises facing many high street retailers to deliver full year results in line with expectations the 15 rise in online sales offset more challenging declines in in store retail sales emphasising that the company s multi channel offering allows it to see the growth of online shopping as an opportunity not a threat meanwhile the 4 5 increase in the annual dividend reaffirmed the company s focus on shareholder returns holdings in drax tesco legal general and bca marketplace further supported returns sterling weakness and prolonged political uncertainty saw the internationally orientated companies of the ftse all share index outperform stock selection within this theme contributed to the portfolio s relative underperformance over the year the portfolio s zero weighting in the metals and mining sector detracted from relative performance mining companies have historically paid dividends from current earnings which are highly correlated to commodity prices given the inherent volatility underpinning earnings within the sector i believe there are alternative areas of the market better suited to the objectives of the portfolio elsewhere the leisure sector faced some challenging trading conditions during the period the portfolio s positions in thomas cook and easyjet suffered as a result of rising oil prices an unusually hot summer across northern europe and the brexit impasse which impacted demand within the sector the portfolio has a significant weighting in the oil gas sector namely in bp and royal dutch shell which performed well over the period bp provided the portfolio s strongest contribution to performance releasing better than expected results for 2018 in february i believe that the sector s outlook is dependent on the market s confidence in these companies ability to cover their cash flow and dividends unlike other sectors i believe that this is reliant on capital discipline within the sector rather than price strength in the underlying commodity in absolute terms the portfolio s standout return was provided by holdings in international healthcare stocks as roche novartis and btg which provided a strong positive contribution roche and novartis traded strongly over the period whilst the share price of btg rose sharply in november as the company accepted an offer from us biopharmaceutical firm boston scientific the portfolio s holding in astrazeneca also supported absolute performance over the period although the decision to sell the position mid way through 2018 coupled with the non inclusion of glaxosmithkline proved challenging for relative returns other notable contributors included homeserve the emergency home repairs and services provider released strong full year results in may 2018 which included a 25 increase in the company s dividend following a year of record profit growth the company s share price continued to trade positively supported by a positive trading update in july 2018 analyst upgrades and an acquisition tobacco remains a prominent theme with investments in altria british american tobacco bat and imperial brands which have delivered exceptional returns for shareholders over the long term however the headwinds noted in my 2017 commentary persisted into 2018 as the market continued to weigh concerns around regulation and the outlook for next generation technologies in november the united states food drug administration fda announced plans to pursue a ban on the sale of menthol products which caused further weakness across the sector the portfolio s holding in bat was most impacted given the company s revenue exposure to menthol sales it is my view that the prospect of a total menthol ban remains unlikely given the requirement to evidence additional harm versus non menthol products furthermore the real impact of a ban remains uncertain as consumers may move to non menthol tobacco alternatives meanwhile the tobacco majors are at the forefront of new technologies with the resources to drive successful innovation in the sector in 2019 the sector has recovered somewhat buoyed by the surprise resignation of the head of the fda and the release of strong full year results from bat which included meaningful growth in the dividend amid challenging and uncertain market conditions the need to secure diversified income streams for the portfolio remains crucial the portfolio retains a significant exposure to the final theme of non correlated financials which can offer strong cash flow and income generation potential that is not correlated to traditional business cycles notable contributors over the period included litigation finance company burford capital which continued to support portfolio returns after posting very strong half and full year results for 2018 in december 2018 the company s share price was further supported by confirmation that it has secured an additional us 1 6 billion in new litigation investments whilst full year results released in march 2019 confirmed a 14 increase in the full year dividend a second consecutive year of double digit growth the significant underweight position in mainstream banks was a positive decision as the sector underperformed the overall market affirming my view of the importance of non correlated stocks within the portfolio conversely the portfolio s holdings in the non standard lending sector weighed on performance amigo performed poorly following its initial public offering last summer as the market became concerned about increased regulatory scrutiny of guarantor lending provident financial pfg also traded down over the period a result of the slower than expected pace of profit recovery under the new management team the non standard lending sector has historically been a strong contributor to portfolio returns and it remains my view that the sector plays an important role in the lending market providing a competitively priced alternative to borrowers who would otherwise be excluded from access to traditional credit furthermore amigo and pfg as regulated entities are well placed within the industry to respond to an evolving regulatory environment in february 2019 pfg received an unsolicited takeover bid from non standard finance a smaller rival which saw further volatility in the company s share price as pfg publicly sought to resist the hostile takeover the offer has now lapsed elsewhere in the financials sector a recently initiated position in the financial trading platform plus500 proved volatile the company has met with challenges in clearly explaining to the market the short term revenue volatility that can arise in trading of contracts for difference derivative instruments having maintained a zero weighting in mainstream banks for a number of years a significant new investment was made in royal bank of scotland rbs the newly initiated position reflects the portfolio manager s confidence that rbs is the best capitalised of all uk banks with the clearest line of sight to delivering substantially improved total shareholder returns new investments were also made in cranswick draper esprit whitbread plus500 amigo and urban exposure the holdings in astrazeneca and relx were sold portfolio manager outlook the portfolio s positioning has evolved incrementally over the past year to take advantage of the best risk adjusted opportunities at the most interesting valuations the portfolio continues to offer a sustainable flow of diversified income with stronger dividend cover and better growth prospects compared to the wider market however these qualities have been largely ignored by a market that has rewarded momentum over fundamentals such that on a price to book basis the portfolio is significantly undervalued this suggests that there is an opportunity for material revaluation in the portfolio from current levels the performance of the uk economy continues to confound most forecasts by recording steady growth over the course of 2019 the overall level of growth is expected to remain solid supported by improvements in household cash flow and rising employment which will benefit consumption activity and economic growth given that the outlook for the economy appears to be more resilient than currently implied by the currency or valuations of domestic sectors it is anticipated that political resolution will see this material differential start to close however valuations in the uk market as a whole remain polarised between a basket of multi national companies which command high valuations and a basket of uk domestic equities which are valued significantly lower given this wide valuation disparity the portfolio has retained a large exposure to sterling revenues which are undervalued due to the persistent caution towards the uk economy as evidenced by the weakness of the exchange rate the portfolio has also maintained exposure to a number of global industries namely oil and tobacco which despite yielding significantly higher than average dividends remain attractively valued in a market that seeks out new disruptive business models within the context of perceived sunset industries in many respects the stock market s current sentiment towards these industries resembles behaviour that was seen during the last tech bubble it would appear that the market is happy to discount a future decline in the cash flow from these businesses which is much more rapid than appears likely patience is an essential characteristic of successful long term investing over the past 12 months this quality has been severely tested the trend towards momentum stocks has been exacerbated by exogenous economic and political factors primarily the sustainability of global economic growth and the protracted brexit negotiations as a result of these persistent uncertainties the market has focused on supporting premium valuations for growth or highly disruptive companies which has not suited the core investment themes of the company it is frustrating that the capital and income growth potential of the company is not currently reflected in capital values however the inherent strengths of the portfolio detailed above remain robust it remains crucial that in such times of extreme momentum and somewhat irrational market pricing the company remains rooted in the fundamental investment process which has worked over many stock market cycles mark barnett portfolio manager 12 june 2019 business review strategy and business model the edinburgh investment trust plc is an investment company and its investment objective is set out below the strategy the board follows to achieve that objective is to set investment policy and risk guidelines together with investment limits and to monitor how they are applied these are also set out below and have been approved by shareholders the business model the company has adopted to achieve its investment objective has been to contract the services of invesco fund managers limited the manager to manage the portfolio in accordance with the board s strategy and under its oversight the portfolio manager with individual responsibility for the day to day management of the portfolio is mark barnett and the deputy portfolio manager is james goldstone in addition the company has contractual arrangements with link asset services to act as registrar and the bank of new york mellon international limited as depositary and custodian investment objective and policy investment objective the company invests primarily in uk securities with the long term objective of achieving 1 an increase of the net asset value per share in excess of the growth in the ftse all share index and 2 growth in dividends per share in excess of the rate of uk inflation investment policy the company will generally invest in companies quoted on a recognised stock exchange in the uk the company may also invest up to 20 of the market value of the company s investment portfolio measured at the time of any acquisition in securities listed on stock exchanges outside the uk the portfolio is selected by the manager on the basis of its assessment of the fundamental value available in individual securities whilst the company s overall exposure to individual securities is monitored carefully by the board the portfolio is not primarily structured on the basis of industry weightings no acquisition may be made which would result in a holding being greater than 10 of the market value of the company s investment portfolio similarly the company may not hold more than 5 of the issued share capital or voting shares in any one company investment in convertibles is subject to normal security limits should these or any other limit be exceeded by subsequent market movement each resulting position is specifically reviewed by the board the company may borrow money to provide gearing to the equity portfolio of up to 25 of net assets use of derivative instruments is monitored carefully by the board and permitted within the following constraints the writing of covered calls against securities which in aggregate amount to no more than 10 of the value of the portfolio and the investment in ftse 100 futures which when exercised would equate to no more than 15 of the value of the portfolio other derivative instruments may be employed subject to prior board approval provided that the cost and potential liability of exercise of all outstanding derivative positions at any time should not exceed 25 of the value of the portfolio at that time the company may hedge exposure to changes in foreign currency rates in respect of its overseas investments results and dividends at the year end the share price was 644 0p per

dividends for the year of 28 00p per share an increase of 5 3 on the previous year s dividends of 26 60p the revenue return per share for the year was 28 7p a 2 decrease on the 2018 return of 29 3p performance the board reviews the company s performance by reference to a number of key performance indicators kpis which are shown on page 4 notwithstanding that some kpis are beyond its control they are measures of the company s absolute and relative performance the kpis assist in managing performance and compliance and are reviewed by the board at each meeting the chairman s statement above gives a commentary on the performance of the company during the year the gearing and the dividend expenses are reviewed at each board meeting enabling the board amongst other things to review costs and consider any expenditure outside that of its normal operations for the year being reported except for disappointing performance all other kpis are considered satisfactory the board also regularly reviews the performance of the company in relation to the 23 investment trusts in the uk equity income sector as at 29 march 2019 the company was ranked 17th by nav performance in this sector over one year and 20th over three and 8th over five years source jpmorgan cazenove analysis of performance for year ended 31 march 2019 total return basis 1 nav debt at market value 2 9 less benchmark 6 4

including the future of the company the main trends and factors likely to affect the future development performance and position of the company s business can be found in the portfolio manager s report details of the principal risks affecting the company follow principal risks and uncertainties the company s key long term investment objectives are an increase in the net asset value per share in excess of the growth in the ftse all share index the benchmark and an increase in dividends in excess of the growth in rpi the principal risks and uncertainties facing the company are an integral consideration when assessing the operations in place to meet these objectives including the performance of the portfolio share price and dividends the board is ultimately responsible for the risk control systems but the day to day operation and monitoring is delegated to the manager the board has carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the company including those that would threaten its business model future performance solvency or liquidity with consideration being given to market and possible regulatory uncertainty arising from brexit the following sets out a description of the principal risks and how they are being managed or mitigated market risk a great majority of the company s investments are traded on recognised stock exchanges the principal risk for investors in the company is a significant fall and or a prolonged period of decline in those markets the company s investments and the income derived from them are influenced by many factors such as general economic conditions interest rates inflation political events including brexit and government policies as well as by supply and demand reflecting investor sentiment such factors are outside the control of the board and manager and may give rise to high levels of volatility in the prices of investments held by the company the asset value and price of the company s shares and its earnings and dividends may consequently also experience volatility and may decline investment performance risk the board sets performance objectives and delegates the investment management process to the manager the achievement of the company s performance objectives relative to the market requires active management of the portfolio of assets and securities the manager s approach is to construct a portfolio which should benefit from expected future trends in the uk and global economies the manager is a long term investor prepared to take substantial positions in securities and sectors which may well be out of fashion but which the manager believes will have potential for material increases in earnings and in due course dividends and share prices strategy asset allocation and stock selection decisions by the manager can lead to underperformance of the portfolio relative to the benchmark and or income targets the manager s style may result in a concentrated portfolio with significant overweight or underweight positions in individual stocks or sectors compared to the index and consequently the company s performance may deviate significantly possibly for extended periods from that of the benchmark in a similar way the manager manages other portfolios holding many of the same stocks as the company which reflects the manager s high conviction style of investment management this could significantly increase the liquidity and price risk of certain stocks under certain scenarios and market conditions however the board and manager believe that the investment process and policy outlined above should over the long term meet the company s objectives of capital growth in excess of the benchmark and real dividend growth investment selection is delegated to the manager the board does not specify asset allocations information on the company s performance against the benchmark and peer group is provided to the board at each board meeting the board uses this to review the performance of the company taking into account how performance relates to the company s objectives the manager is responsible for monitoring the portfolio selected and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile as described in the investment policy derivatives may be used provided that the market exposure arising is less than 25 of the value of the portfolio during the year no forward currency contracts or derivatives were used for hedging or market exposure respectively borrowing risk the company may borrow to provide gearing to the equity portfolio of up to 25 of net assets borrowing is a mix of the company s 100 million debenture stock and the company s 150 million bank facility details of all borrowings are given in notes 11 and 12 the principal gearing risk is that the level of gearing may have an adverse impact on performance secondary risks include whether the cost of borrowing is too high and whether the bank facility can be renewed and on terms acceptable to the company the manager has full discretion over the amount of the borrowing it uses to gear its portfolio whilst the issuance repurchase or restructuring of borrowing are for the board to decide information related to borrowing and gearing is provided to the directors as part of the board papers income dividend risk the company is subject to the risk that income generation from its investments fails to reach the level of income required to meet its objectives the board monitors this risk through the review of detailed income forecasts and comparison against budget these are contained within the board papers the board considers the level of income at each meeting share price risk there is a risk that the company s prospects and nav may not be fully reflected in the share price from time to time the share price is monitored on a daily basis the board is empowered to repurchase shares within agreed parameters the discount at which the shares trade to nav can be influenced by share repurchases during the year the company has repurchased 185 000 shares for holding in treasury control systems risk the board delegates a number of specific risk control activities to the manager including good practice industry standards in fund management operations financial controls meeting regulatory requirements the management of the relationship with the depositary via the depositary the management of the custody and security of the company s assets and the management of the relationship with the registrar consequently in respect of these activities the company is dependent on the manager s control systems and those of its depositary and registrar both of which are monitored by the manager in the context of safeguarding the company s assets and interests there is a risk that the manager fails to ensure that these controls are operated in a satisfactory manner in addition the company relies on the soundness and efficiency of the custodian for good title and timeliness of receipt and delivery of securities a risk based programme of internal audits is carried out by the manager regularly to test the controls environment an internal controls report providing an assessment of these risks and operation of the controls is prepared by the manager and considered by the audit committee and is formally reported to and considered by the board reliance on the manager and other third party providers risk the company has no employees and the directors are all appointed on a non executive basis the company is reliant upon the performance of third party providers for its executive function and other service provisions the company s most significant contract is with the manager to whom responsibility both for management of the company s portfolio and for the provision of company secretarial and administrative services is delegated the company has other contractual arrangements with third parties to act as auditor registrar depositary and broker the company s operational structure means that all cyber risk information and physical security arises at its third party service providers including fraud sabotage or crime against the company failure by any service provider to carry out its obligations to the company in accordance with the terms of its appointment could have a materially detrimental impact on the operation of the company and could affect the ability of the company to pursue successfully its investment policy and expose the company to risk of loss or to reputational risk in particular the manager performs services which are integral to the operation of the company the manager may be exposed to the risk that litigation misconduct operational failures negative publicity and press speculation whether or not it is valid will harm its reputation any damage to the reputation of the manager could result in counterparties and third parties being unwilling to deal with the manager and by extension the company this could have an adverse impact on the ability of the company to pursue its investment policy the board seeks to manage these risks in a number of ways the manager monitors the performance of all third party providers in relation to agreed service standards on a regular basis and any issues and concerns are dealt with promptly and reported to the board the manager formally reviews the performance and the service organisation control reports of other key third party providers and reports to the board on an annual basis the board reviews the performance of the manager at every board meeting and otherwise as appropriate the board has the power to replace the manager and reviews the management contract formally once a year the day to day management of the portfolio is the responsibility of the named portfolio manager mark barnett head of uk equities at invesco he has worked in equity markets since 1992 and has been part of the uk equities team at invesco for over 20 years the risk that the portfolio manager might be incapacitated or otherwise unavailable is mitigated by the fact that he works within and is supported by the wider invesco uk equity team moreover james goldstone as deputy

debenture the debt at its nominal equivalent to the par value of 100 million the nav debt at market value reflects the debenture stock at the value that a third party would be prepared to pay for the debt and this amount fluctuates owing to various factors including changes in interest rates and the remaining life of the debt the number of ordinary shares in issue at the year end was 195 481 734

instruments note 1 also includes the basis on which income and expenses arising from financial assets and liabilities are recognised and measured the main financial risks that the company faces from its financial instruments are market risk liquidity risk and credit risk these are set out below market risk arising from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument

term so as to fulfil its investment policy incorporating the company s investment objective in pursuing its investment objective the company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in either a reduction in the company s net assets or a reduction of the profits available for dividends these policies are summarised below and have remained substantially unchanged for the two years under review 16 1market risk the company s manager assesses the company s exposure when making each investment decision and monitors the overall level of market risk for the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis the board has meetings in each calendar quarter to assess risk and review investment performance as disclosed in the board responsibilities in the annual financial report any borrowing to gear the investment portfolio is used to enhance returns but also increases the company s exposure to market risk and volatility the company has the ability to gear by using its 100 million debenture stock 2022 and its bank facility of 150 million 16 1 1currency risk the majority of the company s assets and all of its liabilities are denominated in sterling there is some exposure to us dollar swiss franc and the euro management of the currency risk the manager monitors the company s direct exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and reports to the board on a regular basis forward currency contracts can be used to reduce the company s exposure to foreign currencies arising naturally from the manager s choice of securities all contracts are limited to currencies and amounts commensurate with the assets denominated in currencies no forward currency contracts were used during the year 2018 none income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling

party are pushing for its mandate to widen beyond its current remit of inflation targeting to promote jobs and economic growth that is another worry for foreign investors on top of the past week s shock gdp reading showing a deeper than expected contraction in the first three months of 2019 many see the risk of painful parallels with turkey where the central bank stymied by political

over time instead of ranging symmetrically on either side of it interest rates could be cut sooner rather than later a little extra inflation while the economy is strong looks better than deflation a consumption stifling alternative that would limit policy options if the economy turns south that s a full agenda for the june fomc meeting the following week 3 oil prices have fallen swiftly oil prices hyper sensitive to any signs of weakness in the global economy have finally started reacting to the trade war news flow and the ominous signals bond markets are sending on the possibility of recession until end may oil prices were holding above 70 a barrel but recent dismal pmi readings may have tipped the balance pushing brent crude futures 12 lower in just three days with pricing sliding suddenly to five month lows analysts have been left wondering if demand for the black gold is weaker than earlier thought such heavy selling is pretty rare particularly outside recessions a global recession this year is unlikely but with trade waning 2019 could turn out to be the worst year for global commerce flows in a decade there are no compelling signs of economic improvement either oil demand slows by several hundred thousand barrels per day during recessions according to morgan stanley which cut its brent forecast for the second half of this year to 65 70 per barrel from 75 80

war with washington are bearing some fruit indeed investors are looking past these figures for may pboc boss yi gang has already signaled his readiness for more stimulus and focus is firmly on whether presidents xi and trump can negotiate some kind of detente when they meet at the end june g20 summit the conflict has in fact moved on from mere trade blacklists on companies rare earths supply threats and china advising citizens to avoid u s travel washington s criticism of chinese human rights practices little seems off limits the international monetary fund imf already expects chinese growth to slow to 6 2 this year and to 6 in 2020 that would be the weakest since 1990 but analysts believe real growth has already dipped below those levels weak data in coming days would merely confirm the grim outlook for the world economy 5 turkey s monetary policy gets set turkey s central bank will publish its interest rate decision on wednesday a few months ago this meeting was meant to be the one at which policymakers were definitely going to start cutting rates having successfully sailed through the rough waters of market turmoil sparked by political tensions fast forward and few of these issues have been put to bed an election re run in the country s biggest city istanbul is scheduled for june 23 the rocky u s turkey relationship has soured again over defense issues and trade tensions and economic woes are clouding the global backdrop but turkey s economy is undergoing a sharp adjustment following the lira s 30 tumble in 2018 and near 10 drop so far this year inflation now

ubi socialist dream capitalism s savior or farfetched economic theory sam merlo follow 13 min read jun 6 2019 listen share can universal basic income help the economy and grow shared prosperity california can t afford universal health care even as one of the wealthiest states in the world it simply can t afford it says countless wealthy individuals experts and everyday people meanwhile cuba and the u k both offer universal healthcare to their citizens the u k since 1948 if california can t afford universal healthcare how could any country afford a universal basic income where would the money come from who would pay for it either the basic income has to be unrealistically low or the tax rate to finance it is unacceptably high this is a straw man argument these questions presuppose that money is something like gold there s only so much of it in the world as if money like gold is a precious commodity that comes from mines deep in the earth and requires much human toil to extract yet we contradict that notion whenever we speak of money as something that is spent we tend to view spending money as akin to evaporation it disappears as it were leaving us with less money this might be true in our relation to money as individuals but on a social level it is just not true since at least the 1970s money has value simply because we declare it so the world runs on fiat currency all currencies fluctuate in value and are tied to the dollar for comparison the dollar in turn also fluctuates in value if the euro goes up and the dollar goes down the euro has both gained and lost relative value in other words all money value is determined by a ledger varying numbers on an excel sheet as a final backstop oil the lifeblood of the economy is bought and exchanged in dollars this means if a country wants to fuel their economy they must rely on dollars in that way oil safeguards the dollar s hegemony as the world currency reserve saddam hussein allegedly in part lost his regime over plans to start accepting euros for oil his plan could have destabilized both the dollar and the world currency exchange system so if money is simply printed and not in fact a mined resource that evaporates after use why can t we afford ubi do we really need new taxes like the vat proposed by 2020 presidential candidate andrew young to that point where does money come from who owns it perhaps money really does come out of thin air or perhaps it comes from the rich the producing class and where does money go after it is spent back to thin air no sometimes toward other consumers but more often than not to banks and various capital institutions like goldman sachs would it cause hyperinflation well the fed has printed trillions of dollars to fight the great recession and inflation is still extremely low in some ways these points are all tangential to a more basic question are dreams like ubi even worth considering and if so why can ubi really solve social economic issues or would it enable more of the same how could it ever be more than a dream if we have to raise taxes extremely high to pay for it wouldn t high taxes make the economy worse off well for one ubi is not a dream the u s already has a ubi since 1982 alaska has used oil proceeds to pay every resident a small stipend saudi arabia does something similar plus they use a sovereign investment firm to distribute investment returns nationally money makes money after all meanwhile other localities in the u s are beginning to experiment with the idea stockton in california for example states like finland italy the u k namibia and india have already held their own studies results from these ubi tests have been interesting and mixed increases in employment are questionable to be fair part time employment does tend to increase as jodi dean points out in a recent bbc article try and find a job when you can t afford a hair cut or clean clothes or transportation to an interview basic income gave people those opportunities unfortunately while having a job moving bricks from one pile to another is counted as employment it certainly isn t dignified or poised to provide upward mobility considering wage declines since the 1970s in spite of productivity increases people are not being paid an honest wage ubi could enable people to afford the chance to train for more skilled in demand jobs without taking on more debt many americans struggle to switch fields because they feel trapped living paycheck to paycheck while working innumerable hours on the other hand in all of these ubi studies entrepreneurship jumps people are free to pursue their ideas for self improvement without fear of total loss that is being reduced to living on the streets and unable to feed their children is entrepreneurship not prized more or at least as much as employment how many times have you heard that small business is the true driver of the economy ubi studies have something else in common soft benefits these are harder to measure monetarily but they are individually and socially valuable nonetheless people who had basic income found that their trust in other people in the government and even in their future prospects for work went up time spent volunteering unpaid work also goes up currently it is hard expensive and time consuming to support aging relatives like parents especially if they have a degenerative disease like dementia people are well aware that social services drag behind needs quality hospice care is often out of reach ubi would and does allow people to spend less time working and more time caring for others ubi could also help democracy and fight fake news by giving people more time and reason to engage in the discussions so critical to the democratic process money is clearly a motivator why would ubi not motivate people and give them a sense of greater ownership in the collective process it would definitely give them more to lose by not engaging whatsmore ubi could allow everyone to vote economically to become mini philanthropists and political funders a single mom who can barely feed her kids nevermind send them to college despite working three part time jobs can t afford to donate to a political candidate who would help her interests she certainly can t take time off to volunteer for a political campaign either yet what value she could provide her democracy by knocking on her neighbors doors and talking to them who s to say this wouldn t make a neighborhood safer too in fact if neighborhood watch programs show us anything it most definitely will plenty of ubi studies conclude that scrapping the current benefits system and replacing it with a basic income could eradicate destitution yet neoliberal economists will tell you if you can t assign a monetary value to something then it is valueless at least in a quantifiable way as such assigning a supposed value to something that is unquantifiable would throw off the whole pricing and free markets system ubi can be seen as threatening to do just that yet this logic flaunted by ivy league graduates is severely flawed it ignores the plethora of corporate handouts and regulations designed to subsidize corporate profits corporate socialism also drives depression in individuals declines in wages and climate destruction but let s take for a moment the neoliberal perspective that everything should have an assigned monetary value could a system of free money help grow the economy thereby allowing an assumption of value to be applied based on the corresponding growth by small business and consumer spending neoliberals suggest taxes and deficits would increase too much to ever make ubi viable they point to the fact that most americans struggle financially as evidence why ubi taxes would only hurt them of course they ignore the fact that current tax codes funnel money up the income spectrum these conservative economists call for more tax cuts despite decades of evidence showing tax cuts for the rich worsen income inequality and drive americans into financial instability perhaps we can pay for ubi just by the increased economic growth the developed world has long stagnated below the 5 annual gdp gains of the post war economy perhaps ubi is an antidote to this malaise after all ubi fits into a historical narrative of successful supply side economics namely those used to fight the great depression and build the post war middle class italy s ubi experiment aims exactly for this any money left on the cards at the end of the month goes back to the state an incentive to spend the full amount which m5s leader luigi di maio hopes will help boost the economy this is problematic because it ignores the importance of savings but it makes clear the point that ubi can drive the economy by boosting consumer confidence and spending just as the public works administration drove jobs and dispersed capital to consumers during the great depression while simultaneously creating magnificent works of art and public spaces still in use and appreciated today almost a hundred years later and to that point the u s spent billions with the marshell plan on rebuilding europe after wwii in order to have a politically stable and allied market to sell goods to taxes or revenue proceeds such as the sale of oil currently fund ubi but are those are only options as the economy automates and we enter a new age with new tools new science and new needs to drive sustainable economic growth we will have new options to finance ubi i offer two ideas to fund ubi which can be intwined or separated from each other first consider a new global bullion artificial gold as it were for this we could use blockchain a technology hyped but still not well understood blockchain essentially creates an unerasable record of transactions thereby ensuring authenticity why could it not be used as a backing for currency instead of the dollar as opposed to always volatile prices untied to any tangible assets this artificial gold could support greater currency stability how many trillions have been lost because of financial crises that are caused by unstable currencies the 2008 great recession the 1998 argentina peso collapse the 1997 asian financial crisis and the 1994 mexican peso crisis were all caused by in some part and undeniably exacerbated by the unstable global currency exchange system put in place when nixon nixed the gold standard during the 1970s secondly and moreover even without a new global bullion ubi could be backed and distributed by capital projects that provide tangible value just as the tennessee valley authority electrified vast swaths of the united states a global clean energy system could create jobs to complement ubi combat inflation and provide clean cheap energy to billions some pundits might say this too is too expensive how expensive was it to electrify the united states but we did it and we re better for it lives have improved and we ve created even more wealth and prosperity than was ever spent investing in the grid imagine for a moment if the whole western hemisphere tied together a grid of wind solar and other renewables and energy storage systems prosperity would increase by providing more people more electricity without the harmful environmental damage social crime and health costs associated with scare fossil fuels and desperate poverty such a grand system would serve as both physical capital and production capital thereby offering a source of ongoing value by which ubi could be funded as well as serve as an incentive to keep the clean grid well maintained beyond just the social value of abundant electricity this would be one way to disperse ubi without necessarily printing ever greater amounts of money in a fight against hyperinflation selling endless renewable electricity to pay for ubi is similar to selling oil right if all this sounds like ideal fluff consider that most investments today move money around to create money on a balance sheet in the old days a tractor factory made money selling tractors which meant there were more tractors available to farm fields and thus more grain could be produced cheaper grain meant consumers could afford more food farmers could produce more so they could in theory make more money and buy more tractors these days the rise of financialization means that money is made on paper and is not tied to physical capital the dow jones traded at 2 700 in 1990 now it s at 25 000 where did all that money come from why else do corporations spend more time trying to increase their stock value than on producing physical goods it is far more profitable for the tractor company to earn money on a rising stock value than it is to build more tractors especially when the middle or farming class consumerism is being squeezed by declining wages and a rising cost of living so if ubi is possible and beneficial why not do it counter arguments often suppose a state welfare system would do better people need vital services like protection healthcare and education why not focus on providing these services instead of handing out free money that might not be spent to fund them what if these services become unavailable to purchase these kinds of arguments ignore several important points first who decides what is a basic human right and what is a luxury do we collectively decide through a democratic process or let technocrats tell us is access to food especially when it s abundant a human right what about access to housing healthcare education energy and the internet if each dollar counted as one vote as it tends to with today s level of extreme wealth inequality then the rich would decide in an important concession ubi doesn t remove the challenge of deciding what is subsistence living either ubi could be set at just enough to afford food or it could be expanded to include more services and goods secondly and more prudently considering the challenge of establishing a subsistence level state run welfare systems tend to eliminate the perception of freedom individuals must conform to the check boxes of bureaucratic machines these apparatuses herd people like cattle eliminating choice for citizens and a sense of ownership or responsibility for bureaucrats how often have you begged a low ranking employee at a government office or even a corporation to help you with an unfair dilemma only to be shrugged off not my problem or nothing i can do about it is the subtext of so many of these conversations in that way welfare systems can instill more fear and insecurity into the average individual true the uk s healthcare system has consistently been ranked highly trustworthy by citizens but imagine if your livelihood depended on unemployment benefits benefits you wouldn t receive without proving certain criteria yet the officials in charge of reviewing your case made mistakes were careless or even negligent sure there may be an appeal process but that would take even more time while you wait to receive benefits you desperately need as an unemployed person perhaps you lose your housing because you can t pay rent because of the delayed unemployment checks getting them all as one big check after going through the appeal process won t get you your apartment back and it didn t keep you off the street this does actually happen charitable giving also tends to subside in welfare systems as it is assumed that the state takes care of social injustices charitable giving is a powerful way for citizens to build community by connecting and helping others the united states has a long history of giving at the local and national levels as long ago as the early 1800s people like tocqueville marveled at the propensity u s residents have for taking care of their neighbors while this is a grand and idealized vision of reality it certainly has its truth and there is an intrinsic value to charitable approaches which ubi could help support it s hard or impossible to design perfect laws and systems of justice diversity matters to quote john stuart mill the only unfailing and permanent source of improvement is liberty since by it there are as many possible independent centers of improvements as there are individuals charity gives people a sense of collectiveness and responsibility in their society to quote another article that states this more simply if not a bit caustically we must consider a basic income to promote economic security and freedom as an alternative to today s unpopular threadbare and hostile welfare state ultimately ubi may be most effective when combined with funding for essential social services like education it s fair to say handing out money won t solve everyone s problems but on the flip side funding education doesn t guarantee people will have the opportunity to make enough money to afford a secure stable life either some pundits like jonathan yates childishly argue that ubi would discourage education yet he of all people should see that current scholarship grant and debt forgiveness plans help average people get a university education about two thirds of u s students pay for college in part with financial aid in that way these programs are like a mini ubi experiment if ph d students did not earn a stipend only the rich could afford that level of education some who are extremely rich have cause to worry about ubi beyond just the burden of taxes ubi has the potential to shift power dynamics active citizens those engaged in the democratic process collaboration activism and voting don t tend to support policies that are tailored to subsidizing corporations over the interests and wellbeing of millions ubi could also lessen the value of extreme wealth after all wealth is competitive by nature it comes from social perception owning three homes is so luxurious in part because many people can t afford one house at all plus wages costs could increase as people are no longer desperate to make ends meet if money suddenly became as abundant as receipts it wouldn t have the same power over individuals but that doesn t mean it couldn t still play a role in directing production however these ubi fears might easily shift as the economy automates a mass of unemployed workers who feel desperate to make ends meet is scary in a very different way also as goods and essential needs like food become more abundant withholding them over money scarcity becomes perceived as more shall we say immoral in the face of starvation unfortunately ubi doesn t necessarily mean more equality or shared prosperity in fact it can work to stabilize living conditions while also exacerbating inequality at the same time by keeping ubi at a level that is enough to meet basic needs but not enough to raise general prosperity the comparative wealth of the elite is maintained while everyone else gets enough security to wane the threat of riots and by ensuring the rate of return on money investments is higher than the redistribution of wealth through ubi or taxes the wealth of the rich will continue to grow while that of the other classes stagnates so it seems ubi could make inequality worse better or keep things similar to what they are today it has tremendous value for society and individuals it can help maintain democracy and a sense of personal freedom compared to semi authoritarian welfare states ultimately however ubi is a social choice not an economic or technological guarantee the debate will continue as the economy further automates through the 20s
a political earthquake hit mexico on 6 july with its elections for the first time in almost 70 years the institutional revolutionary party lost its absolute majority in the chamber of deputies it also lost several states and the mayorship of mexico city in chiapas the zapatista national liberation army issued no directives about the elections choosing instead to withdraw to the sheltering greenery of the lacandona forest from this sanctuary the head of the znla sub commandant marcos sent us this original and geostrategic analysis of the new world picture war is a matter of vital importance for the state it is the province of life and death the road which leads to survival or elimination it is essential to study it in depth sun tzu the art of war as a world system neoliberalism is a new war for the conquest of territory the ending of the third world war meaning the cold war in no sense means that the world has gone beyond the bipolar and found stability under the domination of a single victor because while there was certainly a defeat of the socialist camp it is hard to say who won the united states the european union japan all three the defeat of the evil empire has opened up new markets and the struggle over them is leading to a new world war the fourth like all major conflicts this war is forcing national states to redefine their identity the world order seems to have reverted to the earlier epochs of the conquests of america africa and oceania a strange modernity this which progresses by going backwards the twilight years of the 20th century bear more of a resemblance to the previous centuries of barbarism than to the rational futures described in science fiction novels vast territories wealth and above all a huge and available workforce lie waiting for the world s new master but while there is only one position as master on offer there are many aspiring candidates and that explains the new war between those who see themselves as part of the empire of good unlike the third world war in which the conflict between capitalism and socialism took place over a variety of terrains and with varying degrees of intensity the fourth world war is being conducted between major financial centres in theatres of war that are global in scale and with a level of intensity that is fierce and constant the ineptly named cold war actually reached very high temperatures from underground workings of international espionage to the interstellar space of ronald reagan s famous star wars from the sands of the bay of pigs in cuba to the mekong delta in vietnam from the frenzy of the nuclear arms race to the vicious coups d Ã©tat in latin america from the menacing manoeuvres of nato armies to the machinations of the cia agents in bolivia where che guevara was murdered the combination of all this led to the socialist camp being undermined as a world system and to its dissolution as a social alternative the third world war showed the benefits of total war for its victor which was capitalism in the post cold war period we see the emergence of a new planetary scenario in which the principal conflictual elements are the growing importance of no man s lands arising out of the collapse of the eastern bloc countries the expansion of a number of major powers the united states the european union and japan a world economic crisis and a new technical revolution based on information technology thanks to computers and the technological revolution the financial markets operating from their offices and answerable to nobody but themselves have been imposing their laws and world view on the planet as a whole globalisation is merely the totalitarian extension of the logic of the finance markets to all aspects of life where they were once in command of their economies the nation states and their governments are commanded or rather telecommanded by the same basic logic of financial power commercial free trade and in addition this logic has profited from a new permeability created by the development of telecommunications to appropriate all aspects of social activity at last a world war which is totally total one of its first victims has been the national market rather like a bullet fired inside a concrete room the war unleashed by neoliberalism ricochets and ends by wounding the person who fired it one of the fundamental bases of the power of the modern capitalist state the national market is wiped out by the heavy artillery of the global finance economy the new international capitalism renders national capitalism obsolete and effectively starves their public powers into extinction the blow has been so brutal that sovereign states have lost the strength to defend their citizens interests the fine showcase inherited from the ending of the cold war the new world order has shattered into fragments as a result of the neoliberal explosion it takes no more than a few minutes for companies and states to be sunk but they are sunk not by winds of proletarian revolution but by the violence of the hurricanes of world finance the son neoliberalism is devouring the father national capital and in the process is destroying the lies of capitalist ideology in the new world order there is neither democracy nor freedom neither equality nor fraternity the planetary stage is transformed into a new battlefield in which chaos reigns towards the end of the cold war capitalism created a new military horror the neutron bomb a weapon which destroys life while sparing buildings but a new wonder has been discovered as the fourth world war unfolds the finance bomb unlike the bombs at hiroshima and nagasaki this new bomb does not simply destroy the polis in this case the nation and bring death terror and misery to those who live there it also transforms its target into a piece in the jigsaw puzzle of the process of economic globalisation the result of the explosion is not a pile of smoking ruins or thousands of dead bodies but a neighbourhood added to one of the commercial megalopolis of the new planetary hypermarket and a labour force which is reshaped to fit in with the new planetary job market the european union is a result of this fourth world war in europe globalisation has succeeded in eliminating the frontiers between rival states that had been enemies for centuries and has forced them to converge towards political union on the way from the nation state to the european federation the road will be paved with destruction and ruin and one of these ruins will be that of european civilisation megalopolises are reproducing themselves right across the planet their favourite spawning ground is in the world s free trade areas in north america the north american free trade agreement between canada the united states and mexico is a prelude to the accomplishment of an old dream of us conquest america for the americans are megalopolises replacing nations no or rather not merely that they are assigning them new functions new limits and new perspectives entire countries are becoming departments of the neoliberal mega enterprise neoliberalism thus produces on the one hand destruction and depopulation and on the other the reconstruction and reorganisation of regions and nations unlike nuclear bombs which had a dissuasive intimidating and coercive character in the third world war the financial hyperbombs of the fourth world war are different in nature they serve to attack territories national states by the destruction of the material bases of their sovereignty and by producing a qualitative depopulation of those territories this depopulation involves the exclusion of all persons who are of no use to the new economy indigenous peoples for instance but at the same time the financial centres are working on a reconstruction of nation states and are reorganising them within a new logic the economic has the upper hand over the social the indigenous world is full of examples illustrating this strategy ian chambers director of the central america section of the international labour organisation has stated that the worldwide populations of indigenous peoples 300 million people lives in zones which house 60 of the planet s natural resources it is therefore not surprising that there are multiple conflicts over the use and future of their lands in relation to the interests of business and governments the exploitation of natural resources oil and minerals and tourism are the principal industries threatening indigenous territories in america 1 and then come pollution prostitution and drugs in this new war politics as the organiser of the nation state no longer exists now politics serves solely in order to manage the economy and politicians are now merely company managers the world s new masters have no need to govern directly national governments take on the role of running things on their behalf this is what the new order means unification of the world into one single market states are simply enterprises with managers in the guise of governments and the new regional alliances bear more of a resemblance to shopping malls than political federations the unification produced by neoliberalism is economic in the giant planetary hypermarket it is only commodities that circulate freely not people this economic globalisation is also accompanied by a general way of thinking the american way of life which followed american troops into europe during the second world war then to vietnam in the 1960s and more recently into the gulf war is now extending itself to the planet as a whole via computers what we have here is a destruction of the material bases of nation states but we also have a destruction of history and culture all the cultures which nations have forged the noble past of the indigenous peoples of the americas the brilliance of european civilisation the cultured history of the asian nations and the ancestral wealth of africa and oceania all these are under attack from the american way of life neoliberalism thus imposes the destruction of nations and of groups of nations in order to fuse them into one single model the war which neoliberalism is conducting against humanity is thus a planetary war and is the worst and most cruel ever seen what we have here is a puzzle when we attempt to put its pieces together in order to arrive at an understanding of today s world we find that a lot of the pieces are missing still we can make a start with seven of them in the hope that this conflict will not end with the destruction of humanity seven pieces to draw colour in cut out and put together with others in order to try to solve this global puzzle the first of these pieces is the two fold accumulation of wealth and of poverty at the two poles of planetary society the second is the total exploitation of the totality of the world the third is the nightmare of that part of humanity condemned to a life of wandering the fourth is the sickening relationship between crime and state power the fifth is state violence the sixth is the mystery of megapolitics the seventh is the multiple forms of resistance which humanity is deploying against neoliberalism piece no 1 the concentration of wealth and the distribution of poverty figure 1 is constructed by drawing a sign for money in the history of humanity a variety of models have fought it out over the erection of absurdities as the distinguishing features of world order neoliberalism will have pride of place when it comes to the prize giving because in its distribution of wealth all it achieves is a two fold absurdity of accumulation an accumulation of wealth for the few and an accumulation of poverty for millions of others injustice and inequality are the distinguishing traits of today s world the earth has five billion human inhabitants of these only 500 million live comfortably the remaining 4 5 billion endure lives of poverty the rich make up for their numerical minority by their ownership of billions of dollars the total wealth owned by the 358 richest people in the world the dollar billionaires is greater than the annual income of almost half the world s poorest inhabitants in other words about 2 6 billion people the progress of the major transnational companies does not necessarily involve the advance of the countries of the developed world on the contrary the richer these giant companies become the more poverty there is in the so called wealthy countries the gap between rich and poor is enormous far from decreasing social inequalities are growing this monetary sign that you have drawn represents the symbol of world economic power now colour it dollar green ignore the sickening stench this smell of dung mire and blood are the smells of its birthing piece no 2 the globalisation of exploitation figure 2 is constructed by drawing a triangle one of the lies of neoliberalism is that the economic growth of companies produces employment and a better distribution of wealth this is untrue in the same way that the increasing power of a king does not lead to an increase in the power of his subjects far from it the absolutism of finance capital does not improve the distribution of wealth and does not create jobs in fact its structural consequences are poverty unemployment and precariousness in the 1960s and 1970s the number of poor people in the world defined by the world bank as having an income of less than one dollar per day rose to some 200 million by the start of the 1990s their numbers stood at two billion hence increasing numbers of people who are poor or have been made poor fewer and fewer people who are rich or have become rich these are the lessons of piece 1 of our puzzle in order to obtain this absurd result the world capitalist system is modernising the production circulation and consumption of commodities the new technological revolution information technology and the new revolution in politics the megalopolises emerging from the ruins of the nation state produce a new social revolution this social revolution consists of a rearrangement a reorganisation of social forces and principally of the workforce the world s economically active population eap went from 1 38 billion in 1960 to 2 37 billion in 1990 a large increase in the number of human beings capable of working and generating wealth but the new world order arranges this workforce within specific geographical and productive areas and reassigns their functions or non functions in the case of unemployed and precarious workers within the plan of world globalisation the world s economically active population by sector eaps has undergone radical changes during the past 20 years agriculture and fishing fell from 22 in 1970 to 12 in 1990 manufacture from 25 to 22 but the tertiary sector commercial transport banking and services has risen from 42 to 56 in developing countries the tertiary sector has grown from 40 in 1970 to 57 in 1990 while agriculture and fishing have fallen from 30 to 15 2 this means that increasing numbers of workers are channelled into the kind of activities necessary for increasing productivity or speeding up the creation of commodities the neoliberal system thus functions as a kind of mega boss for whom the world market is viewed as a single unified enterprise to be managed by modernising criteria but neoliberalism s modernity seems closer to the bestial birth of capitalism as a world system than to utopian rationality because this modern capitalist production continues to rely on child labour out of 1 15 billion children in the world at least 100 million live on the streets and 200 million work and according to forecasts this figure will rise to 400 million by the year 2000 in asia alone 146 million children work in manufacturing and in the north too hundreds of thousands of children have to work in order to supplement family incomes or merely to survive there are also many children employed in the pleasure industries according to the united nations every year a million children are driven into the sex trade the unemployment and precarious labour of millions of workers throughout the world is a reality which does not look set to disappear in the countries of the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd unemployment went from 3 8 in 1966 to 6 3 in 1990 in europe it went from 2 2 to 6 4 the globalised market is destroying small and medium sized companies with the disappearance of local and regional markets small and medium producers have no protection and are unable to compete with the giant transnationals millions of workers thus find themselves unemployed one of the absurdities of neoliberalism is that far from creating jobs the growth of production actually destroys them the un speaks of growth without jobs but the nightmare does not end there workers are also being forced to accept precarious conditions less job security longer working hours and lower wages these are the consequences of globalisation in general and the explosion in the service sector in particular all this combines to create a specific surplus an excess of human beings who are useless in terms of the new world order because they do not produce do not consume and do not borrow from banks in short human beings who are disposable each day the big finance centres impose their laws on countries and groups of countries all around the world they re arrange and re order the inhabitants of those countries and at the end of the operation they find there is still an excess of people what you have now is a figure resembling a triangle this depicts the pyramid of worldwide exploitation piece no 3 migration a nightmare of wandering figure 3 is constructed by drawing a circle we have already spoken of the existence at the end of the third world war of new territories waiting to be conquered the former socialist countries and others to be re conquered for the new world order this situation involves the financial centres in a threefold strategy there is a proliferation of regional wars and internal conflicts capital follows paths of atypical accumulation and large masses of workers are mobilised result a huge rolling wheel of millions of migrants moving across the planet as foreigners in that world without frontiers which had been promised by the victors of the cold war they are forced to endure racist persecution precarious employment the loss of their cultural identity police repression hunger imprisonment and murder the nightmare of emigration whatever its cause continues to grow the number of those coming within the ambit of the united nations high commission for refugees unhcr has grown disproportionately from 2 million in 1975 to more than 27 million in 1995 the objective of neoliberalism s migration policy is more to destabilise the world labour market than to put a brake on immigration the fourth world war with its mechanisms of destruction depopulation and reconstruction reorganisation involves the displacement of millions of people their destiny is to wander the world carrying the burden of their nightmare with them so as to constitute a threat to workers who have a job a scapegoat designed to make people forget their bosses and to provide a basis for the racism that neoliberalism provokes piece no 4 financial globalisation and the generalisation of crime figure 4 is constructed by drawing a rectangle if you think that the world of crime has to be shady and underhand you are wrong in the period of the so called cold war organised crime acquired a more respectable image not only did it begin to function in the same way as any other modern enterprise but it also penetrated deeply into the political and economic systems of nation states with the beginning of the fourth world war organised crime has globalised its activities the criminal organisations of five continents have taken on board the spirit of world cooperation and have joined together in order to participate in the conquest of new markets they are investing in legal businesses not only in order to launder dirty money but in order to acquire capital for illegal operations their preferred activities are luxury property investment the leisure industry the media and banking ali baba and the forty bankers worse than that commercial banks are using the dirty money of organised crime for their legal activities according to a un report the involvement of crime syndicates has been facilitated by the programmes of structural adjustment which debtor countries have been forced to accept in order to gain access to international monetary fund loans 3 organised crime also relies on the existence of tax havens there are some 55 of these one of them the cayman islands ranks fifth in the world as a banking centre and has more banks and registered companies than inhabitants as well as laundering money these tax paradises make it possible to escape taxation they are places for contact between governments businessmen and mafia bosses so here we have the rectangular mirror within which legality and illegality exchange reflections on which side of the mirror is the criminal and on which side is the person who pursues him piece no 5 legitimate violence of illegitimate powers figure 5 is constructed by drawing a pentagon in the cabaret of globalisation the state performs a striptease at the end of which it is left wearing the minimum necessary its powers of repression with its material base destroyed its sovereignty and independence abolished and its political class eradicated the nation state increasingly becomes a mere security apparatus in the service of the mega enterprises which neoliberalism is constructing instead of orienting public investment towards social spending it prefers to improve the equipment which enables it to control society more effectively what is to be done when the violence derives from the laws of the market where is legitimate violence then and where the illegitimate what monopoly of violence can the hapless nation states demand when the free interplay of supply and demand defies any such monopoly have we not shown in piece 4 that organised crime government and finance centres are intimately interlinked is it not obvious that organised crime has veritable armies on which it can count the monopoly of violence no longer belongs to nation states the market has put it up for auction however when the monopoly of violence is contested not on the basis of the laws of the market but in the interests of those from below then world power sees it as aggression this is one of the least studied and most condemned aspects of the challenges launched by the indigenous peoples in arms and in rebellion of the zapatista national liberation army against neoliberalism and for humanity the symbol of american military power is the pentagon the new world police wants national armies and police to be simple security bodies guaranteeing order and progress within the megalopolises of neoliberalism piece no 6 megapolitics and its dwarfs figure 6 is constructed by scribbling a doodle we said earlier that nation states are attacked by the finance markets and forced to dissolve themselves within megalopolises but neoliberalism does not conduct its war solely by unifying nations and regions its strategy of destruction depopulation and reconstruction reorganisation also produces a fracture or fractures within the nation state this is the paradox of this fourth world war while ostensibly working to eliminate frontiers and unite nations it actually leads to a multiplication of frontiers and the smashing apart of nations if anyone still doubts that this globalisation is a world war let them look at the conflicts that arose out of the collapse of the ussr of czechoslovakia and of yugoslavia and the deep crises which have shattered not only the political and economic foundations of nation states but also their social cohesion both the construction of megalopolises and the fragmentation of states are founded on the destruction of the nation state are these two independent and parallel events are they symptoms of a mega crisis about to occur or are they simply separate and isolated facts we think that they represent a contradiction inherent in the process of globalisation and one of the core realities of the neoliberal model the elimination of trade frontiers the explosion of telecommunications information superhighways the omnipresence of financial markets international free trade agreements all this contributes to destroying nation states and internal markets paradoxically globalisation produces a fragmented world of isolated pieces a world full of watertight compartments which may at best be linked by fragile economic gangways a world of broken mirrors which reflect the useless world unity of the neoliberal puzzle but neoliberalism does not merely fragment the world which it claims to be unifying it also produces the political and economic centre which directs this war it is urgent that we embark on a discussion of this mega politics mega politics globalises national politics in other words it ties them to a centre which has world interests and which operates on the logic of the market it is in the name of the market that wars credits buying and selling of commodities diplomatic recognition trade blocs political support laws on immigration breakdowns of relationships between countries and investment in short the survival of entire nations are decided the world wide power of the financial markets is such that they are not concerned about the political complexion of the leaders of individual countries what counts in their eyes is a country s respect for the economic programme financial disciplines are imposed on all alike these masters of the world can even tolerate the existence of left wing governments on condition that they adopt no measure likely to harm the interests of the market however they will never accept policies that tend to break with the dominant model in the eyes of mega politics national politics are conducted by dwarfs who are expected to comply with the dictates of the financial giant and this is the way it will always be until the dwarfs revolt here then you have the figure which represents mega politics impossible to find the slightest rationality in it piece no 7 pockets of resistance figure 7 is constructed by drawing a pocket to begin with i ask you not to confuse resistance with political opposition opposition does not oppose itself to power but to a government and its fully formed shape is that of an opposition party resistance on the other hand cannot be a party by definition it is not made in order to govern but to resist tomÃ¡s segovia alegatorio mexico 1996 the apparent infallibility of globalisation comes up hard against the stubborn disobedience of reality while neoliberalism is pursuing its war groups of protesters kernels of rebels are forming throughout the planet the empire of financiers with full pockets confronts the rebellion of pockets of resistance yes pockets of all sizes of different colours of varying shapes their sole common point is a desire to resist the new world order and the crime against humanity that is represented by this fourth world war neoliberalism attempts to subjugate millions of beings and seeks to rid itself of all those who have no place in its new ordering of the world but these disposable people are in revolt women children old people young people indigenous peoples ecological militants homosexuals lesbians hiv activists workers and all those who upset the ordered progress of the new world system and who organise and are in struggle resistance is being woven by those who are excluded from modernity in mexico for example the so called programme for integral development of the tehuantepec isthmus is conceived as constructing a large industrial zone this zone would consist of industrial factories a refinery to process one third of mexico s crude oil and plant to make petrochemical products transit routes between the two oceans would be built roads a canal and a trans isthmus railway two million peasants would become workers in these industrial and transportation sectors in the same way in the south east of mexico in the lacandona forest a long term regional development programme is being set up with the object of making available to capital indigenous lands that are rich not only in dignity and history but also in oil and uranium these projects would end up by fragmenting mexico separating the south east from the rest of the country they are also framed within a strategy of counter insurgency like a pincer movement attempting to encircle the rebellion against neoliberalism that was born in 1994 at the centre are to be found the indigenous rebels of the zapatista national liberation army while we are on the subject of rebellious indigenous peoples a parenthesis would be in order the zapatistas believe that in mexico recovery and defence of national sovereignty are part of the anti liberal revolution paradoxically the znla finds itself accused of attempting to fragment the mexican nation the reality is that the only forces that have spoken for separatism are the businessmen of the oil rich state of tabasco and the institutional revolutionary party members of parliament from chiapas the zapatistas for their part think that it is necessary to defend the nation state in the face of globalisation and that the attempts to break mexico into fragments are being made by the government and not by the just demands of the indian peoples for autonomy the znla and the majority of the national indigenous movement want the indian peoples not to separate from mexico but to be recognised as an integral part of the country with their own specificities they also aspire to a mexico which espouses democracy freedom and justice whereas the znla fights to defend national sovereignty the mexican federal army functions to protect a government which has destroyed the material bases of sovereignty and which has offered the country not only to large scale foreign capital but also to drug trafficking it is not only in the mountains of south east mexico that neoliberalism is being resisted in other regions of mexico in latin america in the united states and canada in the europe of the maastricht treaty in africa in asia and in oceania pockets of resistance are multiplying each has its own history its specificities its similarities its demands its struggles and its successes if humanity hopes to survive and to improve itself its only hope lies in these pockets which are created by the excluded the marginalised and those who are considered disposable so what we have here is a drawing of a pocket of resistance but don t attach too much importance to it the possible shapes are as numerous as the forms of resistance themselves as numerous as all the worlds existing in this world so draw whatever shape you like in this matter of pockets as in that of resistance diversity is a wealth having now drawn coloured and cut out these seven pieces you will notice that it is impossible to fit them together this is the problem globalisation has been seeking to put together pieces which don t fit for this reason and for others which i cannot develop in this article it is necessary to build a new world a world in which there is room for many worlds a world capable of containing all the worlds a post script which speaks of dreams couched in love the sea rests at my side for a long time it has shared my anxieties my uncertainties and many of my dreams but now it sleeps with me in the hot night of the forest i watch its rippling movements in its sleep and i am struck with wonder again at finding it unchanged warm fresh and at my side the stifling heat of the night draws me from my bed and guides my hand and my pen to summon up old antonio today as he was many years ago i asked old antonio to go with me on an exploration up the river we took only a bit of stew to eat for hours we followed the winding riverbed and in the end hunger and the heat began to get to us we spent the afternoon following a herd of boars it was almost night when we eventually caught up with them suddenly a huge wild boar detached itself from the group and attacked us summoning up all my military know how i threw away my gun and climbed the nearest tree old antonio was unarmed but instead of running away he placed himself behind a thicket of canes the giant boar ran straight at him with its full force and found itself caught up in the undergrowth before it could disentangle itself old antonio lifted his big old stick and with one blow provided our evening meal the next morning when i had finished cleaning my modern automatic rifle a 5 56mm m 16 with a range of 460 metres a telescopic sight and a drum magazine holding 90 bullets i settled down to write my field diary omitting most of what had happened i noted only met wild boar a killed one height 350 metres did not rain while we were waiting for the meat to grill i told old antonio that my portion would serve for the festivities that were being prepared back at base festivities he asked poking the fire yes i said whatever the month there s always something to celebrate and i embarked on what i thought was a brilliant dissertation on the zapatistas historical calendar and celebrations old antonio listened to me in silence then imagining that he was not finding it interesting i settled down to sleep while i was still half awake i saw old antonio take my notebook and write something in it the next day after breakfast we shared out the meat and each went our separate ways when i reached camp i reported back and showed the notes i had made in my notebook that s not your writing someone said pointing to the page in question there beneath what i had written old antonio had written in large letters if you cannot have both reason and strength always choose reason and leave strength to the enemy in many battles it is force that makes it possible to win a victory but the struggle as a whole can only be won by reason the strong man will never be able to draw reason from his strength whereas we can always draw strength from our reason and down below in smaller letters he had written happy festivities obviously i was no longer hungry and as usual the zapatista festivities were indeed happy

pdf save it to your desktop read it on your tablet or email to your colleagues q1 hedge fund letters conference scoops etc transcript consuelo i think it will the u s is good at some industries that the rest of the world is not very good at and some of these industries we dominate some of these industries that i m thinking about are things like technology big chunks of technology we dominate you think about amazon or google or facebook much of the software space is dominated by american companies and these companies simply don t exist outside the united states with you know maybe a few exceptions and then you think about biotechnology that s largely driven by the united states and innovations and most innovations in health care not certainly not all but many innovations in health care driven by what s going on in the united states so i think you know as long as these growth industries of the future are dominated by what s going on in the united states you know you re going to have opportunities to invest in things here that you don t have in other parts of the world and how long do you think the dominance will continue because i m thinking you know there are all these statistics about the number of new patents for instance that are being issued globally and the chinese are apps dominating yeah new patents new ideas new technologies do you see any immediate threat to our tech technological dominance for instance or are our dominance in drug creation or no i don t i think it s gonna be a long time before the chinese catch up and these new industries are two to three generations behind in chip production for example they re totally dependent on many of their companies on videos chip and in the biotechnology area they re just beginning to do research in many areas of technology biotechnology so i think it s going to in 20 25 years from now it may be a different story but as long as as long as people continue to innovate in this country and innovation is rewarded you know if you re an entrepreneur in the united states you can you can benefit a lot from the from europe innovations in right and in many other countries and possibly china not always but sometimes you don t always enjoy the benefits of those innovations and she that makes a difference does it does do you think that growth is going to continue to outperform value i do i do i think a lot of value stocks have value traps because it s a digital economy today the businesses that that added a lot of value in the past are being disciplined mediated and i m not talking about taxes and uber i m talking about you know software companies replacing other companies that provided the same service and now you can buy it software a quarter of the price a lot of industrial companies are or are being dissenter mediated by other companies and so we d like to find companies one of our sort of pillars of our investment style is to find areas where there s not a lot of competition right because if we can find areas where there s not a lot of competition you typically have more pricing flexibility and you d like to have the ability to raise prices and that s why these data providers companies like that are so valuable because they can raise prices because they re little monopolies so if i look at the global equity fund versus the international fund for instance what kinds of companies have made the biggest difference for the global equity fund that you couldn t invest in in the international fund so the software area has been the biggest difference and there s a couple of companies in the health care sector i think some names in the tool sector you know we like the companies that make the tools that allow medical research to be done companies like danaher companies like perkin elmer companies like buy or read these companies these industries are dominated by us companies things for instance are the fangs now what we ve done is what do we what have you done with the funding well we put a couple of the things in the international fund right you might say well they re not exactly international but in our view they are unique companies that operate globally so a very small part of the international fund is invested in u s companies right and i think it is 14 percent or something right and these are mainly things right now and artists and you describe the kind of companies you buy basically is having sustainable growth at reasonable prices so what does sustainable growth mean what are you looking for so consuelo that means we re looking for companies that are not going to be around for a year or two years or three years they re going to be around for 20 years companies that continue to innovate companies that continue to grow nicely we ve owned for over 15 years it s been a wonderful stock it s more than tripled may have quadrupled and you think that s a big dumb boring food company but actually it s terribly innovative they have great products they re respected around the world
editors note this week we re running a mini series on argentina s current financial crisis with an election coming up it s an important moment to reflect on the failures of president mauricio macri s promises to restore the country s economy part 1 covers the specifics of argentina s macroeconomic policies and why a renewed alliance with the imf will only exacerbate austerity policies at the expense of the working class part 2 covers president macri s stunted efforts to bring fracking to argentina will argentina continue down this path or will the people seek out an alternative here s part 1 three and a half years after mauricio macri came to power in argentina in december 2015 on the promise of fixing the country s economy it has instead fallen into a deep recession in response the government has turned to the international monetary fund imf for help with memories of the last imf bailout still fresh in the minds of argentinians today what little credit existed in macri s early days has dried up and sky high interest rates are encouraging financial speculation over productive investment unemployment and poverty rates have risen sharply as have the number of people with basic needs unmet plunging economic activity has negatively affected fiscal revenue so meeting the zero deficit target requires new spending cuts to top it all off inflation has risen reaching almost 50 percent in 2018 economic growth and development are terms that have been virtually erased from official public discourse and policy objectives this panorama lies in stark contrast to macri s campaign promises which included reducing inflation to a single digit and a downpour of investments that would arrive from abroad when investors saw how business friendly the new government was this in turn would lead to greater stability economic growth and more jobs and all would be well again he claimed macri s election followed 12 years of center left rule under peronists nÃ©stor kirchner 2003 2007 and cristina fernÃ¡ndez de kirchner often known as cfk 2007 2015 in the first years under the kirchners argentina s economy had improved steadily the first two kirchner administrations were marked by a strong economic recovery from the 1998 2002 recession and massive 2001 2002 crisis with high rates of economic growth sharp reductions in poverty and unemployment and a substantial upturn in real wages and consumption this resulted from a heterodox economic policy framework aimed at developing the domestic market using expansionary monetary and fiscal policy and a managed exchange rate that favored domestic consumption and production yet during cfk s second term however problems began to crop up first international commodity prices began to decline increasing pressure on argentina s foreign sector accounts in response cfk implemented exchange controls or government imposed limits on foreign currency operations which led to the development of a black market exchange rate where argentines traded pesos with dollars and other currencies as the value of their money depreciated second inconsistencies in the management of monetary and exchange rate policies resulted in inflation and appreciated exchange rates third new york judge griesa s 2012 ruling in favor of hold out vulture funds suing argentina temporarily interrupted debt service payments and access to foreign capital markets prompting fears of a government default the government struggled to respond to challenges requiring policy adjustments until it was too late furthermore sectors of the electorate became discontented with exchange controls and inflation decisively influencing the outcome of the 2015 presidential election big business and especially finance were optimistic in the face of macri s electoral victory bloomberg welcomed macri with a revealing headline wall street is in charge in argentina again they were right from his first day in office macri implemented typical neoliberal trade and finance liberalization policies removing most barriers to the free movement of goods and services and more importantly finance including eliminating exchange controls the government s hope was that by neoliberalizing the economy foreign investment would flow in and thus correct external imbalances for a country experiencing a shortage of foreign exchange this move risked making external imbalances worse the result of these policies was to flood the local market with imported goods killing local jobs and businesses and worsening the trade balance while foreign investments never materialized for the first two years the macri administration issued massive amounts of public debt to service the country s external deficit most of it denominated in foreign currency however by february 2018 foreign capital markets had largely stopped bankrolling argentina setting off a run on the peso resulting in devaluation and a surge in inflation the lack of access to foreign credit meant that argentina was headed for another default or a forced debt restructuring at best enter the imf at that point argentine authorities turned to the imf in desperation it wasn t the first time argentina turned to the imf in 2000 when after three years of recession it was unable to service its massive debt the imf conditioned its loans on fiscal spending cuts accelerating argentina s economic downturn and making the massive december 2001 crisis that followed inevitable not much has changed at the imf in the 18 years since argentina s last experience in mid june 2018 argentina had signed a three year stand by agreement for 50 billion the largest loan in the imf s history with a seriously flawed diagnostic of argentina s problems as a point of departure the conditions attached to the loan were vintage imf fiscal austerity with a zero fiscal deficit target excluding debt service payments a renewed commitment to an inflation targeting monetary policy a floating exchange rate regime and ending central bank financing of the treasury among others however by mid august 2018 after another run on the peso consumed most of the imf s first disbursement of 15 billion argentina s authorities once again turned to the imf to request a larger loan by the end of september the imf had approved a 6 3 billion extension to the original loan with new conditions attached and more importantly a substantially accelerated disbursement schedule 90 percent of the loan would be disbursed before december 2019 with presidential elections in october 2019 many interpreted this move as a clear show of imf support for macri s reelection among the new conditions was a 180 degree change in monetary and exchange rate policies the obvious failure of targeting inflation through a freely floating exchange rate framework led the imf to implement a zero growth target for the monetary base or no inflation a very recessionary tool the argentine central bank increased its nominal interest rate to more than 70 percent in order to withdraw pesos from circulation and meet the target it also implemented a floating exchange rate limited to an inflation adjusted range if the exchange rate moves outside of that range the central bank is allowed to intervene in the foreign exchange market all of this implies that imf lenders see exchange rate stability as key to lowering inflation in argentina what have been the results of argentina s new engagement with the imf in the foreword to the april 2019 world economic outlook report the imf noted that macroeconomic instability in argentina and turkey and numerous other factors have all contributed to a significantly weakened global expansion especially in the second half of 2018 since consumption investment and economic activity dropped significantly and inflation almost doubled since the agreement was signed the imf is implicitly acknowledging that its policy recommendations in argentina have failed and are contributing to the slowdown in global economic growth while the first stand by agreement enabled argentina to avoid a default and foreign creditors to get paid the second agreement incentivized capital flight by providing additional dollars to short term speculators not unlike the capital flight that led up to the 2001 2002 crisis in other words argentina is again at the edge of the abyss facing a potentially explosive economic and social situation just ahead of presidential elections in october what to expect will argentina end up going over the edge or turn around and find its way back to growth and development the answer depends in part on the outcome of the upcoming elections where there will likely be two clear alternatives the first is either macri or another candidate from within his political party macri s support and approval ratings have plunged since mid 2018 as a result many are suggesting that marÃ­a eugenia vidal governor of the province of buenos aires should run in his place regardless of who the candidate is the policy program is clear in a recent interview when asked what his economic program would be if reelected macri said he would continue with the same policies but at a faster rate one can expect greater austerity a reprivatization of the social security system labor flexibilization i e further erosion of workers rights and deeper cuts in public sector wages and employment in other words an acceleration of the downward spiral already in place with a major crisis as a likely outcome this would be the over the edge option the alternative is a candidacy centered around former president cfk who announced on may 18 that she would run for the primary elections of the peronist party as a vice presidential candidate to her former chief of staff alberto fernÃ¡ndez cfk remains the opposition politician with the most support but while her approval rating has increased in recent months she still faces a considerable portion of the electorate who do not want her back in office while the fernÃ¡ndez team has not spelled out an economic plan in detail they have spoken of the need to reactivate economic growth job creation and consumption and to control inflation through a social pact of citizen responsibility should they or a similar candidate win they will almost certainly have to negotiate a private debt restructuring but perhaps the most difficult negotiation will be with the imf since almost the entire loan as it stands must be paid off by the end of 2023 this will most certainly be the trickiest aspect of an opposition victory given how inflexible the imf has proven to be in these kinds of negotiations as imf managing director christine lagarde recently stated it would be foolish on the part of any candidate to turn their back to the work that is underway but hopefully argentina will do just that leave imf austerity and neoliberalism behind and more importantly learn the lesson once and for all that neoliberalism and the imf are antithetical to development alan ciblis is an argentine economist and chair of the political economy department at the universidad nacional de general sarmiento in

cnn during his monday morning interview with cnbc president donald trump claimed that china has lost 15 to 20 trillion dollars in value since the day i was elected facts first this isn t even close to true nor is it clear what trump is actually referencing here the entire size of the chinese economy is estimated to be around 13 trillion so it s impossible for it to lose more than it is worth on top of that china s economy has continued to expand during trump s time in office china s gdp growth has remained above 6 since trump was elected in november 2016 while chinese economic growth has started to slow that trend was already underway before trump was elected in 2017 china s gdp was 12 238 trillion according to the world bank while current estimates are hard to come by china s economy grew by 6 6 in 2018 which would put the size of the economy just over 13 trillion if china were to lose 15 to 20 trillion it would completely wipe the country off the face of the world s economic map the bigger point trump seems to be making here is that his trade policies are hurting china s economy that at least does carry a kernel of truth as economists have noted however the us economy is harmed by these tariffs as well since his first round of tariffs against china went into effect last summer us imports from china have dropped sharply as companies have begun to switch their sourcing to other east asian countries like vietnam in the first 4 months of 2019 americans imported about 12 less from china compared to the same period last year according to the research firm capital economics the 25 tariff on all chinese goods that trump is set to impose could shave 0 8 percentage points off china s gdp just under half of that gdp decrease capital economics estimates should have already happened due to lower tariffs on intermediate goods such as steel over the course of a year this estimated 0 8 hit could account for roughly 100 billion dollars nowhere near trump s 15 to 20 trillion figure french wine trump hinted at potential action against france over the price of wine during his phone interview with cnbc you know france charges us a lot for the wine and yet we charge them very little for american wine so the wineries come to me and say sir the california guys they come sir we re paying a lot of money to put our product into france and you re letting meaning this country is allowing this french wine which are some great wines but we have great wines too allowing it to come in for nothing it s not fair trump said and you know what it s not fair we ll do something about it he continued facts first this isn t quite true while us tariffs on wine from the european union are smaller than the eu s tariff on american wine according to the wine institute contrary to what trump said the us does not allow french wine to come in for nothing the eu s import tariff on wine for a 750 ml bottle can range from 0 11 to 0 29 depending on the type alcoholic content of the wine the institute states by comparison the us import tariff on a 750 ml bottle is 0 05 for still wine and 0 14 for sparkling wine and while the us and eu maintain a 2006 agreement on wine trade the institute argues that the eu has since created certain restrictions that increase costs or otherwise affect the ability of us wine to compete in the eu one main restriction comes in the form of a certification for wine imports from the us the us doesn t have similar certification for french wine imports another restriction that makes it more difficult for american wine producers to sell in europe is a limit on the use of common wine descriptors including chateau clos tawny and ruby for their products what trump will actually do about the price of wine is unclear but the president threatened tariffs on france s wines part of a larger tariff threat against the european union late last year france makes excellent wine but so does the u s the problem is that france makes it very hard for the u s to sell its wines into france and charges big tariffs whereas the u s makes it easy for french wines and charges very small tariffs not fair must change trump tweeted last november european wine and cheese were also among the goods the us trade representative s office threatened to place tariffs on in april china s currency manipulation trump contradicted his own treasury department by calling china a currency manipulator weeks after the agency skipped slapping that label on the asian giant they devalue their currency they have for years it s put them at a tremendous competitive advantage the president said during his interview on cnbc before proceeding to attack the federal reserve for not lowering interest rates in the us facts first china s currency has fallen 9 against the us dollar over the past year according to one economic research firm but its recent depreciation didn t trigger the us government taking the rare step of formally labeling beijing a currency manipulator last month speaking to cnbc trump said the sharp decline in china s currency absolutely needs to be addressed as the yuan has depreciated to help offset tariffs on billions of dollars of chinese goods amid an ongoing trade war between the two major economic superpowers economists appear to agree that the weaker currency whether by design or not has softened the blow of tariffs on china by making its goods cheaper but it also raises the risk that the trade dispute could spiral into a currency war a research note by capital economics released monday points out that the weaker currency has provided a cushion since the first tariffs came in adding that the yuan is 9 weaker against the dollar and 6 in trade weighted terms since this time last year a further leg down is likely if china s leaders conclude that there is little point in holding out for a deal according to the report if president trump goes ahead with the threatened 25 tariff on the remainder of china s goods we believe that the renminbi would be allowed to weaken on sunday people s bank of china governor yi gang acknowledged the weakness in his country s currency in an exclusive interview with bloomberg news suggesting that it was indeed a result of the trade war with the us there is obviously a link between the trade war and the movements of renminbi yi said in the interview in beijing recently it s a little bit weaker because of the tremendous pressure from the us side in late may the treasury department declined once again to label china a currency manipulator despite trump s pledge to do so during his 2016 campaign instead the country was placed on treasury s monitoring list in its review of us trading partners along with eight other countries to be fair treasury s report highlighted significant concerns over the meaningful depreciation of china s currency against the us dollar a critical component of ongoing trade talks and urged china to take steps to avoid a persistently weak currency treasury will continue its enhanced bilateral engagement with china regarding exchange rate issues given that the rmb has fallen against the dollar by eight percent over the last year in the context of an extremely large and widening bilateral trade surplus said treasury secretary steven mnuchin in a statement in may still the treasury department said that while china doesn t disclose its foreign exchange interventions it estimates that direct intervention by the people s bank of china in the last year has been limited mnuchin met with china s central bank governor yi over the weekend on the sidelines of the g20 economic summit in fukuoka japan in a tweet mnuchin described the meeting as constructive with a candid discussion on trade issues it s unclear if the two men discussed currency issues immigration deal at another point in his cnbc interview trump said that the us got everything we wanted out of negotiations with mexico last week the president threatened to slap tariffs on mexico if the country didn t step up immigration enforcement and prevent more migrants from crossing into the us from the southern border illegally high level negotiations between the us and mexico ensued in washington last week and the two countries signed onto a joint declaration agreeing to several immigration enforcement provisions ceasing the pursuit of tariffs friday night we got everything we wanted and we re going to be a great partner to mexico now because now they respect us they didn t even respect us trump told cnbc facts first trump s claim that the us got everything we wanted in negotiations misconstrues what we know about the bilateral negotiations one key element of negotiations is about so called safe state status and trump s statements were misleading on the scope and timeline of that provision trump also touted that the us is going to be essentially using to a large extent the very powerful immigration laws of mexico and mexico wants to do a good job they re moving 6 000 soldiers to their southern border do you think they agreed to do that before he added but despite trump s suggestion that the provisions are new the new york times reported that the us and mexico had agreed months earlier to some of the border policies described in last week s joint declaration the mexican government had pledged to deploy the national guard nationwide with a focus on its southern border a key part of friday s agreement during secret meetings in march between former homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen and mexican interior secretary olga sanchez in miami us and mexican officials familiar with the negotiations told the times the deal s key expansion of a program that would keep asylum seekers in mexico while their claims are processed was established in two heavily brokered diplomatic notes exchanged between the two countries the times reported nielsen announced the migrant protection protocols during a house judiciary committee hearing in late december trump disputed the times story in a series of tweets sunday morning writing that his administration like others before it had been working toward some aspects of the deal for a long time but said they were not able to get them or get them in full until our signed agreement with mexico companies leaving china during the interview trump suggested that beijing will agree to a deal because the tariffs he s imposed on chinese goods are driving away business china deal s going to work out you know why because of tariffs because right now china is getting absolutely decimated by companies that are leaving china going to other countries including our own he said facts first this is a bit of an overstatement there is evidence that us importers are shifting part of their production outside china since trump imposed tariffs but little shows that there s a mass exodus of companies that are relocating entirely away from china a process that would likely take years there are currently tariffs on 250 billion of chinese goods giving us importers an incentive to find suppliers outside of china to avoid paying the tariff trade data published by the us census bureau last week suggests that they are buying more from other asian countries while importing about 12 less from china this year us imports are up 38 from vietnam 22 from taiwan 17 from south korea and 13 from bangladesh during the first four months of 2019 compared to last year while those are significant increases some production was already moving outside of china to places with even lower wages long before trump began imposing tariffs us imports from countries like vietnam and south korea have been steadily increasing over the past decade as those countries ramped up manufacturing of apparel and electronics respectively plus the united states imports more overall when the economy is strong still it s unclear whether companies are genuinely shifting production outside of china or simply rerouting goods for minimal processing before being shipped to the us the uptick in imports from vietnam and taiwan suggests that at least partially explains what is happening according to a report from capital economics a research consulting firm based in london plus it s not always easy to find a supplier outside of china that can manufacture the same good with the same quality and for a cheaper price instead an importer may decide to eat the cost betting that trump will lift the tariffs sooner rather than later they can also choose to pass the cost on to consumers for the time being about 60 of companies surveyed last month by the american chamber of commerce amcham and its counterpart in shanghai said they have no plans to relocate manufacturing outside of china because of the tariffs who pays the tariffs the president claimed there has been no price increase on products subject to the tariffs he imposed on chinese goods you haven t seen any or virtually any price increase said trump because what china does it s basically their companies they subsidize their companies because they want to keep people working they want to stay competitive facts first if only it were so simple while inflation has remained relatively low in the us new research suggests that prices on products subject to tariffs have risen significantly economists at goldman sachs found that prices on categories of goods subject to tariffs imposed last year the bulk of which fell on chinese imports have risen sharply compared with categories without new tariffs put another way goldman estimates that 40 of the cost of tariffs has been passed on to consumers with the rest split between producers and retailers so far these tariffs have almost doubled customs revenue bringing billions of tax dollars into the treasury prices have risen the most for goods subject to tariffs regardless of what country they came from because it s not possible to avoid the duties by buying from somewhere else on washing machines for example studies show that consumers absorbed more than the cost of the initial tariffs since the prices of complementary goods clothes dryers in this case went up as well according to a paper from economists at princeton columbia and the new york federal reserve us companies and consumers were paying 3 billion a month more on account of the tariffs by the end of 2018 in the administration s own economic report it admits that consumers will pay a higher price for products in the wake of these tariffs offsetting these benefits are the costs paid by consumers in the form of higher prices and reduced consumption the economic report of the president published in march states

this article first appeared in forum the edge malaysia weekly on june 10 2019 june 16 2019 the gods have been conspiring against the world economy where nothing seems to be going right economic activity is losing vitality virtually everywhere even the seemingly unstoppable us economy is slowing tensions between the us and china are escalating and this has not stopped the us from ramping up trade aggression even against friendly nations such as malaysia and singapore or potential strategic allies such as india how bad will things get and what will the impact be on regional economies in short our view is that economic conditions are likely to deteriorate further financial markets seem to think that monetary easing will prevent the slowdown from turning into a downward spiral that could be true but only up to a point there are some fundamental unknowns how the us and china conduct their relations how convinced businesses across the globe are that the downside risks can be contained and whether the slower global economy might trigger financial imbalances in china and elsewhere until there is clarity on these factors the downside risks will grow what has gone wrong the news in the past two weeks has been unremittingly depressing first it is clear that the slowdown in global economic activity is much worse than most of us thought the latest purchasing manager indices pmis show sharp contractions in manufacturing activity across all the major economies the global manufacturing pmi fell to 49 8 in may from 50 4 in april registering its lowest level since october 2012 business sentiments and the state of new orders all point to continued contraction in manufacturing around the world even the phenomenal us job machine seems to be sputtering as private sector job creation slowed significantly in may south korean exports a bellwether for export performance in other asian countries as it is released earlier are falling sharply dragged down by a precipitous fall in demand in china not a good sign for how the world s second largest economy is doing the decline in hong kong s pmi to its lowest level in three years also reflects the troubled state of the chinese economy second china s economy remains fragile the authorities have been forced to step in and take over a small bank bao shang bank because of what the regulators said was the severe credit risk that the bank posed following that speculation is swirling over how many other such banks could be in trouble some bank analysts have pointed to the rising number of banks in china that have delayed reporting their financial statements for the first quarter while others have also named some that have seen auditors resign suddenly an indicator of serious problems in those banks if in this precarious time for banks the economy slows sharply and causes cash flows of borrowers to fall then non performing loans will rise and more banks could be in jeopardy that could send the economy into a tailspin third frictions between china and the us have escalated china is now openly talking about hitting back against the us by restricting exports of vitally needed rare earth metals and drawing up a list of unreliable foreign firms operating in china the chinese authorities observed that this list would include foreign legal persons and other organisations or individuals who are suspected of damaging the legitimate rights and interest of chinese companies and jeopardising china s national security and interests that s a clear sign that us companies which have more than us 150 billion of sales in china could be targeted china has already initiated an investigation into fedex corp after it misrouted packages that were meant to be delivered to china s telecommunications giant huawei fourth the dislocation from the trade wars is now becoming more tangible and could compound the global slowdown large companies with extensive supply chains seem to be reaching the conclusion that they can no longer wait to see if somehow china and the us might pull off a trade deal fearful of tariffs and other aggressive economic measures companies have started to rejig their supply chains exporters to the us are sieving out producers in china so as to reduce the risks to them from tariffs and other possible sanctions the latest data on capital spending by businesses in the large economies shows that firms are also delaying or cancelling capacity expansion fundamentals are against us near term prospects are therefore worrying to fully understand how things are moving we need to go beyond these details and appreciate the geopolitical context in which they are unfolding our deepening pessimism stems from the realisation that we are living in a world where three big powers the us china and russia are vandalising the diplomatic security and trade frameworks that helped preserve political stability and allowed the asia pacific economies to flourish this sounds like a strong statement to make but it is not an exaggeration the current us administration has broken basic norms of diplomatic conduct and has few qualms about undermining vitally important international frameworks such as the world trade organization s dispute settlement mechanism china is not innocent either witness its occupation of disputed territories in the south china sea its refusal to accept the findings of the international tribunal for the law of the sea its efforts to force technology transfer from foreign companies to local ones and its intimidation tactics against countries that annoyed it russia s interventions in georgia in 2008 and ukraine in 2014 did not do the global order any favours either and this is why although there are some offsetting trends they are not enough for us to be confident of future prospects yes financial conditions have loosened for the developed economies for example 10 year us bond yields have fallen sharply from 2 55 at the beginning of may to 2 13 last week falling borrowing costs should help firms and consumers while also probably boosting housing demand and yes another positive has been the correction in oil prices which have fallen by around 15 since early may but these changes are unfortunately too modest to affect the overall picture of a downward drift in global prospects financial markets are therefore celebrating these positives too prematurely what should we expect in the coming weeks and months there will be more signs of a weaker economy and its knock on effects on our region export growth is likely to flounder and as a result consumers and businesses will tend to cut back on spending weakening our economies further china and the us will engage in more pushing and shoving china s strategy seems to be to demonstrate to the us that it can inflict pain on the us as well to persuade president donald trump s administration to back away from its uncompromising demands china is probably not going to return to the negotiating table until it has made its point eventually there will be some kind of trade deal since it is in both sides interests to avoid a damaging downward spiral in the global economy but that will take time policymakers in the big economies will step up their efforts to counter the gathering slowdown in the us federal reserve bank officials including chairman jerome powell have made it clear that they will cut rates if the economy weakens given the very serious downside risks in china its government needs to aggressively ease credit restrictions expand the fiscal stimulus substantially and loosen some of the administrative restrictions in areas such as the property market what can southeast asia do this region is highly dependent on the world economy whether it is through exports commodity prices tourist arrivals or capital inflows to finance current account deficits or the foreign direct investment that is essential to economic development as the global economy deteriorates the downward pressures will build on regional economies at one level we need more proactive domestic counter cyclical policies in the past year the emphasis was more on stability rather than preserving growth for instance bank indonesia raised interest rates aggressively to protect its currency even at the risk of slowing the economy similarly for the philippines that was the right thing to do then but now with the headwinds growing the priority needs to shift to preserving growth by easing both monetary and fiscal policies beyond such immediate responses there is also a need for more strategic long term responses to prepare the regional economies to face down what could be a permanently stressed global economy domestically this means stepping up infrastructure spending to boost demand and reduce a constraint on competitiveness there should also be more reforms of the supply side of the economy for instance if indonesia deregulated its labour market rules to make them more investor friendly that would attract a lot more foreign investment in export oriented manufacturing which indonesia needs but we also need a more coordinated regional response if asean members spoke with one collective voice on issues such as trade protectionism it would protect the regional economies a lot more than if each country tried to stand up to protectionist pressures individually monetary and fiscal policy easing would also enjoy more credibility in financial markets if they were coordinated given the likelihood of more financial market turbulence hurting currencies and balance of payments asean should work harder at creating its own regional safety nets currently the regional countries would have to turn to the international monetary fund for financial support in the event of currency or balance of payments stresses but the asian financial crisis of 1997 98 made countries wary of the imf or they can turn to the chiang mai initiative but as china japan and south korea are its main funders the asean members would need their approval to secure funding it is time asean built its own fund to protect itself from an external crisis finally at a time when globalisation is in retreat there is an even more pressing need to reinvigorate asean economic integration while initiatives such as the asean economic community have made some progress it falls far short of the integration needed to offset the slower growth of world trade and investment the bottom line the region is facing a much more troubled world and it needs to step up its

article to print this article all you need is to be registered or login on mondaq com as alerted in our previous advisories libor the world s most important number is being phased out created almost 50 years ago on august 15 1969 opening day of the woodstock music festival libor began as a floating market determined interest rate for syndicated loans but over time has become the benchmark interest rate for an estimated 350 trillion in outstanding financial arrangements around the world these contracts include public and private loans and bonds consumer financial products such as credit cards mortgages and student loans and some 200 trillion in interest rate derivatives due in large part to concern that the determination of libor formally known as ice libor is based on fewer and fewer interbank transactions and therefore is an increasingly unreliable benchmark for the global financial markets regulators worldwide have been working to develop alternative benchmarks over the past few years the us federal reserve the uk s financial conduct authority fca and other regulators have convened industry led working groups to develop risk free rates rfrs as an alternative to libor with the goal of replacing libor by the end of 2021 in the us the alternative reference rates committee arrc a private industry group convened by the federal reserve board and the new york federal reserve bank to plan the market s transition away from us dollar libor has selected sofr the secured overnight financing rate as the new interest rate benchmark for us dollar denominated transactions in bond and loan markets in the uk sonia the sterling overnight index average has been chosen as the new interest rate benchmark for pound sterling transactions other financial markets including for transactions denominated in euro swiss franc and japanese yen have developed their own risk free rates eonia saron and tonar respectively differences between libor and sofr the transition away from libor by 2021 presents a series of significant challenges to the financial markets for numerous reasons many of the challenges stem from the basic differences between libor and the proposed replacement rates for example sofr first libor is an inter bank unsecured lending rate whereas sofr is based on overnight transactions secured by us treasury securities a rate considered risk free as a result libor is generally higher than sofr often by 20 basis points or more which difference often widens at times of stress in the credit markets therefore a simple switch from libor to sofr without more would mean a lower interest rate so in an existing transaction a transition from libor to sofr would require an upward adjustment referred to as a replacement benchmark spread to ensure that the pre and post amendment rate levels are compatible the negotiation between creditors and borrowers of the amount of the replacement benchmark spread may present a challenge because sofr which is tied to the securities repurchase repo market is at times subject to significant volatility particularly at month quarter and year ends in the us the arrc is expected to recommend a specific methodology for determining the replacement benchmark spread but when amending existing contracts creditors and borrowers will be under no obligation to accept it second while libor is available for various tenors e g one month three month six month etc sofr is currently only available as an overnight rate on the website of the sofr benchmark administrator the federal reserve bank of new york for now the lack of forward looking term sofr makes corporate treasurers reluctant to agree to use sofr in their loan agreements as they cannot predict how the new benchmark will perform while private parties are developing forward sofr curves for different periods the cme group for example currently publishes one month and three month sofr futures it will take time for curves to be developed and then gain widespread market adoption finally given the absence so far of a published forward looking term sofr other methods of calculating sofr are under consideration each with its own challenges for example should sofr be accrued from the beginning of an interest period on a daily overnight basis with the final interest rate for the period only determined at the end of each interest period or should sofr instead be determined for a given interest period by compounding daily sofr for the previous one three or six month period while the first option would better reflect market interest rates during the interest period neither the creditor nor the borrower would have predictability in terms of future interest income expense many corporate treasurers would be informed immediately preceding the payment date how much interest would need to be paid raising operational back and middle office issues both for creditors and borrowers a problem compounded for those non us borrowers required to close a foreign exchange transaction in advance to effect us dollar payments amending existing contracts perhaps the greatest challenge to the transition from libor to sofr will be to amend the contractual terms of existing financings that are due to mature after the libor transition date an estimated 35 trillion of currently outstanding libor linked financial transactions expire after 2021 in comparison the us national debt is 22 trillion the problem is particularly acute if prior to the parties successfully amending the contracts libor itself is no longer published or is otherwise no longer considered a reliable measure of inter bank lending rates concern has been raised about so called zombie libor where libor remains in legacy contracts after the point when it is no longer supported or reported loan documents for libor based loans generally provide a definition of libor with that definition providing certain fallbacks in case libor is no longer determinable based on the method provided in the document generally a designated display page on a reuters or bloomberg rate screen however these fallbacks are particularly for many older agreements generally triggered only when libor is unavailable for example if for some reason libor is not displayed on the designated rate screen on the interest rate determination date but do not consider a scenario where libor no longer exists loan agreements also typically contain provisions that apply an alternate base rate in the event that either a libor cannot be determined b dollar deposits are not being offered in the london interbank market or c libor no longer reflects the lender s cost of funding a loan those alternate base rates are often based on the prime rate the fed funds rate plus a margin or some other agreed upon rate but these alternate rates were added as a short term solution for a temporary disruption not as long term replacements for libor in particular as those rates are often significantly more expensive than libor more recent libor definitions will generally provide a different fallback already contemplating a time when libor no longer exists and industry groups have been working to develop a consistent approach in 2018 the arrc released market consultations on potential fallback language for syndicated loans floating rate notes bilateral loans and securitizations in april 2019 the arrc published its recommendations of fallback language for syndicated loans and floating rate notes based on feedback it received from market participants even so while at least one major bank has adopted the arrc recommendations in whole fallback language is still being developed and it will be difficult for the market to develop adequate language until the uncertainties surrounding sofr are resolved loan modification itself will be a challenge even after market standard fallback language has become more fully developed loan modification negotiations for bilateral loans between lenders and sophisticated borrowers should be relatively straightforward though any discussion of a benchmark spread adjustment may be a challenge especially if negotiated at a time of market stress when libor and sofr diverge more significantly syndicated loans the documentation of which often require the approval of lenders holding 100 of the outstanding loan for any proposed modification of the method for calculating interest will be a greater challenge particularly if there are numerous members of the lending syndicate with different levels of sophistication regarding the market shift from libor to sofr in addition to the obvious libor provisions amendments may also need to be made to provisions regarding break funding make whole and increased costs among other clauses the coordination role of administrative agents will be critical but the greatest challenge will likely be to modify floating rate notes frns that have been widely distributed as generally the approval of noteholders holding 100 of the outstanding notes is required to amend existing terms and conditions affecting interest rates to the extent a libor based frn is held by a significant number of retail investors and the terms of the frn require 100 approval for amendments and have an old style libor definition then liability management exercises such as debt for debt exchange offers should be considered to help mitigate the risk if at least in part new loan agreements prior to libor cessation for new loan agreements being entered into now and using libor as the interest rate benchmark the arrc has proposed two different approaches for making future amendments when libor ceases the amendment approach and the hardwired approach each of these approaches has slight variations when applied to syndicated loans as opposed to bilateral loans generally the amendment approach provides that upon the occurrence of a defined libor replacement trigger certain cessation or pre cessation events the lender in the case of a bilateral loan or the borrower and the administrative agent in the case of a syndicated loan will have agreed to amend the loan agreement to replace libor with an alternate benchmark rate which may include term sofr unless the other party or parties to the loan agreement for example a certain percentage of required lenders object in writing within a specified timeframe under the hardwired approach upon the occurrence of a defined libor replacement trigger libor is automatically replaced with term sofr compounded sofr or another alternate benchmark rate determined in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement using an agreed waterfall each of these approaches has advantages and disadvantages generally speaking the amendment approach provides the parties with greater flexibility in establishing a rate to replace libor upon the occurrence of a libor replacement trigger however a disadvantage to the amendment approach is that the parties may not be able to agree on a replacement rate when libor replacement is triggered and in that case the existing and inadequate fallbacks will remain in the loan agreement depending on the specific wording of these fallbacks and the then current market the result will either be inadequate unduly expensive or unworkable particularly for loans having longer tenors and will inevitably in some cases lead to litigation at the same time while the hardwired approach has the advantage of not depending upon the parties reaching agreement to a replacement rate in the future at the time a libor replacement trigger occurs the parties do risk agreeing in advance to a replacement rate e g term sofr or compounded sofr that does not currently exist and may never fully develop the arrc s hardwired approach includes a required benchmark spread adjustment based on spread adjustments or adjustment methodologies published by relevant governmental bodies or isda while the amendment approach contemplates that the parties will select a benchmark spread adjustment at the time of the amendment the parties would still need to agree on the amount or the methodology for determining the amount of the adjustment though giving due consideration to certain defined factors given that libor is generally higher than sofr these spread adjustment provisions are important without such provisions borrowers and the lenders will have different incentives in determining whether a libor replacement was actually triggered with borrowers likely preferring an early switch to sofr and lenders preferring a later switch all other things being equal for this reason the arrc spent considerable effort to develop objective and knowable triggers as part of its consultations our recent experience suggests that parties are more comfortable with the amendment approach than with the hardwired approach until more information regarding replacement rates becomes available other considerations the migration away from libor presents other risks to both creditors and borrowers hedging isda is undertaking separate consultations for the derivatives markets and consulted with the market in july 2018 announcing final recommendations at the end of 2018 while isda undertook its consultations before the arrc took its own there is concern that the isda fallbacks and arrc fallbacks may not align generating worries of fallback misalignment between loans notes and their respective interest rate hedges for example unlike the arrc proposal which includes a pre cessation trigger e g a public statement by the regulator for the administrator of libor that libor is no longer representative the current isda proposal does not include pre cessation triggers accordingly loan agreements that include the arrc s pre cessation trigger may result in the replacement of libor before it has ceased to be published while any associated hedges using isda s fallback language would continue to be based on libor until it is officially discontinued another example of potential divergence between the libor replacement proposals applicable to the cash loan and derivatives markets relates to the method of determining replacement benchmark itself isda has announced that it will utilize a compounded replacement rate calculated in arrears as its fallback for derivatives to the extent the loan market adopts a forward looking term sofr or some other methodology for determining the replacement benchmark instead of a compounded sofr in arrears there will be a mismatch between loans and their associated hedges regulation for financial institutions in particular there is increased regulatory focus on ensuring that banks are prepared the fsb financial stability board and iosco the international organisation of securities commissions have been coordinating international efforts for interest rate benchmark reform in recent months the us s federal deposit insurance corporation fdic focused its winter 2018 issue of supervisory insights to the end of libor while the us securities and exchange commission sec has identified it as a disclosure and operational concern for both reporting companies and securities industry participants taxation in the us a number of issues have been raised about the tax impacts of converting existing loans and other financial instruments from libor to a replacement rate for example there is concern that the conversion could result in a determination that there was a material modification of the indebtedness potentially resulting in a taxable exchange a similar concern is raised under fatca where a material modification to an existing financial instrument can cause the issue to be deemed a new issuance jeopardizing the grandfathering exemption from fatca withholding for instruments issued before july 1 2014 this would be a particular concern in the context of an older existing securitization where the documentation establishing the issue likely contains no provisions contemplating fatca withholding on april 8 2019 the arrc sent a letter to the us treasury and the us internal revenue service requesting formal guidance on these and similar us tax issues potential for disputes for many of the reasons discussed above there may be instances where it will be a challenge to incorporate fallback provisions into an existing financial instrument prior to the cessation of libor because of the inability to obtain requisite consent from the relevant constituents absent a statutory or other fix that applies across the different market segments the potential for disputes in these cases is a real concern that should be considered as firms analyze their needs and objectives recommendations both creditors and borrowers should already be preparing for the transition from libor to sofr we would recommend the following first parties should take stock of their libor exposure under existing loans notes and derivatives focusing on transactions maturing after 2021 the definition of libor should be reviewed as well as the provisions for amending the terms and conditions of the regarding modification discussions with counterparties should begin as soon as possible to ensure that counterparties are also aware of the conversion from libor to sofr second parties should review standard documents that are likely to be used for future transactions such as under medium term note mtn commercial paper cp or certificate of deposit cd programs to check whether amendments should be made in contemplation of future issues for example consideration should be given to changing existing program documentation to permit less than 100 approval for amending libor related interest rate provisions reducing the ability of small groups of holdout creditors to block necessary amendments parties should monitor developments in standard libor replacement language and the developments involving potential term sofr and replacement benchmark spread in addition given the concern that both sofr and libor fallbacks may develop in different directions between standard lending securities documentation and standard isda documentation companies should review credit and hedging documents carefully to avoid potentially costly gaps third parties particularly lenders and agents should review their internal systems to understand what adjustments may be required for loan accrual in sofr whichever sofr calculation method is ultimately used by the market back and middle office systems and procedures such as client invoicing will also need to be adapted finally parties again particularly lenders and agents should already begin advising borrowers and issuers that libor is coming to an end preparing them for the changes to come less sophisticated counterparties may need additional time to educate themselves on the upcoming changes to libor and the adoption of sofr final thoughts while 2021 may still seem well in the future the adjustments that market participants will need to make are significant and these adjustments will be undertaken while replacement rates and fallback provisions remain unresolved the time to take stock of your company s exposures and to map a path forward is now one of the last bands to perform at woodstock was blood sweat and tears if the issues raised by the transition to risk free rates remain unresolved by the end of 2021 libor may well end on a similar note the content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter specialist advice should be sought about

longer considered a reliable measure of inter bank lending rates concern has been raised about so called zombie libor where libor remains in legacy contracts after the point when it is no longer supported or reported loan documents for libor based loans generally provide a definition of libor with that definition providing certain fallbacks in case libor is no longer determinable based on the method provided in the document generally a designated display page on a reuters or bloomberg rate screen however these fallbacks are particularly for many older agreements generally triggered only when libor is unavailable for example if for some reason libor is not displayed on the designated rate screen on the interest rate determination date but do not consider a scenario where libor no longer exists loan agreements also typically contain provisions that apply an alternate base rate in the event that either a libor cannot be determined b dollar deposits are not being offered in the london interbank market or c libor no longer reflects the lender s cost of funding a loan those alternate base rates are often based on the prime rate the fed funds rate plus a margin or some other agreed upon rate but these alternate rates were added as a short term solution for a temporary disruption not as long term replacements for libor in particular as those rates are often significantly more expensive than libor more recent libor definitions will generally provide a different fallback already contemplating a time when libor no longer exists and industry groups have been working to develop a consistent approach in 2018 the arrc released market consultations on potential fallback language for syndicated loans floating rate notes bilateral loans and securitizations in april 2019 the arrc published its recommendations of fallback language for syndicated loans and floating rate notes based on feedback it received from market participants even so while at least one major bank has adopted the arrc recommendations in whole fallback language is still being developed and it will be difficult for the market to develop adequate language until the uncertainties surrounding sofr are resolved loan modification itself will be a challenge even after market standard fallback language has become more fully developed loan modification negotiations for bilateral loans between lenders and sophisticated borrowers should be relatively straightforward though any discussion of a benchmark spread adjustment may be a challenge especially if negotiated at a time of market stress when libor and sofr diverge more significantly syndicated loans the documentation of which often require the approval of lenders holding 100 of the outstanding loan for any proposed modification of the method for calculating interest will be a greater challenge particularly if there are numerous members of the lending syndicate with different levels of sophistication regarding the market shift from libor to sofr in addition to the obvious libor provisions amendments may also need to be made to provisions regarding break funding make whole and increased costs among other clauses the coordination role of administrative agents will be critical but the greatest challenge will likely be to modify floating rate notes frns that have been widely distributed as generally the approval of noteholders holding 100 of the outstanding notes is required to amend existing terms and conditions affecting interest rates to the extent a libor based frn is held by a significant number of retail investors and the terms of the frn require 100 approval for amendments and have an old style libor definition then liability management exercises such as debt for debt exchange offers should be considered to help mitigate the risk if at least in part new loan agreements prior to libor cessation for new loan agreements being entered into now and using libor as the interest rate benchmark the arrc has proposed two different approaches for making future amendments when libor ceases the amendment approach and the hardwired approach each of these approaches has slight variations when applied to syndicated loans as opposed to bilateral loans generally the amendment approach provides that upon the occurrence of a defined libor replacement trigger certain cessation or pre cessation events the lender in the case of a bilateral loan or the borrower and the administrative agent in the case of a syndicated loan will have agreed to amend the loan agreement to replace libor with an alternate benchmark rate which may include term sofr unless the other party or parties to the loan agreement for example a certain percentage of required lenders object in writing within a specified timeframe under the hardwired approach upon the occurrence of a defined libor replacement trigger libor is automatically replaced with term sofr compounded sofr or another alternate benchmark rate determined in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement using an agreed waterfall each of these approaches has advantages and disadvantages generally speaking the amendment approach provides the parties with greater flexibility in establishing a rate to replace libor upon the occurrence of a libor replacement trigger however a disadvantage to the amendment approach is that the parties may not be able to agree on a replacement rate when libor replacement is triggered and in that case the existing and inadequate fallbacks will remain in the loan agreement depending on the specific wording of these fallbacks and the then current market the result will either be inadequate unduly expensive or unworkable particularly for loans having longer tenors and will inevitably in some cases lead to litigation at the same time while the hardwired approach has the advantage of not depending upon the parties reaching agreement to a replacement rate in the future at the time a libor replacement trigger occurs the parties do risk agreeing in advance to a replacement rate e g term sofr or compounded sofr that does not currently exist and may never fully develop the arrc s hardwired approach includes a required benchmark spread adjustment based on spread adjustments or adjustment methodologies published by relevant governmental bodies or isda while the amendment approach contemplates that the parties will select a benchmark spread adjustment at the time of the amendment the parties would still need to agree on the amount or the methodology for determining the amount of the adjustment though giving due consideration to certain defined factors given that libor is generally higher than sofr these spread adjustment provisions are important without such provisions borrowers and the lenders will have different incentives in determining whether a libor replacement was actually triggered with borrowers likely preferring an early switch to sofr and lenders preferring a later switch all other things being equal for this reason the arrc spent considerable effort to develop objective and knowable triggers as part of its consultations our recent experience suggests that parties are more comfortable with the amendment approach than with the hardwired approach until more information regarding replacement rates becomes available other considerations the migration away from libor presents other risks to both creditors and borrowers hedging isda is undertaking separate consultations for the derivatives markets and consulted with the market in july 2018 announcing final recommendations at the end of 2018 while isda undertook its consultations before the arrc took its own there is concern that the isda fallbacks and arrc fallbacks may not align generating worries of fallback misalignment between loans notes and their respective interest rate hedges for example unlike the arrc proposal which includes a pre cessation trigger e g a public statement by the regulator for the administrator of libor that libor is no longer representative the current isda proposal does not include pre cessation triggers accordingly loan agreements that include the arrc s pre cessation trigger may result in the replacement of libor before it has ceased to be published while any associated hedges using isda s fallback language would continue to be based on libor until it is officially discontinued another example of potential divergence between the libor replacement proposals applicable to the cash loan and derivatives markets relates to the method of determining replacement benchmark itself isda has announced that it will utilize a compounded replacement rate calculated in arrears as its fallback for derivatives to the extent the loan market adopts a forward looking term sofr or some other methodology for determining the replacement benchmark instead of a compounded sofr in arrears there will be a mismatch between loans and their associated hedges regulation for financial institutions in particular there is increased regulatory focus on ensuring that banks are prepared the fsb financial stability board and iosco the international organisation of securities commissions have been coordinating international efforts for interest rate benchmark reform in recent months the us s federal deposit insurance corporation fdic focused its winter 2018 issue of supervisory insights to the end of libor while the us securities and exchange commission sec has identified it as a disclosure and operational concern for both reporting companies and securities industry participants taxation in the us a number of issues have been raised about the tax impacts of converting existing loans and other financial instruments from libor to a replacement rate for example there is concern that the conversion could result in a determination that there was a material modification of the indebtedness potentially resulting in a taxable exchange a similar concern is raised under fatca where a material modification to an existing financial instrument can cause the issue to be deemed a new issuance jeopardizing the grandfathering exemption from fatca withholding for instruments issued before july 1 2014 this would be a particular concern in the context of an older existing securitization where the documentation establishing the issue likely contains no provisions contemplating fatca withholding on april 8 2019 the arrc sent a letter to the us treasury and the us internal revenue service requesting formal guidance on these and similar us tax issues potential for disputes for many of the reasons discussed above there may be instances where it will be a challenge to incorporate fallback provisions into an existing financial instrument prior to the cessation of libor because of the inability to obtain requisite consent from the relevant constituents absent a statutory or other fix that applies across the different market segments the potential for disputes in these cases is a real concern that should be considered as firms analyze their needs and objectives recommendations both creditors and borrowers should already be preparing for the transition from libor to sofr we would recommend the following first parties should take stock of their libor exposure under existing loans notes and derivatives focusing on transactions maturing after 2021 the definition of libor should be reviewed as well as the provisions for amending the terms and conditions of the regarding modification discussions with counterparties should begin as soon as possible to ensure that counterparties are also aware of the conversion from libor to sofr second parties should review standard documents that are likely to be used for future transactions such as under medium term note mtn commercial paper cp or certificate of deposit cd programs to check whether amendments should be made in contemplation of future issues for example consideration should be given to changing existing program documentation to permit less than 100 approval for amending libor related interest rate provisions reducing the ability of small groups of holdout creditors to block necessary amendments parties should monitor developments in standard libor replacement language and the developments involving potential term sofr and replacement benchmark spread in addition given the concern that both sofr and libor fallbacks may develop in different directions between standard lending securities documentation and standard isda documentation companies should review credit and hedging documents carefully to avoid potentially costly gaps third parties particularly lenders and agents should review their internal systems to understand what adjustments may be required for loan accrual in sofr whichever sofr calculation method is ultimately used by the market back and middle office systems and procedures such as client invoicing will also need to be adapted finally parties again particularly lenders and agents should already begin advising borrowers and issuers that libor is coming to an end preparing them for the changes to come less sophisticated counterparties may need additional time to educate themselves on the upcoming changes to libor and the adoption of sofr final thoughts while 2021 may still seem well in the future the adjustments that market participants will need to make are significant and these adjustments will be undertaken while replacement rates and fallback provisions remain unresolved the time to take stock of your company s exposures and to map a path forward is now one of the last bands to perform at woodstock was blood sweat and tears if the issues raised by the transition to risk free rates remain unresolved by the end of 2021 libor may well end on a similar note the content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter specialist advice should be sought about

opinions of wednesday 12 june 2019 columnist aceye introduction is there a certified financial crisis in the ghanaian banking industry we say yes the financial crisis in the ghanaian banking industry has risen as a result of the rampant fold ups merger and acquisitions occurring in the industry this has reduced the financial confidence of customers there have been several factors speculated as the cause of the crisis in the ghanaian financial system africa centre for entrepreneurship and youth empowerment argue that the higher level of information systems in the operations of the financial sector is a tacit factor contributing to the financial crisis an elaborate research was conducted to justify this argument aceye conducted this research to also examine the state of the ghanaian financial system this article expounds on the discovery made in the research the ghanaian banking industry the financial sector in 2012 experienced some changes in the competitive environment due to some major mergers and acquisitions notable ones include access bank ghana acquiring intercontinental bank of ghana with a market share of 3 20 adding to the 1 20 of access bank ecobank ghana with a market of 9 00 acquired the trust bank limited whose market share was 2 80 the growth of the sector was attributed to the discovery of oil in the nation given the rise in ghana s annual gdp growth rates from 2009 to 2011 according to professor obuobi the most essential factors that are changing the industry include development in information technology and the deregulation of the financial services at national and regional levels and globalization given the already aggressive nature of the banking industry in ghana and the fact that most banks in ghana are trying to increase their market share by implementing winning marketing strategies the banks are adopting innovations in information technology to improve their operations cut down costs attract new customers maintain old customers and to stay competitive amongst other benefits of information technology the use of the concepts techniques policies and implementation strategies of information and communication technology has become fundamentally important and a greater concern for all banks even the micro financial institutions because it has become a requirement for survival in the industry and a prerequisite to attaining local and global competitiveness how a financial system operates bhaduri 2011 indicated that the financial system facilitates trade and asset acquisition from the macroeconomic perspective the wellbeing of a country s economy depends greatly on the financial system nevertheless the financial system operates on a network of mutual confidence since the financial system deals with derivatives such as swaps options and futures which carry higher level of uncertainties due to the higher level of uncertainties in the operations of the financial system consumers bankers enter into contract with them based on the confidence that the banks will be able to raise the future price of assets the danger with the financial system and the higher intensity of ict adoption is that consumers confidence drop when their divergent expectations are not met a prior study conducted by reinhart and rogoff 2008 revealed that a drop in confidence of consumers has a detrimental potency on financial systems in general reinhart and rogoff 2008 narrated cases of prior financial crisis where the financial confidence of consumers had heightened to the peak and the consumers were at the stage of cacoethes and unexpectedly the financial system collapsed and created panic among consumers this is a plebeian incident that happens in both developed and developing economies the situation was expected to be better due to the adoption of information system and other complex technologies in the financial system this study conducted has really shown that the adoption of information systems technology and other management information systems has rather heightened the possibility of financial crisis in the banking industry that is not to debunk that information technology is not essential in the banking industry these developments in technological innovations have enabled banks to create service innovations for the banking industry according to mashhour zaatreh 2008 most of the new banking innovative strategies are as a result of either new or enhanced banking information systems some of the prominent innovations in the banking sector including electronic or internet banking e banking debit and credit cards automated teller machines atm and so on advances in the internet technology have had a big impact on business operations and have brought about a paradigm shift especially in the operations of banks what financial practitioners and industrial researchers have failed to consider and give more attention is the fact that the higher level of information systems adoption in the banking industry creates higher level of confidence in consumers as stated by rogoff and reinhart 2008 therefore a venial failure in the information system drops down the confidence of consumers to the barest minimum what appears to be a menial crisis is compounded by the reactions of consumers to become a grave crisis this research identified the plausible explanation to this phenomenon happening specifically in the ghanaian financial industry the study drew on the financial crisis theory by minsky to explain the reasons why information technology has increased the potency of financial crisis in the ghanaian banking industry is merger and acquisition really the problem merger and acquisition has been a practice in the business environment for a period of time the concept of merger and acquisition has been a significant practice that incenses economic growth a merger is a combination of two or more corporations in which only one new corporation comes to existence and the individual corporations that have merged go extinct acquisition on the other hand occurs when a corporation takes over the controlling ownership interest of another corporation a legal subsidiary of a corporation or some selected assets of the firm scott 2003 the terms are usually put together as merger and acquisition because the end result of each process is that corporations which initially had separate ownership now come under one ownership transforming a small business into a big one or a big business into an even bigger one essentially occurs in one of two ways companies can grow their revenues and profits from within by cultivating and growing demand for their products and services this strategy known as organic growth requires patience but pays big dividends when executed successfully a riskier way that companies can grow is through a merger and acquisition m a strategy an m a strategy can create synergies when companies with complementary products services and missions unite however it can also create tensions and failures when corporate cultures clash or the acquirer fails to successfully integrate the acquired company s assets systems and brands some corporate unions fail to create synergies and thereby destroy shareholder value mergers and acquisitions are more common than ever in today s business climate chances are if a firm haven t gone through some sort of integration it may integrate with another firm sometime to come yet studies show that many if not most mergers are doomed to fail the failures result in poor shareholder results layoffs and in some cases a complete dissolution of the merger one of the reasons why mergers and acquisitions fail is because the top management do not first of all enter into the merger and acquisition with the right motive moreover there is not much preparation prior to the entry of the merger and acquisition arrangement the first to be done is to understand the culture and strategies of the individual firms involved in the merger and acquisition arrangement there should be so much communication among the management of all the individual firms involved in the merger and acquisition furthermore the cultures of the firms must be integrated in a prearranged administrative process before the merger and acquisition deal takes off one approach toward improving the probability of successful is integration focuses on alignment of firm and is level integration strategies there are so many instances where mergers and acquisitions have failed due to the lack of proper planning prior to the merger and acquisition deal a typical example is the daimler and chrysler merger case when german daimler the makers of mercedes benz merged with american company chrysler in the late 1990s it was called a merger of equals a few years later it was being called a fiasco meaning a disastrous or embarrassing failure discordant company cultures had the two divisions at war as soon as they merged differences between the companies included their level of formality philosophy on issues such as pay and expenses and operating styles the german culture became dominant and employee satisfaction levels at chrysler dropped off the map one unhappy joke circulating at chrysler at the time was how do you pronounce daimlerchrysler daimler the chrysler is silent by 2000 major losses were projected and a year later layoffs began in 2007 daimler sold chrysler to cerberus capital management for 6 billion this is the point where the bank of ghana and the ghanaian financial system at large is failing hardly would the public know the laid down strategies for a merger and acquisition it always appears as a surprise on the customers of the institutions the strategic plan including all stakeholders must be mapped for the firms merging to come to a unified strategy for instance the recently consolidated bank consolidated bank of ghana has to operate on an interoperability platform and customers have challenges withdrawing their money due to the challenges with the interoperability network customers on the various banks cannot withdraw cash from atms of other banks within the consolidated bank and if even possible the customer is charged a fee as if the transaction was with a third party bank these are the same situations that occur in the various mergers and acquisitions that occur in the ghanaian financial system the problem therefore is not necessarily with the merger and acquisition as explained earlier merger and acquisition is a very risky growth strategy and as such requires adequate preparation and integration to succeed the lack of adequate planning preparation and integration of the mergers and acquisitions in the ghanaian financial system is one of the ravaging factors driving the system into crisis overview of incidences in the ghanaian banking industry gcb assumes ut bank and capital bank within three years 2016 to 2019 several banks in ghana were folded up acquired or merged with other banks because they were facing financial crisis gcb was rated behind ut bank as the riskiest indigenous ghanaian banks listed on the stock exchange in 2016 it looks so surprising and paradoxical to have gcb take over the unique trust ut bank the 2016 assessment of the indigenous banks showed that per the rate of growth in the banks gcb was riskier than ut bank nevertheless the capital base of gcb bank which appeared quite substantial over ut bank allowed gcb bank to take over ut bank in the prospect of shareholder returns ut bank was ahead of gcb bank following the progressive trend of gcb gcb struggled for survival in 2007 and underwent recapitalization to raise ghc45 000 additional capital in 2007 before the devaluation of the ghanaian cedi gcb was struggling for survival due to stunt growth shares were floated to raise additional capital and the bank was re branded the name was changed from ghana commercial bank to gcb bank and the logo was changed from the eagle on a star to the interlocked eagle one of the drawbacks of the gcb was its long queues and longer waiting times gcb has been identified over the years for overcrowding and protracted queues at most of its branches one of the notable causes of the long queue and overcrowding was the experience of frequent network failures the breakdown of the network slowed down the speed of services provided by the bank this was also an aspect that the banks taken over by gcb outcompeted it a review of the interest payout on deposits revealed that the gcb bank had relatively low interest payout on deposits compared to the firms it took over in the first quarter of 2017 just before the announcement of the assumption gcb s average interest on deposit was 9 3 whiles capital bank s ai was 13 5 and ut s ai was 12 the strongest area of operation that gcb had outcompeted all the firms in the banking industry was the e zwich services gcb was awarded as the active e zwich bank for three consecutive years this success is yet to be investigated but that could be because of the compulsory payout of national service allowance through the e zwich platform another stronghold of the gcb bank was its timely delivery of information considering its position as a bank having a part state ownership it stood to be more accountable to the citizenry than the various private sector owned banks possibly this has translated into its services to stay highly accountable to its customers gcb hooked unto the mobile banking i e mobile money transfer to account in november 2016 according to business world 2016 this appears to be a late adoption because the private firms assumed by gcb were hooked unto the platform in 2011 ut bank was awarded the best in sme banking the core focus of the ut bank was on small and medium enterprises therefore most of its products were geared towards the development of the smes in ghana ut bank offered mortgage facilities to smes and individual customers as well one of the innovative products sold by ut bank was the ut car imports designed through a web based system the ut bank developed an online platform where foreign car sellers were hooked on and the customers of the bank who wanted to import cars could also be hooked unto the platform and then ut bank mediated the transaction and ensured the smooth transfer of funds and ownership title this was a unique product which made use of the different wings of the ut group this product was introduced in march 2011 gcb bank has no such product considering the uniqueness of this product what is the implication to the gcb bank will they continue to adopt this is strategy or they will discard it entirely ut bank started in 1997 as a financial house named as unique trust financial services the financial services purchased a former bank called bpi bank in june 2010 and got listed on the gse as ut bank 6 years later it has gown down the drain ghanatrade 2017 what possibly could have gone wrong for a firm which was strong enough to take over another firm to go down the drain in just six years this shows that a merger and acquisition in itself does not mean success several other factors come to play for a purchase and assumption to yield success to the acquiring firm capital bank was established as savings and loans in 2009 and attained a license to operate as a bank in 2013 three years after that it has gown down the drain capital bank positioned itself to timely and relevant financial solution to the sme market looking at capital bank and ut bank it is clear that these banks positioned themselves in the market of sme banking that has been their competitive edge and it is not so for the assuming firm gcb therefore the challenge of aligning strategies can be a critical in the success of the acquisition failure to deal effectively with the alignment issues can cause a problem to gcb sometime to come an effective management of the alignment of the various strategies can also yield success in august 2016 capital bank was awarded as the best growing bank the best bank in household retail banking and the best bank in savings and deposits in october 2013 capital bank was awarded the 10th best performing company for the year 2012 and the best in the non bank financial institutions sector at the ghana club 100 awards organized by the ghana investment promotion center this shows that the capital bank had a good growth prospect however there had been some internal challenges that could not be dealt with and this has caused the fall of capital bank royal bank unibank beige bank sovereign bank and construction bank merger in march 2018 the bank of ghana the central bank announced the collapse of five banks priorto the collapse of these banks data was gathered by aceye on the information technology used by the royal bank the royal bank was established in august 2012 as a fully ghanaian owned bank with a capital base of fifty one million u s dollars according to b ft 2018 the bank performed extremely well in its first three years of operation and grew its loan book by 322 percent in the third year the bank s loan book underperformed and struggled to meet the bank of ghana s prudential ratios the central bank bank of ghana made an asset quality review on the royal bank and recommended that the bank impair its capital b ft 2018 the royal bank was granted liquidity support of two hundred million ghana cedis in 2016 by the bank of ghana eventually the banks performance advanced and in 2017 made a quarter repayment of the liquidity support given by the central bank according to business and financial times 2018 the royal bank suffered with liquidity issues due to higher amount of loan granted to finatrade finatrade borrowed one billion ghana cedis ghc1 000 000 000 from twenty six banks even though the total stated capital of the ghanaian banking industry was ghc 2 6 billion according to frimpong 2016 the royal bank was a victim which explains why it faced liquidity issues in 2015 however in 2017 its performance had improved significantly according to the business and financial times 2018 the collapse of ut bank and capital bank had a greater toll on the royal bank customers lost confidence in the financial system according to allotey 2018 there were very few deposits and several withdrawals from customers coupled with the central banks capital requirement of ghc 400 million the royal bank declined in its performance and by the end of 2018 it was declared as insolvent construction bank had an ill fate because it started in 2017 when ut bank and capital bank had collapsed and the confidence of consumers had dropped therefore the bank struggled with liquidity right from its inception the confidence of consumers in the financial system had dropped and so the priodos start for construction bank was wrong that is why it could not succeed confidence of consumers had dropped therefore the bank struggled with liquidity right from its inception the financial crisis theory explains ghana s financial crisis the phenomena happening in the ghanaian banking industry were passed through the lens of the financial crisis theory to examine whether the ghanaian financial system is in crisis minsky s financial instability theory is used to explain the phenomena occurring in the ghanaian financial sector according to minsky s financial instability theory every economy has some financial regimes under which it is stable and some financial regimes under which it is unstable and then also in periods of prosperity the economy can move from the stable financing regimes to unstable financing regimes in minsky s 1986 theory he asserted that a financial system is stable and robust when moderate changes in cash flows capitalization rate and payment commitments does not suppress its ability of the units in the financial system to meet their commitments on the other hand an economy is fragile when small changes in the cash flows capitalization rate and payment commitments have damaging effects such that the units within the financial system are not able to meet their financial commitments passing the happenings in the ghanaian financial system through the theory proves that the ghanaian financial system is a fragile one the bases for this conclusion are these 1 the ut bank and capital bank were performing well but the failure of some borrowers to make payment resulted in their bankruptcy 2 the collapse of the ut bank and capital bank resulted in a huge drop in the capital base of the financial system due to less deposits and higher withdrawals 3 the change in capital requirement by the bank of ghana resulted in the collapse of over 20 banks minsky s theory posits that when the hedge units against the speculative and ponzi schemes are relatively less then the financial system is more prone to fragility developing on the theory it is explained that in the first phase it is assumed that the economy goes through crisis and the speculative units are used up to run the economy lenders and borrowers become more conservative when they go through the crisis lenders would give out their funds to the financial units when they are offered higher margins of safety borrowers also become pessimistic in the prospect of their businesses and perceive that they need higher margin of safety in order not to borrow and run at a loss at this stage investment and profits though low are very stable because of this natural occurrence leading to stability the consumers eventually gain higher confidence in the financial system borrowers become optimistic in their profit making and begin to accept lower margin of safety at this point profit is maximized due to the stability lenders also begin to give out funds at a lower margin of safety judging from the profit records of borrowers having the expectations that profit will increase more and they will be in a good position to pay back the funds lent out the financial sector moves to a boom then the second phase appears in the second phase the boom becomes a bust because of borrowers increase in profitability and access to lower rate funds there is increased demand for finance for investment projects dertzer and herr 2014 stated that as long as the supply curve for finance is infinitely elastic this circumstance does not lead to increase in the interest rate the pro founder of the theory minsky explained in the theory that this statement holds true when at this stage the financial system is loaded with financial innovations or the central bank is willing to supply further reserves to banks nevertheless bottlenecks in the financial system and external pressures such as inflation and exchange rate forces the central bank to increase interest rate then the downturn begins this is where this study took a critical look at the role of management information system in the fragility of the ghanaian financial system drawing from the theory it can be explained that during the boom session banks invest in management information system that boosts the confidence of the borrowers and lenders in the financial system in essence the management information system creates extra confidence in consumers which leads to a much detrimental impact on them during the downturn information technology and the consumer confidence cycle dr mohammed explained on modernghana com that ponzi banks are banks that increase debt to pay debt their case is like the case of mansa who borrowed 10ghc from kojo at 10 per cent interest unable to pay back kojo mansa borrows 11ghc 10gch loan plus 1ghc interest from salifu to pay kojo now mansa owes salifu 11ghc and when the time is up for mansa to pay salifu again unable to pay mansa borrows 11ghc at 10 per cent interest from segbefio to pay salifu and now mansa s loan increases to 12 1ghc what s interesting is that mansa doesn t know when she will ever find the money from her own business to pay back the loans she owes and so continues borrowing from one person to pay the other until she can t borrow anymore and finally declares bankruptcy as it stands now the plight of many banks in ghana are analogous to the plight of mansa this in so many ways explain why several banks in ghana are collapsing this operation is a back office operation which may not be open to the consumer populace africa center for entrepreneurship conducted a case study at the royal bank to investigate how information technology modulate financial confidence in consumers a study was conducted in the royal bank between january 2017 to april 2017 after a careful study of the history of the royal bank the royal bank received the new era award for technology innovation and quality at an awards ceremony held in june 2014 in rome italy by the association ofotherways management consulting firm it was also declared the best bank in bank growth at the 13th ghana banking awards the bank was also declared a top emerging brand at the ghana super brands awards in december 2014 this informed aceye to choose the riyal bank for this particular research from the research conducted it was identified that the lenders and borrowers of the bank had much confidence in the ghanaian financial system and as such they were willing to transact with the banking industry to the highest level for instance some customers had left their previous banks to the royal bank because they wanted a more advanced information technology that will enhance their banking experience if customers left one bank to another for technological reasons then it implies that the customers have higher confidence in their new bank s technology than their previous bank s technology it implies that the royal bank and the banking industry in general attracted customers because of the increasing level of information technology in other words the more advanced the information technology used by a bank the more the confidence level of its customers what was discovered subsequent to the research conducted was that whiles the customers had built their confidence level to a peak and were expecting some advanced form of information technology the financial system started having a downturn the sudden collapse of ut bank and capital bank which were bigger banks and well known as highly advanced in information system and performance was an indicator that the financial system was fragile therefore the lenders and borrowers were hit hard by the sudden downturn according to minsky s financial crisis theory the borrowers were not ready to borrow unless offered a higher margin of safety and lenders were not willing to lend unless offered a higher margin of safety because the financial system was unstable the bank could not rely much on its reserve and speculative units to meet its financial commitments thus the change in cash flows coupled with the change in capital requirement had a detrimental effect on the bank eventually the bank had to be declared illiquid and consolidated the consolidation of the five banks and the recent collapse of some micro finance institutions further unstabilize the financial system and reduces the confidence of consumers further contrary to the bank of ghana s statement that these happenings will strengthen the ghanaian financial system the research conducted shows that with the level of technology in the financial system these happenings are rather weakening the ghanaian financial system and gradually heightening the financial crisis of ghana the consumer confidence level curve and ghana s financial system figure 1 shows the rise and fall in the confidence level of customers in the ghanaian financial system and the level of fragility of the system in an unstable economic period the fragility of the financial system is less yet the confidence level of customers is low when the economy becomes stable the confidence level begins to rise from level one to level two and the fragility of the financial system increases at this period the higher adoption of information systems increases the confidence level of customers further from level 2 to level 3 and the financial system becomes more fragile external factors cause changes in capital requirement cash flows and payment commitments and the banks begin to struggle with the payment of their obligations and commitments eventually the confidence of customers falls drastically from level 3 to level 1 just as a fall from a higher height has greater impact than a lower height so is the fall in the confidence level from a higher level to a lower level considering the fragility of the ghanaian financial system it takes long for the system to recover from the fall figure 1 consumer confidence curve source aceye s model in light of the discovery made it makes sense to argue that the raising of the capital requirement affected the ghanaian owned and local banks more than the multinational banks the research explains from the financial crisis theory that the local banks rested and still rest solely on the fragile ghanaian financial system whiles the multinational banks had and continue to have rest on less fragile financial system due to their reliance on other stable economies in other words during the unstable economic period in ghana international banks are able to meet their commitments from the reserves in other stable economies whiles the local banks have no reserves to fall on the study therefore concludes that 1 the ghanaian financial system is fragile and it hold s true for most developing economies 2 the financial system suffers greatly when the confidence level of customers falls significantly 3 information technology raises the confidence level of customers borrowers and lenders such that there is a greater fall in times of instability in the economy 4 higher information technology adoption in a fragile financial system as ghana s indirectly contributes to the financial crisis of the financial system conclusion the research was grounded on minsky s financial crisis theory to show that the ghanaian financial system is a fragile one as it is with every economy the ghanaian economy transits from stability to instability at various points in time whether the economy is stable or unstable its fragile nature presents some peculiar consequences because of the fragile nature of the ghanaian financial system it suffers detrimental effects at any

last week thomas fazi and i had a response to a recent british attack on modern monetary theory mmt published in the tribune magazine june 5 2019 for mmt the article we were responding to against mmt written by a former labour party advisor in part 1 we considered how the mmt critique was not really about mmt at all we provided a more accurate summary of what mmt is and what it is not in this second part we consider the way the former advisor s article misrepresented mmt authors on issues such as taxes inflation and democracy not that this three part series is not just a point by point response to the attack on mmt noted above in part that article was not really about mmt but some concoction the author created to make his argument easier to sustain in seize the means of production of currency part 1 june 11 2019 we provided a coherent summary of what mmt is rather than what the critics claim it is it is impossible to tell whether their misrepresentations are deliberate to set up the straw person a product of ignorance and lack of research or plain stupidity or a combination of all three in part 1 we got up to the question of taxes and so we resume does this mean that taxes are not necessary of course not taxes in part serve a functional role in depriving the non government sector of purchasing power which in turn frees up the goods and services that would otherwise have been used by the non government sector for public use in other words taxes help to free up real resource space to allow governments to spend without invoking the inflation risk does this mean that we shouldn t tax the rich the present authors values indicate we are all for taxing the rich but not to get their money rather the rich should pay higher taxes in order to deprive them of their purchasing power which translates into economic and political power this is not a minor issue ultimately fuelling the notion that we need the rich folk s money to our schools and our caring services as the likes of jeremy corbyn and john mcdonnell never tire of repeating is a dangerous and misguided narrative for progressives to engage in not only because it fuels damaging myths about how the monetary system works but also because it elevates the rich and high income earners to an indispensable status that is unwarranted as pavlina tcherneva from the levy economics institute notes in her excellent response to doug henwood s rather loopy attack on mmt mmt is already helping february 27 2019 i would say that henwood like other tax the rich to pay for progress lefties is tethered to the wealthy by an imaginary umbilical cord that holds his progressive agenda hostage to his oppressors to me this is the definition of a self induced paralysis time to cut the cord mmt has a profound emancipatory power and the left would do well to awaken to its potential progressives should come to terms with the fact that the incomes and taxes paid by the rich do not enhance the capacity of a currency issuing government to provide first class public services and infrastructure if the reader finds all this perplexing it is because for the past forty or so years policymakers and mainstream economists and commentators have peddled a series of false myths about how modern monetary systems work for example politicians seek to relate our own experiences as households managing financial constraints with the opportunities available to government even though the comparison is false at the most elemental level households use the currency the government issues they blur that difference and attack government welfare programs using terms such as maxing out the credit card to amplify this misunderstanding they also know that rising public debt can be politically manipulated and demonised in order to get citizens and workers to accept demand even policies that are not in their class interest even though they know that governments do not issue debt to fund government spending to be clear politicians and central bankers know full well how the system works indeed governments already operate according to the framework offered by mmt as a recent article in ft alphaville america has never worried about financing its priorities january 16 2019 by brendan greeley noted when washington wants something to fight a war to cut taxes it appropriates and so arguments about balancing budgets aren t actually about constraints they re about priorities important programs get appropriations full stop unimportant programs need to be paid for with taxes or in washington we can t afford that actually just means i don t think that s very important the same can be said for the uk as of march 2006 approximately 4 5 billion had been spent by the uk in iraq enough to pay for the building of around 44 new hospitals and to fund the recruitment and retention of over 10 300 new teachers for ten years yet there was never any debate about how the uk would fund the war the same goes for the massive post crisis financial bailouts unfortunately the mainstream macroeconomic narrative continues to infest large swathes of the left particularly in europe meadway s article is representative he writes that about mmt this article aims to concentrate instead on the practical and political implications why they are wrong and why labour s own economic programme makes more sense in that sense he is really talking about some conception of the application of mmt understandings according to some value set rather than mmt itself although he clearly doesn t understand the difference there is no mmt program the labour s own economic programme will be implemented if they gain office in the context of a monetary system that is best understood through the mmt lens and the principles outlined in seize the means of production of currency part 1 june 11 2019 trying to set up a comparison to show labour s own economic programme is superior or more sensible demonstrates meadway s complete lack of understanding of what mmt is it is such a basic error that he should disqualify himself from further discussion until he takes the time to understand this key difference between a lens that allows for understanding and a policy program the inflation bogey the knee jerk reaction to mmt is that government deficits will be inflationary especially if they are not accompanied by debt issuance the critics characterise mmt as being about monetary financed deficits and they usually slip the printing word in here because that is the paradigm these sorts of criticisms are stuck in meadway is no exception he recognises that as a technical detail modern governments do not have to collect taxes before they can spend they can also borrow the money or create and spend that money directly on a day to day basis these three things can and often do all happen at once unfortunately what holds as a technical description of how governments pay for their daily operations does not apply over the longer term the grave danger from issuing money in particular is that it will lead to a general rise in prices known as inflation something readily acknowledged by academic mmt supporters they often argue that governments should use taxes to deal with this problem taxes take money out of wider circulation and by reducing the amount of money chasing goods and services you reduce the pressure on prices his claim that this description of the monetary system is readily acknowledged by academic mmt supporters is a blatant misrepresentation of the mmt position there is no such acknowledgement that aside meadway s claim can be distilled down to the classic monetarist assertion that increasing the money supply in the economy reduces its value via inflation first meadway s mainstream textbook characterisation is not an accurate description of how government spending enters the system as noted in part 1 government spending enters the economy via the central bank crediting the relevant bank accounts to facilitate the spending requirements of the treasury this process is not dependent on whether the fiscal position is in deficit or surplus and occurs whether the government issues debt or not to distinguish as meadway seems to between spending that is issuing money from spending that is presumably not issuing money is nonsensical all government spending involves currency entering the non government sector irrespective of what other operations might accompany it such as issuing bonds second it is the government spending itself that carries the inflation risk indeed all spending private or public is inflationary if it drives nominal aggregate spending faster than the real capacity of the economy to absorb it there is nothing particular about government spending in this regard but if the net government spending is purchasing real goods and services that are for example idle which means there is no demand for them from the non government sector then such spending is unlikely to trigger inflation a growing economy requires a growing volume of currency further there will be times that a policy program does run into resource constraints given there is sometimes likely to be a mismatch of idle capacity and required capacity for example if the government pursues a major infrastructure project then they will likely need skilled tradepersons in the construction sector and the unemployed and under employed might not have those skills so on those occasions the government ambitions may require productive resources being diverted from current uses to government use which requires additional policies to accompany the spending plans taxes regulation etc these spending offsets are not related to the funding of the spending as might be popularly conceived by meadway and others but are related to the fact that government spending is subject to real resource constraints rather than financial constraints further these decisions then will reflect political judgements on what is best for the nation and have nothing to do with the capacity of the government to spend its own currency third what happens if the government issues debt to match the deficit all that happens is that the non government sector exchanges cash for an interest bearing asset the central bank records this as a decline in the reserves held in the banking sector and an increase in another account government debt liabilities when the debt is repaid the numbers are reversed fourth issuing debt does not reduce the inflation risk attached to the spending despite what meadway channelling orthodox textbooks suggests the funds to buy the debt were held in a wealth portfolio and were not being spent anyway if those funds were being spent by the non government then it is likely the required fiscal deficit to support well being and high levels of employment would be smaller further in the event that the government spending hits resource bottlenecks as noted above issuing debt or not does not alter the demand squeeze that the bottlenecks will create fifth what would happen if the government did nothing other than instruct the central bank to credit bank accounts to facilitate its spending plans this option has been referred to unfortunately as overt monetary financing omf and has been advocated in recent years even by mainstream economists such as ben bernanke former governor of the federal reserve and adair turner former chair of the british financial services authority there would be no heightened inflation risk the risk is in the spending the claim that meadway makes that the crediting of bank accounts by the central bank on behalf of the government is inevitably inflationary without accompanying debt issuance has been thoroughly discredited by the evidence central banks have created trillions of pounds dollars euros since the financial crisis with little or no impact on inflation all that happens is that the net financial assets created by the deficits in the banking sector cannot be held in the form of interest bearing bonds what happens if inflation accelerates meadway introduces another straw person accusation he claims that the only solution proposed by mmt to deal with inflation is that governments should use taxes to deal with this problem taxes take money out of wider circulation and by reducing the amount of money chasing goods and services you reduce the pressure on prices in this scenario far from the transformative claims made by its online fans we have ended up in a place remarkably similar to the hated mainstream of economics mainstream economics also acknowledges that inflation is an issue but instead of saying taxes should be used to control it its adherents known as neoclassical economists propose interest rates as a remedy first there is nothing mainstream about dealing with inflation on the other hand obsessing about it like meadway does is very mainstream indeed second it is remarkable that he holds himself out as a progressive yet has been part of a policy making team that has designed the british labour party s fiscal credibility rule which gives primacy to the monetary policy committee as the arbiter of when and if the rule can be suspended in bad times the mpc sets interest rates to control inflation which meadway says is a hallmark of neoclassical economics the hated mainstream of economics but as we will see in part 3 he holds this privileging of the mpc of the bank of england out as the exemplar of fiscal credibility somewhat ridiculous really a very confused position meadway also misuses literature when he writes but as two left wing economists sympathetic to mmt arjun jayadev and j w mason have recently argued this means that the only meaningful difference in policy terms between mmt and the mainstream on the central issue of managing inflation is whether the government should use taxes or interest rates i considered that particular article jayadev and mason in these blog posts 1 the divide between mainstream macro and mmt is irreconcilable part 1 september 10 2018 2 the divide between mainstream macro and mmt is irreconcilable part 2 september 11 2018 3 the divide between mainstream macro and mmt is irreconcilable part 3 september 12 2018 one of the points i made was that the authors were not discussing mmt at all despite their article being titled mainstream macroeconomics and modern monetary theory what really divides them after that three part response to their article one of the authors jw mason admitted via twitter december 31 2018 that in august inet published mainstream macroeconomics and modern monetary theory what really divides them in retrospect we should have used different title simce focus was on fiscal policy not mmt generally but i still think it moved convo forward in other words trying to use this article as a source of commentary on mmt as meadway does is dishonest even the authors mason s tweet was retweeted by jayadev had to concede they had misrepresented what their article was about when it was first published third in fact mmt identifies that if the inflation is due to excessive growth in aggregate spending which is only one way inflation can arise then that growth has to be attenuated there are a number of ways that attenuation can occur tax rises being one of them the government might choose to also cut spending in some areas as scott fullwiler rohan grey and nathan tankus noted in their recent financial times article an mmt response on what causes inflation march 1 2019 when mmt says that a major role of taxes is to help offset demand rather than generate revenue we are recognising that taxes are a critical part of a whole suite of potential demand offsets which also includes things like tightening financial and credit regulations to reduce bank lending market finance speculation and fraud further they wrote assessing the potential inflationary effect of new spending proposals also requires seriously assessing how underutilised our existing resources are this requires detailed expert analysis from a range of industry analysts not just statistical regressions on aggregate economic data by macroeconomists that is an mmt understanding also requires governments to be continually analysing real resource constraints ex ante and avoiding stimulus beyond those limits but if there is a need to attenuate spending growth in the economy then mmt analysis demonstrates the superiority of an employment buffer stock approach which is denoted the job guarantee to replace the current unemployment buffer stock approach to inflation control when the government currently seeks to constrain spending growth it creates unemployment to discipline wage demands under neoliberalism unemployment ceased to be a policy target lower the better and has become a policy tool to control inflation this is incredibly costly both in terms of income and personal losses mmt proponents advocate that the government would instead offer a public sector job at a socially inclusive minimum wage to anyone who seeks to work redistributing labour from the inflating sector to the fixed price sector ensures price stability and avoids costly mass unemployment why didn t meadway acknowledge this central aspect of mmts approach to inflation after all the job guarantee the integral macroeconomic stability framework within mmt is the only policy option that can be considered pure mmt fourth meadway also compounds these errors by asserting that mmt is anti democratic because three pro mmt academics writing recently in the financial times who called for an administrative agency to take responsibility for managing inflation via aggregate demand so whilst the mainstream wants central banks to be independent of democratic government when setting the interest rate mmt expects an administrative agency or agencies to do the same thing when setting taxes either way democracy misses out the ft article referred to is the fullwiler et al article linked to above in fact the fullwiler article did not reach that conclusion inasmuch at there was discussion of the possibility that we could replace one unaccountable technocracy central bank with an unaccountable fiscal agency there was no hint that this was a core mmt proposition the authors were presenting their own opinion about this matter there is nothing in the core body of mmt work that would lead to outsourcing fiscal policy to a bunch of unelected technocrats that is a straightforward misrepresentation and lie from meadway i considered the issue of creating independent fiscal authorities in parts 2 and 3 of the blog posts cited above further their opinion expressed in the ft article runs counter to the views of the current authors thomas and i to be continued conclusion in part 3 we enter the murky world of politics the british fiscal credibility rule again and more that is enough for today c copyright 2019 william mitchell all rights reserved

which is stored by a third party the main advantage lies in reducing the cryptocurrency s volatility since the price of the coin can t be lower than the current gold rate gold in russia the russian government intends to return to the gold standard and is thinking about using cryptocurrency as a tool to reduce dependence on the us dollar russia wants to return gold to the world market as it believes this will be the strongest blow to the us dollar since the usa brought the world out of the gold standard the world economy has been using dollars instead this was fine so long as the dollar was backed by gold but now it is not backed by anything which makes it just paper therefore if russia continues to rapidly increase its gold reserves and put gold backed cryptocurrency into operation for international settlements dependence on the us dollar will be reduced last year russia became the largest buyer of gold and over the past 10 years the country has increased its total volume of gold reserves by 400 the central bank of russia the central bank of russia is studying a proposal to create a cryptocurrency linked to the price of gold which could be used for cross border settlements with other countries the head of the central bank of russia elvira nabiullina said as for mutual settlements we will consider of course a proposal on a cryptocurrency that is tied to gold but in my opinion it is more important to develop settlements in national currencies story continues nabiullina also reminded people that the position of the bank of russia on the launch of cryptocurrency in the russian monetary system has not changed we in principle are opposed to cryptocurrencies being launched into our monetary system we do not see the possibility that cryptocurrencies in fact fulfill the function of monetary surrogates she said russia is a member of the eurasian economic union along with armenia belarus kazakhstan and kyrgyzstan the eaeu minister for integration and macroeconomics tatyana valovaya more positively assessed the idea of using cryptocurrency for cross border settlements at least between the eaeu member states she said we have prepared an analytical report and will soon present it which will analyse what cryptocurrency is what is happening in the world what approaches different countries have and what regulation is envisaged and if the phenomenon of cryptocurrency in any perspective may cause risks to our macroeconomic stability we need to understand that the central bank of russia has accumulated large amounts of gold in its reserves buying it from russian gold miners this contributes to the development of precious metal mining in the country as companies can guarantee the sale of their products with the help of this yellow precious metal the financial authorities of russia intend to reduce the dependence of russian reserves on the us dollar in this regard for a long time there was speculation about the possibility that russia is developing a currency based on gold goldmint one company in russia has already launched a cryptocurrency with its price tied to the value of gold a group of entrepreneurs from russia launched the blockchain platform goldmint with the gold backed token mntp the cost of the mntp token will always be equal to the price of an ounce of gold on the london bullion market and is backed with physical gold stored in automated vaults at partner banks of the project secured cryptocurrency is the next step in the direction of the spread of blockchain technologies bitcoin and other early cryptocurrencies essentially ceased to be money and turned into apple stocks which are growing all the time because everyone wants them our cryptocurrency is not growing faster than gold and this is its plus commented dmitry plushchevsky co founder of the project you can buy mntp tokens on several cryptocurrency exchanges in countries where the issue and circulation of cryptocurrencies is allowed all operations are carried out through smart contracts based on the ethereum platform third party companies will be able to use the api to integrate their services with goldmint russia and china there have also been rumours that russia and china may create their own joint cryptocurrency secured by the gold reserves of the countries the large purchases of gold by russia and china last year may be the first step towards the launch of a joint cryptocurrency the volume of gold being purchased began to grow sharply after the introduction of western sanctions a joint cryptocurrency between china and the russian federation will differ from existing cryptocurrencies and would most likely act as a settlement method for international bank transfers between legal entities disadvantages of gold despite the relative price stability gold has several disadvantages it is expensive to transport transfer and store in proper conditions in this regard cryptocurrency is much more convenient currencies built on blockchain technology can only be safe when based on a large number of nodes around the world with full centralisation they are just as vulnerable as any other computer system the russian view russian government economist vladislav ginko expressed doubts that the country could create a cryptocurrency linked to gold the economist noted gold is being traded for us dollars and the ability to sell it can also be limited by sanctions from the united states this can be seen in the example of venezuela which cannot sell its reserves locked in the bank of england what cryptocurrencies are backed by gold if you just want to buy gold with bitcoin the easiest and most reliable way is to open an account with vaultoro this is a gold service that allows you to buy and sell gold with bitcoin and other altcoins gold is 100 your legal property and is fully insured in swiss vaults vaultoro is perfect if you prefer to park your crypto

on wednesday afternoon bernie sanders gave a speech defining democratic socialism at george washington university this is the second major speech he has given on this subject the first being in 2015 during his first bid for the democratic presidential nomination a lot has changed since then sanders has gone from being a national unknown to a household name consistently following former vice president joe biden in polls on the democratic primary his progressive policy platform is at the center of the democratic political discourse and of course donald trump is president a lot however hasn t changed the vermont senator s definition of democratic socialism remains the fight for economic freedom one that ensures health care a living wage a full education housing and a clean environment over 80 years ago franklin delano roosevelt helped create a government that made transformative progress in protecting the needs of working families today in the second decade of the 21st century we must take up the unfinished business of the new deal and carry it to completion he said this is the unfinished business of the democratic party and the vision we must accomplish below is a transcript of sanders s remarks courtesy of his presidential campaign my friends we are in the midst of a defining and pivotal moment for our country and our planet and with so many crises converging upon us simultaneously it is easy for us to become overwhelmed or depressed or to even throw up our hands in resignation but my message to you today is that if there was ever a moment in the history of our country where despair was not an option this is that time if there was ever a moment where we had to effectively analyze the competing political and social forces which define this historical period this is that time if there was ever a moment when we needed to stand up and fight against the forces of oligarchy and authoritarianism this is that time and if there was ever a moment when we needed a new vision to bring our people together in the fight for justice decency and human dignity this is that time in the year 2019 the united states and the rest of the world face two very different political paths on one hand there is a growing movement towards oligarchy and authoritarianism in which a small number of incredibly wealthy and powerful billionaires own and control a significant part of the economy and exert enormous influence over the political life of our country on the other hand in opposition to oligarchy there is a movement of working people and young people who in ever increasing numbers are fighting for justice they are the teachers taking to the streets to make certain that schools are adequately funded and that their students get a quality education they are workers at disney amazon walmart and the fast food industry standing up and fighting for a living wage of at least 15 an hour and the right to have a union they are young people taking on the fossil fuel industry and demanding policies that transform our energy system and protect our planet from the ravages of climate change they are women who refuse to give control of their bodies to local state and federal politicians they are people of color and their allies demanding an end to systemic racism and massive racial inequities that exist throughout our society they are immigrants and their allies fighting to end the demonization of undocumented people and for comprehensive immigration reform when we talk about oligarchy let us be clear about what we mean right now in the united states of america three families control more wealth than the bottom half of our country some 160 million americans the top 1 own more wealth than the bottom 92 and 49 of all new income generated today goes to the top 1 in fact income and wealth inequality today in the united states is greater than at any time since the 1920s and when we talk about oligarchy it is not just that the very rich are getting much richer it is that tens of millions of working class people in the wealthiest country on earth are suffering under incredible economic hardship desperately trying to survive today nearly 40 million americans live in poverty and tonight 500 000 people will be sleeping out on the streets about half of the country lives paycheck to paycheck as tens of millions of our people are an accident a divorce a sickness or a layoff away from economic devastation while many public schools throughout the country lack the resources to adequately educate our young people we are the most heavily incarcerated nation on earth after decades of policies that have encouraged and subsidized unbridled corporate greed we now have an economy that is fundamentally broken and grotesquely unfair even while macroeconomic numbers like gdp the stock market and the unemployment rate are strong millions of middle class and working people struggle to keep their heads above water while the billionaire class consumes the lion s share of the wealth that we are collectively creating as a nation in the midst of a so called booming economy real wages for the average worker have barely risen at all and despite an explosion in technology and worker productivity the average wage of the american worker in real dollars is no higher than it was 46 years ago and millions of people are forced to work two or three jobs just to survive and here is something quite incredible that tells you all you need to know about the results of unfettered capitalism all of us want to live long happy and productive lives but in america today the very rich live on average 15 years longer than the poorest americans in 2014 in mcdowell county west virginia one of the poorest counties in the nation life expectancy for men was 64 years in fairfax county virginia a wealthy county just 350 miles away life expectancy for men was nearly 82 years an 18 year differential the life expectancy gap for women in the two counties was 12 years in other words the issue of unfettered capitalism is not just an academic debate poverty economic distress and despair are life threatening issues for millions of working people in the country while the rich get richer they live longer lives while poor and working families struggle economically and often lack adequate health care their life expectancy is declining for the first time in modern american history taken together the american dream of upward mobility is in peril in fact if we don t turn things around our younger generation will for the first time in living memory have a lower standard of living than their parents this is not acceptable globally the situation is even more shocking with most of the world s wealth concentrated among a very few while billions of people have almost nothing today the world s richest 26 billionaires now own as much wealth as the poorest 3 8 billion people on the planet half of the world s population but the struggle we are facing today is not just economic across the globe the movement toward oligarchy runs parallel to the growth of authoritarian regimes like putin in russia xi in china mohamed bin salman in saudi arabia rodrigo duterte in the philippines jair bolsonaro in brazil and viktor orbÃ¡n in hungary among others these leaders meld corporatist economics with xenophobia and authoritarianism they redirect popular anger about inequality and declining economic conditions into violent rage against minorities whether they are immigrants racial minorities religious minorities or the lgbt community and to suppress dissent they are cracking down on democracy and human rights in the united states of course we have our own version of this movement which is being led by president trump and many of his republican allies who are attempting to divide our country up and attack these same communities how sad it is that president trump sees these authoritarian leaders as friends and allies this authoritarian playbook is not new the challenge we confront today as a nation and as a world is in many ways not different from the one we faced a little less than a century ago during and after the great depression in the 1930s then as now deeply rooted and seemingly intractable economic and social disparities led to the rise of right wing nationalist forces all over the world in europe the anger and despair was ultimately harnessed by authoritarian demagogues who fused corporatism nationalism racism and xenophobia into a political movement that amassed totalitarian power destroyed democracy and ultimately murdering millions of people including members of my own family but we must remember that those were not the only places where dark forces tried to rise up today we are all rightly repulsed by the sight of neo nazis and klansmen openly marching in charlottesville va and we are horrified by houses of worship being shot up by right wing terrorists but on february 20 1939 over 20 000 nazis held a mass rally not in berlin not in rome but in madison square garden in front of a 30 foot tall banner of george washington bordered with swastikas in new york city but back then those american extremists could not replicate the success of their authoritarian brethren across the ocean because we in the united states thankfully made a different choice than europe did in responding to the era s social and economic crises we rejected the ideology of mussolini and hitler we instead embraced the bold and visionary leadership of president franklin delano roosevelt then the leader of the progressive wing of the democratic party together with organized labor leaders in the african american community and progressives inside and outside the party roosevelt led a transformation of the american government and the american economy like today the quest for transformative change was opposed by big business wall street the political establishment by the republican party and by the conservative wing of fdr s own democratic party and he faced the same scare tactics then that we experience today red baiting xenophobia racism and anti semitism in a famous 1936 campaign speech roosevelt stated we had to struggle with the old enemies of peace business and financial monopoly speculation reckless banking class antagonism sectionalism war profiteering they had begun to consider the government of the united states as a mere appendage to their own affairs we know now that government by organized money is just as dangerous as government by organized mob never before in all our history have these forces been so united against one candidate as they stand today they are unanimous in their hate for me and i welcome their hatred despite that opposition by rallying the american people fdr and his progressive coalition created the new deal won four terms and created an economy that worked for all and not just the few today new deal initiatives like social security unemployment compensation the right to form a union the minimum wage protection for farmers regulation of wall street and massive infrastructure improvements are considered pillars of american society but while he stood up for the working families of our country we can never forget that president roosevelt was reviled by the oligarchs of his time who berated these extremely popular programs as socialism similarly in the 1960s when lyndon johnson brought about medicare medicaid and other extremely popular programs he was also viciously attacked by the ruling class of this country and here is the point it is no exaggeration to state that not only did fdr s agenda improve the lives of millions of americans but the new deal was enormously popular politically and helped defeat far right extremism for a time today america and the world are once again moving towards authoritarianism and the same right wing forces of oligarchy corporatism nationalism racism and xenophobia are on the march pushing us to make the apocalyptically wrong choice that europe made in the last century today we now see a handful of billionaires with unprecedented wealth and power we see huge private monopolies operating outside of any real democratic oversight and often subsidized by taxpayers with the power to control almost every aspect of our lives they are the profit taking gatekeepers of our health care our technology our finance system our food supply and almost all of the other basic necessities of life they are wall street the insurance companies the drug companies the fossil fuel industry the military industrial complex the prison industrial complex and giant agri businesses they are the entities with unlimited wealth who surround our nation s capitol with thousands of well paid lobbyists who to a significant degree write the laws that we live under today we have a demagogue in the white house who for cheap political gain is attempting to deflect the attention of the american people away from the real crises that we face and instead is doing what demagogues always do and that is divide people up and legislate hatred this is a president who supports brutal family separations border walls muslim bans anti lgbt policies deportations and voter suppression it is my very strong belief that the united states must reject that path of hatred and divisiveness and instead find the moral conviction to choose a different path a higher path a path of compassion justice and love it is the path that i call democratic socialism over eighty years ago franklin delano roosevelt helped create a government that made transformative progress in protecting the needs of working families today in the second decade of the 21st century we must take up the unfinished business of the new deal and carry it to completion this is the unfinished business of the democratic party and the vision we must accomplish in order to accomplish that goal it means committing ourselves to protecting political rights to protecting civil rights and to protect economic rights of all people in this country as fdr stated in his 1944 state of the union address we have come to a clear realization of the fact that true individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence today our bill of rights guarantees the american people a number of important constitutionally protected political rights and while we understand that these rights have not always been respected and we have so much more work to do we are proud that our constitution guarantees freedom of religion freedom of expression freedom of assembly a free press and other rights because we understand that we can never have true american freedom unless we are free from authoritarian tyranny now we must take the next step forward and guarantee every man woman and child in our country basic economic rights the right to quality health care the right to as much education as one needs to succeed in our society the right to a good job that pays a living wage the right to affordable housing the right to a secure retirement and the right to live in a clean environment we must recognize that in the 21st century in the wealthiest country in the history of the world economic rights are human rights that is what i mean by democratic socialism as dr martin luther king jr said call it democracy or call it democratic socialism but there must be a better distribution of wealth within this country for all of god s children to realize this vision we must not view america only as a population of disconnected individuals we must also view ourselves as part of an inescapable network of mutuality tied in a single garment of destiny as dr king put it in other words we are in this together we must see ourselves as part of one nation one community and one society regardless of race gender religion sexual orientation or country of origin this quintessentially american idea is literally emblazoned on our coins e pluribus unum from the many one and i should tell you it is enshrined in the motto of our campaign for the presidency not me us let me be clear i do understand that i and other progressives will face massive attacks from those who attempt to use the word socialism as a slur but i should also tell you that i have faced and overcome these attacks for decades and i am not the only one let us remember that in 1932 republican president herbert hoover claimed that franklin roosevelt s new deal was a disguise for the totalitarian state in 1936 former democratic new york governor and presidential candidate al smith said in a speech about fdr s new deal policies just get the platform of the democratic party and get the platform of the socialist party and lay them down on your dining room table side by side when president harry truman proposed a national health care program the american medical association hired ronald reagan as their pitchman the ama called the legislation that stemmed from his proposal socialized medicine claiming that white house staff were followers of the moscow party line in 1960 ronald reagan in a letter to richard nixon wrote the following about john f kennedy under the tousled boyish haircut is still old karl marx in the 1990s then congressman newt gingrich claimed president bill clinton s health care plan was centralized bureaucratic socialism the conservative heritage foundation has claimed that the children s health insurance program chip was a step towards socialism former speaker of the house john boehner claimed the stimulus package the omnibus spending bill and the budget proposed by president barack obama were all one big down payment on a new american socialist experiment in this regard president harry truman was right when he said that socialism is the epithet they have hurled at every advance the people have made in the last 20 years socialism is what they called social security socialism is what they called farm price supports socialism is what they called bank deposit insurance socialism is what they called the growth of free and independent labor organizations socialism is their name for almost anything that helps all the people now let s be clear while president trump and his fellow oligarchs attack us for our support of democratic socialism they don t really oppose all forms of socialism they may hate democratic socialism because it benefits working people but they absolutely love corporate socialism that enriches trump and other billionaires let us never forget the unbelievable hypocrisy of wall street the high priests of unfettered capitalism in 2008 after their greed recklessness and illegal behavior created the worst financial disaster since the great depression with millions of americans losing their jobs their homes and their life savings wall street s religious adherence to unfettered capitalism suddenly came to an end overnight wall street became big government socialists and begged for the largest federal bailout in american history some 700 billion from the treasury and trillions in support from the federal reserve but it s not just wall street that loves socialism when it works for them it is the norm across the entire corporate world the truth is corporate america receives hundreds of billions of dollars in federal support every single year while these same people are trying to cut programs that benefit ordinary americans if you are a fossil fuel company whose carbon emissions are destroying the planet you get billions in government subsidies including special tax breaks royalty relief funding for research and development and numerous tax loopholes if you are a pharmaceutical company you make huge profits on patent rights for medicines that were developed with taxpayer funded research if you are a monopoly like amazon owned by the wealthiest person in america you get hundreds of millions of dollars in economic incentives from taxpayers to build warehouses and you end up paying not one penny in federal income taxes if you are the walton family the wealthiest family in america you get massive government subsidies because your low wage workers are forced to rely on food stamps medicaid and public housing in order to survive all paid for by taxpayers if you are the trump family you got 885 million worth of tax breaks and subsidies for your family s housing empire that is built on racial discrimination when trump screams socialism all of his hypocrisy will not be lost on the american people americans will know that he is attacking all that we take for granted from social security to medicare to veterans health care to roads and bridges to public schools to national parks to clean water and clean air when trump attacks socialism i am reminded of what dr martin luther king jr said this country has socialism for the rich rugged individualism for the poor and that is the difference between donald trump and me he believes in corporate socialism for the rich and powerful i believe in a democratic socialism that works for the working families of this country what i believe is that the american people deserve freedom true freedom freedom is an often used word but it s time we took a hard look at what that word actually means ask yourself what does it actually mean to be free are you truly free if you are unable to go to a doctor when you are sick or face financial bankruptcy when you leave the hospital are you truly free if you cannot afford the prescription drug you need to stay alive are you truly free when you spend half of your limited income on housing and are forced to borrow money from a payday lender at 200 interest rates are you truly free if you are 70 years old and forced to work because you lack a pension or enough money to retire are you truly free if you are unable to go to attend college or a trade school because your family lacks the income are you truly free if you are forced to work 60 or 80 hours a week because you can t find a job that pays a living wage are you truly free if you are a mother or father with a new born baby but you are forced to go back to work immediately after the birth because you lack paid family leave are you truly free if you are a small business owner or family farmer who is driven out by the monopolistic practices of big business are you truly free if you are a veteran who put your life on the line to defend this country and now sleep out on the streets to me the answer to those questions in the wealthiest nation on earth is no you are not free while the bill of rights protects us from the tyranny of an oppressive government many in the establishment would like the american people to submit to the tyranny of oligarchs multinational corporations wall street banks and billionaires it is time for the american people to stand up and fight for their right to freedom human dignity and security this is the core of what my politics is all about in 1944 fdr proposed an economic bill of rights but died a year later and was never able to fulfil that vision our job 75 years later is to complete what roosevelt started that is why today i am proposing a 21st century economic bill of rights a bill of rights that establishes once and for all that every american regardless of his or her income in entitled to the right to a decent job that pays a living wage the right to quality health care the right to a complete education the right to affordable housing the right to a clean environment the right to a secure retirement over the course of this election my campaign has been releasing and will continue to release detailed proposals addressing each of these yet to be realized economic rights we will also address the attacks that are being launched each day against the civil rights and civil liberties of our people and let me be absolutely clear democratic socialism to me requires achieving political and economic freedom in every community and let me also be clear the only way we achieve these goals is through a political revolution where millions of people get involved in the political process and reclaim our democracy by having the courage to take on the powerful corporate interests whose greed is destroying the social and economic fabric of our country at the end of the day the one percent may have enormous wealth and power but they are just the one percent when the 99 percent stand together we can transform society these are my values and that is why i call myself a democratic socialist at its core is a deep and abiding faith in the american people to peacefully and democratically enact the transformative change that will create shared prosperity social equality and true freedom for all
in the decades following the 1980s free market policies dominated policy agendas across the world the gains from growth however were not broadly shared within countries as evidenced by the high levels of economic inequality in the united states and most other advanced economies in a recent paper a group of economists at the international monetary fund argue for a rethinking of the rules actual or perceived that guide economic policies so that the distributional consequences are considered and addressed by policymakers in their paper imf economists jonathan d ostry prakash loungani and davide furceri argue there are four primary reasons why it is critical to pay greater attention to how economic gains are shared up and down the income ladder first their research shows that economic inequality leads to lower and less durable growth even when growth is the primary goal attention to inequality is necessary second they find that economic inequality may lead to social tension and ultimately political backlash against free market policies including globalization third redistributive policies to curb excessive inequality tend to support not slow economic growth and fourth many aspects of economic inequality are the result of policy choices made by governments meaning policymakers should factor in the distributional consequences when designing and evaluating policies a disproportionate focus on growth over distribution was solidified among economists during the 1980s with the consensus view that the benefits of growth would trickle down the income ladder governments and institutions such as the imf dismissed questions of distribution as secondary to growth based on their confidence in markets to reward everyone fairly and their belief that redistributive policies hurt growth ostry loungani and furceri question this conventional wisdom by showing that high inequality is bad not only for social reasons but also for growth an increase in the so called gini coefficient a standard measure of inequality that runs from zero perfect equality to one perfect inequality from 0 37 like the united states in 2005 to 0 42 like gabon in 2005 decreases economic growth by 0 5 percentage points the authors also find that economic inequality shortens the duration of growth an increase of 0 01 in the gini coefficient is associated with a 7 percent decrease in expected spell length or a 6 percentage point higher risk that a growth spell will end in the next year moreover the authors prove that concerns about the negative growth effects of redistribution are misplaced although excessive redistribution policies can slow growth redistributive policies to reduce inequality actually support growth on average contrary to what many policymakers think often policymakers are facing not a tradeoff but a win win situation where redistribution can reduce inequality and boost growth given these findings which build upon their earlier work how should the rules of economic policymaking be corrected the authors focus on two policies fiscal consolidation and capital account liberalization to illustrate why centering distributional considerations in the evaluation of policies can provide better guidance fiscal consolidation refers to the reduction of the size of government through spending cuts limits on deficit levels or the privatization of government functions the evidence suggests that for countries with a high risk of imminent debt crises and facing pressure from financial markets fiscal consolidation can be necessary yet countries with a strong fiscal track record and low risk of a crisis with what the authors describe as ample fiscal space such as the united states it is better to live with current levels of public debt rather than pay down the debt or ramp it up further in the u s context the authors find that it is better to live with significant amounts of federal debt and let future growth reduce the debt to gross domestic product ratio even with a framework that is biased toward consolidation other research shows that moving from a debt ratio of 120 percent of gdp to 100 percent of gdp over a few years reduces the probability of a crisis marginally but has a significant welfare cost due to the distortionary taxation needed to service the debt in this scenario the likelihood of a negative fiscal event such as a government debt default or a spike in inflation decreases minimally from an already unlikely 2 6 percent to only 2 4 percent but the benefit is about 0 5 percent of gdp just one tenth of the welfare cost of paying down the debt through distortionary taxation even in the short run fiscal consolidation reduces output and raises economic inequality looking at fiscal consolidation policies across 17 advanced economies of the organisation for economic co operation and development ostry loungani and furceri find that fiscal consolidation has been followed by a significant drop in economic output about 2 percent 2 years after the policy change and economic inequality rises simultaneously the gini coefficient increases by more than 3 percent 2 years after the policy the authors other policy focus capital account liberalization or the opening up of economies to foreign capital and investments boosts growth minimally but worsens economic inequality significantly standard economic theory indicates that capital account liberalization is beneficial for economies because savings across the world can flow to their most productive uses through freer capital markets but the authors find that on average capital account liberalization has little impact on economic output confirming the results of other empirical studies while national economies experience moderate increases in gdp when there are no crises liberalization leads to significant declines in output when followed by crises moreover capital account liberalization policies lead to higher economic inequality depending on whether there is a crisis after the policy change in another paper furceri and loungani find that capital account liberalization typically leads to an increase in the gini coefficient of about 0 8 percent 1 year after the policy change and about 1 4 percent 5 years after based on their findings about fiscal consolidation and capital account liberalization the authors ask why support them if there are scarce efficiency benefits for them but palpable equity costs the answer is important because fiscal consolidation and capital account liberalization are two policies that have historically been at the center of the imf s economic reform agenda this paper is one illustration of a shift in policy priorities at the imf where leaders increasingly recognize that liberalization and tight fiscal policy are not always suited for sustainable economic growth as the imf marks its 75th anniversary managing director christine lagarde has argued for a renewed approach that tackles economic inequality as well as climate change and corruption inequality affects economies through various channels whether it blocks opportunity and innovation for those not at the top of the income and wealth ladders destabilizes growth by distorting demand and disables political systems through the influence of the economic elite the research from the imf shows that inequality itself has a direct economic impact of lower and less durable growth this new body of research matters because it shows that many of the negative distributional outcomes stem from intentional policy choices not just from technological developments or factors beyond the control of governments the authors note that even with better designed policies there will be a need for the redistribution of the gains from overall economic growth which the evidence shows can be both pro growth and pro equality through spending on education and taxes on activities with negative externalities such as excessive risk taking in the financial sector but first and foremost policymakers can support sustainable growth by paying more attention to the distributional consequences of economic policies

last week thomas fazi and i had a response to a recent british attack on modern monetary theory mmt published in the tribune magazine june 5 2019 for mmt the article we were responding to against mmt written by a former labour party advisor in part 1 we considered how the mmt critique was not really about mmt at all we provided a more accurate summary of what mmt is and what it is not in this second part we consider the way the former advisor s article misrepresented mmt authors on issues such as taxes inflation and democracy not that this three part series is not just a point by point response to the attack on mmt noted above in part that article was not really about mmt but some concoction the author created to make his argument easier to sustain in seize the means of production of currency part 1 june 11 2019 we provided a coherent summary of what mmt is rather than what the critics claim it is it is impossible to tell whether their misrepresentations are deliberate to set up the straw person a product of ignorance and lack of research or plain stupidity or a combination of all three in part 1 we got up to the question of taxes and so we resume does this mean that taxes are not necessary of course not taxes in part serve a functional role in depriving the non government sector of purchasing power which in turn frees up the goods and services that would otherwise have been used by the non government sector for public use in other words taxes help to free up real resource space to allow governments to spend without invoking the inflation risk does this mean that we shouldn t tax the rich the present authors values indicate we are all for taxing the rich but not to get their money rather the rich should pay higher taxes in order to deprive them of their purchasing power which translates into economic and political power this is not a minor issue ultimately fuelling the notion that we need the rich folk s money to our schools and our caring services as the likes of jeremy corbyn and john mcdonnell never tire of repeating is a dangerous and misguided narrative for progressives to engage in not only because it fuels damaging myths about how the monetary system works but also because it elevates the rich and high income earners to an indispensable status that is unwarranted as pavlina tcherneva from the levy economics institute notes in her excellent response to doug henwood s rather loopy attack on mmt mmt is already helping february 27 2019 i would say that henwood like other tax the rich to pay for progress lefties is tethered to the wealthy by an imaginary umbilical cord that holds his progressive agenda hostage to his oppressors to me this is the definition of a self induced paralysis time to cut the cord mmt has a profound emancipatory power and the left would do well to awaken to its potential progressives should come to terms with the fact that the incomes and taxes paid by the rich do not enhance the capacity of a currency issuing government to provide first class public services and infrastructure if the reader finds all this perplexing it is because for the past forty or so years policymakers and mainstream economists and commentators have peddled a series of false myths about how modern monetary systems work for example politicians seek to relate our own experiences as households managing financial constraints with the opportunities available to government even though the comparison is false at the most elemental level households use the currency the government issues they blur that difference and attack government welfare programs using terms such as maxing out the credit card to amplify this misunderstanding they also know that rising public debt can be politically manipulated and demonised in order to get citizens and workers to accept demand even policies that are not in their class interest even though they know that governments do not issue debt to fund government spending to be clear politicians and central bankers know full well how the system works indeed governments already operate according to the framework offered by mmt as a recent article in ft alphaville america has never worried about financing its priorities january 16 2019 by brendan greeley noted when washington wants something to fight a war to cut taxes it appropriates and so arguments about balancing budgets aren t actually about constraints they re about priorities important programs get appropriations full stop unimportant programs need to be paid for with taxes or in washington we can t afford that actually just means i don t think that s very important the same can be said for the uk as of march 2006 approximately 4 5 billion had been spent by the uk in iraq enough to pay for the building of around 44 new hospitals and to fund the recruitment and retention of over 10 300 new teachers for ten years yet there was never any debate about how the uk would fund the war the same goes for the massive post crisis financial bailouts unfortunately the mainstream macroeconomic narrative continues to infest large swathes of the left particularly in europe meadway s article is representative he writes that about mmt this article aims to concentrate instead on the practical and political implications why they are wrong and why labour s own economic programme makes more sense in that sense he is really talking about some conception of the application of mmt understandings according to some value set rather than mmt itself although he clearly doesn t understand the difference there is no mmt program the labour s own economic programme will be implemented if they gain office in the context of a monetary system that is best understood through the mmt lens and the principles outlined in seize the means of production of currency part 1 june 11 2019 trying to set up a comparison to show labour s own economic programme is superior or more sensible demonstrates meadway s complete lack of understanding of what mmt is it is such a basic error that he should disqualify himself from further discussion until he takes the time to understand this key difference between a lens that allows for understanding and a policy program the inflation bogey the knee jerk reaction to mmt is that government deficits will be inflationary especially if they are not accompanied by debt issuance the critics characterise mmt as being about monetary financed deficits and they usually slip the printing word in here because that is the paradigm these sorts of criticisms are stuck in meadway is no exception he recognises that as a technical detail modern governments do not have to collect taxes before they can spend they can also borrow the money or create and spend that money directly on a day to day basis these three things can and often do all happen at once unfortunately what holds as a technical description of how governments pay for their daily operations does not apply over the longer term the grave danger from issuing money in particular is that it will lead to a general rise in prices known as inflation something readily acknowledged by academic mmt supporters they often argue that governments should use taxes to deal with this problem taxes take money out of wider circulation and by reducing the amount of money chasing goods and services you reduce the pressure on prices his claim that this description of the monetary system is readily acknowledged by academic mmt supporters is a blatant misrepresentation of the mmt position there is no such acknowledgement that aside meadway s claim can be distilled down to the classic monetarist assertion that increasing the money supply in the economy reduces its value via inflation first meadway s mainstream textbook characterisation is not an accurate description of how government spending enters the system as noted in part 1 government spending enters the economy via the central bank crediting the relevant bank accounts to facilitate the spending requirements of the treasury this process is not dependent on whether the fiscal position is in deficit or surplus and occurs whether the government issues debt or not to distinguish as meadway seems to between spending that is issuing money from spending that is presumably not issuing money is nonsensical all government spending involves currency entering the non government sector irrespective of what other operations might accompany it such as issuing bonds second it is the government spending itself that carries the inflation risk indeed all spending private or public is inflationary if it drives nominal aggregate spending faster than the real capacity of the economy to absorb it there is nothing particular about government spending in this regard but if the net government spending is purchasing real goods and services that are for example idle which means there is no demand for them from the non government sector then such spending is unlikely to trigger inflation a growing economy requires a growing volume of currency further there will be times that a policy program does run into resource constraints given there is sometimes likely to be a mismatch of idle capacity and required capacity for example if the government pursues a major infrastructure project then they will likely need skilled tradepersons in the construction sector and the unemployed and under employed might not have those skills so on those occasions the government ambitions may require productive resources being diverted from current uses to government use which requires additional policies to accompany the spending plans taxes regulation etc these spending offsets are not related to the funding of the spending as might be popularly conceived by meadway and others but are related to the fact that government spending is subject to real resource constraints rather than financial constraints further these decisions then will reflect political judgements on what is best for the nation and have nothing to do with the capacity of the government to spend its own currency third what happens if the government issues debt to match the deficit all that happens is that the non government sector exchanges cash for an interest bearing asset the central bank records this as a decline in the reserves held in the banking sector and an increase in another account government debt liabilities when the debt is repaid the numbers are reversed fourth issuing debt does not reduce the inflation risk attached to the spending despite what meadway channelling orthodox textbooks suggests the funds to buy the debt were held in a wealth portfolio and were not being spent anyway if those funds were being spent by the non government then it is likely the required fiscal deficit to support well being and high levels of employment would be smaller further in the event that the government spending hits resource bottlenecks as noted above issuing debt or not does not alter the demand squeeze that the bottlenecks will create fifth what would happen if the government did nothing other than instruct the central bank to credit bank accounts to facilitate its spending plans this option has been referred to unfortunately as overt monetary financing omf and has been advocated in recent years even by mainstream economists such as ben bernanke former governor of the federal reserve and adair turner former chair of the british financial services authority there would be no heightened inflation risk the risk is in the spending the claim that meadway makes that the crediting of bank accounts by the central bank on behalf of the government is inevitably inflationary without accompanying debt issuance has been thoroughly discredited by the evidence central banks have created trillions of pounds dollars euros since the financial crisis with little or no impact on inflation all that happens is that the net financial assets created by the deficits in the banking sector cannot be held in the form of interest bearing bonds what happens if inflation accelerates meadway introduces another straw person accusation he claims that the only solution proposed by mmt to deal with inflation is that governments should use taxes to deal with this problem taxes take money out of wider circulation and by reducing the amount of money chasing goods and services you reduce the pressure on prices in this scenario far from the transformative claims made by its online fans we have ended up in a place remarkably similar to the hated mainstream of economics mainstream economics also acknowledges that inflation is an issue but instead of saying taxes should be used to control it its adherents known as neoclassical economists propose interest rates as a remedy first there is nothing mainstream about dealing with inflation on the other hand obsessing about it like meadway does is very mainstream indeed second it is remarkable that he holds himself out as a progressive yet has been part of a policy making team that has designed the british labour party s fiscal credibility rule which gives primacy to the monetary policy committee as the arbiter of when and if the rule can be suspended in bad times the mpc sets interest rates to control inflation which meadway says is a hallmark of neoclassical economics the hated mainstream of economics but as we will see in part 3 he holds this privileging of the mpc of the bank of england out as the exemplar of fiscal credibility somewhat ridiculous really a very confused position meadway also misuses literature when he writes but as two left wing economists sympathetic to mmt arjun jayadev and j w mason have recently argued this means that the only meaningful difference in policy terms between mmt and the mainstream on the central issue of managing inflation is whether the government should use taxes or interest rates i considered that particular article jayadev and mason in these blog posts 1 the divide between mainstream macro and mmt is irreconcilable part 1 september 10 2018 2 the divide between mainstream macro and mmt is irreconcilable part 2 september 11 2018 3 the divide between mainstream macro and mmt is irreconcilable part 3 september 12 2018 one of the points i made was that the authors were not discussing mmt at all despite their article being titled mainstream macroeconomics and modern monetary theory what really divides them after that three part response to their article one of the authors jw mason admitted via twitter december 31 2018 that in august inet published mainstream macroeconomics and modern monetary theory what really divides them in retrospect we should have used different title simce focus was on fiscal policy not mmt generally but i still think it moved convo forward in other words trying to use this article as a source of commentary on mmt as meadway does is dishonest even the authors mason s tweet was retweeted by jayadev had to concede they had misrepresented what their article was about when it was first published third in fact mmt identifies that if the inflation is due to excessive growth in aggregate spending which is only one way inflation can arise then that growth has to be attenuated there are a number of ways that attenuation can occur tax rises being one of them the government might choose to also cut spending in some areas as scott fullwiler rohan grey and nathan tankus noted in their recent financial times article an mmt response on what causes inflation march 1 2019 when mmt says that a major role of taxes is to help offset demand rather than generate revenue we are recognising that taxes are a critical part of a whole suite of potential demand offsets which also includes things like tightening financial and credit regulations to reduce bank lending market finance speculation and fraud further they wrote assessing the potential inflationary effect of new spending proposals also requires seriously assessing how underutilised our existing resources are this requires detailed expert analysis from a range of industry analysts not just statistical regressions on aggregate economic data by macroeconomists that is an mmt understanding also requires governments to be continually analysing real resource constraints ex ante and avoiding stimulus beyond those limits but if there is a need to attenuate spending growth in the economy then mmt analysis demonstrates the superiority of an employment buffer stock approach which is denoted the job guarantee to replace the current unemployment buffer stock approach to inflation control when the government currently seeks to constrain spending growth it creates unemployment to discipline wage demands under neoliberalism unemployment ceased to be a policy target lower the better and has become a policy tool to control inflation this is incredibly costly both in terms of income and personal losses mmt proponents advocate that the government would instead offer a public sector job at a socially inclusive minimum wage to anyone who seeks to work redistributing labour from the inflating sector to the fixed price sector ensures price stability and avoids costly mass unemployment why didn t meadway acknowledge this central aspect of mmts approach to inflation after all the job guarantee the integral macroeconomic stability framework within mmt is the only policy option that can be considered pure mmt fourth meadway also compounds these errors by asserting that mmt is anti democratic because three pro mmt academics writing recently in the financial times who called for an administrative agency to take responsibility for managing inflation via aggregate demand so whilst the mainstream wants central banks to be independent of democratic government when setting the interest rate mmt expects an administrative agency or agencies to do the same thing when setting taxes either way democracy misses out the ft article referred to is the fullwiler et al article linked to above in fact the fullwiler article did not reach that conclusion inasmuch at there was discussion of the possibility that we could replace one unaccountable technocracy central bank with an unaccountable fiscal agency there was no hint that this was a core mmt proposition the authors were presenting their own opinion about this matter there is nothing in the core body of mmt work that would lead to outsourcing fiscal policy to a bunch of unelected technocrats that is a straightforward misrepresentation and lie from meadway i considered the issue of creating independent fiscal authorities in parts 2 and 3 of

two straight monthly decreases related stories u s central bank policymakers are scheduled to meet on june 18 19 against the backdrop of rising trade tensions slowing growth and a sharp step down in

it seems to me that the situation in china is far different from what most people think it is even if we would like to depend on china we really cannot reason 1 when we depend on goods from china an amazingly large share of the world s industrial activity gets concentrated in china the five largest users of energy in the world are china the united states india russia and japan the international energy agency shows total energy consumption as follows for the year 2016 when these countries are compared restricting our analysis to the portion of energy used by industry we find the rather disconcerting result shown in figure 2 china consumes more fuel for industrial production than the next four countries listed united states india russia and japan combined of course we don t know exactly the corresponding amounts for other countries of the world but we can observe that if a country is concerned about its co2 emissions the easiest way to reduce these emissions is to send heavy industry elsewhere such as to china or india there are likely many countries that are primarily service economies thanks to the option of outsourcing most industry to other countries much of the discussion i have read regarding sending industry elsewhere has been in the direction of as advanced as our economy is we don t need heavy industry service jobs will substitute industry can be developed at lower cost elsewhere everyone will be better off with this arrangement the invisible hand will provide jobs and goods and services for everyone in addition corporations saw the possibility of adding customers from around the world not too many thought about the real world problems that might result clearly there is a problem with the jobs being lost to china and other emerging markets when new service jobs are added they often do not pay as well the industrial jobs they replaced in fact there might not be enough jobs in total if automation plays an important role as well another issue is that the level of industrial concentration can be a problem we are now depending on china and perhaps a few other countries to provide for a large share of the stuff we use even if china is not the only provider it is often an important part of the supply chain if something should go wrong for example widespread riots in china we don t have a plan b reason 2 china needs energy products to make the goods it uses for itself and for the goods it exports china s own energy supply is faltering because of china s huge size it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep china s energy consumption rising sufficiently rapidly using imported energy china s own energy production is shown in figure 3 note hot off the press new bp report released this week it is easy to see that china s coal production hit its highest point in 2013 and has stayed at a lower level since that date also china s highest oil production occurred in 2015 with lower production since that date china s total energy production has been rising recently but only with great effort total energy production is only 8 9 higher in 2018 than it was in 2012 implying an increase of less than 1 5 per year relative to 2012 amounts a standard workaround for inadequate energy production growth is imported energy products even with these imports it has been impossible to keep total energy consumption rising as rapidly as it rose in the 2002 to 2007 period the cost with imports is greater also in 2018 china imported 71 of its petroleum either as crude or as products and 43 of its natural gas it was the largest importer in the world with respect to both of these fuels in 2018 china s coal imports shrank as its own coal production surged this was almost certainly a change planned by china china would much prefer producing its own coal and keeping the jobs within the country to importing coal from elsewhere china imported 4 of its coal from elsewhere in 2018 reason 3 the commodity demand from china is so huge that to a significant extent it determines world commodity price levels where regional energy prices exist china s choice regarding whether or not to import from a country can influence local price levels chile is the largest copper producer in the world a recent article regarding problems associated with lower copper prices notes that the demand for chilean copper has been driven almost entirely by the expanding chinese economy over the last three decades for many commodities china consumes over half of the world s commodity supply if china s industrial demand is growing prices will tend to rise allowing more of the mineral to be extracted higher commodity prices tend to be needed over time because the ores of highest concentration and otherwise easiest to extract ores tend to be extracted first ores extracted later tend to be more expensive to extract so higher prices are required for extraction to be profitable this situation of china playing an extremely large role in commodity prices holds for a very large number of commodities if china is building widgets or any other product using a particular commodity china s need to buy this commodity in the world market will tend to hold up world prices for the commodity this situation holds even for fossil fuel prices reason 4 over the next few years china s coal supply is likely to fall significantly because of depletion this lower fuel supply is likely to lead to a shrinkage of china s industrial capability and indirectly falling world commodity prices of all kinds the problem that china is encountering in figure 3 is peak coal this is a similar problem to that encountered by the united kingdom immediately before world war i and to that germany encountered just before world war ii coal tends to be the industrial fuel of choice because it is cheap goods made with coal tend to be inexpensive especially if wages paid to workers are low and if the company making the goods does not spend much money on pollution prevention hydroelectric can be an adequate substitute for coal if the water flow can be depended upon wind and solar are too intermittent and not sufficiently inexpensive to be adequate substitutes for coal wind and solar included in other ren on figure 3 are also far smaller in quantity than coal outsourcing a large share of the world s manufacturing to china seemed like a great idea back when it was started often in the early 2000s if at some point china cannot really handle the responsibility it has taken on outsourcing gets to be a huge problem the reason why coal prices cannot rise very high is because if they do the prices of finished goods will need to rise as well wages of workers around the world will not rise at the same time because the higher cost of production takes place due to something that is equivalent to growing inefficiency the coal mined is of lower quality or in thinner seams or needs to be transported further this means that more workers and more fuel is needed for each ton of coal extracted this leaves fewer workers and less fuel for other industrial tasks so that in total the economy can manufacture fewer goods and services because of these issues countries experiencing peak coal are pushed toward contraction of their economies unfortunately rather than leading to high prices to compensate for the higher extraction costs running short of inexpensive to extract fuel tends to lead to war or to tariff fights countries whose coal is depleting will try to maintain their own supply as long as possible they will invent excuses to stop importing coal back in september 2018 the financial review reported china has introduced unofficial restrictions on coal imports in a bid to prop up domestic prices by slowing down customs approvals at key ports china needed higher internal prices to make it profitable to extract coal from its depleting coal mines if higher coal prices really were possible over the long term it would make it possible to open new mines in more distant locations the location of coal mines is important because transport costs by rail or truck tend to be high china built the large ghost city of ordos inner mongolia on the expectation that coal prices would rise making development of coal in the area profitable unfortunately coal prices fell making the project not economic i visited the area in 2015 after teaching a short course on energy economics in beijing there was a large almost empty airport and few vehicles were using nearby multi lane roads reason 5 all of the concern about future tariffs artificially raised china s 2018 industrial production and commodity prices because production was brought forward into 2018 china s production and world commodity prices can be expected to be lower in 2019 and in future years manufacturers wanted to front run tariffs so they tended to ramp up production in advance of the tariff implementation date this higher production in turn tended to raise commodity production and prices around the world note on figure 6 above that coal and oil prices are both higher in 2018 than in 2017 prices in 2019 not shown are tending to trend downward again china badly needed higher coal prices in order to help its coal extraction thus part of the reason that china was able to continue to function as well as it did in 2018 was because of all of the discussion about future tariffs if this discussion had not taken place employment in china would likely have been lower with this lower employment sales of automobiles and smartphones would have been lower as well note too that even with the demand brought forward into 2018 china s economy was not functioning very well in 2018 private passenger automobile sales for the year fell by 4 smartphone sales fell by a worrisome 15 5 clearly workers were having difficulty buying the kinds of goods a person would expect a growing economy to be selling i would attribute these problems to the peak coal problem mentioned earlier making it increasingly difficult to increase the amount of industrial operations provided by china s economy reason 6 the chinese economy has been gradually changing and adapting to hide its energy problems even more changes will be needed in the future potentially affecting the world economy with or without tariffs the chinese economy reports carefully massaged gdp numbers which many analysts consider to be inflated in recent years its debt level keeps rising to try to keep all of its operations going we know that china discontinued one major industry at the beginning of 2018 recycling plastic and other types of low valued recycling with low oil and natural gas prices this type of recycling cannot be profitable of course discontinuing a major industry can be expected to lead to a loss of jobs within china but on the positive side it frees up coal and other energy resources in china for other industries that can perhaps make more profitable use of them on a world basis the loss of the plastic recycling industry becomes a problem if rich countries are willing to subsidize the cost of sending plastic recycling to china this subsidy allows containers that bring goods to rich countries to be sent back to china with a paid load inside thus operating the plastic recycling industry helps keep the cost of shipment of goods from china to the us or europe down because the shipping costs only need to cover the one way cost of transit rather than also covering the cost of shipping the empty container back without the subsidy to pay the freight of the plastic recycling costs for the shipping industry rise making international trade more expensive eliminating the subsidy that rich countries are paying to ship otherwise empty containers back full of mixed trash is part of what pushes the world economy to contraction other countries are not taking over very much of china s role in recycling plastic either the net effect is that the loss of recycling is one of the things pushing the world toward contraction china has no doubt been cutting back in other ways as well it is likely that it is not building as many uninhabited cities and roads that are really not needed ugo bardi recently posted this chart showing global cement production china produces over half of the world s cement part of the reduction we are seeing relates to china s falling use of concrete in new buildings and roads in some cases china is moving in the direction of being a service economy a recent video states that of the 237 45 cost of producing an iphone in china chinese workers only provide assembly services worth 8 46 the us contributes 68 69 of the cost mostly in the design and distribution phases the parts are generally outsourced from other parts of the world one way of looking at what is happening in china s economy is to analyze the country s oil consumption in terms of the relative amounts of diesel used primarily by industry and gasoline often used by private passenger vehicles based on figure 8 it appears that china s industrial growth suddenly leveled off about 2012 this not by coincidence is about the time that china s coal problems were becoming apparent in china china s gasoline consumption has continued to rise however it appears that once it became apparent that its coal supplies were starting to seriously deplete china began to grow china s economy more as a service economy after 2012 most growth seems to have come in the non industrial sectors of china reason 7 a major concern should be a financial collapse far worse than 2008 both in china and for the world as a whole the world needs growing energy supply to support the world economy china is increasingly having difficulty with its energy supply when china has trouble with its energy supplies the world as a whole has a problem with its growth in energy supplies a few months ago i showed the role china has played in the world economy is this chart china added a little bump in gdp growth at the end of the nearly 200 year time period shown after it joined the world trade association in december 2001 the energy added by china mostly in the form of coal allowed the world economy to continue to grow when it otherwise would have been up against limits now we are reaching a situation where china s energy production is likely to flatten or fall because of the depleted state of its coal mines and the fact that coal prices can t rise high enough for long enough to open new mines the world economy over the period shown has always had rising energy consumption in most cases energy consumption rose faster than population growth allowing some growth in the standard of living over time changing to a situation of shrinking energy consumption per capita would likely be extraordinarily traumatic population would likely fall commodity prices would drop to low levels debt would tend to default prices of shares of stock would fall many governments would fail if shrinking energy consumption per capita starts in one country whether china or elsewhere it could easily spread to other countries around the world we don t know what is ahead but we know that the low points on figure 9 were very bad times even though energy consumption in total was not contracting the decade of 1860 to 1870 was the decade of the us civil war the decade of the 1930s was the decade of the great depression the decade of the 1990s was the decade of the collapse of the central government of the soviet union we also know that world energy consumption and gdp growth tend to be highly correlated this is as we would expect because energy consumption is required for the many aspects of gdp growth transportation heating and or cooling and electricity all require energy consumption for example the recent divergence between gdp and energy consumption on figure 10 may be the result of overstated gdp amounts by china india and other countries if a country wants to appear inviting for new investment there is a temptation to overstate gdp since other countries seem to be doing so without penalty back during the great recession of 2008 2009 our problem was with homeowners who took out loans that were far higher than they could really afford today we have whole economies taking on more debt than properly stated gdp reports would suggest they are able to handle we go from one version of optimism regarding debt levels to another conclusion if a person doesn t understand how badly the energy situation is working out for china or how important energy consumption is it is easy to think that the problems china is facing are primarily tariff related in fact china s situation is a very worrisome one with or without tariffs being added to fix the situation china would need a very cheap non intermittent locally produced non polluting additional energy source this energy source would also need to be rapidly scalable such an energy resource doesn t appear to be available share this email print reddit facebook twitter x linkedin

hong kong is in danger of blowing up and could drag mainland china along with it beijing appears set on ending the one country two systems principle as it pushes forward in supporting an extradition bill that would allow hong kong residents to be sent to the mainland the extradition bill is something that threatens hong kong s autonomy and will discourage many business and investors staying in hong kong thousands of protesters marched on major highways attempting to storm the legislative council in protest of the extradition bill and that could continue for days the situation remains tense as tear gas was used during yesterday s protests the protest leader jimmy sham noted demonstrators will remain in the streets until the government withdraws the proposed bill chief executive carrie lam noted that the withdrawal of the proposed extradition bill would weaken hong kong s rule of law it appears we could see an extended standoff here china is in tough position as they are short dollars and running down their reserves they use hong kong as a hub to raise dollars for their working capital to do trade with the rest of the world most of their transactions are done with the dollar but if hong kong loses favor with the international community chinese growth would be dealt another blow the hong kong crisis could continue to escalate in the coming days and should weigh on risk appetite trade deal updates could fall to the second page of papers but eventually we could see chinese politics blend together us stocks finished the day modestly lower across the board as trade

investors and businesses value hong kong s autonomy uncertainty with hong kong s autonomy will dampen business prospects and put a further strain on chinese growth if the us and europe become involved it could complicate relations and future trade deals hong kong is china s primary spot for raising us dollars is critical for china s business with the rest of the world the us could escalate this political problem into a major trade issue that could see the ending of hong kong s favored trading status hong kong is the most over levered economy in the developed world the banking system is close to 900 of gdp if we see this proposed extradition bill become law over the next couple months we could see hong kong s economy crumble us inflation softer than expected us inflation in may supported fed rate cut bets to occur at the july 31st meeting slowing economic readings will continue to solidify the end of the fed s tightening cycle and expectations should grow for two rate cuts to get

to the weakest levels in almost two months but settled slightly higher on the day eur the euro sank after president trump stated he is considering sanctions to block the nord stream 2 gas pipeline between russia and germany the us has been skeptical of thwarting off germany s dependence on russia for energy and this is one of the rare topics that trump does have bipartisan support the nord stream 2 is under construction and could split the eastern european nations away from the central and western parts the us is concerned this will solidify russia s control over the region s energy supply possibly threatening fuel to the ukraine which is now a key transit hub sanctions on companies contracted to work on the pipeline could derail the pipeline which is expected to begin at the end

with brent d griffiths the ticker joe biden is getting tougher on china whether voters think it s tough enough could shape the direction of the 2020 race the former vice president leading early polling for the democratic presidential nomination appeared to pivot wednesday from a dismissive attitude he d staked out just last month to a more confrontational posture toward the rising superpower but some china hawks argue biden s hardened stance still reads as accommodating compared to president trump s tariff backed bid to force structural economic changes in china that creates a contrast for blue collar voters in midwestern states that biden has said he is uniquely positioned to recapture biden in a speech in ottumwa iowa blasted trump s trade war as damaging american farmers and autoworkers while neglecting the investments at home necessary to keep pace with china s advancements in tech and infrastructure we need to get tough with china they are a serious challenge to us and in some areas a real threat biden said read his remarks as prepared for delivery here advertisement the conclusion marked an apparent departure from biden s assessment of the chinese threat in another iowa speech on may 1 then he suggested that the u s does not need to worry about china as a geopolitical competitor china is going to eat our lunch come on man biden said at the time i mean you know they re not bad folks folks but guess what they re not competition for us now the former vice president says to counter china s rise the u s needs to plow money into research workforce development and infrastructure work with allies to police chinese trading abuses and tighten up our defenses so that american companies don t have to keep giving away technology to china or having it stolen rob atkinson who served during the obama administration on the national innovation and competitiveness strategy advisory board said biden is clearly backtracking advertisement i think he knows his initial comments about china were not well received and were not going to play well in the battleground states the heartland so he had to change the narrative atkinson said former vice president and 2020 presidential candidate joe biden criticized president trump s approach to china on june 11 video reuters but he added that he was struck that biden didn t call out chinese mercantilism he s saying china is a threat but the response should be domestic policies only and he appears to criticize aggressive trade policies going after china if he stays with that and is the nominee that s going to be the dividing line ely ratner biden s former deputy national security adviser said wednesday s speech didn t represent an about face i think the vice president has been consistent on this issue and at the root of those earlier comments was what we heard today which is an undying faith in the american people and faith in what makes america great ratner said having worked for him and heard him speak thousands of times what i hear him saying is given a level playing field we can out compete china advertisement and he said trump s approach may look tough but is effectively a dead end trump is not putting forward a competitive strategy with china he said he s confrontational without being competitive during the 2016 campaign trump broke from decades of republican free trade orthodoxy effectively outflanking hillary clinton to the left on the issue by embracing a protectionist program since then the tariffs he has imposed on key trading partners and the retaliation from the countries facing them have pinched farmers and autoworkers in the very midwestern states that helped deliver him the white house and quinnipiac polling last month revealed trump s trade policies are underwater with voters in those rust belt battlegrounds the survey of voters in iowa michigan ohio pennsylvania and wisconsin found 41 percent of respondents approve of his approach to trade while 56 percent disapprove president trump on june 11 slammed democratic presidential candidate joe biden for his previous comments on china video the washington post pointing to those results the new york times s neil irwin seemed to anticipate biden s tack when he wrote last week you can imagine a trade pitch from the 2020 democratic nominee that goes something like this i ll work with allies to keep pressure on china over its unfair practices but not with open ended tariffs on thousands of goods that are a tax on american consumers and invite retaliation against american farmers i won t use tariffs against countries that are our close partners and i ll use trade policy to try to boost well being for american workers rather than using it as a cudgel on unrelated issues advertisement nevertheless trump on wednesday appeared to relish the opportunity to put his record against biden s on the issue joe biden thought that china was not a competitor of ours joe biden is a dummy he told reporters from the white house before leaving for his own trip to iowa china is a major competitor and right now china wants to make a deal very badly it s me right now that s holding up the deal and we re either going to do a great deal with china or we re not going to do a deal at all and china ate our country alive during obama and biden derek scissors a china scholar at the american enterprise institute pointed out that the top four vote getters in the 2016 presidential primaries trump hillary clinton sen bernie sanders i vt and sen ted cruz r texas who reversed himself to oppose fast tracking trade deals all ran to varying degrees as protectionists notwithstanding that biden realizes he needs to sound tough on china he s still outlining the obama approach he said the big question here in evaluating biden s speech is do you think we were in a good place with respect to the chinese in 2016 market movers global bond markets taunt the fed bloomberg s emily barrett bond markets

border thousands of additional migrant arrests per week and the acceptance of busloads of asylum seekers turned away from the u s border daily all geared toward cutting the migrant flow sharply in

editor s note this column first appeared as a chapter in the vox ebook trade war the clash of economic systems endangering global prosperity available to download free here future scholars may someday ask did the 2018 trade war cause the end of dispute settlement under the wto or was it the failures of dispute settlement that caused the trade war for more than 20 years the wto s dispute settlement system provided an orderly process for countries to resolve trade grievances and keep cooperation going 1 but in 2018 something broke down in this column i explore why the inability to resolve underlying problems with the wto itself deserves some of the blame the main goal is to arrive at some potential lessons for a future system of dispute settlement the us deliberately pushed the wto to the brink before turning to a critique of the wto i begin with the conventional wisdom the us provoked a crisis in 2018 with three precisely targeted policy decisions that expertly poked holes in some of the wto s weakest spots first it imposed new tariffs which it claimed would not be subject to international review on nearly 50 billion of steel and aluminium imports formally the us excused its new tariffs by triggering the wto s national security exception the us administration has argued this exception is self judging or non justiciable meaning that it cannot be questioned or benchmarked against externally verifiable economic evidence unlike other opt outs like antidumping or safeguards 2 but denying any outside check could lead to copycat behaviour and a protectionist spiral in which countries ignore even the most basic rules that limit tariffs the result could be systemic failure second the us retaliated against another wto member without first going through the formal dispute resolution process its tariffs on 250 billion of imports from china came after completing only an internal investigation wto rules require a country first win a dispute that requests the partner change its policies the us could only be authorised to retaliate if china then refused to comply and even then the retaliation would be subject to wto limits third the us initiated a procedure that could end the wto s system of resolving disputes countries currently have the right to appeal to the wto s standing appellate body ab if they disagree with a preliminary ruling but the united states has refused to allow the appointment of new ab members as old members terms expire by december 2019 the ab may not have enough members to issue rulings to appeals 3 but if no rulings are issuable a forward looking defendant country could simply trigger an appeal put the legal case into permanent limbo and eliminate the wto s ability to authorise tariff retaliation against countries that fail to comply scholars have articulated the extraordinary economic and long run institutional costs of these and other us policy actions taken in 2017 2018 4 those costs are of first order importance but will not be repeated here instead the next sections explore the political economic concerns with the wto that may have contributed to these us actions china s subsidies demanded us intervention of some form the us imposed national security tariffs in part because of china s state driven economic model in sectors like steel and aluminium for example china s expansion increased from under 20 to over 50 of global production between 2002 and 2017 yet even as china s domestic demand began to slow production and its already formidable exports continued to increase china s subsidies and exports exacerbated three external concerns its potential global domination was worrisome on anti competitiveness grounds because of its history of abusing international market power once acquired 5 furthermore us policymakers have become more sensitive to the fact that technology and trade induced shocks impose larger than expected adjustment costs on domestic communities and labour markets and that the chinese system may push its share of those costs onto others autor et al 2016 6 finally china got caught in us domestic politics steel and aluminium firms are geographically concentrated in american swing states and us policymakers are historically responsive to their economic interests and the industries older mostly male workers may be part of the other recent us narrative over identity politics grossman and helpman 2018 us national security tariffs arose because others wouldn t work or had been ruled illegal by the wto other us policy options had been taken off the table for a combination of reasons the us had already emptied some of the wto toolbox but to little economic effect its use of antidumping tariffs had mostly stopped steel and aluminium imports directly entering from china but china s exports to third countries continued to rise as did us imports from third countries likely due to trade diversion and potentially trade deflection but second the us was unwilling to deploy a nondiscriminatory safeguard tariff instead of a national security tariff because earlier attempts had been thwarted by the wto itself the ab issued a series of legal rulings condemning us safeguards imposed over 1995 2003 including a 2002 us safeguard on steel 7 the us was also concerned a wto dispute was too risky and potentially unwinnable the us ruled out a formal dispute to stop chinese subsidies the first best result out of concern that the wto was not well equipped to constrain chinese style subsidisation 8 wto subsidy disciplines can easily capture transparent direct payments from a government agency to firms but chinese subsidies are different and often stem from a nuanced and complex combination of policies a recent oecd 2019 study of the downstream finished aluminium industry is illustrative its first key point is that primary aluminium is estimated to make up 75 86 of the cost of downstream products and primary aluminium has benefited from highly subsidised chinese coal but second china also imposed export restrictions on primary aluminium implicitly subsidising chinese downstream firms relative to their foreign competitors china also rebated value added taxes to exporters of downstream products without doing the same to primary producers the combined result was a heavily subsidised downstream refined aluminium industry but it is also one that the wto legal system would have found challenging to address 9 the us imposed unilateral tariffs because that type of wto dispute was also unwinnable the idea that wto dispute settlement was not well positioned to tackle a suite of chinese policies whose economic effect was to act against the spirit if not the legal letter of wto rules applies similarly to the us unilateral tariffs on 250 billion of imports the us economic argument was that china maintained high tariffs for example on automobiles that contributed to foreign firms needing to access the chinese market through foreign direct investment in lieu of exports but investment combined with china s joint venture requirements and other regulatory barriers created greater possibilities for the forcible transfer of foreign technology industrial espionage and theft of intellectual property ustr 2018 again because it was a combination of chinese policies some such as high chinese tariffs that were not wto inconsistent when viewed in isolation a wto dispute seemed unable to solve the problem see also wu 2016 however one important counter argument and that the us gave up on formal dispute settlement prematurely is that it failed to appeal to the wto s non violation nullification and impairment nvni clause staiger and sykes 2013 loosely interpreted nvni is a legal provision by which the wto could find china guilty of harming us trading interests even without having broken any explicit wto rules nevertheless there have been few attempts to use such an argument with respect to china it would also require that the ab grapple with economic models in order to assess how complex policy interactions taking place in a non market economy adversely impact us economic activity it is not as straightforward as asking the ab whether one chinese policy crossed some red line it also would have been philosophically inconsistent for the us to ask the wto to find another country guilty even though it hadn t broken any explicit rules the current us administration has argued repeatedly against any wto attempts to encroach on national sovereignty the appellate body needs a reboot because it had gone astray much of the us action that could eliminate the appellate body was based on the concern that the wto has engaged in judicial overreach the argument is that the ab imposed obligations on the us and other countries that had never been agreed through 70 years of gatt or wto negotiations 10 as noted one example involved a series of rulings against us use of safeguards in another backward looking example the us became frustrated that it lost dozens of wto decisions over zeroing or an approach to calculating antidumping tariffs it has argued these rulings overly constrained the us ability to address unfair trade bown and prusa 2011 other forward looking us worries involve china in ongoing cases over china s non market economy status the ab could further limit how the us deploys its antidumping tariffs in other disputes the ab may decide that chinese state owned firms are not a public body and thus do not count as being a subsidy provider limiting us use of countervailing duties the us view is that it was the ab s own rulings that created the need for someone to step in and the problems couldn t be fixed without a crisis because with the doha round of negotiations stuck the wto lacks a rules making function to legislate corrections when the ab either makes a legal error or crosses a politically sensitive red line to make its point the us did two things it imposed policies national security tariffs and tariffs on china that were even more problematic than the ones ruled illegal in the past it also threatened the existence of the wto dispute settlement system that had decided that those earlier policies were illegal dispute settlement may be going back to the gatt dispute settlement was not always this legalistic under the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt the wto s predecessor from 1947 1994 disputes were typically resolved quite differently the key gatt distinction was that countries could veto the dispute at any stage this included a veto from the defendant before the dispute began or right before adoption of a legal ruling because the resulting legal process was uncertain disputes were addressed through negotiation or not at all and it was also a system that benefited those with power as the current us trade representative robert lighthizer has expressed an affinity for the gatt system lighthizer 2017 that may be where things are headed ironically it was the us that became increasingly frustrated with the gatt s ineffectiveness in the 1980s it turned to the aggressively unilateral section 301 the same law used to impose tariffs on china in 2018 and demanded partners provide additional access for us exporters or face tariffs growing concerns with us unilateralism at the time helped lead to the uruguay round agreement and the creation of the wto dispute settlement system 11 and over the ensuring 25 years no countries could block the process of dispute resolution and the wto could authorise retaliation if countries were found not to comply with the rules and critically important it was rare for a dispute to ever reach the stage of retaliation before being resolved the other main problem with the gatt is that there was a lot more protectionism much of it through voluntary export restraints hoekman and kostecki 2009 bown 2019 and while no major trade wars may have erupted the gatt was never forced to confront today s trade tensions between market oriented and state driven economies wto dispute settlement is not gone yet nor is the 2018 trade war but if either goes any evaluation of the effectiveness of the us strategy will also require a thorough assessment of the new dispute settlement system that replaces it and that will require grappling with what the wto system provided warts and all author s note thanks to bernard hoekman petros mavroidis robert staiger and mark wu for comments all remaining errors are my own

manufacturing of course us spending on active labour market policies a more efficient approach to facilitating adjustment is also low relative to peer countries bown and freund 2019 while the us imposed safeguards on solar panels and washing machines in 2018 indicating the constraint was nonbinding the us government was forced to act because those cases were initiated by domestic industry the last time the us government self initiated a safeguard investigation was 2002 which resulted in the steel tariffs rebuked by the ab sykes 2003 the obama administration filed a wto dispute against china s aluminium subsidies at the very end of 2016 that the trump administration decided not to pursue the us had pushed for a multilateral oecd forum to address global chinese steel overcapacity but that also made little progress a final argument against formal dispute settlement is the length of the process horn et al 2011 find that on average three years elapse between the initiation of the

consumer price inflation picked up momentum and reached 2 7 y o y in may the rise in food and vegetable prices are visibly felt by chinese consumers and the yuan depreciation is certainly a major responsible for the current price dynamics the rising inflation could be a barrier for the people bank of china s pboc policy easing efforts shanghai s composite index 0 59 edged lower as the pboc doves became less convinced with their positions after the solid inflation data have the us treasury markets gone ahead of themselves the us 10 year yields recovered to 2 14 as the us treasury markets began questioning how realistic the federal reserve s fed rate cut speculations are in fact markets have a short memory and investors tend to overweight the recent events as such the markets may have gone well ahead of themselves after last week s jobs report pointed at a softening labor market in the us and the fed chair jerome powell hinted that a rate cut could be considered to give support to the economy so if the us inflation figures due later today confirm a slowdown in consumer prices in may as expected the recovery in the yields could halt or even reverse in fact the us headline inflation may have eased from 1 9 year on year versus 2 0 printed a month earlier although the inflation excluding food and energy is seen steady at 2 1 over the same period while the recent events and data may justify a softer fed policy to some extent in the coming months this do not necessarily mean that the fed should start gearing back as soon as the july meeting the us unemployment rate hit the lowest levels in two decades and the us gdp growth remained above 3 in the first quarter despite the downside revision due to slower investment this being said the fed may have put itself in a challenging position face to the financial markets given the jump in rate cut probabilities the fed could eventually be brought to act sooner than it intended to to avoid disappointing the market and injecting an unwanted price volatility in stock markets during the low volume summer months hence we could expect a further upside volatility in the us yields before and after the fed s june 19 meeting should the fed readjust its tone to a less dovish policy stance the yields could jump and the probability of the next fed cut if any could take a sharp dive apple in focus as us china relations get tenser the us giant phone maker apple is in investors focus as the escalating trade war between the us and china could squeeze the company first because china is clearly one of the highest growth potential markets in the world and second because the low cost production plants in china could soon be forced to relocate elsewhere however there is no need to panic just yet a leading apple supplier foxconn which produces most of iphones and ipads in china said that it has enough capacity outside china to meet the demand yet if apple becomes an arm for china to fight back the us trade attacks relocation outside china could clearly be an option to be considered in the latter case investors already question whether it would lead to a substantial price increase in apple products an important decline in company profits or perhaps both apple hasn t asked for a production shift for now apple s share price recovered to 196 per share as a result of the june risk rally but short positions could challenge apple s positive price trend into the 200 mark turkey to stay pat despite rising temptation to ease policy the central bank of turkey cbt is expected to keep its policy rate unchanged at 24 despite the growing temptation to unwind its 625 basis point tightening over the past year and indeed with the markets fiercely pricing in a fed rate cut as early as july this year investors could be in a better position to absorb lower turkish rates but in spite of the prospects for softer us yields a stronger lira and the softening consumer inflation the june meeting may not be the right moment for the cbt to cut the rates given that the controversial rerun of the mayor election in istanbul on june 23rd could rise tensions in turkish markets and weigh on the lira despite a favorable market environment for high yielding currencies
it seems to me that the situation in china is far different from what most people think it is even if we would like to depend on china we really cannot reason 1 when we depend on goods from china an amazingly large share of the world s industrial activity gets concentrated in china the five largest users of energy in the world are china the united states india russia and japan the international energy agency shows total energy consumption as follows for the year 2016 when these countries are compared restricting our analysis to the portion of energy used by industry we find the rather disconcerting result shown in figure 2 china consumes more fuel for industrial production than the next four countries listed united states india russia and japan combined of course we don t know exactly the corresponding amounts for other countries of the world but we can observe that if a country is concerned about its co2 emissions the easiest way to reduce these emissions is to send heavy industry elsewhere such as to china or india there are likely many countries that are primarily service economies thanks to the option of outsourcing most industry to other countries much of the discussion i have read regarding sending industry elsewhere has been in the direction of as advanced as our economy is we don t need heavy industry service jobs will substitute industry can be developed at lower cost elsewhere everyone will be better off with this arrangement the invisible hand will provide jobs and goods and services for everyone in addition corporations saw the possibility of adding customers from around the world not too many thought about the real world problems that might result clearly there is a problem with the jobs being lost to china and other emerging markets when new service jobs are added they often do not pay as well the industrial jobs they replaced in fact there might not be enough jobs in total if automation plays an important role as well another issue is that the level of industrial concentration can be a problem we are now depending on china and perhaps a few other countries to provide for a large share of the stuff we use even if china is not the only provider it is often an important part of the supply chain if something should go wrong for example widespread riots in china we don t have a plan b reason 2 china needs energy products to make the goods it uses for itself and for the goods it exports china s own energy supply is faltering because of china s huge size it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep china s energy consumption rising sufficiently rapidly using imported energy china s own energy production is shown in figure 3 note hot off the press new bp report released this week it is easy to see that china s coal production hit its highest point in 2013 and has stayed at a lower level since that date also china s highest oil production occurred in 2015 with lower production since that date china s total energy production has been rising recently but only with great effort total energy production is only 8 9 higher in 2018 than it was in 2012 implying an increase of less than 1 5 per year relative to 2012 amounts a standard workaround for inadequate energy production growth is imported energy products even with these imports it has been impossible to keep total energy consumption rising as rapidly as it rose in the 2002 to 2007 period the cost with imports is greater also in 2018 china imported 71 of its petroleum either as crude or as products and 43 of its natural gas it was the largest importer in the world with respect to both of these fuels in 2018 china s coal imports shrank as its own coal production surged this was almost certainly a change planned by china china would much prefer producing its own coal and keeping the jobs within the country to importing coal from elsewhere china imported 4 of its coal from elsewhere in 2018 reason 3 the commodity demand from china is so huge that to a significant extent it determines world commodity price levels where regional energy prices exist china s choice regarding whether or not to import from a country can influence local price levels chile is the largest copper producer in the world a recent article regarding problems associated with lower copper prices notes that the demand for chilean copper has been driven almost entirely by the expanding chinese economy over the last three decades for many commodities china consumes over half of the world s commodity supply if china s industrial demand is growing prices will tend to rise allowing more of the mineral to be extracted higher commodity prices tend to be needed over time because the ores of highest concentration and otherwise easiest to extract ores tend to be extracted first ores extracted later tend to be more expensive to extract so higher prices are required for extraction to be profitable this situation of china playing an extremely large role in commodity prices holds for a very large number of commodities if china is building widgets or any other product using a particular commodity china s need to buy this commodity in the world market will tend to hold up world prices for the commodity this situation holds even for fossil fuel prices reason 4 over the next few years china s coal supply is likely to fall significantly because of depletion this lower fuel supply is likely to lead to a shrinkage of china s industrial capability and indirectly falling world commodity prices of all kinds the problem that china is encountering in figure 3 is peak coal this is a similar problem to that encountered by the united kingdom immediately before world war i and to that germany encountered just before world war ii coal tends to be the industrial fuel of choice because it is cheap goods made with coal tend to be inexpensive especially if wages paid to workers are low and if the company making the goods does not spend much money on pollution prevention hydroelectric can be an adequate substitute for coal if the water flow can be depended upon wind and solar are too intermittent and not sufficiently inexpensive to be adequate substitutes for coal wind and solar included in other ren on figure 3 are also far smaller in quantity than coal outsourcing a large share of the world s manufacturing to china seemed like a great idea back when it was started often in the early 2000s if at some point china cannot really handle the responsibility it has taken on outsourcing gets to be a huge problem the reason why coal prices cannot rise very high is because if they do the prices of finished goods will need to rise as well wages of workers around the world will not rise at the same time because the higher cost of production takes place due to something that is equivalent to growing inefficiency the coal mined is of lower quality or in thinner seams or needs to be transported further this means that more workers and more fuel is needed for each ton of coal extracted this leaves fewer workers and less fuel for other industrial tasks so that in total the economy can manufacture fewer goods and services because of these issues countries experiencing peak coal are pushed toward contraction of their economies unfortunately rather than leading to high prices to compensate for the higher extraction costs running short of inexpensive to extract fuel tends to lead to war or to tariff fights countries whose coal is depleting will try to maintain their own supply as long as possible they will invent excuses to stop importing coal back in september 2018 the financial review reported china has introduced unofficial restrictions on coal imports in a bid to prop up domestic prices by slowing down customs approvals at key ports china needed higher internal prices to make it profitable to extract coal from its depleting coal mines if higher coal prices really were possible over the long term it would make it possible to open new mines in more distant locations the location of coal mines is important because transport costs by rail or truck tend to be high china built the large ghost city of ordos inner mongolia on the expectation that coal prices would rise making development of coal in the area profitable unfortunately coal prices fell making the project not economic i visited the area in 2015 after teaching a short course on energy economics in beijing there was a large almost empty airport and few vehicles were using nearby multi lane roads reason 5 all of the concern about future tariffs artificially raised china s 2018 industrial production and commodity prices because production was brought forward into 2018 china s production and world commodity prices can be expected to be lower in 2019 and in future years manufacturers wanted to front run tariffs so they tended to ramp up production in advance of the tariff implementation date this higher production in turn tended to raise commodity production and prices around the world note on figure 6 above that coal and oil prices are both higher in 2018 than in 2017 prices in 2019 not shown are tending to trend downward again china badly needed higher coal prices in order to help its coal extraction thus part of the reason that china was able to continue to function as well as it did in 2018 was because of all of the discussion about future tariffs if this discussion had not taken place employment in china would likely have been lower with this lower employment sales of automobiles and smartphones would have been lower as well note too that even with the demand brought forward into 2018 china s economy was not functioning very well in 2018 private passenger automobile sales for the year fell by 4 smartphone sales fell by a worrisome 15 5 clearly workers were having difficulty buying the kinds of goods a person would expect a growing economy to be selling i would attribute these problems to the peak coal problem mentioned earlier making it increasingly difficult to increase the amount of industrial operations provided by china s economy reason 6 the chinese economy has been gradually changing and adapting to hide its energy problems even more changes will be needed in the future potentially affecting the world economy with or without tariffs the chinese economy reports carefully massaged gdp numbers which many analysts consider to be inflated in recent years its debt level keeps rising to try to keep all of its operations going we know that china discontinued one major industry at the beginning of 2018 recycling plastic and other types of low valued recycling with low oil and natural gas prices this type of recycling cannot be profitable of course discontinuing a major industry can be expected to lead to a loss of jobs within china but on the positive side it frees up coal and other energy resources in china for other industries that can perhaps make more profitable use of them on a world basis the loss of the plastic recycling industry becomes a problem if rich countries are willing to subsidize the cost of sending plastic recycling to china this subsidy allows containers that bring goods to rich countries to be sent back to china with a paid load inside thus operating the plastic recycling industry helps keep the cost of shipment of goods from china to the us or europe down because the shipping costs only need to cover the one way cost of transit rather than also covering the cost of shipping the empty container back without the subsidy to pay the freight of the plastic recycling costs for the shipping industry rise making international trade more expensive eliminating the subsidy that rich countries are paying to ship otherwise empty containers back full of mixed trash is part of what pushes the world economy to contraction other countries are not taking over very much of china s role in recycling plastic either the net effect is that the loss of recycling is one of the things pushing the world toward contraction china has no doubt been cutting back in other ways as well it is likely that it is not building as many uninhabited cities and roads that are really not needed ugo bardi recently posted this chart showing global cement production china produces over half of the world s cement part of the reduction we are seeing relates to china s falling use of concrete in new buildings and roads in some cases china is moving in the direction of being a service economy a recent video states that of the 237 45 cost of producing an iphone in china chinese workers only provide assembly services worth 8 46 the us contributes 68 69 of the cost mostly in the design and distribution phases the parts are generally outsourced from other parts of the world one way of looking at what is happening in china s economy is to analyze the country s oil consumption in terms of the relative amounts of diesel used primarily by industry and gasoline often used by private passenger vehicles based on figure 8 it appears that china s industrial growth suddenly leveled off about 2012 this not by coincidence is about the time that china s coal problems were becoming apparent in china china s gasoline consumption has continued to rise however it appears that once it became apparent that its coal supplies were starting to seriously deplete china began to grow china s economy more as a service economy after 2012 most growth seems to have come in the non industrial sectors of china reason 7 a major concern should be a financial collapse far worse than 2008 both in china and for the world as a whole the world needs growing energy supply to support the world economy china is increasingly having difficulty with its energy supply when china has trouble with its energy supplies the world as a whole has a problem with its growth in energy supplies a few months ago i showed the role china has played in the world economy is this chart china added a little bump in gdp growth at the end of the nearly 200 year time period shown after it joined the world trade association in december 2001 the energy added by china mostly in the form of coal allowed the world economy to continue to grow when it otherwise would have been up against limits now we are reaching a situation where china s energy production is likely to flatten or fall because of the depleted state of its coal mines and the fact that coal prices can t rise high enough for long enough to open new mines the world economy over the period shown has always had rising energy consumption in most cases energy consumption rose faster than population growth allowing some growth in the standard of living over time changing to a situation of shrinking energy consumption per capita would likely be extraordinarily traumatic population would likely fall commodity prices would drop to low levels debt would tend to default prices of shares of stock would fall many governments would fail if shrinking energy consumption per capita starts in one country whether china or elsewhere it could easily spread to other countries around the world we don t know what is ahead but we know that the low points on figure 9 were very bad times even though energy consumption in total was not contracting the decade of 1860 to 1870 was the decade of the us civil war the decade of the 1930s was the decade of the great depression the decade of the 1990s was the decade of the collapse of the central government of the soviet union we also know that world energy consumption and gdp growth tend to be highly correlated this is as we would expect because energy consumption is required for the many aspects of gdp growth transportation heating and or cooling and electricity all require energy consumption for example the recent divergence between gdp and energy consumption on figure 10 may be the result of overstated gdp amounts by china india and other countries if a country wants to appear inviting for new investment there is a temptation to overstate gdp since other countries seem to be doing so without penalty back during the great recession of 2008 2009 our problem was with homeowners who took out loans that were far higher than they could really afford today we have whole economies taking on more debt than properly stated gdp reports would suggest they are able to handle we go from one version of optimism regarding debt levels to another conclusion if a person doesn t understand how badly the energy situation is working out for china or how important energy consumption is it is easy to think that the problems china is facing are primarily tariff related in fact china s situation is a very worrisome one with or without tariffs being added to fix the situation china would need a very cheap non intermittent locally produced non polluting additional energy source this energy source would also need to be rapidly scalable such an energy resource doesn t appear to be available share this email print reddit facebook twitter x linkedin
menafn venezuelanalysis com field type text with summary field label hidden body text various developments at the outset of nicolÃ¡s maduro s presidency set the stage for what has been called a humanitarian crisis consisting of hyperinflation a sharp decline in national income massive emigration and acute political conflict and disorder when hugo chÃ¡vez went off to cuba for the last time to seek cancer treatment in late 2012 maduro as vice president took charge of the government during those months of political uncertainty the exchange control system that guided the nation s imports became largely non functional as the black market price for the dollar began to spiral out of control the resultant inflation reached an estimated 150 000 per cent by 2018 and cut into purchasing power as wages failed to catch up a second early development that signalled acute conflict and instability was the refusal of the opposition and the united states government to recognise maduro s triumph in the presidential elections following chÃ¡vez s death in march 2013 the increasingly hostile position of both these actors toward the venezuelan government culminated in 2019 with the formation in defiance of maduro of a parallel government headed by national assembly president juan guaidÃ³ and its immediate recognition by washington another problematic characteristic of the maduro presidency that manifested itself at the start was his tendency to refrain from taking difficult but necessary measures and acting boldly and decisively to face pressing problems thus maduro failed to act on charges formulated by former insiders in 2014 that the nation had been bilked of twenty billion dollars through the manipulation of the exchange control system even though the president recognised the possible veracity of the accusation indeed the increasing disparity between the official price that the government charged those whose request for dollars from the state was approved in accordance with the exchange control system and the black market price for dollars lent itself to corruption as the disparity increased so did the damage caused by maduro s failure to modify or scrap the exchange control system in addition in response to severe economic and political difficulties in mid 2014 maduro promised a cabinet shakeup what he called el gran sacudÃ³n creating great expectations not only did he put off making the announcement for over a month but he retained most of the key members of his administration finally little over a year after maduro assumed the presidency international oil prices plummeted while venezuela s oil output also declined significantly subsequently oil prices began to recover but failed to come close to their pre 2014 levels while production continued to decrease partly as a result of us sanctions imposed on the state oil company pdvsa these developments involving foreign intervention leadership capacity international oil prices and the exchange control system have given rise to diverse opinions regarding the root cause of the venezuelan crisis different theories put the blame on different actors either maduro and those surrounding him or the venezuelan opposition and the us government or washington alone the fact that each of these problems dates back to the beginning of the maduro government if not before confuses the effort to determine which one came first and could thus be considered the pivotal factor five major explanations have been put forward the unrelenting hostility of internal and external adversaries leading to international sanctions and threats of military action the plummeting of international oil prices aggravated by the government s failure to diversify production and sever dependency on petroleum mistaken policies that discouraged private investments the mismanagement and incompetence of the maduro government and socialism s inherent contradictions and unsustainability i argue in this essay that the answer to the question of what was the root cause of the current crisis is as follows almost all the above in that four of the five explanations contain important elements of truth these four plausible explanations excluding the implausible one that attributes venezuela s difficulties to socialism s lack of viability are not theories but factors that have together contributed to the crisis no methodology can determine with precision the relative importance of each of them furthermore the four reinforce one another consequently one may at least tentatively assign equal weight to the four and in doing so dismiss the usefulness of attempting to single out one as the paramount cause while one factor may be more important than others they all contributed to the crisis in major ways and thus the effort to determine the relative weight of each one appears to be of limited value moreover the effort to identify one root cause often passes over the complexity of the problems currently confronting venezuela each of the five above mentioned theories defended by politicians political activists journalists think tanks and academics is underpinned by distinct paradigms and sets of assumptions that often leave little room for the appreciation of complexity the singling out of one overriding factor is also simplistic and misleading because as stated above the major factors are interrelated and reinforce one another thus requiring an analysis based on contextualisation the following essay will examine these shortcomings as well as the broad political implications of the various explanations the five explanations for the crisis different ideologically charged opinions over the root cause of the venezuelan crisis revolve in large part around chronological order anti maduro analysts and opposition leaders for instance argue that us imposed sanctions against the venezuelan government as well as the decline in international oil prices in mid 2014 could not be held responsible for the nation s economic collapse because these factors followed rather than preceded the outset of the crisis accordingly juan guaidÃ³ criticised un high commissioner for human rights michelle bachelet for warning about the harm caused by us imposed sanctions saying it is evident she lacks information about when the sanctions began he then chastised her for not being better informed matheus 2019 along the same lines two time opposition presidential candidate henrique capriles claimed that the crisis began prior to the fall of oil prices but for a long time was ignored repressed and covered up by the government ellner 2019a the anti chavistas conclude that maduro and his followershave scapegoated washington and international oil prices for problems that are of their own making those more sympathetic to the venezuelan government contest the accuracy of this sequence thus the issue of what came first is significant and open to debate hostile actions of domestic and foreign adversaries in august 2017 the trump administration announced economic sanctions against venezuela which prohibited the purchase of bonds issued by the government or pdvsa and forbade the nation s us based company citgo from repatriating profits because the executive order was explicitly designed to render significant damage to the venezuelan economy the date was widely seen as the initiation of what the chavistas call the economic war against venezuela those who ascribe the venezuelan crisis to government incompetence and or mistaken policies discard the importance of the sanctions on the grounds that the crisis was already underway when the trump administration first implemented them nevertheless pinpointing the beginning of us supported efforts that undermined economic stability in venezuela is problematic president obama s executive order in 2015 declared venezuela an unusual and extraordinary threat to us national security the broadly worded order created a list of those venezuelans whose assets are blocked or visas restricted due to among other charges involvement in actions or policies undermining democratic processes or institutions congressional research service 2019 obama s order was not as dramatic and explicit as that of trump and thus received less attention and did not become the focus of debate nor did it trigger the formation of an important pro venezuela solidarity movement at the international level some analysts and political activists viewed the sanctions as innocuous or in the words of guaidÃ³ not directed at the nation but at corrupt functionaries and violators of human rights matheus 2019 nevertheless obama s executive order sent a signal to the private sector after the order was implemented various large us firms including ford and kimberly clark closed factories and pulled out of venezuela in the process heavily impacting the economy furthermore the sanctions against venezuela and venezuelans albeit on a more modest scale dated back to the administration of george w bush congressional research service 2019 bush s sanctions banned the sale of spare parts to the venezuelan air force s flagship fighter jets the f 16s much depends on how the issue of hostility against the chavista government is framed it makes a difference whether what is under examination is an economic war or whether it takes into account other forms of hostility with economic repercussions and whether the focus is on us initiated actions or also includes those of the domestic opposition supported by washington some of the economic problems currently afflicting venezuela resulted from regime change efforts by a disloyal opposition that is an opposition that refused to recognise the government s legitimacy thus for instance the system of exchange controls which has been largely responsible for the nation s high inflation rate and its steady increase since 2012 was implemented after a two month general strike spearheaded by the venezuelan chamber of commerce fedecamaras in 2002 2003 threatened to trigger capital flight continuing fear of capital flight driven by a hostile private sector intent on regime change is one reason why the system was not subsequently discontinued or modified in fundamental ways oil dependence and international oil prices academics political commentators and political actors are divided over whether the sharp decline in oil prices played a major role in setting off the venezuelan crisis over the decades writers on venezuela influenced by dependency and world systems theories consistently pointed out that the volatility of oil prices played havoc with economic and political stability an argument applied to the current situation by analysts of different political persuasions lÃ³pez maya 2016 330 venezuela under maduro like elsewhere in the global south has been hurt not only by low oil prices but also by sharp market fluctuations government commitments and popular expectations were heightened during the boom period but generated frustration and anger when prices later fell thus contributing to the nation s political turmoil and crisis bergquist 1986 ellner 2019a in this sense maduro was at a considerable disadvantage in comparison to chÃ¡vez the harshest critics of chavismo deny the importance of oil prices as a cause of the venezuelan crisis and instead blame maduro for the nation s economic difficulties moisÃ©s naÃ­m former development minister under the neo liberal government of carlos andrÃ©s pÃ©rez and subsequently editor of foreign policy and venezuelan specialist javier corrales argue that in the words of naÃ­m and economist francisco toro all the world s petrostates suffered a serious income shock in 2014 as a result of plummeting oil prices only venezuela could not withstand the pressure naÃ­m and toro 2018a 128 corrales 2017 31 nevertheless while venezuela was the opec nation most adversely affected by the sharp downturn in oil prices it was also the only one along with iran subject to international sanctions writers belonging to the school of neo extractivism criticise chÃ¡vez and maduro and other pro leftist pink tide governments for having failed to sever dependence on basic commodity exports and to anticipate price declines such as occurred after the 2008 stock crash that led to venezuela s economic crisis lander 2012 79 86 scholars across the political spectrum have generally accepted this observation however while most neo extractivism scholars centre their analysis on the harmful impact of extractivism and pass over the pink tide s possible redeeming features ellner 2019b 15 17 writers sympathetic to the chavista government recognise its failure to reduce the hold of the nation s rentier economy but also point to positive features thus they present a balanced view of government strategy that inadvertently contributed to the nation s pressing economic problems and in doing so underline the complexity of the venezuelan crisis and its multiple causes katz 2015 32 33 greg wilpert 2012 159 2015 for instance has written that although chÃ¡vez and maduro failed to use oil revenue to overcome dependence with the social economy the government is planting the seeds of a transformative alternative james petras and henry veltmeyer for their part hold the pink tide governments including that of venezuela responsible for their vulnerability to the volatility of global markets nevertheless they consider venezuela a special case and credit it for promoting the socialization of production and substantive changes in contrast to bolivia and other pink tide countries petras and veltmeyer 2014 11 39 petras 2019 mistaken policies and strategies some political analysts single out unfriendly government policies toward domestic and foreign capital and resultant disinvestment as the principal cause of the crisis according to this position venezuela went the furthest of any of the pink tide governments in expropriating numerous companies and under maduro placing a cap of 30 per cent on profits these policies explain why the nation was hardest hit by the economic downturn in the second decade of the century the contextualisation of this factor and the chronology of events related to economic polices help rule out the explanation that the socialist character of the government was the cause of the crisis the resistance to the chÃ¡vez government by fedecamaras and other peak employer organisations preceded chÃ¡vez s proclamation of socialism as a national goal in 2005 and the mass expropriations following his third presidential election in 2006 in fact fedecamaras opposed chÃ¡vez s first presidential candidacy in 1998 and went on to spearhead the april 2002 coup as well as the 2002 2003 general strike which in effect was a lock out the radicalisation of fedecamaras position was an immediate reaction to legislation passed in late 2001 consisting of agrarian reform and measures applied to the oil industry which reflected an economic nationalism that undid the neo liberal oil opening apertura petrolera of the 1990s ellner 2008 114 this sequence of events explains why the argument that anti business policies were the main cause of the crisis conflicts with the socialism doesn t work explanation to be discussed below the disinvestment resulting from policies considered anti business may be tied to another factor discussed in this article in the section titled hostile actions of domestic and foreign adversaries there are two possible dynamics at play related to disinvestment domestic and foreign capital may have disinvested as a result of market considerations that is because projected profits were perceived to be insufficient to justify continued operations the second possibility is that investment decisions were politically motivated as the private sector sought to pressure the government into modifying policies or to generate economic instability leading to regime change us policy toward venezuela beginning with president george w bush labelling it a hostile state and culminating with the international campaign unleashed by trump played into the second dynamic consisting of a consciously devised political strategy both dynamics undoubtedly played a role ellner 2017 thus confirming the central thesis of this article regarding the interconnectedness of the basic factors contributing to the venezuelan crisis another policy that is alleged to have contributed to the economic crisis is venezuela s foreign policy which antagonised the united states jorge castaÃ±eda 2008 238 239 has argued that venezuela paid a heavy price for chÃ¡vez s anti americanism in that it jeopardised his nation s oil exports to its principal market a claim that has also been made against maduro however castaÃ±eda and others who condemn chÃ¡vez s hostile declarations toward washington fail to contextualise us venezuelan relations see also muravchik 2019 33 the contextualisation of the tensions between the two nations is useful in that it helps determine whether chÃ¡vez s and maduro s denunciations of the us were pure demagoguery as these writers allege or were basically reactive in spite of his fiery rhetoric in the leadup to the 1998 presidential elections and his first several years in office chÃ¡vez generally showed moderation in his interaction with the us even shortly after the washington supported coup in april 2002 and then the creation of the office of transition initiatives operating out of the us embassy in caracas chavez was discrete in his references to the us government harnecker 2005 134 ellner 2008 199 the first sign of open hostility between the two nations was the decision of the bush administration to recall its ambassador in caracas and its questioning of chÃ¡vez s democratic credentials in response to his cautiously worded criticism of us bombings in afghanistan in late 2001 leadership capacity incompetence and misrule many of those vehemently opposed to maduro single out government incompetence as the main factor behind the crisis in all its dimensions when venezuela was hit with severe electricity shortages in early 2019 opposition leaders and washington spokespeople including secretary of state mike pompeo alleged that the problem was due to incompetence and not sabotage as the venezuelan government claimed they pointed out that power outages had become common albeit not of the same lengthy duration years prior to the implementation of sanctions and that more recently many of the technicians who worked for the state electricity company had emigrated duber and castro 2019 a 7 sheridan and zuÃ±iga 2019 a 1 journalist and ngo participant mary anastasia o grady as well as the left leaning catholic publication commonweal emphasised the chavistas incompetence in explaining other pressing problems such as poverty and the distortions caused by the exchange control system including hyper inflation o grady 2016 a 19 commonweal 2019 5 the economist 2019 47 anti chavistas who attributed venezuela s crisis to government incompetence pointed to various aspects of chavista rule in order to back their claim in the first place president chÃ¡vez fired all 18 000 pdvsa employees who participated in the 2002 2003 general strike to topple the government most of whom were technical and professional personnel after production was restored the chavista leaders drew the conclusion that loyalty and political considerations were more important than technical skill in running the industry ellner 2008 159 160 in the second place the constant shuffling by presidents chÃ¡vez and maduro of their cabinet and selection of members who were not specialists in the field left the impression that political criteria were prioritised over technical ones in addition the list of nearly one hundred top chavistas whom the us government as well as canada and the european union sanctioned on grounds of illicit and unethical behaviour contributed to the notion that the chavistas were unqualified to rule finally anti chavistas at all levels sometimes pointed to maduro s class origin as well as that of chÃ¡vez as a bus driver as evidence that he lacked the necessary skills to run the country salazar huneeus 2017 chronology and context need to be brought into the discussion of leadership skills as is the case with the three other factors behind the nation s crisis as referred to above maduro inherited an exchange control system that had gotten out of control during the months of a veritable power vacuum following chavez s absence from the country prior to his death in 2013 another contextual consideration is the sharpness of the contrast in oil prices after 2014 compared with the steady increases of the chÃ¡vez years thus generating discontent among venezuelans whose living standards deteriorated significantly and reinforcing the view that maduro was incompetent nevertheless it is undeniable that maduro s decision making capacity did not match that of chÃ¡vez the latter for instance acted immediately and decisively to face a financial crisis occurring in 2009 by jailing various top members of the private sector who were closely associated with his government and were held responsible for the calamity at the same time he nationalised various poorly managed banks that were on the verge of collapse and merged them into the newly created banco bicentenario in contrast maduro waited until mid 2017 to take visible measures against corruption by choosing tarek william saab as attorney general who ordered the arrest of numerous top pdvsa executives accused of corruption by then however the problem was of greater proportions and much more difficult to confront given the nation s political climate an additional aspect of leadership deficiency was maduro s failure to explain with detailed evidence the effects and multiple dimensions of the economic war on venezuela and his overreliance on shibboleths and slogans this stood in sharp contrast to chÃ¡vez s communication skills which were recognised even by his adversaries those who consider government incompetence as the root explanation for the crisis often link it with the implementation of ill advised policies in particular ones that were hostile toward the private sector such as expropriations naÃ­m and toro 2018b for instance claim that maduro plainly has no clue how to reverse any of the multiple crises he has set off their basic argument is that the venezuelan problem consists of sheer incompetence and by way of example they claim that the government appointed chÃ¡vez cronies who lacked the expertise to administer one expropriated company after another naÃ­m and toro 2018a 130 133 at the same time those who emphasise incompetence typically view socialist ideology as a mere veneer kumanaev 2018 c 1 naÃ­m and toro 2018a 128 point out that the venezuelan economic crisis cannot be attributed to socialism because the economies of other pink tide countries were also critically affected even though not all of them were committed to socialist goals the socialism doesn t work narrative the anti socialist narrative on venezuela was articulated by president trump during his 2017 un general assembly address when he stated the problem in venezuela is not that socialism has been poorly implemented but that socialism has been faithfully implemented aleem 2017 when trump repeated the claim in his 2019 state of the union address it was obviously designed to be used as a major talking point for his 2020 presidential bid undoubtedly trump s intention was not to single out the small socialist wing of the democratic party headed by bernie sanders according to the narrative the entire democratic leadership is committed to the implementation of socialist policies that threaten to lead to economic disaster just as they did in venezuela think tank pundits and other analysts on the right of the political spectrum also ascribe venezuela s economic woes to socialism and like president trump conflate reformist policies of an economic nature with socialist ones some criticise the mainstream media for downplaying or ignoring venezuela s socialist character by referring to it as a welfare state and the government as populist rossell 2015 one analyst writing in commentary maintained that socialism in all its varieties had proved to be a failure with the collapse of the soviet union a lesson that seems to have been widely absorbed until chavismo brought it all back muravchik 2019 36 another writing in the new american stated that until average venezuelans come to realize that socialism is at the root of their problems they will just keep replacing one left wing government with another tennant 2017 39 however the thesis that points to socialism as the true culprit ignores the fact that between 70 and 80 per cent of the venezuelan economy is in private hands in their analysis of the venezuelan crisis some of these writers notably influenced by friedrich hayek s the road to serfdom equate venezuelan socialism and state intervention in the economy with authoritarianism william poole 2017 22 of the cato institute an academic closely tied to private and state financial institutions wrote in specific reference to venezuela that despite hayek s analysis and warnings socialism is indeed alive today in the less developed world especially in south america this argument is woven into the analysis of venezuela s humanitarian crisis that posits extreme political repression as one of its facets and views the breakdown of democracy and the nation s economic debacle as intricately related in accordance with this line of thinking specific aspects of the government s economic policy including price controls the ceiling placed on the rate of profit and measures that allegedly intimidate the private sector are labelled authoritarian corrales 2016 81 82 political polarisation and explanations for the crisis the venezuelan solidarity and labour movements venezuelan politics is highly polarised at the national level pro chavista leaders point to the implementation of international sanctions and though to a lesser extent low oil prices as responsible for the current crisis pro opposition writers and political figures claim that the crisis is due either to the socialist model that is being followed or erroneous policies or incompetent leadership and in some cases a combination of the latter two public opinion surveys such as those of the pro opposition datanalisis indicate a lesser degree of polarisation among the majority of venezuelans who condemn the sanctions strongly criticise government policies and leadership and have a negative view of the opposition woody 2017 venepress 2018 in addition venezuela was characterised during the chavista years by sharp social polarisation the opposition s social base of support was the middle and upper middle classes while the chavistas relied on significant backing from the popular sectors this dichotomy was put in evidence during the confrontational anti maduro protests that broke out in 2014 2017 and 2019 as well as during the chÃ¡vez years in each case the protests were concentrated in the more affluent municipalities and communities but for the most part failed to spread to the popular neighbourhoods in contrast the chavistas in the case of caracas usually marched from the city s low income western half to the downtown area from the very outset of chÃ¡vez s government the venezuelan labour movement was highly polarised between pro and anti chavista trade unionists the anti chavista confederaciÃ³n de trabajadores de venezuela ctv led by traditional labour leaders played a major role in the attempt to oust chÃ¡vez in april 2002 and the abortive general strike in 2002 2003 resulting in the loss of most of its following the ctv aware that its alliance with fedecamaras had cut into its worker following has attributed the crisis to maduro s policies in general without either condemning or supporting measures considered hostile to business interests el nacional 2019 labour leaders of the two split offs from the chavista workers movement the pro trotskyist corriente clasista unitaria revolucionaria y autÃ³noma c cura and the uniÃ³n nacional de trabajadores unete are now in the opposition camp and blame reactionary government policies many favouring the business sector for the crisis chirino 2018 critical sectors of the chavista labour movement supported maduro s re election in 2018 and recognise his government s legitimacy but put forth their own narrative regarding the nation s economic crisis and its causes by far the most visible and active component in this category is the peasant movement grouped in several organisations that participated in the admirable campaign in mid 2018 a 400 kilometre march to present a petition to president maduro in person the leaders of the march recognised the impact of international sanctions on the venezuelan economy but also blamed the crisis on recent government agrarian policy and state bureaucrats tied to latifundistas and domestic and foreign agribusiness interests spokespeople for the group pointed out that peasant production accounted for 70 per cent of the nation s agricultural output and thus should be prioritised as part of the strategy to overcome the crisis correo del orinoco 2018 the issue of the causes of the venezuelan crisis its complexity and the need to contextualise important events and to distinguish between what is known as certain and what cannot be easily confirmed is also at the heart of a dilemma facing the international solidarity movement opposed to sanctions the movement has had to choose between two different strategies each with its own narrative regarding the crisis the first centres its arguments on the illegality of sanctions not authorised by the un and the fact that historically they have never produced desired results and have always aggravated the suffering of the general population this position condemns the sanctions without examining other possible causes for the crisis the approach has the advantage of avoiding knotty issues related to internal politics and of being able to present simple concise arguments the second approach questions the validity of the charges against the maduro government used to justify the imposition of sanctions and military intervention these solidarity activists counter the anti maduro narrative that attributes the venezuelan crisis to socialist policies or the incompetence of policy makers arguments that are often decontextualised felicien schiavoni and romero 2018 17 the second approach is a harder sell than the first given the complexity of the problem of decontextualisation and other issues discussed in this article the approach however has the advantage of winning over those who consider that international sanctions and other forms of foreign intervention may be justified in certain circumstances in short the analysis of root causes of the venezuelan crisis put forward by scholars journalists political commentators and activists has a major impact on political strategies both within the nation and at the international level concluding remarks the recognition of the importance of all four of the above mentioned factors in explaining venezuela s current crisis goes a long way toward countering the narratives of various political actors most importantly the narrative that serves to justify attempts at regime change places the blame solely on government incompetence and badly conceived policies while discarding the relevance of international sanctions and oil prices the logic of this line of thinking is as follows since the major international sanctions and the downturn in oil prices followed the outbreak of the crisis they cannot be blamed for having created it the maduro government is solely responsible for the nation s pressing economic problems and its ouster is thus a sine qua non for overcoming them the argument however focuses exclusively on the sanctions implemented by trump and ignores washington s support for venezuela s disloyal opposition dating back to the early years of chÃ¡vez s rule at the same time recognition of leadership shortcomings as an important contributing factor undermines the pro chavista narrative which emphasises one factor over all others namely the damage caused by international sanctions maduro and other chavista leaders acknowledge that mistakes have been made although they fail to specify what they were the gravity of the failure to act decisively in such cases as the twenty million dollar corruption scandal and the exchange control system fiasco suggests leadership deficiency the problem however also needs to be contextualised the intensity of existing political tensions diminishes the likelihood that the chavistas will question the government s leadership capacity aspects of the nation s political environment the existence of a disloyal opposition and the actions and military threats from abroad mitigate against the possibility that government supporters initiate a process of introspection and self criticism and that rival chavista leaders who share the movement s goals emerge from within chavismo published in global labour

golden sibanda senior business reporter the government s short term economic blueprint the transitional stabilisation programme tsp is resolving structural or fiscal deformities contributing to the current instability of the economy economic analysts have said the short term economic blue print scheduled to run for two years until 2020 was introduced in october last year and is already bearing fruit in the form of successive budget surpluses since november which saw a 443 million first quarter 2019 excess fiscal or structural balance refers to the matching of ongoing expenditures with ongoing revenues if revenues equal or exceed expenditures structural balance surplus is achieved if expenditures exceed revenues structural imbalance deficit occurs in 2017 the government spent beyond its 2017 revenues by a whopping us 2 52 billion which resulted in huge debt and has to be carried by the taxpayer resulting in excessive money supply blamed for current inflationary pressures zimbabwe has faced deep structural imbalances says equities and economic research firm inter horizon ih securities since the southern african country dollarised in 2009 to break the nearly decade long bubble of hyper inflation fiscal deficits due to excessive public expenditure worsened between 2016 and 2018 and government issued treasury bills funded through local currency nominally equal to the us dollar to finance its obligations while the external debt spiked the fragile equilibrium was maintained through exchange controls and other restrictions on access to foreign exchange providing a deep distortion for economic activity in a bid to halt the macro economic imbalances by halting the issuance of the quasi currency instruments to finance the deficit the new administration led by president mnangagwa after the 37 year long mugabe era produced a comprehensive structural reform programme dubbed transitional stabilisation programme tsp to address structural rigidities ih securities said only last month the international monetary fund imf approved a staff monitored programme smp for zimbabwe covering the period may 2019 to march 2020 being a reform framework to support the new government s ongoing economic reform agenda enunciated in the tsp united states ambassador to zimbabwe brian nichols said recently the international monetary fund s staff monitoring programme and the transitional stabilisation programme were the right way forward to get zimbabwe back on its feet he noted that zimbabwe had tremendous potential and wonderful human capital but would not fix the two decades of failed policies overnight further pointing out that the smp and tsp provided the foundation to resolving the issues the smp will be monitored on a quarterly basis and it is intended to assist the authorities in building a track record of implementation of a coherent set of economic and social policies to facilitate a return to macroeconomic stability and assist in reengagement with the international community including global lenders economic policies under the smp target restoration of macroeconomic and financial sector stability through implementing a large fiscal adjustment the elimination of central bank financing of the fiscal deficit and adoption of reforms to allow the effective functioning of market based foreign exchange and debt markets other structural reforms include steps to reform and privatise state owned entities enhance governance including in procurement and revenue administration and to improve the business environment the imf will support government s efforts in all policy areas covered by the smp through tailored technical assistance the reforms will lay the foundation for global re engagement including of creditors to reopen access to cheaper offshore financing zimbabwe remains in debt distress with external arrears of us 7 4 billion and domestic debt of 9 5 billion as of end 2018 which prevent new financing from the ifis and limit access to external financing from non traditional official and commercial creditors zimbabwe s debt with the afreximbank african development bank and paris club members stands at us 1 25 billion us 2 5 billion and us 2 8 billion respectively total consolidated public debt as at end 2017 net of rbz loans was 55 percent of gdp there was however a sharp increase in inflation at 75 86 percent as of april the inflation together with scrapping of the 1 1 exchange rate policy have inflated a sizable portion of the real value of domestic public debt which is projected to decline to 11 percent of gdp at end 2019
no one knows if we are facing into another recession but but if you haven t looked at the positioning of your own financial products now is probably a good time to do so suggests economist eddie hobbs investors in sovereign credit are worried that a recession is looming over the horizon this is why the bond market throughout the world is flashing red long term rates fell below short term inverting the normal upward slope of the bond curve you ll understand why this is important when you consider that the last two times inversions happened on this scale was just before the dot com burst and the global financial crisis the most damaging doctrine carried forward from the 20th century may yet prove to be that of british economist john maynard keynes that is how i ended the pivot a book i wrote for jack jill in october 2017 why it matters is because everything from the value of your property to the stability of your cash deposits rests on keynes being right central banks and governments throughout the world are betting on it too dusting down keynes ten years ago in the teeth of the gfc global financial crisis central banks crushed interest rates flooded banks with cheap money and bought securities at prices no one else would with trillions they magicked up the plan was that this would be temporary that governments would structurally reform countries in the window created they didn t central banks short term fix has become open ended risk asset prices property shares corporate credit private equity it is all propped up and extended by so called quantitative easing and money printing operations ten years after it kicked off the danger zone has moved from housing debt to national debt you can prime a business or an economy with good debt that is certain but when it becomes excessive it retards growth you cannot print sustainable growth and when you interfere with the positive destruction and replacement cycle which is the hidden hand of capitalism instead you create monsters these are zombies companies and national economies that exist purely on the basis of cheap open ended money central banks and their political masters have us in a trap interest rates cannot be cut again to the same scale the scope simply isn t there neither can rates rise without choking large parts of economies addicted to cheap money that is clear in the usa the federal reserve ran off the pitch ditching its rate rises this year trump who has linked his presidency to the barometer of the us stock market and the wealth effect of rising portfolio values won t like to read morgan stanley s rolling warnings it detects a notable slowdown in us services and manufacturing activity prompting a cut to forecasts for this quarter from 1 to 0 6 think of the economies as sponges that can take on too much water too much debt leading to sluggish performance little sign of wage growth for workers and a declining impact from stimulus debt has grown faster than economies by half again since the gfc central banks terrified of deflation are now looking at plumbing the depths of untested alchemy negative interest rates where you pay to hold money in banks and helicopter money given directly to you to spend rather than to banks as cheap debt it hasn t helped that trump is adopting economic nationalism unseen since before bretton woods in 1944 which follows the doctrine that to create economic growth at home you must first coerce it from abroad the interconnectivity of the modern global economy which makes trade wars a self inflicted wound hasn t stopped trump who has threatened south korea australia europe and mexico he is in a trade war with china and he has pulled the usa out of climate action why this matters to us in europe is because unlike the usa we have much lower growth and a base rate already on the floor which means we are more vulnerable to shocks at a time of elevated national debt the eurozone banking system continues to carry a heavy burden of non performing loans and is struggling to improve margins the centrepiece of concern is deutsche bank whose share price continues to fall it peaked may 2007 at 122 and hit a low over 17 after lehmann bros collapse and is now hovering at all time lows close to 6 per share deutsche bank a gsib globally systemically important bank matters because of its transmission channels throughout the global financial system and its colossal derivative book estimated at net 40 trillion these are financial instruments that can go notoriously illiquid at times of crisis which is why the imf describes deutsche bank as the world s most dangerous bank pointing out that it makes the highest net contribution to global systemic risk behind each bank connected to deutsche bank is a further web to medium sized and smaller banks to the wiring of the global financial system itself what is less well known is the fsb financial stability board established by the g20 in 2009 and first chaired by mario draghi its work in 2011 key attributes of effective resolution regimes for financial institutions better known as the bail in report was adopted by the eu commission six years ago this month this allows for deposits to be decapitated when banks become insolvent a resolution imposed on cypriots in 2012 bank default risk still matters and explains why irelands largest deposit over 14bn is held by bny mellon in the usa it is why all of us need to look closely at deposit risks so is a recession really coming as ever no one knows until the next few quarters are revealed us fed rate cuts may buy more time but one thing is clear on this trajectory extreme monetary policies could lead to japanese type conditions long term tepid growth very high national debt and at continued risk to deflation but until time unfolds no one can tell if the next recession will be a cyclical one short and shallow or a structural one deep and long but if you haven t looked at the positioning of your own financial products now is probably a good time to do so eddie hobbs is a financial advisor and writer
monrovia when an international monetary fund imf team visited monrovia from february 25 march 8 to conduct discussions for the 2019 article iv consultation with liberia it made several recommendations and raised red flags about the rapidly dire and prevailing economic situation under the george manneh weah led government three months after the team s report lowered liberia s economic growth forecast for 2019 to 0 4 from 4 7 and declared that the government s wage bill was just too high it has returned with another report released tuesday with similar numbers reporting that the near and medium term outlook under the baseline scenario remains challenging growth is projected to slow further to about 0 4 percent in 2019 and remain below 2 percent into the medium term in the baseline scenario the authorities face the possibility of a forced abrupt adjustment when domestic and external financing options are exhausted an alternative reform scenario is therefore presented as a more viable alternative in which growth weakens somewhat in the near term due to proactive fiscal and monetary tightening but picks up significantly over the medium term to exceed 5 percent by 2024 garnering support key in its latest report the imf executive directors noted that liberia continues to face major economic challenges but welcomed the authorities efforts to bolster macroeconomic stability directors emphasized that steadfast and well sequenced policies and structural reforms are essential to enhance macroeconomic stability and promote higher sustainable and inclusive growth they welcomed the authorities pro poor agenda for prosperity and development papd and agreed that garnering support from the international community will be important directors emphasized that significant fiscal adjustment is needed going forward they underscored that efforts should focus on mobilizing domestic revenue and rationalizing spending especially the wage bill while securing needed space for social and capital spending directors encouraged the authorities to formulate realistic budgets and to implement a sound borrowing plan that ensures debt sustainability while advocating caution in engaging in non concessional borrowing they also called for further progress in public financial management reforms to improve the quality of spending in a resource constrained environment the imf agreed that the central bank of liberia cbl should tighten monetary policy with the objective of reducing inflation to single digits by 2021 directors emphasized that further issuance of cbl bills should be suspended until the cost of the operation is included in the government budget and the fiscal financing gap is closed without cbl financing and noted that while the financial soundness indicators show that the banking sector appears adequately capitalized the cbl should enhance its supervisory efforts the imf highlighted the need to prioritize strengthening the cbl s supervisory regulatory and resolution frameworks in light of the elevated level of nonperforming loans focusing on measures that improve loan underwriting standards directors highlighted the need to improve the external position by tightening monetary and fiscal policies allowing for greater exchange rate flexibility and raising competitiveness through improvements in the business environment they welcomed that the authorities pro poor agenda focuses on physical and human capital particularly improving service delivery in health and education over the past couple of days frontpageafrica has learned that the team of imf staffers have been holding discussions with finance and economic planning minister samuel d tweah and senior administration officials including president weah in a bid to see what has been done and to prepare the country for enrollment into the imf strait jacket program welcoming the imf after early snub addressing the nation last month president weah announced that his administration would soon be embracing the imf soon we will welcome a team from the international monetary fund coming to create an imf program tailored for liberia such a program will help us to take the needed steps to stabilize our economy restore confidence in our currency and offer technical assistance to continue social services the president said his remarks followed an urging from ambassador christine elder the united states ambassador accredited to liberia told the president and his government to remain open to recommendations of the international monetary fund imf in order to pave the way for economic productivity and prosperity for liberia speaking at a recent ceremony marking the 243rd anniversary of the independence of the united states of america recently the us envoy while applauding president weah for opening discussions with the international monetary body regarding measures that could restore confidence in the economy and set the stage for growth ahead said heeding the recommendations to liberia is key i hope that you the liberian government and the liberian people remain open to what the imf recommends so that liberia can lay the groundwork for future economic productivity and prosperity an imf program requires greater discipline across government budgets and president weah in his speech last month suggested that his administration is prepared to begin tightening the screws we will be introducing salary caps for government workers and asking our legislators to share the burden as well we will review performance and revenues from our state owned enterprises ensuring that leakages or inefficiencies do not undercut the ability of government to support its people we have seen other african countries including ghana rwanda and senegal benefit from imf programs and i believe liberia can do so as well rallying call to arms addressing the nation tuesday the president realizing the challenges at hand for his administration issued a call to arms urging all liberians to come to the table and find answers to resuscitating the economy said the president it will take the collective effort of all liberians to achieve the desired objective of reviving the economy and placing our country on a path of sustainable development and transformation we will have to come together to devise and support new measures which are necessary to address the structural defects and imbalances in our economy the president reiterated what he has previously stated in speeches that he inherited a broke country last year when i assumed the presidency i informed you that we had inherited a broken economy and pledged to you that i would exert every effort to fix the economy and improve the lives and livelihood of our people while our efforts to fix the economy are sustained and ongoing we still face challenging times the president whose administration has been unreceptive to critics and suggestions about improving the economy now says all liberians have a vested interest in the peace and economic development of the country my government recognizes that the alternative views of all citizens are equally vital in finding a way forward it is because of this fact that i now take the opportunity to again invite the leaders of political parties civil society groups elders religious leaders our traditional leaders student leaders and the business community to a round table discussion to afford them the opportunity to present their alternative views or their suggestions on the economy govt eyeing external credit facility during the april 2019 spring meetings in washington minister tweah reportedly delivered a special message of president weah to management authorities of the fund enumerating the government s intent for an imf supported arrangement in response to president s invitation the imf executive board approved a mission to hold discussions with the liberian authorities in this regard the imf team is in country to work along with fiscal and monetary authorities of government to review the current state of the economy and recommend appropriate policy advice which will lead to economic growth and transformation through implementation of the country s national development agenda the papd aides to the president told frontpageafrica tuesday the administration has set the basis for a new economic thrust which has been endorsed and cleared by the imf board executive directors of the imf were in full support of the liberian government during board discussions to approve the recent article iv consultation report on liberia the source speaking on condition of anonymity said tuesday the source said the administration within the next two weeks which will be underpinned by rigid engagements the administration will seek to enter an external credit facility ecf arrangement which provides financial assistance to countries with protracted balance of payments problems in a more flexible form to low income countries the ecf was created under the poverty reduction and growth trust prgt as part of a broader reform to make the fund s financial support more flexible and better tailored to the diverse needs of low income countries lics including in times of crisis the ecf is the fund s main tool for providing medium term support to lics the ecf supports countries economic programs aimed at moving toward a stable and sustainable macroeconomic position consistent with strong and durable poverty reduction and growth and the ecf may also help catalyze additional foreign aid budget reportedly sliced to us 515m the program is available to countries that face a protracted balance of payments problem i e when the resolution of the underlying macroeconomic imbalances would be expected to extend over the medium or longer term assistance under an ecf arrangement is provided for an initial duration from three to up to four years with an overall maximum duration of five years following the expiration cancellation or termination of an ecf arrangement additional ecf arrangements may be approved this is not liberia s first program the administration of former president ellen johnson sirleaf also benefited from the program which ended in nov 2017 it was under sirleaf s watch that issues and challenges of printing money and weak internal controls was first unearthed sources closed to the weah presidency say the administration is aiming to correct some of the defects as outlined by president weah in his speech last month from all indications the liberian government is reportedly set to pass a budget of us 515m less than earlier projection of us 570m with no room for borrowing which is something the imf mission is desirous to see as part of the government s commitment to macroeconomic reform however and in spite of this fiscal rigidity it is not certain as to whether the legislators will approve of the us 55m adjustment which brings credibility to the budget process the president s wage bill reform program which is also aligned with the mission s recommendation may also face resistance from the other two branches of government mainly the legislators liberia might likely fail the imf fiscal test if any of the other two branches refuses to allow wage cuts which could lead bigger economic loss for the country in the short run economists say focusing on fiscal discipline may not be the only macroeconomic option for reviving an economy which is suffering from the shocks of the fall in the prices of global commodities vulnerability and exposure to ebola virus disease the departure of unmil inflation and a depreciation of the country s currency among others the government needs to balance this measure with improvement in the overall circular flow of the economy through investment and growth as well as the provision of a stimulus package to jump start the economy in the short run while other policy measures are being sequenced and implemented major cuts underway in line with the imf s suggestions the weah administration says it has instituted cuts within the executive branch and is pledging that the new budget will deliver wage reform which has not been achieved in the last 10 years liberia s development partners are looking to see cuts on the legislative side as well raising concerns as to whether lawmakers will go along with the plan one official described as crucial to liberia s economic revival on monetary front the government has agreed to stop borrowing from the central bank as recommended by the imf and announced by the president in his speech last month to date frontpageafrica has learned the weah led government has formally borrowed us 8 million from the cbl with the government reportedly rolling over a us 20 million borrowing done under former president sirleaf when it came to office the no borrowing constraint economists say will now make it difficult given the pressing fiscal needs of the government in the end some limited borrowing will be allowed by the program on a strictly restrictive basis the bottom line the government will have to be very disciplined to fall in line with the imf s suggestions and directives for the weah led government the imf program is not just about fiscal discipline but about economic and investment growth as the government is pledging to place high priority on economic stimulus as part of the program a major part of stimulus surrounds domestic arrears to vendors and commercial banks economists say the inability for the government to pay banks and vendors has stifled the economy thus the government views stimulus as a key imf program a necessity unclogging the circular flow for increase service delivery through a multiplier effect will require the servicing of domestic arrears to vendors and commercial banks government delay or inability to service their indebtedness to vendors and commercial banks is stifling private sector development as a stop gap measure the government through the mfdp has reportedly already issued a us 65m bond to commercial banks for infrastructure loans which were borrowed under the former administration once discounted the bonds will inject some liquidity to the banking sector for onward lending to other productive sectors fpa has learned that an imf delegation in town this week is going over the fine prints of the new initiatives in hopes that both government and the imf are on the same page governance reforms and fighting corruption are going to be a key part of any program and development partners say they will give liberia more support if they achieve a program during the discussions with the imf in the coming weeks diplomatic observers say the government must demonstrate political will by committing itself to the many reform measures which would open the doors for more support to the country s reform process no one has ever said that the path to economic prosperity was easy but with commitment to an imf supported program the country could be on the right track for a great leap forward one diplomat told fpa tuesday for the immediate future economists say the exact structure of the program will depend on a lot of data issues and how the weah led government commits to live within the limits imposed by the program while some of liberia s neighbors and countries across africa have found the programs too restrictive the current situation in liberia has left the administration with no option but to make the imf program a necessity

the effects of app reinvestments on euro area bond markets closing remarks by benoÃ®t cÅurÃ© member of the executive board of the ecb at the ecb s bond market contact group meeting 12 june 2019 in december 2018 the governing council decided to halt net purchases under its asset purchase programme app and to continue reinvesting in full the principal payments from maturing securities for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ecb interest rates and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation in my short remarks this evening i will take stock of euro area bond market developments since the start of the year without elaborating on the future course of monetary policy which the governing council discussed at its meeting last week in vilnius i will show that the app has continued to provide substantial monetary accommodation also after the transition from net purchases to reinvestments the stock effect of our asset purchases alongside clear forward guidance by the governing council on its intentions regarding reinvestments and policy rates has helped to preserve very accommodative financial conditions and our decision to distribute redemptions under the public sector purchase programme pspp over the year and to maintain our presence in primary markets under some of the private asset purchase programmes has supported the transition with minimal impact on market functioning euro area bond markets in 2019 since the start of the year government bond yields in the euro area have fallen noticeably in many euro area countries they currently stand at or close to historical lows and cross border dispersion of financial conditions across countries has declined considerably with few exceptions you can see this on the left hand side of my first slide reduced cross country dispersion in financial conditions slide 1 consider portugal and greece which you can see on the right hand side since the start of the year ten year government bond yields have fallen by around 100 basis points in portugal and 160 basis points in greece these declines mark a significant easing in financial conditions in an environment of downside risks to growth and imply that the ecb s accommodative monetary policy stance is now being felt more forcefully across larger parts of the euro area it is tempting to argue that the decline in yields is proof enough that the end of net asset purchases did not trigger an unwarranted tightening in financial conditions but this would be far too simple of course financial asset prices as you know reflect the effects of a large number of forces at any given point in time pulling yields in different and often opposing directions to make some sense of changes in asset prices ecb staff use an array of analytical tools including exploiting cross asset price restrictions to identify the possible sources of economic shocks an unexpected tightening in monetary policy for example is assumed to lead to higher yields lower stock prices and an appreciation of the exchange rate just like textbook economics would teach you can see the outcome of such an exercise for the ten year euro area overnight index swap ois on my second slide clearly according to this model a number of factors including global and euro area monetary policies have contributed to the downward pressure on yields since the start of the year in other words there are no signs that the effects of our asset purchases started to evaporate the moment we stopped expanding our balance sheet end of net purchases has not put upward pressure on yields slide 2 indeed i would argue that the effects of asset purchases are highly persistent and that they have affected recent pricing dynamics in two important ways through a yield level channel and through a yield sensitivity channel the persistence of stock effects the first channel relates to the growing evidence that central banks through their stocks of acquired assets and by reinvesting maturing principals can persistently lower the yield level around which investors evaluate changes to the economic outlook i have laid out the mechanics behind the persistent impact of asset purchases in previous speeches in short as the central bank reduces the bond free float the share of outstanding government bonds held by private price sensitive investors it also reduces the compensation or term premia that investors as a whole demand for holding long term bonds a crude yet simple way to see this is to look at the correlation between a measure of the bond free float and the spread between ten year german bund yields and corresponding ois rates you can see this on my next slide stock effects have been built up gradually slide 3 the intuition is that both being risk free assets changes in the economic outlook or monetary policy expectations would shift bund and ois yields to a similar degree a sudden spike in risk aversion such as during the sovereign debt crisis or towards the end of last year can cause the spread to widen but such episodes are typically short lived and reverse as investors reduce their demand for safe assets in other words we would expect the bund ois spread to be fairly constant on average but the fact that the spread has been gradually and persistently widening over time suggests that it is not being driven by common factors but rather by factors specific to the bund market since about the start of 2015 the most plausible candidate for this kind of secular effect is supply demand effects induced by a shrinking bond free float you can see that according to new ecb staff estimates only a little more than a third of outstanding general government bonds of the four largest euro area countries are currently in the hands of private price sensitive investors before the app was launched more than half of these bonds were held by these investors and by rolling over our bond portfolio we keep removing duration risk from the market you can see this on my next slide in germany for example pspp reinvestments in central government bonds this year and next are expected to still absorb nearly 30 of gross issuance in some countries like france and italy reinvestments as a share of total gross issuance are expected to rise in 2020 reinvestments will continue to absorb a significant share of issuance slide 4 the implication of this is that the stock effect of our purchases will continue to be significant as you can see on my next slide two years from now the stock of acquired assets is still estimated to compress the ten year term premium in the four largest euro area government bond markets by some 70 basis points the main reason why the effect gradually becomes smaller in the coming years is due to the mechanical ageing of the portfolio asset purchases have highly persistent effects on yields slide 5 it is also easy to see now why the concerns that many have voiced regarding the potential impact of our intention to reduce deviations from the ecb s capital key have not materialised put simply these adjustments in our purchases are too small to have a significant effect on yields on my next slide you can see the progress we have made so far this year in reducing the overall sum of absolute deviations from the capital key across all euro area countries it is interesting to see that the introduction of the new capital key in itself contributed to a one off reduction in overall deviations this is the jump in the series at the start of the year we expect to reverse the deviations further in the coming months and years as you can see by the dotted projection line reduction of deviations from capital key had no discernible impact on yields slide 6 stock effects yield sensitivity and market functioning the second channel through which the stock of our assets and continued reinvestments are likely to have affected recent pricing outcomes is through their impact on the sensitivity of yields to macroeconomic shocks you can see this on my next slide which shows the rolling coefficient of the impact of macroeconomic news on ten year german bund yields stock effects may have helped reduce sensitivity of yields slide 7 the chart shows that the average sensitivity of yields to macroeconomic news fell by 20 in the year following the launch of the app it has fallen by half since the governing council increased the monthly pace of purchases from 60 billion to 80 billion in april 2016 that is when stock effects started to become more powerful and it has not visibly increased after the end of net purchases such reduced sensitivity is remarkable considering the economic and political environment we have been navigating these past three years of course a variety of factors might be at play here for example forward guidance may have contributed to reducing the sensitivity of yields to macro news or perceptions of reduced policy space in particular for conventional policy instruments may have led investors to expect less forceful changes in yields for any given macroeconomic impulse this is indeed what we have been seeing for negative news shocks as you can see on the left hand side of my next slide there has been a relatively clear structural break in the sensitivity of ten year yields to negative news since around the time we lowered the rate on our deposit facility to zero in mid 2012 in the vicinity of the effective lower bound a central bank has less means to react to adverse shocks by reducing rates further sensitivity lower for both positive and negative macro news slide 8 however on the right hand side you can see that we have also observed a striking decline in the trend sensitivity of long term rates to positive news today it is about half of what it was in the earlier part of this decade policy space on the way up certainly has far fewer if any constraints all this suggests that by reducing the bond free float stock effects may have helped temper the impact of demand shocks and foreign spillovers on yields this is not to say that markets have lost their price discovery function just consider the large swings in yields we have seen over the past two years and the changing constellation of intra euro area spreads the app has not suppressed market discipline but what stock effects do is shield financial conditions from unwanted tightening forces and thereby help preserve the financial conditions that are needed to ensure a sustained convergence path of inflation towards levels that are below but close to 2 and where the large volume of bonds extracted from the market may have had adverse consequences on market functioning we took appropriate action to mitigate them as you well know growing scarcity of some securities led to a persistent and measurable rise in the share of bonds trading special in the repo market you can see this on my next slide reduced cash collateral usage suggests markets functioning well slide 9 the initial eurosystem restriction that bonds could only be lent against other securities was too penalising and is likely to have contributed to the growing specialness premium the governing council s decision in december 2016 to also open the facility for lending against cash was an important step towards alleviating market pressure as you can see on the right hand side lending against cash collateral was used widely during our net purchase phase and helped stabilise and later reduce the share of bonds trading special the fact that lending against cash has practically evaporated in recent months suggests that both the repo and cash markets are now operating smoothly despite the reduced bond free float continued smooth implementation of the app during the reinvestment phase corroborates the view of efficient market functioning the decision to distribute redemptions where and when needed over the year has been well understood by market participants and allows eurosystem central banks to have a continued presence in all euro area sovereign bond markets private purchase programmes and reinvestments before concluding let me briefly discuss the private purchase programmes which have arguably been the strongest cause for concern for market participants regarding the impact of the end of net purchases the increase in corporate bond spreads during the course of last year for example was widely taken as a sign that investors were anticipating the nearing end of our purchases yet as you can see on the left hand side of my next slide spreads have fallen measurably again since the start of the year back to levels below those prevailing before the start of our corporate sector purchase programme cspp in march 2016 credit spreads and premia have tightened since the start of the year slide 10 we have observed a similar dynamic for the net issuance premium firms have to pay when tapping the market you can see this on the right hand side the premium rose strongly towards the end of the year but fully reversed its rise during the course of this year much like in the covered bond market as you can see on my next slide end of net purchases left no void in primary markets slide 11 both charts together make clear that the drop in central bank allocations in primary markets since the start of the year has not left a void banks in particular have taken up a larger share of supply in the primary market keeping premia low and relatively stable so the tightening in financial conditions in credit markets in the last quarter of 2018 was in all likelihood unrelated to the eurosystem ending net purchases it was rather the result of a sudden global flight to safety that put downward pressure on risky asset prices similar to what we have been experiencing in recent weeks but looking through the ups and downs current market based financing conditions for firms have returned to levels that are highly conducive to investment and job creation thereby complementing our commitment to preserve favourable bank lending conditions through the launch of the new series of quarterly targeted longer term refinancing operations tltro iii under which banks can borrow at highly favourable rates conditional on their lending performance on my last slide you can see that this two pronged approach has been successful the start of the cspp and the subsequent drop in spreads triggered a healthy rebalancing of external funding by some mainly cspp eligible firms and has thereby freed up bank balance sheet capacity to lend to cspp ineligible firms policy package successful in balancing external funding sources slide 12 the end of net purchases has not jeopardised this virtuous circle today thanks to our broad package of policy measures a very large majority of euro area firms can freely decide on their optimal funding mix with few supply constraints conclusion taken together there is convincing evidence that supports the view that the app has remained a considerable source of financial easing also after the end of net purchases it continues to provide important accommodation in an environment of increased downside risks to growth and thereby supports the sustained convergence of inflation to levels closer to 2 since our decision to halt net purchases further employment gains increasing wages and the underlying strength of domestic demand continue to confirm the governing council s central outlook of gradually rising inflation at the same time global headwinds have undisputedly accelerated and uncertainty has increased mainly related to the rising threat of protectionism in this environment the governing council last week extended its forward guidance on rates and now expects them to remain at their present levels at least through the first half of 2020 and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below but close to 2 over the medium term we have also announced the technical parameters governing tltro iii the governing council is determined to act in case of adverse contingencies and stands ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation continues to move towards the governing council s inflation aim in a sustained manner thank you

menafn khaleej times european central bank policymakers are open to cutting the ecb s policy rate again if economic growth weakens in the remainder of the year and a strong euro hurts a bloc already bearing the brunt of a global trade war two sources said the ecb had said that its interest rates would stay at their present levels until mid 2020 but president mario draghi added rate setters had started a discussion about a possible cut or fresh bond purchases to stimulate inflation the apparently mixed message failed to convince some investors who saw it as too tenuous a commitment to more stimulus this sent the euro rallying to a 2 1 2 month high of 1 1347 against the us dollar but two sources familiar to the ecb s policy discussions said a rate cut was firmly in play if the bloc s economy was to stagnate again after expanding by 0 4 per cent in the first quarter of the year if inflation and growth slow then a rate cut is warranted said one of the sources who requested anonymity because the ecb s deliberations are confidential a spokesman declined to comment the ecb s deposit rate is already 40 basis points below zero and the bloc s top rated governments such as germany s can borrow at negative rates for up to a decade in this context countering the euro s strength rather than lowering already rock bottom borrowing costs would be the main reason for a further cut to that deposit rate one of the sources said i ll give you five reasons for a rate cut the source said before repeating exchange rate five times the ecb doesn t formally target an exchange rate but draghi noted the euro s appreciation in his news conference on thursday and has long highlighted the currency as a crucial determinant of financing conditions the source said a euro at 1 15 would still be tolerable for some but 1 20 would be a critical level to watch the single currency has risen by 2 per cent against the dollar in just over a week as the federal reserve signalled its willingness to cut its interest rates if needed this was seen by some analysts as a sign the us central bank was bowing to pressure from the white house to keep the dollar weak and strengthen the administration s hand in its trade negotiations the argument for more quantitative easing qe from the ecb was less clear to some policymakers however the sources said one of the sources said more qe could help soothe stock markets if these were spooked by an escalation in the trade war although there would be a risk for the ecb in appearing to kowtow to equity investors the other said the main benefit of qe was compressing the difference between short and long term borrowing costs making access to finance easier for companies and households but this so called term premium was already low

lower tax rates with more capital investment are crucial to increasing productivity wages and living standards and boosting the loonie canadians standard of living isn t growing as quickly as per capita gross domestic product gdp the reason our dollar has been declining against the currency of our biggest trading partner the united states while some of that is because the u s dollar has risen against most currencies around the world a lot of it is because of things we ve done to ourselves according to the economist canada s gdp per capita is about us 47 640 74 5 per cent of that of our american cousins us 64 070 the last time the loonie traded at par with the u s dollar was feb 8 2013 it s tempting to blame the subsequent decline on the price of oil canada s major export commodity however while the price of oil as noted by the u s benchmark west texas intermediate hit 108 64 per barrel on sept 3 2013 it was only about 97 in february and the big drop in the price didn t start until later in june 2014 since then it s been a rocky slide for the loonie if oil isn t the only reason for the loonie s swoon then some other factors must be at play currency rates are set by supply and demand there are a number of constituents of demand exports of our products and services including tourism and other foreign visitors short term interest in our securities including money market and other interest rate sensitive securities and longer term interest in investing in our stocks bonds real estate mortgages loans businesses and other assets our current account including net exports and investment income has been negative since 2014 the capital account longer term flows and the exchange rate have to balance this we can increase demand for exports by developing new and attractive products and services lowering prices of existing ones or producing more and selling more into more markets unfortunately canada has not been good at this there are few entirely new products produced meanwhile oil sands bitumen and natural gas have been crowded out by shale production in the u s when the loonie was last at par we were selling all the oil and bitumen we could produce to the u s and at much higher prices those higher prices may never come back but the volumes sold could increase if we had pipeline capacity to the south east and west the loonie is also weak because there s little interest in investing in this country the biggest companies are in energy mining and banking with better alternatives in other countries those canadian sectors aren t attractive canadian mining companies have to compete for money with others around the world where getting projects approved permitted and developed to the commercial stage is faster and cheaper if not always as safe canadian investors are voting with their dollars according to global affairs canada from 2013 to 2017 foreign investment in canada grew by about 135 billion an average of about 27 billion per year whereas investment abroad by canada based investors grew by a whopping 343 billion or about 69 billion per year for 2018 the trend continued as foreign investment flowed in at 51 3 billion and canadian investment moved outward at 65 4 billion if capital accounts are negative and short term accounts are negative with lower interest rates here than in the united states and a negligible or often negative trade balance there will continue to be downward pressure on the loonie investors have to believe that rates of return if not robust now will become so in the near future and have a high probability of being sustainably high while canada s population growth is good at over one per cent per year its productivity growth is meagre at less than one per cent per person per annum from this increased profits and improved wages and living standards are nearly impossible in the mix add regulations that increase costs and lengthen times to start or expand businesses and projects increasing opposition from environmental and indigenous groups and landowners to resource industrial or real estate projects and high corporate taxes in comparison to the u s ultimately then it doesn t look like a canada u s currency parity is imminent but the federal government could improve canada s tax competitiveness with comparatively little harm to the federal deficit it needs to tax corporate income after capital expenditures as the u s does to boost capital spending and productivity it could also cut corporate tax rates by 0 5 per cent a year for the next 10 years the gradual approach quebec has taken the business friendly governments now in power in most of canada s provinces could chime in making the total average rate in the nation even lower lower tax rates with more capital investment are crucial to increasing productivity wages and living standards reducing or eliminating the cost boosting carbon tax would help even more and businesses and consumers should be encouraged to increase energy efficiency and substitute clean cheap lower co2 emitting natural gas nobody has to invest in canada including canadians we need to make it more alluring now and in the future by ian

raghuram rajan has delivered some uncomfortable economic truths in a career spanning the international monetary fund and powerful positions in his native india the question is whether brexit britain is ready to hear them from another foreign bank of england governor the job of stewarding the u k s monetary policy and maintaining its financial stability has rarely been more political and rajan is the only outsider among the top contenders in the running to replace mark carney according to bookmakers and economists who follow the 325 year old institution carney s tenure has been overshadowed by the convulsions over brexit with some hardliners in the governing conservatives accusing the canadian of exaggerating the economic pain and underplaying the benefits of leaving the european union as the party chooses a new leader following the resignation of prime minister theresa may her potential successors have vowed to deliver brexit and the latest deadline is oct 31 rajan has made sympathetic noises toward the u k s dilemma particularly the disillusionment in parts of the country that fueled the brexit vote he told the times newspaper in march though that success depends on the u k reengaging with the world that would start with his appointment according to david blanchflower an economics professor at dartmouth college and a former bank of england policymaker the other top candidates for the job including front runner andrew bailey already work at the bank or financial regulator also read arvind subramanian s gdp bombshell prominent economists divided over maths it s a pretty unimpressive bunch with rajan sitting head and shoulders above the rest of them blanchflower said the problem is why would anybody want to put themselves in the position of having to deal with brexit rajan 56 a professor at the chicago booth school of business declined to comment about his potential candidacy when contacted by bloomberg as did the bank of england the u k treasury which is responsible for hiring the next governor declined to comment on who had applied by last week s deadline chancellor of the exchequer philip hammond has stressed the need to look internationally for the next appointment though it s not clear if he will still be in his job when the decision is made what is clear though is that rajan has the right sort of track record he was chief economist of the imf from 2003 to 2006 and then worked as an adviser to the indian government before becoming governor of the reserve bank of india in 2013 at the elite jackson hole annual economic gathering in 2005 when he was at the imf rajan warned that risks were building up in the global financial system at the time former u s treasury secretary larry summers criticized rajan as a luddite three years later lehman brothers collapsed as rbi governor rajan introduced inflation targeting and led an effort to clean up bad loans in the banking industry he remained for just one three year term running india s central bank after heavy criticism from segments of the government for offering opinions on matters unrelated to monetary policy subramanian swamy an outspoken lawmaker in prime minister narendra modi s ruling party said rajan was mentally not fully indian and kept interest rates too high in 2016 swamy wrote a letter to modi calling for rajan to be either fired or dismissed at the end of his term in his 2017 book i do what i do rajan said he warned the government against demonetization an attempt to withdraw cash from circulation saying the short term economic costs would outweigh the long term benefits he handled some very treacherous shoals very well said anne krueger a former imf first deputy managing director who helped recruit rajan he did not cave under political pressure and on the other hand he did the best he could to advance what he thought was right political attacks have also been a hallmark of carney s time at the bank of england pro brexit lawmaker jacob rees mogg at one point called him a second tier canadian politician who failed to get a job at home as well as an enemy of brexit rajan has indeed hinted the role could be too politically fraught central banking jobs are very polluted he said in an interview with forbes published last week you have to have a very good sense of where the political terrain lies and how far you can go without upsetting the balance in his latest book published this year the third pillar how markets and the state leave the community behind he argues that neglect of parts of society led to a rise in populism and mistrust bank of england chief economist andy haldane who is also in the running to succeed carney has cited the book in his last three public appearances those political antennae will be vital to navigate brexit according to arvind mayaram who was the top bureaucrat in the indian finance ministry while rajan was central bank governor the volatility and uncertainty that comes with it will require a very steady hand said mayaram he can hold his own and speak his mind he would not let go of those core principles which would be necessary for the central bank to steer a course in very turbulent waters

growth is not contingent on a china deal what has changed is lower tax rates massive deregulation opening up the energy sector and various trade reforms kudlow added in a separate interview commerce secretary wilbur ross expressed support for president trump s tariff strategy however he warned that the public should not expect a deal between the u s and china to occur at the upcoming g20 summit ross noted that detailed negotiations of this manner do not occur at summits and the best anyone can expect is a discussion alluding to high level alignment on key areas hopefully laying the groundwork required to secure a deal in the future there is no guarantee any such discussion or alignment will happen at the g20 summit though president trump has threatened to impose additional tariffs on china if president xi does not attend either we will collect more and more tariffs on more and more products or we ll back an arrangement with them ross commented on the ongoing trade war

the running to replace mark carney according to bookmakers and economists who follow the 325 year old institution unlock exclusive access to the story of india s general elections only on the ht app download now carney s tenure has been overshadowed by the convulsions over brexit with some hard liners in the governing conservatives accusing the canadian of exaggerating the economic pain and underplaying the benefits of leaving the european union as the party chooses a new leader following the resignation of prime minister theresa may her potential successors have vowed to deliver brexit and the latest deadline is oct 31 rajan has made sympathetic noises toward the u k s dilemma particularly the disillusionment in parts of the country that fueled the brexit vote he told the times newspaper in march though that success depends on the u k reengaging with the world that would start with his appointment according to david blanchflower an economics professor at dartmouth college and a former bank of england policy maker the other top candidates for the job including front runner andrew bailey already work at the bank or financial regulator it s a pretty unimpressive bunch with rajan sitting head and shoulders above the rest of them blanchflower said the problem is why would anybody want to put themselves in the position of having to deal with brexit rajan 56 a professor at the chicago booth school of business declined to comment about his potential candidacy when contacted by bloomberg as did the bank of england the u k treasury which is responsible for hiring the next governor declined to comment on who had applied by last week s deadline chancellor of the exchequer philip hammond has stressed the need to look internationally for the next appointment though it s not clear if he will still be in his job when the decision is made what is clear though is that rajan has the right sort of track record he was chief economist of the imf from 2003 to 2006 and then worked as an adviser to the indian government before becoming governor of the reserve bank of india in 2013 at the elite jackson hole annual economic gathering in 2005 when he was at the imf rajan warned that risks were building up in the global financial system at the time former u s treasury secretary larry summers criticized rajan as a luddite three years later lehman brothers collapsed as rbi governor rajan introduced inflation targeting and led an effort to clean up bad loans in the banking industry he remained for just one three year term running india s central bank after heavy criticism from segments of the government for offering opinions on matters unrelated to monetary policy subramanian swamy an outspoken lawmaker in prime minister narendra modi s ruling party said rajan was mentally not fully indian and kept interest rates too high in 2016 swamy wrote a letter to modi calling for rajan to be either fired or dismissed at the end of his term in his 2017 book i do what i do rajan said he warned the government against demonetization an attempt to withdraw cash from circulation saying the short term economic costs would outweigh the long term benefits he handled some very treacherous shoals very well said anne krueger a former imf first deputy managing director who helped recruit rajan he did not cave under political pressure and on the other hand he did the best he could to advance what he thought was right political attacks have also been a hallmark of carney s time at the bank of england pro brexit lawmaker jacob rees mogg at one point called him a second tier canadian politician who failed to get a job at home as well as an enemy of brexit rajan has indeed hinted the role could be too politically fraught central banking jobs are very polluted he said in an interview with forbes published last week you have to have a very good sense of where the political terrain lies and how far you can go without upsetting the balance in his latest book published this year the third pillar how markets and the state leave the community behind he argues that neglect of parts of society led to a rise in populism and mistrust bank of england chief economist andy haldane who is also in the running to succeed carney has cited the book in his last three public appearances those political antennae will be vital to navigate brexit according to arvind mayaram who was the top bureaucrat in the indian finance ministry while rajan was central bank governor the volatility and uncertainty that comes with it will require a very steady hand said mayaram he can hold his own and speak his mind he would not let go of those core principles which would be necessary for the central bank to steer a course in very turbulent waters the story

people tour the shops during the grand opening of the hudson yards development in new york by lucia mutikani washington reuters u s consumer prices barely rose in may pointing to moderate inflation that together with a slowing economy increased pressure on the federal reserve to cut interest rates this year but the report from the labor department on wednesday will likely not shift fed officials views that temporary factors are behind the weak inflation readings airline fares among the transitory factors identified by fed chairman jerome powell rebounded and apparel prices stabilized after two straight monthly decreases u s central bank policymakers are scheduled to meet on june 18 19 against the backdrop of rising trade tensions slowing growth and a sharp step down in hiring in may that has led financial markets to price in at least two rate cuts by the end of 2019 a rate cut is not expected next wednesday this soft inflation backdrop reinforces our call for two rate cuts later this year said michael feroli an economist at jpmorgan in new york we think next week is probably too soon to expect that action given that growth is still holding in and trade related risks remain

the fourth straight month the longest such stretch since april 2017 the so called core cpi was held down by a sharp decline in the prices of used cars and trucks as well as motor vehicle insurance in the 12 months through may the so called core cpi rose 2 0 after advancing 2 1 in april u s treasury prices were trading mostly higher while the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies

compared with 20 9 million or 1 65 per diluted share in fiscal 2018 income taxes for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 reflect the mix of the company s taxable income favoring its foreign tax jurisdictions located in canada and china that have higher income tax rates in relation to the u s and a significant decline in u s taxable income which was more than anticipated this resulted in a significant increase in the company s global intangible low taxed income gilti tax and led to a 199 7 percent tax rate however income taxes incurred in the u s on a cash basis were minimal due to the utilization of the company s u s federal net operating loss carryforward generated in fiscal 2019 additionally income taxes reflect provisional adjustments that represented the income tax effects of the tax cuts and jobs act tcja enacted on december 22 2017 no provisional adjustments associated with the tcja were recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 while such provisional adjustments resulted in an income tax benefit totaling 8 0 million that was recorded in fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 the company s income taxes for the full fiscal year of 2019 included an income tax benefit of 550 000 compared with an income tax benefit of 2 1 million that was associated with provisional adjustments pursuant to the tcja for the annual period of fiscal 2018 overview commenting on the results frank saxon chairman and chief executive officer of culp inc said we faced a number of significant challenges in the fourth quarter primarily related to global trade disruption and an overall weaker retail environment there were continuing headwinds associated with low priced imported mattresses from china and the excess supply of these mattresses disrupted the market and affected many of our customers the outcome for culp was reduced demand for our mattress fabrics and sewn covers our upholstery fabrics business was affected by the softer retail environment for home furnishings and uncertainties surrounding international tariffs and the associated geopolitical risks however even with the lower sales for the fourth quarter we were pleased to have another year of overall higher annual sales for the upholstery fabrics segment these results included the first full year sales contribution from read window products rwp which we acquired late in fiscal 2018 in spite of the challenging market conditions throughout fiscal 2019 we continued to execute our product driven strategy in each of our business segments with a relentless focus on design creativity and product innovation our ability to offer a diverse product mix and reach new market segments has been a key differentiator for culp in all of our marketplaces and will remain our strategic focus going forward we will continue to diversify both our product and customer mix in mattress and upholstery fabrics with unique opportunities to expand in the hospitality market we also have the ability to extend our market reach through culp home accessories our finished products business offering bedding accessories and home goods direct to both consumers and businesses we have a flexible global platform to support our business segments with the ability to respond to changing demand as market conditions improve and importantly we have a strong balance sheet and the financial flexibility to pursue our growth strategy we look forward to the opportunities ahead for culp in fiscal 2020 additionally we believe the may 29 2019 ruling by the u s department of commerce imposing punitive anti dumping duties on chinese made mattresses will provide relief for the domestic mattress industry in fiscal 2020 and ultimately lead to improving conditions for our business added saxon mattress fabrics segment sales for this segment were 37 7 million for the fourth quarter down 18 9 percent compared with sales of 46 5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 for fiscal 2019 mattress fabric sales were 145 1 million down 24 7 percent compared with 192 6 million in fiscal 2018 iv culp president and chief operating officer of culp stated while we saw sequential sales improvement in our mattress fabrics business compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019 the influx of low priced mattresses from china has continued to affect the domestic mattress industry the market is still dealing with a significant amount of excess inventory of late 2018 and early 2019 imports and a slower retail environment delayed the sale of these products as we previously announced in our may 1 2019 press release customer demand for our mattress fabrics was lower than expected and affected our sales for the fourth quarter however we are pleased to note some recent positive developments in retail demand as well as many customers altering their supply chains away from china we believe the punitive anti dumping measures against chinese made mattresses as recently announced by the u s department of commerce in its may ruling will ultimately provide relief for the domestic mattress industry with preliminary imposed duties from 39 percent to as high as 1 731 percent despite the headwinds we continue to manage our business in an efficient manner and provide excellent service to our customers we have rationalized our manufacturing operations to meet current and expected demand and have achieved sound profitability in spite of the ongoing challenges importantly we have a sustainable business platform that favorably positions culp for the long term we will continue to reinvest in our business to maximize our operating efficiencies and delivery capabilities our varied product mix of mattress fabrics and sewn covers across most price points and style trends supports our diversification strategy with favorable results importantly class our mattress cover business continues to perform well with the support of our global sewing platform we remain encouraged by the sales trends with our core customers as well as our ability to reach new customers and additional market segments like the popular and expanding boxed bedding space we are excited about the growth opportunities for class as we broaden our customer base culp added while fiscal 2019 was a challenging year for our mattress fabrics business we are optimistic about the year ahead we have the ability to leverage our creative designs innovative products and global production capabilities to enhance our leadership position and sustain culp s competitive advantage we look forward to the opportunities ahead for our mattress fabrics business in fiscal 2020 and beyond upholstery fabrics segment sales for this segment were 29 0 million for the fourth quarter down 8 3 percent compared with sales of 31 7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 for fiscal 2019 upholstery fabric sales were 135 7 million up 3 5 percent compared with 131 1 million in fiscal 2018 our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 reflect an uncertain marketplace and a soft retail environment for home furnishings said boyd chumbley president of culp s upholstery fabrics division as noted in our may press release sales and profits were lower than our originally announced expectations for the fourth quarter the ongoing trade dispute between the u s and china and uncertainties surrounding tariffs have caused significant disruptions throughout the supply chain for the furniture industry the anticipation of additional tariffs resulted in more advance customer purchases in previous quarters and inflated inventories heading into the fourth quarter this factor combined with generally weaker consumer demand for furniture affected our sales for the fourth quarter for the full year we were pleased to achieve another year of higher annual sales in spite of the closure of our anderson south carolina operation in the second quarter and the challenges in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 throughout the year we pursued a product driven strategy with a sustained focus on innovation and creative designs supported by our substantial global platform our design team has done an outstanding job with current style trends and meeting the changing demands of our customers additionally our popular and expanding line of highly durable stain resistant performance fabrics continued to gain acceptance in the marketplace we are also pleased with the contribution from rwp as fiscal 2019 marked the first full year of sales for custom window treatments and other products for the hospitality market in closing chumbley noted looking ahead we expect the prevailing geopolitical issues will continue to affect our business and the furniture industry we are taking steps to adjust our supply chains including partnering with sources for cut and sew kits in vietnam and are working with customers to make necessary adjustments in response to the latest round of tariffs while we expect continued overall softness in retail demand for furniture through the first quarter of fiscal 2020 we believe culp is well positioned for the long term above all we remain focused on providing innovative products that meet the changing demands of

with 13 weeks we expect mattress fabrics sales to be moderately up compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and operating income and margins also are expected to be moderately up as compared with the previous year s first quarter in our upholstery fabrics segment we expect first quarter sales to be moderately down compared with the first quarter of last year as we continue to operate in

income for the first fiscal quarter of 2020 in the range of 2 5 million to 3 2 million pre tax income for last year s first quarter was 1 9 million which included 2 0 million in restructuring and

acquired businesses into our existing operations changes in consumer tastes or preferences toward products not produced by us could erode demand for our products changes in tariffs or trade policy or changes in the value of the u s dollar versus other currencies could affect our financial results because a significant portion of our operations are located outside the united states strengthening of the u s dollar against other currencies could make our products less competitive on the basis of price in markets outside the united states and strengthening of currencies in canada and china can have a negative impact on our sales of products produced in those places also economic and political instability in international areas could affect our operations or sources of goods in those areas as well as demand for our products in international markets finally increases in market prices for petrochemical products can significantly affect the prices we pay for raw materials and in turn increase

everything to know about the april 8 eclipse in atlantic canada saltwire eclipse saltwire by lucia mutikani washington reuters u s consumer prices barely rose in may pointing to moderate inflation that together with a slowing economy increased pressure on the federal reserve to cut interest rates this year but the report from the labor department on wednesday will likely not shift fed officials views that temporary factors are behind the weak inflation readings airline fares among the transitory factors identified by fed chairman jerome powell rebounded and apparel prices stabilized after two straight monthly decreases related stories u s central bank policymakers are scheduled to meet on june 18 19 against the backdrop of rising trade tensions slowing growth and a sharp step down in

chinese president xi jinping at a g20 summit at the end of this month in japan economists have warned that the tariffs will undercut the economy which will celebrate 10 years of expansion in july the longest in history powell said last week the fed was closely monitoring the implications of the trade war on the economy and would act as appropriate to sustain the expansion data so far have

high fiscal deficit jobs etc says managing director and the asia pacific economist in an exclusive interview with et now at the morgan stanley india summit edited excerpts the framework by the risk market seems to be that the us might be actually muddling through yes there is a slowdown in the us but the bond market is implying that there would be probably 1 5 2 gdp growth and the fed is going to be supportive that is always good for risk assets particularly for the rest of the world outside of the us but if you get us tipping over recession then this whole situation reverses every time the us heads into a recession the dollar rises emerging market currency suffers and financial conditions tighten in emerging markets which actually hurts their growth we are right now in terms of expectation sitting at that cusp where people think we will get to muddle through the outcome which is good for risk assets we will have to see what happens on june 29 which is a critical date where we can get a clue of what happens on trade tensions and which will determine where the us goes in terms of growth outlook yes i think so we are moving in from globalisation to slowbalisation unfortunately it is looking real and would probably be long lasting we have moved away from the benign environment where there was predictability on what happens on global trade front into this environment where there is going to be probably continuous uncertainty hurting corporate confidence it is not a great environment from a medium term perspective either that is right and that is something we were concerned about independent of trade tensions because we have a situation where us unemployment is very low and it is in late cycle the us started to see wage growth pick up and that was beginning to hurt corporate margins all the signals which would indicate that the us in late cycle were already beginning to come through as it is without trade tensions we were worried about the corporate credit risk because that is what usually you tend to be worried about in the late cycle either the household or the corporate balance sheet whichever is levelled up when cost of capital goes up could tip over and create a bigger slowdown in the economy we were watching the corporate credit risk the late cycle dynamics in the us now these trade tensions have only accelerated and increased our concerns on the us outlook from a global economy perspective when you hit global growth of below 2 5 imf has defined that as a recession threshold currently we are at 3 2 we were at 4 in first quarter of 2018 so we have seen an 80 bps deceleration and what we are saying is that if you do get a bad outcome on trade tensions then it persists for some time if it is for a few weeks it is okay but the economy will not be able to withstand a severe deterioration in global trade dynamics which will take this global growth from 3 2 to below 2 5 that is how we are worried about recession mark definitely not our strategists are highlighting that if that is the case you would probably see a much severe correction in the risk assets globally i am not a strategist all i can tell you is that generally when you are heading into recession risk assets do badly bond yields would fall in that scenario of recession where global growth is below 2 5 we are expecting the fed to take rates down to zero and that will probably be taking down the 10 year bond further down than where we are today yes we have been highlighting that and i wrote a long report on this saying that in the next downturn you will have to use fiscal policy more actively because in the dms central banks do not have much room to cut rates the us has some room to cut rates but all the other central banks like japan or ecb boj or ecb do not they will have to think about how to have fiscal policy play a complimentary role and drive that recovery it is in this context that we are hearing the arguments about mmt modern monetary theory i do not think that is the solution we have existing institutional framework which allows us to use all the tools and the fiscal policy tool will have to be used more actively to get out of the next downturn yes unfortunately that will be a challenge what i have been highlighting is that india has already been going through this multiple years of weakness in investment cycle we have had slowdown in growth lower nominal gdp growth because pricing power has also been weak if you look at wpi that has resulted into lower corporate return expectations and so in some ways we are stuck in this vicious cycle we need to have an environment where the financial system is robust enough to support recovery in the economy but unfortunately that is not there the government is working towards it but it is taking its own time meanwhile there is this window to fix this financial system if you have global recession in three four quarters that will create additional problem for india to get out of this persistent weakness in investment and therefore lower growth i would not call 12 to 18 months a structural i would still call it cyclical if you take a 10 year view or a five year view this is more like a deep cyclical slowdown rather than structural slowdown india has great demographics there are pockets of leverage in the corporate sector but in aggregate the debt levels in india are not that high so the structural story is quite robust and it is just that we have got into this deep cylical challenge you can go back in history and keep giving an explanation as to what will happen not all of it is due to the government decisions a lot of it is due to the external environment clearly the government has not really been working as actively to revive that investment as it should have and hopefully we see that action coming in through now rbi is looking at just simple mandate of inflation versus growth and inflation is looking comfortable and in the background we have this persistent weakness in investment and growth it is the absolutely right decision from rbi to focus on growth right now because they have comfort on inflation outlook i do not think it is at the cost of a compromise of inflation outlook there is room for fiscal expansion it s the way you take up fiscal expansion that rating agencies watch if there is a fiscal expansion for productive investment as well as tax cuts for the corporate sector that would be viewed positively because the challenge that india faces right now even the fiscal challenge the problem is on the revenue side and not on the expenditure side you need to kick start the growth cycle and that will be the solution for all the problems that india has whether it is high fiscal deficit jobs etc look at pmis globally they have been decelerating quite aggressively over the last few months and india can see less decline in pmi less decline in corporate confidence but it has to see the same downturn as we are seeing everywhere else in the world so it is not isolated very often i get a lot of explanation on growth changes from domestic side but it is really linked with the global economy and global economy has been doing badly exports are doing badly corporate confidence is going to be further affected already there are challenges in the domestic economy and if you get this downturn on the exports front it is going to be difficult at the same time fii inflows were also not so great and have only revived recently all kind of ties up together that this was a global factor which was affecting india over the last six months it is two simple areas of focus we do not know what happens externally so domestically the first and the most important one is to fix the financial system i know they are working towards it but there needs to be some kind of priority and a concerted effort to fix it in a time bound manner and then one has to have some ideas to revive investment be it tax cuts or government takes of some select high level of investment infrastructure projects which needs to be done to kickstart the investment cycle going back in time it all started with taper tantrums when india had to take up tight fiscal policy tight monetary policy curtail down domestic demand because current account deficit was quite high and the rupee was declining after that in about 18 months or so there was some kind of recovery in domestic demand the consumption data had started to recover but there was a global slowdown with china s problems on fx in 2015 then all emerging market economies also went down including the developed world after that we had demonetisation and 2017 and 2018 first half was actually a synchronous global recovery environment where every other economy was doing well but we were dealing with our lagged effects of demonetisation then we implemented gst and outcome for the corporate sector was weak corporate revenue growth weak aggregate demand that has been persisting for a long time killing their confidence to invest the good news is that finally you have political stability for five years and the government will take this opportunity and work towards whatever is needed for the economy at least you know that if you are making a demand as an independent economist these are the things that i want to see for the economy to improve you have a political environment which is going to be able to respond if you had a bad political outcome where there is unstable government it would have been just about expecting but not actually being able to execute the good news is that you have this stable government and hopefully we will see some execution
published wednesday 12 june 2019 print disqus stefan gleason the 2020 presidential election is already shaping up to be one of the most bitterly contested in history the outcome could have enormous ramifications for all asset markets including precious metals in the meantime a lot can happen before november 2020 especially with the federal reserve apparently set to turn dovish and cut interest rates this summer some historical research into presidential election cycles suggests that the stock market tends to perform well heading into an election year the incumbent administration tends to focus on padding economic statistics and during election years fed officials who swear up and down they aren t motivated by politics tend to avoid making policy moves such as rate hikes that could make them vulnerable to political attacks gold and silver fared well last time a republican stood for re election gold and silver which are less tied to the economy than stocks show little recent correlation with election years the last time a republican incumbent was up for re election was 2004 incumbent president george w bush faced off against democrat challenger john kerry gold and silver markets performed well in the second half of 2003 and made modest gains in 2004 the metals were in the early stages of a major bull market in 2008 when barack obama and john mccain were vying for the white house the financial crisis hit silver got slammed along with virtually all other assets during that infamous autumn gold however weathered the storm quite well and ended up putting in a gain for the year the stunning election victory of donald trump in 2016 lit a fire under the stock market and put something of a damper on retail demand for physical precious metals in the united states although gold prices are now up since trump s election win and inauguration silver has trended lower and coin and bar demand remains soft compared to the heady years under president obama unlike stocks precious metals tend to benefit from the fear trade if a pro socialist democrat actually wins the white house in 2020 you can bet a lot of investors will decide to hunker down and get defensive gold and silver markets may begin to display an inverse correlation to trends in president trump s poll numbers however larger macro forces now in motion namely steadily rising government debt and accommodative monetary policy will stay in motion through next year s election and beyond regardless of who wins it s only a matter of whether the election results accelerate the debt fueled monetary crisis that is coming if the gop keeps the white house in 2020 it s not necessarily bad news for metals investors recall that when george w bush won re election in november 2004 gold was trading at a mere 450 oz the money metal went on to hit a record 1 000 oz in early 2008 over that same period silver advanced from under 8 oz to over 20 oz importantly precious metals vastly outperformed the stock market through the four years of bush ii s second term radical leftists push democrats to go for broke on spending promises some in the conservative media stamp democrats as suffering from trump derangement syndrome unhinged hatred of the president is only part of what s driving democrats to take increasingly radical positions packing the supreme court abolishing the electoral college abolishing ice censoring the internet medicare for all green new deal etc even before trump the base of the democrat party had been lurching ideologically to the left today democrat candidates are being pushed to reject mixed economy welfare statism and fully embrace socialist doctrines nearly the entire field of democrat presidential candidates has essentially adopted bernie sanders platform one exception former colorado governor john hickenlooper who is running as a pragmatic problem solver with a business background he recently gave a speech to california democrats in which he said socialism was the wrong way to go he was roundly booed meanwhile 76 year old uncle joe biden is disavowing himself to appease far left activists but that is proving to be difficult for him under pressure he suddenly reversed his decades long support of the hyde amendment which bars federal funding of most abortions biden is also trying to play catch up to the trillions in new spending programs proposed by bernie sanders and elizabeth warren clumsily rolling out a partially plagiarized clean energy revolution that would cost the economy at least 5 trillion 2020 prediction winner will embrace more money printing as for senator pocahontas warren has gone off the reservation when it comes to taxing spending and printing currency out of thin air she would pay for her multi trillion dollar progressive wish list by instituting a new wealth tax and pushing the u s dollar lower i e inflation as warren put it her monetary policy vague as it is would entail more actively managing our currency value it sounds like modern monetary theory mmt which is likely coming in one form or another in the years ahead as the government struggles just to pay interest on an exponentially growing debt load under mmt the government would directly print the dollars it needs to close its deficits rather than issue new bonds similar monetary experiments didn t work out so well in zimbabwe and venezuela given president trump s repeated clashes with the federal reserve over what he sees as too tight monetary policy he might be all too willing to support a bipartisan push for a more actively managed more inflationary monetary system investors who are thinking about selling precious metals or refraining from buying until trump leaves office should check their premises
