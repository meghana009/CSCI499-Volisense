the year that passed proved to deliver positive returns for investors but 2020 may present a new set of risks thank you for reading this post don t forget to subscribe paul wallace bloomberg global bond traders who ventured into africa this year have reaped rich rewards the continent s sovereign dollar debt has generated total returns of 20 since the start of 2019 more than any other region in emerging markets local bonds have also performed strongly egyptian pound and nigerian naira bonds each returned more than 30 in dollar terms if the world s major central banks remain dovish in 2020 that should sustain a dash for higher yields in emerging markets and mean that african bonds remain in hot demand the extra yield investors get when buying sovereign dollar bonds in africa rather than us treasuries has narrowed almost 100 basis points this year according to j p morgan chase co s indexes still at 461 basis points that spread remains the highest of any emerging market region and double that of eastern europe africa is a land of opportunity and could be one of the main beneficiaries if the us and china make more progress on trade talks said bank of america strategists

as the 2010s draw to a close the global economy is in a very different place at the decade s end than at its beginning many of the sociopolitical events that took place around the world were reflective of the financial world analysts say the election of donald trump in 2016 was the catalyst for significant change in the u s economy and the global economy but his rise was as much an effect of broader forces at work as it was a cause of these movements and moments that reshaped the economy over the last 10 years eurozone in crisis in the wake of the recession unsustainably high deficit and debt levels in several european countries led to a crisis requiring the intervention of third party financial institutions such as a 2012 bond buying program implemented by the european central bank to tamp down interest rates on sovereign debt which were rising as investor confidence shrank the crisis was most acutely felt in greece which had its bond rating slashed slashed to junk status after it was revealed that the government had seriously misrepresented its debt burden leaders agreed to sharp austerity measures in return for bailouts from the union and the international monetary fund in the subsequent backlash and public protests against greek austerity measures there was speculation that the country might leave the eurozone entirely some say these events were a precursor to and a catalyst of britain s 2016 vote to leave the eurozone brexit is kind of the natural outcome of when greece was basically held hostage said brad mcmillan chief investment officer at commonwealth financial network they were forced into a multi year depression in order to save the euro obviously brexit opens up the possibility more concretely that european countries can leave their union and i m sure that s going to have all kinds of ramifications said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics with nationalism growing in prominence he predicted that the eurozone will face a continuation of these challenges in the coming decade nationalism hits trade the 2010s were marked more broadly by a surge of populist and nationalist sentiment both in the u s and elsewhere around the world a sentiment that is fundamentally reshaping trade between countries and changing the calculus for multinational corporations we ve seen this rise of nationalism which is a political issue reshaping financial markets tremendously said joseph heider president of cirrus wealth management for roughly half a century business and industry labored to build manufacturing and production facilities and supply chains to take advantage of the availability of raw materials cheap labor and lax environmental regulations all in a relentless drive for efficiency now that commercial infrastructure is under strain trump s decision to pull the united states out of the trans pacific partnership and start a trade war with china is the most visible and consequential manifestation of this trend with his on again off again threats to impose tariffs on europe mexico and other trading partners a close second politics is now taking primacy over economics over the past several decades we ve been building an economically optimized world right now that is no longer the case mcmillan said political economy is now being prioritized over economic efficiency and that s something we haven t seen for decades that takes us back to the 50s fed intervenes to prop up the economy in the wake of the financial crisis the federal reserve initiated monetary policy with little precedent in modern times it held interest rates at zero for an extended period of time and undertook enormous quantitative easing programs to pump liquidity into financial markets the decade was really remarkable in the sense that for the first six years of the decade we had zero percent interest rates and for the first five years we had quantitative easing said dan north chief economist at euler hermes north america characterizing the central bank s activities as a wild monetary policy experiment some market observers defend the fed s interventionist streak particularly at the start of the decade with the financial crisis still fresh in people s minds the biggest thing in the last 10 years is the continuation of quantitative easing without quantitative easing i think everything would be drastically different way worse than things are now said mitchell goldberg president of clientfirst strategy in hindsight some question whether the fed was too accommodative a stance that could have ramifications for the next recession when the fed cut interest rates to the unprecedented level of zero to 0 25 percent nobody expected it was going to last the seven years that it did mcbride said we ve had way too much easy money for way too long and at some point it s going to come back and get us north said this leaves the fed with fewer tools at hand to boost the economy he said we re leaving very little room for the next recession tax cuts lead to buybacks republicans sweep of the 2016 election facilitated the passage of a massive corporate tax cut financial experts say the passage of the tax cuts and jobs act at the end of 2017 had positive results initially but those short term gains could come at the cost of long term pain trump got elected and went on a path of reducing regulation north said i think honestly the reduction in regulation has helped the economy and i think the tax cut helped the economy as well he said but he added that since economic growth fell far short of republicans forecasts the stimulative effects of the tax cut have faded and the national debt has ballooned a risky combination it s putting america on a less stable financial future because of the structure of this unfunded non sustainable tax cut crowley said proponents of the the tax cuts predicted that companies would spend their windfalls expanding and investing in production facilities technology and human capital instead the cuts spurred a wave of corporate stock buybacks which helped propel the market to new record highs but also potentially limited the broader impact the tax cuts were intended to have it s in part a reflection of the fact that there may be in some sectors more than others limited investment or acquisition opportunities or a lack of appealing valuations on those that make a buyback a more palatable way to boost earnings per share said greg mcbride chief financial analyst at bankrate com every dollar that s going into buybacks is a dollar that s not being used for another form of expansion he said share repurchases have also contributed to stock valuation gains but investing experts warn that this inflation can distort markets more dollars chasing fewer stocks because of all the buybacks isn t something you want long term investors to hang their hat on said john lynch chief investment strategist at lpl financial stock market highs the increase in buybacks is one factor that has contributed to the record long bull market a meteoric rise virtually no one would have predicted 10 years ago when 2010 began the stock market had already begun the long climb out of its recession era hole but the mood was still pessimistic the decade started off very ominously zandi said we began the decade not knowing that the crisis was over we d just suffered the worst economic downturn since the 1930s depression the recession was over officially by june 2009 but it wasn t quite clear that we were out of it since then of course stocks have smashed through one record high after another with valuations boosted by both monetary and fiscal policy mcbride said the fed s trio of rate cuts in 2019 reversed the correction that took place at the end of last year sustaining the bull market for a record setting 10th year that helped cushion the broader economy but it s also helped juiced the equity markets lower interest rates make other investments less appealing he said that enhances the appeal of equities relative to bonds or cash
this conversation took place in 2013 and it is still valid this is the profile thinking pattern and the value system of the man who has been appointed as the governor of the central bank it was 1972 and i was an assistant lecturer at the then vidyodaya university the permanent lecturer taking the second year monetary economics class had fallen ill and was not to come to the university for about one month i was asked by the head of department to fill in my problem was that there were no good textbooks in sinhala in national income analysis which students and i could refer to the university library also had not stocked books in sinhala then at a leading book shop in the city i chanced upon a collection of essays on selected topics in economics with a chapter on national income written by a young lecturer called w d lakshman then attached to the university of ceylon peradeniya the title of the book was aarthika vishleshana or economic analyses and on glancing through the content page i knew that i had found the perfect book in sinhala for teaching national income to undergraduates that was how i came to know about lakshman though i had not met him in person the writer of books lakshman s first book was soon followed by another this time an expanded version covering the full range of both microeconomics and macroeconomics under the same title but co authored with another university don h m gunasekara at a time when university students doing economics in sinhala were hungry for advanced textbooks in the subject lakshman tried to fill the gap by investing his time in writing textbooks his was a continuation of the rich tradition set by other university academics some of them his gurus in sharing their knowledge with students and general readers that was a period during which the country was under strict exchange controls and textbooks in english were scanty hence writing books in sinhala had a well protected market yet only a few university academics ventured into this lucrative enterprise i was able to sell a few thousand copies within a few months says lakshman showing the line of humbleness that is drawn across his face in fact it was from the profits of the first book that i was able to part finance my studies at oxford later we met at his residence in the suburb of colombo it was already the evening and lakshman had a long day that day taking his wife kalyani to a religious practice class in the morning and meeting some united nations representatives in the afternoon yet the indefatigable lakshman did not appear to be tired his wife a green tea fan served us with a steaming pot of the brew which we could sip while talking i wanted to probe into that part financing story is he telling me a lie i knew that he went to the oxford on a university scholarship then how could it be that he had to part finance his studies out of his own resources the harsh arm of exchange controls true that i got a scholarship from the university of ceylon but it was not a scholarship in its true sense he explains what they did was to convert my rupee salary into sterling pounds and remit to me with exchange control approval that amounted only to 55 sterling pounds but the exchange control allowed the remittance of 60 sterling pounds at that time so the balance 5 pounds i had to finance from my own resources the sale proceeds of the book were a handy source for meeting those five pounds at that time was that sufficient i mean the 60 pounds i ask him no he says at that time the commonwealth scholars were paid double or close to double that amount by the british government so our salary and what was allowed by the exchange control were totally insufficient we had to undergo innumerable difficulties worse when we came back we did not have any savings here because all my salary had been sent to the uk i turned the discussion to some other topic what about his school days where did he study i ask him the bright student at vidyaloka i studied at a school in galle and it was called vidyaloka vidyalaya its name has recently been changed to vidyaloka college he says that was where i received my post primary and secondary education vidyaloka was not ranked among the top three in galle but it was a good school he talks of his alma mater with a visible sense of reverence in fact lakshman was a bright student at school at every annual prize giving he was a recipient of many prizes the college had a policy of giving only three prizes to one student a policy that was designed to broad base the award of prizes today going by the popular terminology it would be re termed inclusive distribution of prizes like the popular inclusive growth had that policy not been there lakshman would have bagged almost all the class prizes what did he study for the university of ceylon preliminary as today s advanced level equivalent was then called or the higher school certificate or hsc examination i ask him i did arts subjects says lakshman they were sinhala pali government and ceylon history in fact my most preferred subject was pali that may be true because based on his performance in that subject he was offered a scholarship at peradeniya called the university of ceylon scholarship with a glorious value of rs 100 attached to it that was about us dollars 21 at the exchange that prevailed in 1960 eight students including lakshman sat for the university of ceylon preliminary examination in december 1959 from vidyaloka and four of them lakshman included got through the exam and entered the university in 1960 peradeniya days i didn t have a particular preference in regard to the subject of specialisation in my undergraduate studies when i joined the university of the university preliminary subjects i had already dropped pali from my general arts qualifying or gaq course work by the time i had completed gaq i had developed a desire to specialise in political science taught at that time as part of the special degree course in economics that is how i came to select economics as the subject of specialisation from the second year onwards in the university the second year in the university life of a special degree student was then called the special arts qualifying year the economics course offered several specialisations from third year onwards but during my time in peradeniya there were no adequately qualified lecturers to admit students for the political science stream in economics that is how i ended up specialising in money and banking in my special course in economics i am indeed happy that i ended up specialising in money and banking as it was and still is the elite specialisation in economics adds lakshman that decision though perhaps taken without much thought sealed lakshman s destiny he specialised in money and banking and was able to come under the academic influence of the renowned scholar at that time professor h a de s gunasekara after sitting for the final exam for a few months lakshman taught at a school in galle then all of a sudden he received a telegram from hades to return to peradeniya as a temporary lecturer hades asked lakshman to teach economic history first and then economic theory in one of these classes he met his future wife kalyani while doing the extensive reference work for teaching economic theory i realised the difficulties faced by students in sinhala medium due to a lack of good economics books in sinhala i was myself in the first batch of undergraduates to study economics in the sinhala medium but as we were in the transitional stage i had no difficulty in referencing english medium literature the batches following us were not so this gave me the idea of writing my first book in sinhala and also later contributing to the translated literature in economics says lakshman i did not tell him that i also used his book to teach my students the rigour of the material touched upon in the book coupled with its easy readability made lakshman a well known economics scholar in all the four universities in the country at the time and also in other universities later on after the release of the results of the degree examination many of lakshman s friends chose the central bank as their future career station but lakshman remained faithful to peradeniya and continued as a lecturer any particular preference to remain at peradeniya i asked him i cannot recall says lakshman when i started my career at the university i started to enjoy teaching perhaps that would have been the reason for me to stick to an academic career at the university in any case the distance between the university and the central bank as career stations then was not that much central bank governor professor w d lakshman the oxford experience from peradeniya lakshman got a university scholarship to do his postgraduate studies at the prestigious university of oxford in the uk he was registered for the bachelor of literature or b litt degree in economics a master s degree though it was called bachelor s in the oxford jargon entirely by research after working for his thesis for two years he was upgraded by the university directly to the doctor of philosophy or d phil degree he did his research on terms of trade public policy and economic development of ceylon 1948 1958 under the supervision of eprime eshag an iran born professor at oxford eshag before he joined oxford had worked at the un and has been well known as an ardent follower of keynes an appreciation written by london university professor heather joshi to the independent in 1998 on eshag s death has described him as an unrepentant keynesian socialist it is also reported that while studying in cambridge for his doctorate in early 1940s eshag came to the notice of keynes and became a disciple of another cambridge academic joan robinson for his doctorate eshag submitted a thesis on the history of monetary theory to the university of cambridge at oxford eshag had taught development economics keynesian economics and monetary theory later in 1983 he published a book titled fiscal and monetary policies and problems of developing countries i suspected that lakshman s well known keynesian leaning would have been due to his association with eshag but he refutes me the social democrat eshag was to some extent responsible for influencing my thinking to move toward keynesianism indeed my teaching throughout has been influenced by keynesian analysis i was indeed responsible for commencing a course in post keynesian economics for fourth year students in economics at colombo a couple of years prior to my retirement but i would call myself a social democrat rather than a keynesian social democracy as a philosophy is much wider than keynesianism although many keynesians are social democratic in orientation the aim of social democracy is to bring justice equity and prosperity to everyone not for a selected crowd in today s parlance we can call it inclusive justice inclusive equity and inclusive prosperity keynesianism is known as a philosophy and method of economic analysis opposed to market fundamentalism promoting government intervention for economic and social progress says lakshman the market fundamentalism about which lakshman was talking is the belief that markets always work properly the government should only do the minimum and any governmental intervention more than the minimum would harm an economy it appears that a political party or a regime which is truly dedicated to pure social democracy has not been present in sri lanka throughout its post independence history lakshman in his introduction to dilemmas of development containing a collection of papers by eminent economists in the country and published on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of independence of sri lanka from the british rule categorises the two main political parties which had held power in the country into the following two groups united national party a libertarian ideology with an element of social democracy and the sri lanka freedom party social democracy enhanced by elements of socialist ideology a libertarian ideology here means a greater proneness to the free market economy system in which the private sector is entrusted with the task of performing the two important economic activities namely production and distribution a socialist ideology which relies on the government sector attempts to attain an equitable distribution in income and economic power according to him this demarcation too was further blurred by the fact that unp had to satisfy its trade union movements by moving more toward social democracy at times and slfp had in its rank many holding right wing libertarian ideas another factor that moved both parties away from the social democratic philosophy was the presence of powerful groups with communalistic tendencies in both parties this meant that neither political party could satisfy lakshman s burning desire to practise social democracy as the guiding principle of managing affairs in sri lanka how does he marry keynesianism with social democracy i begin to wonder then i recalled that keynes was a sympathiser of the liberal party in the uk in 1920s the liberal party followed a mid path not aligned to the pure capitalism practiced in the us or to the pure socialism practiced in the soviet union in fact after visiting the soviet union in 1926 keynes published a book titled the end of laissez faire suggesting that governments should intervene in their respective economies even the main message delivered in keynes the general theory was that when the demand by the people for goods and services become deficient the government should place a huge purchase order financed through borrowing to supplement the demand so the government s intervention is an essential element in a keynesian type of an economy but it should be done in a democratic manner respecting the rights of people the research on ceylon s terms of trade i asked lakshman about his d phil thesis what were his findings my thesis covered the period from 1948 to 1958 during that period ceylon was purely a trade dependent economy both imports and exports accounted for about three fourth of the gross domestic product so the terms of trade the measure that tells you how many units of export products a country should sacrifice to get one unit of imports and its behaviour influenced the fluctuation of actual real income in the country very significantly if the terms of trade turned favourable to a country over a particular period that is if export units to be given up to buy an import unit were declining then the real income level of the country would be bigger than they actually measured real income level if the terms of trade are unfavourable to a country then the opposite takes place between 1948 and 1958 in some years the terms of trade were favourable to ceylon especially in the early part when the country was experiencing a boom in its export prices but toward the end of the period the terms of trade began to gradually turn unfavourable so it was a mixed performance but then how did it affect ceylon s economic development i ask him the problem for ceylon was that it did not make use of the favourable situation in the terms of trade to make a diversification of the economy as a result ceylon was pretty much vulnerable to external shocks even today when imports and exports account for about 45 of the country s gdp we are vulnerable to adverse external shocks you can imagine how we would have been vulnerable in 1950s when that ratio was more than 65 he explains does this mean that sri lanka is still a developing country today because of the wrong type of economic strategies adopted during the good times the country had immediately after the independence i begin to wonder and ask him about that lakshman says that his thesis did not explicitly go into that question but one could draw that lesson from its findings in the introduction to dilemmas of development mentioned above lakshman says that the government in power during 1948 to 1956 tried to continue with the export economy which the country inherited from the british with an added element of social democracy for political survival the social democratic measures implemented by that government were the food subsidy scheme free education and free health services lakshman says that the government that came to power in 1956 had practised in contrast to the preceding regime a policy of assigning a central position in the economy to the state in order to break the shackles of underdevelopment with which the economy had been bound that government tried to introduce a new production model based on the substitution of goods particularly manufactured goods that were being imported from other countries by locally produced goods import substitution in agricultural goods was practiced even by the earlier regime however the import substitution policy was implemented with all associated trappings namely introducing high tariff levels import and exchange controls price controls overarching presence of state enterprises and attempts at introducing central planning systems professor at the university of colombo in 1981 lakshman got a real break in his career he was appointed professor and head of the department of economics at the university of colombo how did it change his workload and approach i ask him now i had the responsibility of continuing with the development work which my predecessors had started says lakshman it was a three pronged approach i had to develop the faculty at the same time i had to see that the students in the department were getting a standard education then i had to see to it that the curricula and courses were updated to reflect the changing underlying conditions for all these changes i got the full support of the staff and the university administration how did you set about doing it i ask him fortunately around this time i got a new opportunity he says the then minister of finance ronnie de mel had sought the dutch government s support to develop a think tank in sri lanka that could help the government to evaluate and reform its development policy package particularly its economic policies the dutch government had agreed and the institution which came up as the result after considerable planning effort has been the institute of policy studies or today s ips it was the institute of social studies or iss in the hague that carried out the planning activities in this think tank initiative on behalf of the dutch government two senior teachers at the iss dr howard nicholas and dr david dunham were sent for the purpose to colombo on a number of occasions indeed after the ips was set up these two gentlemen were posted at two different times at the ips as long term resident representatives of the collaborating institution the iss during this time i got an introduction to howard and david through some mutual friends after several meetings howard david and i developed the idea of developing the economics department in the university of colombo through the iss association supported by dutch government funding under a project parallel to the ips project the idea that we developed was for the ips to become the planned think tank and the economics department of the university to become manpower development centre and the source of resource persons for the ips this did not materialise in the way we expected but the idea was accepted by the dutch there would have been other contenders among departments of economics in other local universities for this kind of rare opportunity of securing foreign funding for departmental development how did lakshman manage to beat other contenders i ask him one advantage was that colombo university was centrally located the other was that our project proposal had various elements like the introduction of post graduate degree programmes in collaboration with iss development of the staff and a research programme funded under the scheme he says the link with the iss thus lakshman managed to link the colombo s economics department with iss of the two distinguished academics of iss noted above howard was responsible for looking after the colombo economics project and during 1987 2000 and he spent long periods in colombo planning facilitating and managing with lakshman on colombo side being in charge of all link activities between colombo economics and iss by the time this university of colombo institute of social studies project was established lakshman had already begun in colombo the programme of developing postgraduate education in economics the first teaching programme commenced in 1984 for this purpose was the postgraduate diploma in economic development the uc iss project and the teaching inputs received from iss through this project enabled colombo to commence in the late 1980s its highly demanded master s course in economics both programmes were very popular and there were a large number of students who applied for admission how did you develop the staff i ask him he smiles as if it has taken him back to the memory of a coup he had staged to have the staff developed under the dutch government s assistance the first phase of the uc iss project offered us mostly master s degree scholarships for studying in the dutch universities at the negotiations for the second phase of the project i insisted that we do not want ma scholarships instead i asked for a large number of phd scholarships about eight in all to be spent in the netherland and if conditions demanded also in universities elsewhere they were sceptical and asked us how can you release such a large number of staff i told them to leave it to us because i knew that we could have the study programme covered by temporary and visiting staff finally the dutch government agreed and we fully utilised the eight phd scholarships offered the majority of phds in the colombo economics today are those trained in various dutch universities what is satisfying is that the great bulk of the teachers trained during this period had completed their phds and returned to the university so colombo has the largest concentration of phds in its economics department compared to other universities today he says with an enormous sense of contentment the researcher par excellence then came the research programme lakshman alone published a large number of papers and books between 1981 and 1998 these papers and books covered numerous aspects of the extant sri lanka s economy some dealt with political economy aspect of the growth of public enterprises in sri lanka others looked at issues like sri lanka s relationship with the imf and the world bank and implications of complete exchange control liberalisation his studies included a few on exchange rate movement in sri lanka some alone and some jointly with other eminent economists like howard nicholas and premachandra athukorala another renowned sri lankan economist attached to the australian national university was this spirit continued undiminished after he left the department i wonder yes he says in fact both the staff development and the research programmes were continued by my successors with the same spirit and vigour that was an encouraging sign what about the curriculum development what changes were made by him in that area i drew his attention to this aspect of his contribution a course on post keynesian economics what i had done in the field of curriculum development at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels of economics teaching at universities of peradeniya and colombo are too numerous to be fully explained here let me just tell about one item in this long list of things i had done it was noted earlier also i introduced a new course for special degree students on post keynesian economics in the colombo department of economics this is in fact the only course on this subject taught by a sri lankan university today having adopted the structuralist keynesian approach in my teaching of development economics it was fitting that i could introduce this course which still continues to be taught as a parting contribution from me he says this course is a critic of the prevailing orthodoxy in economics and tries to equip the student with some knowledge of how a group of economists with a way of thinking that is different to the mainstream orthodoxy of economics would analyse economic issues and approach economic policy what was meant by the prevailing orthodoxy here is the body of economics that was developed since keynes general theory and came to be the segmented into different schools of the mainstream economics the mainstream economics is described in many different terms like neoclassical a marriage of both classical economics and keynesian economics monetarist a body of economics that taught that money supply increases have no impact on influencing real goods and services but the general price level in the long run new classical a body of economics that tried to resurrect the old classical economics largely dismissed by keynes and rational expectations economics again a body of economics that tried to base its policy on the expectations made by people on a rational basis so that people cannot be fooled continuously and systematically lakshman s new course apparently takes the students through a bit of history of economic thought and introduces the core of the body of knowledge now known as post keynesian and not new keynesian economics to students lakshman thinks that this is necessary knowledge which economics students should acquire if he she is to claim to be an economist and it is also good for these students to pass out with the awareness that economics is not merely the mainstream neoclassical economics taught in textbooks used around the world since the rational expectations hypothesis has become the accepted norm of the mainstream economics today i wondered whether lakshman believed in rational expectations if so how he would incorporate them in his critical analysis of the course human beings are not always rational says lakshman people for most part of their life are emotional and acting on instinct you may be an emotional man now and finds your folly and swear to yourself that you will not be emotional again but the very same man becomes emotional shortly with respect to some other matter so where do you find those rational men they are not found even in developed countries where they are taught to become rational decision makers by their education systems lakshman s view reminded me of the concept of bounded rationality propagated by herbert simon psychologist cum economist in 1957 according to this concept a man can be rational up to the point that he can acquire all the necessary information on an issue and he has the ability to understand the same if these two prerequisites are not present then there is no meaning in talking about a rational man in the society take for example the emotionally driven americans and britons who believed in the existence of mass destruction weapons in iraq as pushed through their throats by their respective governments even after finding out that this story was a fabrication they continued to believe it because they had been emotionally worked out lakshman himself taught the new course in post keynesian economics for two years before he retired from colombo and a few years even after retirement the course may not be popular among students but appears to be respected by both teachers and students the vice chancellor s job in 1995 lakshman reached the pinnacle of his career that was when he was elevated from the dean of the graduate studies a position he had held since 1992 to the vice chancellor s position at the university of colombo did this administrative position kill the researcher in him i wondered i was not averse to an academic administrative post says lakshman true that it took most of my time but after sometime when the job throws day to day to medium term challenges at you you start enjoying the work earlier i was in charge of a department then in 1992 i was responsible for the development of a faculty almost from scratch now as vc i had to handle several faculties at the university in addition i was the chief accounting officer too i was responsible for guiding the university senate and the council in the management respectively of academic and general administrative and financial matters at the position of the vc the whole world was looking at you and you cannot allow the academic standards to deteriorate then for financial matters i was responsible to both ugc and the parliament this makes you scared but once you take up the job you cannot retreat so i engaged myself in planning for the long term development of the university while improving its standards and systems i got the support from everyone for that within these constraints lakshman managed to complete four papers which he had started earlier two papers dealing with how internal and external factors would affect economic policy making and the socio economic factors affecting the structural adjustment policies were authored by him alone the other two papers that dealt with the sri lanka s export sector and its rural unemployment were completed jointly with his academic colleagues at the university since the completion of these papers lakshman had been silent for some time i asked him why the workload as the vc was so heavy that i could not devote my time for any research work during that period the university s planning system its funding issues and numerous meetings within and outside the university took most of my time therefore i considered that period as a holiday for my research interests in economics but i did a different type of research that was how a university should be developed and run hence i could safely say that my time was productively used during that period sabbatical leave in japan in april 1999 lakshman resigned from the post of vice chancellor and proceeded to japan on sabbatical leave a privilege which a university don enjoys once in seven years of active duty to go on full time leave to advance and update his knowledge many academics use this facility to get themselves attached to universities of repute usually in the west it is a programme for continuing academic development of university dons lakshman chose japan because he had previously in 1976 spent his sabbatical leave also in that country in 1999 he joined ryukoku university in japan as a professor of economics after my two year stint at ryukoku i came back to colombo and worked there for three years till october 2004 i had some earned leave so far not utilised which i could use before my retirement coming due in 2007 colombo university offered me another one and a half years of overseas leave to enable me to accept the position of professor offered to me by another japanese university the university of saga this enabled me to return to my full academic life once again japanese universities are very much oriented to research and therefore it was like a rebirth for me i was able to recover the lost time as a top university administrator back home says lakshman policy advisor to the government after returning to sri lanka from japan in mid 2006 lakshman re joined university of colombo and served it for a short period until retiring in 2007 from university service after 40 long years but the government did not want to allow his knowledge and expertise to be wasted and therefore appointed him as an advisor to the ministry of finance in 2008 and later in 2010 as the chairman of the institute of policy studies the economic policy think tank set up in sri lanka with the dutch government s support in the 1980s though lakshman had now been divorced from teaching his passion of life in the past forty year period he now could serve the nation in a different capacity this was a good opportunity for me to get involved in economic policy making and understand the intricate issues that one has to handle in terms of the prevailing political economic conditions confesses lakshman in 2009 he got another important assignment to examine and review the country s tax system and recommend measures to improve the same so as to meet the country s future aspirations this he had to do as the chairman of the presidential commission on taxation which had ten other members the report was completed in 2010 and presented to the president of the republic lakshman s services to the nation as a university don top university administrator and top economist did not go unnoticed he was honoured by the president by conferring on him the highest honour of the republic the title of deshamanya in 2005 then the university which he served since 1981 namely the university of colombo conferred on him the degree of doctor of letters or d litt honoris causa in 2008 despite these honours conferred on him and the reputation he is having as a top economist lakshman still moves with people displaying the same innocence which he had as a youngster when he was in his village in the down south he has all the reasons to be proud of himself and his family though his sense of modesty and humility do not allow him to show it openly his wife kalyani was the principal of a leading girls college in colombo before she retired from the public service his elder son harsha is a physician and younger son rajith is an economist like him his only daughter iresha is a sociologist he has an expanded family now with the three spouses of his children and five grandchildren added but one may also have to add to this number the pet dog that keeps watch over his car at the entrance to his house to make the family numbers complete w a wijewardena a former deputy governor of the central bank of sri lanka can be

the world turned a corner in 2019 the problem is that the world order didn t turn with it this disconnect could have disastrous consequences the biggest global change has been the start of the asian century today asia is home to three of the world s top four economic powers in purchasing power parity terms china india and japan the region s combined gdp exceeds that of the united states and of the european union the us is no longer even the most globalized power that title now goes to china already a larger trading partner to more countries than the us china is signing more free trade agreements as well including potentially the largest in history the regional comprehensive economic partnership the us by contrast has abandoned or is abandoning ftas such as the trans pacific partnership which japanese prime minister shinzo abe has kept alive without the us with a new name comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership and the us share of global trade continues to shrink the world order has not kept pace with these shifting economic dynamics on the contrary the us dollar remains the predominant currency for settling international trade the us and the eu retain control of the two leading global economic organizations the international monetary fund and the world bank and the united nations security council the only body that can issue binding decisions for the un s 193 member states is dominated by just a few largely declining powers in theory the easiest of these incongruities to address should be the inadequate influence of emerging powers such as china in the imf and the world bank after all the us and europe have already acknowledged including in the 2006 and 2007 g20 communiqués that the selection of senior management of the imf and world bank should be based on merit ensuring broad representation of all member countries yet the anachronistic gentlemen s agreement that has kept an american at the head of the world bank and a european leading the imf has proved stubbornly resilient in 2007 dominique strauss kahn became imf managing director succeeded by another french citizen christine lagarde in 2011 six years later lagarde declared that the imf could be based in beijing by 2027 if growth trends continue and are reflected in the imf s voting structure after all she noted the imf s bylaws call for the institution s head office to be located in the largest member economy yet when lagarde resigned from her post this year to become president of the european central bank it was another european who took her place bulgarian economist kristalina georgieva likewise the world bank presidency passed from robert zoellick to jim yong kim in 2012 and then to david malpass this year future historians will marvel at the imprudence of the old powers shameless refusal to share control of global institutions and yet the imf and the world bank are not the only institutions that need reform the un security council too needs to be reformed if the security council s composition is not updated the body could lose its credibility and moral authority to avert such an outcome perhaps the security council could adopt a 7 7 7 formula the first seven countries economies would be permanent members each representing a different region the second seven would be semi permanent members a rotating selection of 28 countries based on population and gnp the remaining 160 countries would rotate into the remaining seven seats the most difficult incongruity to resolve will be that between the us declining leadership and its currency s role as the leading international reserve currency today more than 40 percent of cross border payments and 90 percent of foreign exchange trading is settled in us dollars this reflects decades of trust the us had deep markets strong institutions including efficient courts and an independent central bank and it did not use the dollar as a tool to advance its own interests but since 2017 the us administration has been aggressively undermining the international community s trust in the dollar the white house has pressured the us federal reserve to lower interest rates in order to deliver short term economic growth in fact the white house has weaponized the dollar labeling china a currency manipulator and instructing the us treasury to put more countries including close asian and european allies under surveillance the us administration s actions have raised the hackles not only of traditional adversaries russia leads a new de dollarization trend but also of key allies jean claude juncker the former european commission president has pledged that the euro would become an active instrument of eu sovereignty it is also telling that france germany and the united kingdom in collaboration with china and russia have created the instrument in support of trade exchanges to bypass us sanctions on iran but in a sense the us administration has done the world a favor by making undeniable what was already obvious if world leaders do not start addressing the contradictions plaguing the world order soon the likely result is crisis and even more dangerous contradictions the writer a professor in the practice of public policy at the national university of singapore is the author of has the west lost it project syndicate the views don t necessarily reflect those of china daily
hacking the economy to determine an election is it happening on august 27th 2019 in an editorial published in bloomberg william dudley the former president of the federal reserve bank of new york did what had previously been considered unthinkable the foundation premise of the federal reserve is that it is supposed to be completely nonpartisan insulated from all political considerations however dudley wrote that donald trump was a threat to the federal reserve and the nation and urged fed officials to make decisions that would take into account the need to keep trump from being reelected the freezing up of the repurchase agreement repo market had nearly collapsed the u s financial system as one part of the financial crisis of 2008 however the market had enjoyed 11 years of relative calm since then three weeks after dudley s editorial during the week of september 16th 2019 the repo market returned to crisis mode and was likely saved only by emergency interventions on the part of the federal reserve a contributing factor was some major mistakes that were made by career officials at the new york fed dudley s former staff if the current related crises in the repurchase agreement market and with the funding of the national debt continue and get worse which is far from certain at this time crossing over into the wider markets interest rates and the economy it could become one of the defining political events of our lifetimes if the economy is in recession and the markets have crashed at the time of the november 2020 election then control of not only the presidency but likely the senate as well would be delivered to the democratic party this would give the democrats simultaneous control of the house senate and presidency during a time of financial emergency with a claim to a mandate which could very rapidly lead to some of the biggest political tax and economic changes of our lifetimes did a few career staff at the new york fed join the resistance and from the inside attempt a decisive strike to prevent donald trump from being reelected 3 weeks after being publicly called upon by their former boss to do so i am not going to attempt a definitive answer in this analysis as it likely can t be known with certainty by anyone except the insiders who were involved instead i will explore something that is little understood by the general public which is the extraordinary financial pressures that have created a situation where a few staff mistakes whether accidental or intentional could indeed change the economy the election and the values of everyone s retirement accounts and homes i will explore the sequence of what has been happening some interesting coincidences what is at stake and what the financial implications could be for individuals throughout i will always take two possibilities into account accidental mistakes versus deliberate intentions when the reader has finished this analysis you will have the information to make your own determination about which of those two you believe to be the more likely more details on the current crisis can be found in my analysis linked here the fed almost lost control of interest rates in a critical market and has since then relied on monetary creation just creating money effectively out of the nothingness though the actual process is much more complex to fund about 90 of u s government spending at very low interest rates and to thereby hold the economy stock and housing markets together the crisis has been escalating and the fed s emergency maneuvers have now reached the somewhat surreal point where up to 634 billion in new money will be created by the end of 2019 to prevent a potential deepening of this crisis that now threatens the financial system as explored in the analysis linked here i ve been analyzing and writing about related matters for years now and the speed with which this came up out of nowhere is almost surreal for comparison the total physical money outstanding in the united states as of january of 2008 before the financial crisis of that year was only 758 billion and the total assets of the federal reserve were less than 900 billion two valid explanations one of the issues with understanding what has been happening is that the rapid growth in the national debt has created so much pressure on the system that there are two perfectly valid explanations for what has been happening on the one hand there is the saying never ascribe to malice what can be explained by incompetence there is an enormous pressure on a very complex system and it grows every week month and year with the growth in the national debt we are in unchartered territory people make mistakes particularly with complex systems under enormous pressure and there is not one part of what has happened that can t be legitimately explained as an accident or well intended action one could even say that such an accident was almost inevitable at some point on the other hand what should be wildly speculative conspiracy theory isn t former new york fed president william dudley did quite publicly issue the provocative and unprecedented call for fed officials to prevent the reelection of trump that he did 3 weeks before the mistakes by his former staff helped to create a major crisis out of nowhere indeed as we will explore later in this analysis if the senior career staff executing monetary policy and understanding that complex system wanted to bring that system and the economy down from the inside without the knowledge and consent of the current federal reserve presidents and governors then three of the most critical places to strike are three places where critical operational mistakes were made during the week of september 16th in particular that is of course not definitive but it is one part of a series of interesting coincidences what both alternatives have in common is that neither one of them should exist in a normal healthy economy and financial system execution errors by senior staff should be of minor and fleeting consequence the big decisions are made by the federal open market committee and if there is a screw up at the staff level it could maybe lead to some issues for a week or even a month but there shouldn t be any lasting impact on the economy retirement account values home values or a presidential election the idea that career staffers could secretly do something that could bring down a robustly healthy economy or determine an election should be ludicrous under normal circumstances the underlying problem is that the fed s complex system for enabling the rapid growth of the national debt while keeping interest rates very low is under increasingly acute pressure as the debt grows and this introduces an element of fragility to the financial system and the economy that shouldn t be there it is this fragility that sets up this deeply abnormal situation where staff level mistakes whether accidental or intentional could actually materially change the direction of the markets and economy and thereby potentially determine the results of a presidential election it is this fragility that is the true cost of the 23 trillion national debt for the average american particularly when it comes to the currently elevated values of their retirement accounts and homes the rapid growth in the national debt is not some theoretical or purely political issue and the danger isn t just some potential default or bout of hyperinflation off in the distant future right now the federal reserve is on a weekly basis effectively creating 90 of the money to fund the government s deficit spending in the emergency attempt to contain crisis and if it fails the value of the retirement accounts and homes of the nation could be in grave peril within the coming year and even if the fed succeeds this time around the problem will still be there the pressure will continue to grow and the system will grow ever more fragile so long as the national debt continues to soar this analysis is part of a series of related analyses which support a book that is in the process of being written some key chapters from the book and an overview of the series are linked here a series of events 1 william dudley was president of the federal reserve bank of new york from january 27th 2009 through june 18th 2018 dudley was appointed by president obama in his first week in office which would seem to indicate that this was considered a politically vital appointment it should be noted that while there are twelve regional federal reserve banks they are not equal in their powers because the new york fed implements open market operations while regulating wall street itself it has a disproportionate degree of power and the president of the new york fed is widely considered the second most powerful person in the federal reserve after only the chairman 2 on august 27th 2019 dudley wrote an editorial in bloomberg link below saying that for the good of the nation the federal reserve should refuse to enable president trump or try to prevent the damage from the trade war from harming the economy he explicitly called for the fed to make decisions on a political basis saying that being apolitical was now untenable i understand and support fed officials desire to remain apolitical but trump s ongoing attacks on powell and on the institution have made that untenable dudley closed his opinion piece with the extraordinary paragraph below which seems to say that trump is a threat to the u s global economy and therefore the correct monetary policy for fed officials is for the federal reserve to treat the possibility of trump s reelection as a threat and to consider how their decisions will affect the political outcome in 2020 there s even an argument that the election itself falls within the fed s purview after all trump s reelection arguably presents a threat to the u s and global economy to the fed s independence and its ability to achieve its employment and inflation objectives if the goal of monetary policy is to achieve the best long term economic outcome then fed officials should consider how their decisions will affect the political outcome in 2020 note that dudley didn t reference the federal reserve governors or presidents taking formal action but simply for fed officials to take this into account when making decisions 3 staff at the federal reserve made a major mistake that was unprecedented in the post 2008 era they were well aware that the treasury planned to pull out more than 100 billion in cash from the financial system in a day on monday september 16th which would reduce the liquidity in the system however they thought that there was 200 to 300 billion in extra liquidity in the system per morgan stanley via the wall street journal so they took no precautions 4 on september 16th 17th about 3 weeks after dudley s advice to fed officials it turned out that a major mistake had been made there was not plenty of excess liquidity to handle the payments to the treasury and in the repo market there was a shortage of funds available on september 17th rates spiked upwards from around 2 up to as high as little below 10 very briefly creating an emergency situation 5 the initial attempt to create liquidity failed as a result of a staff mistake an execution error at the new york fed and repo loans had to be withdrawn and then reoffered later that day adding to the market turmoil 6 there were a series of oversubscriptions in the following weeks as the fed failed to provide sufficient liquidity to the market and the cash they injected into the markets rose from 75 billion up to over 200 billion 7 in october the federal reserve reversed course and began purchasing 60 billion per month in short term treasury obligations with created money thereby freeing the private market from doing so and helping to keep excess cash in the system 8 on december 12th the fed announced plans to offer up to 415 billion in repo lending to get the banking system through the end of the year in combination with treasury obligation purchases this took the total up to about 634 billion in commitments for funding all using created money and all either directly or indirectly funding the growth in the national debt 9 in a separate and unusual move on december 12th 2019 the federal reserve bank of new york announced major senior management changes in their markets and financial services groups simultaneously naming three new executive vice presidents to head key departments that actually implement financial and monetary operations the hack the potential damage the above may sound a bit on the technical side for many people and they may not see the implications for their own lives we live in a complex world full of complex technology complex systems and complex organizations because no one can understand everything we must place trust in things that we don t fully understand and this very much applies to the federal reserve the economy the national debt the value of retirement accounts the value of homes and even the very nature and value of money itself to understand how a few technical mistakes at the new york fed could indeed change all of our lives we need to understand several interrelated issues we have had very low interest rates for a number of years now and this is particularly true of the time since the financial crisis of 2008 for seven years thereafter the federal reserve forced zero percent interest rates on the nation in the attempt to contain the damage and get the economy going again interest rates rose a little bit but have consistently been far below historic averages and have rapidly been forced back down by 0 75 since july in the attempt to prevent a recession the above graph shows long term asset prices and valuations and how the averages since 2000 are far higher than in previous decades inflation adjusted home prices for comparable homes are up by 32 the price that investors pay for each dollar of corporate earnings is up by 49 and the price for a 10 year bond is up by 34 the graph just puts numbers on what most people are already quite well aware of we currently have the highest home and stock prices in history if we take stock prices bond prices and real estate prices then we also get most of the value of most retirement accounts what is understood by professionals in the area but less so by the general public is that the very low interest rates and the very high asset prices are two sides of the same coin the graphs above are from chapter one link here from a free book that i have been writing and what the book explores in much greater detail than can be covered in this one analysis is how the federal reserve forcing interest rates to record lows has led to the highest retirement account values and home prices that the nation has seen the flip side of this relationship is that if interest rates should rise substantially then home prices and retirement account values should plummet and if interest rates stay higher then there is no particular reason to expect a recovery so a homeowner could be underwater for many years with a house worth less than they paid for it and a retirement account investor could spend a decade in retirement without equity prices recovering to where they had been in inflation adjusted terms what could push up interest rates we have a rather enormous problem with the national debt which has recently passed 23 trillion and is now larger than the total u s economy that is borrowed money which has to come from somewhere and interest payments have to be made on that debt as i have written about extensively in the past heavily indebted nations require very low interest rates and the federal reserve creating very low interest rates has been the critical enabler that has allowed the u s national debt to grow as fast and as large as it has the dangerous part for the economy retirement accounts and home values is not so much the outstanding national debt but the deficits the weekly monthly and annual borrowing that the federal government is doing to cover spending that is above tax collections this is not at all theoretical but is real cash at the time the government spends it every bit as real as the money in your retirement account or checking account indeed if you are a federal government employee or if your employer relies on dollars from the federal government to pay you then your standard of living is to a large part supported by the federal government pulling the cash out of the financial system to make your paycheck there is a fantastic degree of pressure that is building when it comes to the conflict between the very low interest rates that retirement account values home values and the affordability of the national debt are all dependent upon and what can be seen in the graph above of the official deficit projections from the congressional budget office we just had a trillion dollar deficit for the last year and they are projected to continue for each and every year of the next ten years all that cash has to come out of the financial system and ultimately the u s economy unless the debt is being monetized i e being paid with created money as has recently been the case in a market based financial system steadily higher interest rates should have to be paid which traditionally then acts a brake on deficit spending and the growth of the national debt however those materially higher interest rates would also crash the stock bond and housing markets while sending the economy into a potentially deep recession what stands between the higher interest rates that a federal government voraciously sucking cash out of the system should trigger and the very low interest rates that the economy and markets currently depend upon is the federal reserve standing in the middle with its vast but little understood powers in a complex process that involves creating trillions of dollars of new money quantitative easing to keep interest rates low asset prices high the economy holding together and a rapidly expanding national debt funded at interest rates far lower than what rational investors would accept in a free market most importantly pressure is created at a rapid rate with the rapid growth in the national debt this can be thought of as a sort of ratcheting mechanism every week for the next ten years on average the federal government plans to pull another 20 billion in real cash out of the financial system without paying a free market interest rate which means that investors have to be forced to effectively fund the national debt at lower rates than they what they want this is an unnatural process and with each weekly ratchet the difference between what works for the government and what works for investors grows and so does the pressure on the complex systems deployed by the fed that maintains an artificial stability this process has been underway for many years and an extraordinary degree of pressure has already built up even as the pressure continues to build with each year of trillion dollar deficits as the pressure has built the chances for a mistake being made that would cause the fed to lose control and the markets to crash has steadily built as will as the pressure builds the size of the needed mistake that would crash the markets steadily grows a bit smaller each month and each year as the margin for error steadily shrinks as the pressure builds if we assume what is supposed to be unthinkable but is in fact a matter of publicly stated intent and desire the less it would take for an insider who knows how the mechanism works and is in a place to do something about it to subtly but deliberately sabotage the very complex mechanism in a way that could likely never be proven or understood at all by the average voter three pins that resist the pressure hold everything together when you come right down to it what holds everything together right now underneath all the complexity of the ratcheting system is three fairly basic and closely related things very low interest rates confidence that the markets are running smoothly and the market s confidence that the federal reserve has the situation completely under control should interest rates soar then a trap door opens up and the current very elevated values of the nation s stocks bonds retirement accounts and homes could all plunge downwards should the markets lose confidence in the federal reserve s ability to maintain both financial stability and very low interest rates then the way markets work is that they price in today what their expectations are for the future and if confidence is lost on a widespread basis that trap door can open up almost instantly in a matter of hours days or weeks a related but distinct problem with confidence is the lack of fear among market participants if fear gets started then it becomes self fulfilling and the fear of crisis causes an actual crisis this can particularly be a problem with liquidity the free cash floating around the system in search of an overnight home and it has been the most dangerous part of many previous crises for months and years there is lots of extra money floating around as lenders are eager to lend then one day something happens a number of lenders get nervous at the same time and they each decide to get cautious and stop lending this was covered in more detail in chapter 18 link here but a number of borrowers who were depending on the availability of the loans and had invested the money they had borrowed all of a sudden find as a group that they are hundreds of billions of dollars short of the money they need to repay their overnight loans which are due later that same day if they don t get the money they will default only nobody is willing to lend it to them bam interest rates spike upwards as they frantically seek cash instant crisis then seeing an actual crisis in process the lenders get even more nervous lend even less and the crisis gets still worse in some ways this could be likened to a form of a bank run the classic source of banking system collapse money is borrowed from depositors and invested too many people get nervous and demand their money back at the same time enough money isn t there because it has been invested the bank fails and the doors of a previously healthy bank are locked that same day a version of this when the repo market locked up in 2008 was one of the key risks that nearly brought down the entire financial system and the federal reserve had to create over 400 billion in a week to save the system in the first use of quantitative easing in the united states for the next eleven years while there were some interesting spots for the professionals in the market there were no emergencies in the repo market and the fed didn t have to intervene then the week of september 16th 2019 something happened the lenders fled borrowers were in crisis and the federal reserve would create 50 billion then 75 billion then 200 billion and then by december of 2019 announced a willingness to create up to 415 billion in new money to lend it out in the repo market thereby indirectly funding the growth of the u s national debt and also preventing a potential deep crisis in the financial system so if we take the hypothetical case of someone who really truly understands this complex system and its weaknesses such as dudley and his former staffers and pose the question how to bring it down with the least effort and in a way that can never be proven then a particularly effective answer would be a swift tap tap directed against two of the vital pins that hold the whole complex mechanism together the very low interest rates and the market s confidence that the federal reserve has the situation completely under control interestingly enough the mistakes first manifested themselves as an enormous spike upwards in interest rates from under 2 to almost 10 ver briefly in the systemically important repurchase agreement market and a series of awkward stumbles in execution that would make a person question whether the federal reserve had the situation under control at all tap tap going straight at two of the most important pins that were holding all the pressure back or at least the two of the most important pins that could be accessed by senior staffers without the approval of the federal reserve bank presidents and board of governors and while maintaining plausible deniability the most important question however is the origins of something happened this much is clear a major mistake was made by the fed it got the numbers spectacularly wrong on the amount of excess liquidity in the system and when the treasury department took out 100 billion in cash to fund government spending a crisis was set off this crisis created the fear loop lenders pulled back borrowers needed help the situation got worse and the fed kept increasing its interventions hopefully the fed will reestablish control but as of late december the numbers were still climbing as the federal reserve struggles to get the situation under control it has at least temporarily replaced its former complex and subtle system for making sure the deficits could be funded without raising interest rates with a form of blunt force as shown in the graph repeated above the federal reserve is effectively just creating the money to fund the government deficits week by week just taking the very low interest rates for itself and not attempting to make private investors do that in order to avoid risking failure indeed what the fed is doing by throwing so much newly created money at the markets up to 634 billion in 16 weeks is trying to make sure that no matter how fast the treasury is pulling cash out of the system there will be enough new free cash floating around that interest rates do not spike upwards so does the striking of the two pins and the major mistake on the amount of liquidity in the system mean that this is necessarily deliberate absolutely not as discussed in the beginning of this analysis this can all be explained on an innocent basis there is enormous pressure and complexity this is unchartered territory people screw up all the time and the staff at the new york fed could have been completely blindsided by the blowup of the repo market and could have then found themselves over their heads unable to keep up with events as they rapidly developed that said if someone who actually understood how this very complex system works were to be writing a novel about it or making an action plan striking those two weak spots while setting a fear based crisis in motion would be the absolutely perfect way to hit a system that was under great pressure so that what still might or might not become an economic crisis would happen before the 2020 election instead of after these would also be the exact places to strike if the plot or the plan required senior career staff to strike the blows with plausible deniability and without the knowledge or consent of the current political appointees at the federal reserve who are supposed to control such matters the theory that underlies the federal reserve and our economic system is that because the president of the federal reserve bank of new york is in charge of executing monetary policy something which can change the economy and elections that person is supposed to be scrupulously nonpartisan entirely above the fray acting only for the good of the entire nation for william dudley to publicly destroy that mantle of nonpartisanship and publish via bloomberg a call for fed officials to make decisions to affect the 2020 election with the goal of preventing the reelection of trump and then a mere three weeks later after eleven years of relative calm in the repo markets with nothing like this happening have his own former senior career staff make serious mistaken decisions that then triggered a massive repo market crisis is an astonishing coincidence now that doesn t prove that it isn t a coincidence but the timing is remarkable the perfect political kill shot so why would a prominent but clearly partisan economist such as william dudley advocate for fed officials to use their power in a way that could change the election results the reason is that it could be a perfect political kill shot something that could not only guarantee who wins in 2020 but that could change american politics for a generation or more trump is running for reelection primarily on the strength of the economy and the markets if the average voter in november of 2020 is looking at a raging national recession widespread unemployment devastating damage to their retirement accounts and having lost a big chunk of their net worth with the plunge in home prices how is that likely to impact the election trump is only the starting point the issue is that very few people fully understand what is discussed in this analysis oh economists like william dudley understand it perfectly well and what the consequences would be for the nation but the average person not so much so let s say this or another sophisticated form of economic sabotage from the inside were to work the average person would be facing devastating economic losses and possibly unemployment as well they wouldn t actually know anything about where any of this came from but they would know it was real they would know it was awful and life changing and wherever they turned they would be continually told who did it to them if i might be allowed to hypothesize that the media would not be strictly neutral but might actually have a preference as to who is president then the average person would be told 24 7 via television newspapers and social media just who is responsible for their pain and the destruction of their dreams and it wouldn t just be trump but the senators and representatives who supported him as well as his supporters in general in such a circumstance with so much economic pain and so much agreement as to the source then something much bigger than just beating trump becomes not only possible but downright likely control of the presidency the senate and the house in a time of national economic emergency and with the claim of a mandate from the people for massive change a series of radical economic tax and political changes like the nation has never seen could happen in months things that might seem improbable right now could become quite possible in a time of national emergency a mandate and a lack of checks and balances what makes it the perfect political kill shot is that almost nobody would ever know particularly if control over the narrative is maintained most of the people whose lives employment financial security and standard of living were severely harmed by the deliberate sabotage would go to their graves blaming the wrong side and being absolutely convinced that the source of their personal pain was donald trump again does the potential outcome prove that there was a deliberate strategy to make it happen no that can t be proven from this information and it remains true that everything can be explained by the combination of complexity pressure and normal human errors however if someone were writing a novel or action plan about how to use the little understood and supposedly nonpartisan federal reserve to take down a sitting president who is running based on a thriving economy this would be a potentially quite effective means of doing so it would be far more reliable than impeachment when it comes to not just to removing trump but to taking the senate as well with the accompanying vast potential increase in power when the presidency senate and house are all controlled at the same time whether the source is accidental or intentional the price for the nation would be enormous either way the consequences of what has been explored herein could be a life defining event particularly for retirees and for those who are near to retirement and this would apply regardless of their political affiliation the personal but universal price for a nation there are very good reasons why the federal reserve is supposed to in theory be completely nonpartisan and above politics deliberately tilting the economy into a recession in a way that voters would not understand and thereby determining the results of a presidential election is arguably always within the capabilities of the federal reserve although it should be much harder to do than it would be in our current circumstances of fragility and should require the coordinated efforts of a majority of the voting members of the federal open market committee fomc and not just a few senior staffers the issue with the weaponization of the federal reserve to win elections is that while it may have a political appeal to the party seeking power the costs to the nation as a whole are enormous and they are bipartisan a recession and potential market crash reaches out and hits everybody it can hurt many millions of people some of them quite badly and it does not discriminate on the basis of political affiliation i do believe that there are people in the world who if they had the power to do so would without hesitation trigger a recession and crash the markets if the bad people of the other side would be smashed into the ground and their side would come into power with overwhelming control of the powers of the government if they thought about the cost to the average person at all they might say that a year of recession and a couple of down years in the markets would be totally worth it and for the good of the nation so long as the awful people are thrown out and the correct thinking people take control based on his editorial this seems to be dudley s rationale even though he has to be fully aware of the costs however the risk is far more dangerous than an average recession and bear market specifically because of the very factors that have created the fragility that makes some minor issues how the fed conducts operations on a given day or in a given week able to potentially influence elections one source of extraordinary risk is what was previously explored our current very low level of interest rates and the resulting very elevated asset prices for stocks bonds and homes a fall from historically elevated asset prices is not a normal downturn or bear market instead the damage could be far worse it could be very long lasting and it could change many millions of lives and standards of living as an illustration in the analysis linked here i set up a hypothetical investor with a round number million dollar net worth 800 000 in retirement accounts with a 75 25 stock bond allocation and a 500 000 house with a 300 000 mortgage the idea behind the even 1 million was to make it very easy to multiply and adapt for one s own situation if we returned merely to long term averages then the losses from today s very high asset prices are shown above in step 2 this would include about 200 000 in stock losses 50 000 in bond losses 120 000 in home losses and a total loss in net worth of 370 000 for someone with 500 000 in assets it might be a 185 000 loss when we start with today s record or near record stock bond and home prices as shown in step 1 subtract the losses associated with a mere regression to the mean or return to average as shown in step 2 then we get what is shown in step 3 above what a round number net worth of 1 million today would be worth if we merely had average valuations in inflation adjusted terms it would be down to about 630 000 let me suggest that if someone was planning on supporting themselves for potentially decades in retirement based on their retirement accounts and home values today then a mere return to average could be quite life changing when it comes to their annual standard of living in retirement as well as their financial security when it comes to handling unexpected expenses or health events it should also be noted that what is shown above is in no way a worst case scenario because about half of long term history is of prices that are below the long term averages so if a crisis were to hit our current historically high asset prices then they might go well below what is shown above and then hopefully recover over time if the eventual recovery involved a return to long term average interest rates as well as to long term average valuations for stock pe ratios bond prices and inflation adjusted home prices then the result would be step 3 above again the fundamental conflicts and dangers are here anyway the question is if what is underway now does become a full blown crisis that spreads into the stock and housing markets as well as the economy itself it may not hopefully it will not and the most interesting part of all as explored in chapter one and throughout the rest of the book that i m currently still writing is that there is a very good chance that if the fed reestablishes full control it will use still lower interest rates to achieve economic stability and if that happens those still lower interest rates in a stable economy could create still higher stock prices than today possibly materially so and the same is true for home prices the nation does not have elevated stock and home prices in spite of the unnaturally low interest rates that the federal reserve imposed to contain the financial crisis of 2008 but specifically because of those artificially low interest rates we have never had anything close to average interest rates since 2008 and asset prices that are well above historic averages are the direct result counterintuitive as it may seem the containment of the problems with the national debt could lead to still higher stock and home prices for a while however that would just further increase the fundamental pressure the clash between an even larger national debt and even lower interest rates this would make the system ever more fragile and the stability of the value of retirement accounts and homes ever more fragile if that path is the path ahead then it would make much of the nation potentially very happy for a good while even happier than they are today until they weren t providing information not conclusions this is a very unusual analysis for me and i struggled a bit in terms of whether to write it and release it i m a financial analyst not a political analyst i am well aware that i have plenty of readers from both parties and i try to keep politics out of things once again i did not draw any firm conclusions there are some fascinating and troubling things going on but the only people who can know for sure are those insiders who participated in these events or have other insider knowledge the first reason for my deciding to release this analysis is that politics and human nature are ultimately the most likely sources of what could break down this complex system that is coming under ever increasing pressure and likely bring down today s highly elevated asset prices at least in inflation adjusted terms this is true regardless of the specifics of the source of what is in process right now there are limitations to that very complex process at least in its current form but i doubt that those theoretical limits are ever reached the bigger issue is that the larger the national debt gets the greater the pressure the more fragile the system becomes and the more vulnerable it becomes to international geopolitics international financial system risk domestic political risk and perhaps the biggest risk of all human error or possibly though hopefully not malfeasance or sabotage if someone sees something to be gained in terms of a great deal of wealth a great deal of political power or both hopefully the current crisis will be contained the economy will not crash and neither will stock or home prices but even if this desired outcome does happen the growth in the debt over the next year will make the system that much more fragile as will the growth in the national debt in the year after that the greater the fragility of this highly complex system the greater the exposure to political forces and human error and the greater the exposure of the economy and the value of everyone s retirement accounts and homes my second reason for deciding to release this information is that this is such a complicated and specialized area that relatively few people understand how the parts fit together in terms of how this could have been done if it was done how it could determine the election results and how it could end up being a determining factor when it comes to the standard of living in retirement that may in practice be experienced by many millions of people as the result of many years of study and research in closely related areas it happens that i do something that just kept coming back to me as i was wrestling with whether to prepare and release this analysis was that possessing this background professional knowledge was actually a quite separate thing from making the determination of what was believable or not when it comes to such things as motivations coincidences and how politics works in general it occurred to me that if i decided not to release then i would effectively be making the decision for others that none of those millions of people would have the information needed to make their own evaluations about something that could be one of the most important political and financial events of their lives that would be quite the presumption on my part maybe the better choice given just how important this might be was to just try to explain what i know and why it matters give two fair alternatives not draw any conclusions and then let people make their own evaluations so now you know the rest if anything at all is up to you learn

governments often influence the economy through fiscal and monetary policy a central bank such as the federal reserve in the united states typically sets monetary policy national governments like the u s congress may decide fiscal policy learn the key components of fiscal vs monetary policy here monetary policy in the united states the federal reserve sets and manages monetary policy and uses it to influence the economy monetary policy generally encourages growth or slows inflation by managing money supply and demand in other countries central banks regulatory authorities and the international monetary fund steer the monetary policy of other countries monetary policy affects many aspects of a country s economy from interest rates to the stock market however its effects can last for generations the federal reserve decides whether to expand or contract the economy based on factors such as the gross domestic product gdp inflation and the unemployment rate stimulating the economy is designed to raise the gdp meanwhile more restrictive monetary policy is designed to slow the economy to offset inflation either in the present or the future the federal reserve has a variety of tools to affect monetary policy for example the fed wants to increase inflation it will put more money in circulation if the fed wants to decrease inflation it will take money out of circulation fed monetary policy tools the federal reserve has a number of tools at its disposal for influencing monetary policy below are just a few examples the discount rate this is the interest rate that the fed charges for short term loans to commercial banks and other institutions during the financial crisis in 2008 the fed lowered the rate to help out the banks interest on reserves the fed can use this to either encourage or discourage banks to lend money this is interest paid to banks by the federal reserves on the money the banks have with them when the fed lowers the interest rate banks are incentivized to lend out more money as a result they can make more money by lending it out than by keeping it with the fed when the fed raises the interest rate banks are encouraged to increase their reserves they can make more money that way reserve requirement this is how much banks and financial institutions are obligated to hold in reserve relative to customer deposits this is determined by the fed if the reserve requirement increases it decreases the money supply in the economy and potentially inflation as well if the reserve requirement decreases it increases the money supply in the economy open market operations omo this is when the fed buys or sells government securities to expand or contract the market buying treasuries will expand the market by putting new money into the hands of individuals and corporations selling treasuries will contract the market by putting money into government funds or reserves quantitative easing this is another tool that the fed used during the 2008 financial crisis it and other central banks reduced interest rates to nearly 0 and made very large open market purchases this was intended to try to get consumers to take out more loans and buy more expensive items like household appliances cars and houses the goal was to grow the economy and get it out of the recession fiscal policy here s a closer look at fiscal vs monetary policy fiscal policy involves the taxes the government collects and how much money it spends in the united states congress controls fiscal policy the goal of most government fiscal policy is to target the total level of spending the total composition of spending or both the two most common ways of affecting fiscal policy are changes in government spending policies or tax policies tax cuts and spending increases are expected to stimulate economic growth in the short run while tax increases and spending cuts are generally expected to slow future economic expansion and inflation if the government wants more business activity in the economy it will increase the amount of money it spends in order to stimulate the economy this is often referred to as stimulus spending if not enough in taxes has been collected in order to pay for the spending increase the government can borrow money by issuing debt securities like government bonds that is deficit spending and it is a way that a government can accumulate debt the government might also cut taxes in order to increase spending if people have more money they will generally spend more money which will increase business activity expansionary fiscal policy can risk sparking inflation which means the value of your income initially decreases until your company gives you a raise or permanently decreases your income if you are on a fixed income fiscal policy motivation if a government wants to lower business activity in the economy it can raise taxes this pulls money out of the economy and as a result slows business activity

here s a closer look at fiscal vs monetary policy governments often influence the economy through fiscal and monetary policy a central bank such as the federal reserve in the united states typically sets monetary policy national governments like the u s congress may decide fiscal policy learn the key components of fiscal vs monetary policy here monetary policy in the united states the federal reserve sets and manages monetary policy and uses it to influence the economy monetary policy generally encourages growth or slows inflation by managing money supply and demand in other countries central banks regulatory authorities and the international monetary fund steer the monetary policy of other countries monetary policy affects many aspects of a country s economy from interest rates to the stock market however its effects can last for generations advertisement advertisement the federal reserve decides whether to expand or contract the economy based on factors such as the gross domestic product gdp inflation and the unemployment rate stimulating the economy is designed to raise the gdp meanwhile more restrictive monetary policy is designed to slow the economy to offset inflation either in the present or the future the federal reserve has a variety of tools to affect monetary policy for example the fed wants to increase inflation it will put more money in circulation if the fed wants to decrease inflation it will take money out of circulation fed monetary policy tools the federal reserve has a number of tools at its disposal for influencing monetary policy below are just a few examples advertisement advertisement the discount rate this is the interest rate that the fed charges for short term loans to commercial banks and other institutions during the financial crisis in 2008 the fed lowered the rate to help out the banks interest on reserves the fed can use this to either encourage or discourage banks to lend money this is interest paid to banks by the federal reserves on the money the banks have with them when the fed lowers the interest rate banks are incentivized to lend out more money as a result they can make more money by lending it out than by keeping it with the fed when the fed raises the interest rate banks are encouraged to increase their reserves they can make more money that way story continues reserve requirement this is how much banks and financial institutions are obligated to hold in reserve relative to customer deposits this is determined by the fed if the reserve requirement increases it decreases the money supply in the economy and potentially inflation as well if the reserve requirement decreases it increases the money supply in the economy open market operations omo this is when the fed buys or sells government securities to expand or contract the market buying treasuries will expand the market by putting new money into the hands of individuals and corporations selling treasuries will contract the market by putting money into government funds or reserves advertisement advertisement quantitative easing this is another tool that the fed used during the 2008 financial crisis it and other central banks reduced interest rates to nearly 0 and made very large open market purchases this was intended to try to get consumers to take out more loans and buy more expensive items like household appliances cars and houses the goal was to grow the economy and get it out of the recession fiscal policy here s a closer look at fiscal vs monetary policy fiscal policy involves the taxes the government collects and how much money it spends in the united states congress controls fiscal policy the goal of most government fiscal policy is to target the total level of spending the total composition of spending or both the two most common ways of affecting fiscal policy are changes in government spending policies or tax policies tax cuts and spending increases are expected to stimulate economic growth in the short run while tax increases and spending cuts are generally expected to slow future economic expansion and inflation advertisement advertisement if the government wants more business activity in the economy it will increase the amount of money it spends in order to stimulate the economy this is often referred to as stimulus spending if not enough in taxes has been collected in order to pay for the spending increase the government can borrow money by issuing debt securities like government bonds that is deficit spending and it is a way that a government can accumulate debt the government might also cut taxes in order to increase spending if people have more money they will generally spend more money which will increase business activity expansionary fiscal policy can risk sparking inflation which means the value of your income initially decreases until your company gives you a raise or permanently decreases your income if you are on a fixed income fiscal policy motivation if a government wants to lower business activity in the economy it can raise taxes this pulls money out of the economy and as a result slows business activity however this only applies to lower income earners the amount the wealthy pay in taxes doesn t typically encourage economic growth high income earners spend much less for every tax dollar saved than low income earners in addition governments typically use fiscal policy to stimulate the economy not to slow down the economy however fiscal policy is not always based on economic considerations fiscal policy may help or hurt

opinion the year 2019 marks a memorable period in the history of african trade with the entry into force of the african continental free trade agreement afcfta the agreement establishes the largest free trade area in the world since the creation of the world trade organisation in 1995 afcfta will cover more than 1 2 billion people and over 3 trillion in gdp it creates a myriad of opportunities for entrepreneurs across the continent and has the potential to enhance competitiveness promote industrial development through diversification and regional value chain development as well as sustainable socio economic development and structural transformation
at the start of 2019 we said that we were bullish on the stock market but that there were numerous risks that would cap the pse index s upside to 8 600 while the arguments for why we were bullish proved to be correct the impact of the risks that we highlighted plus some more proved to be much worse than expected hurting foreign fund flows and sentiment for philippine equities as a result the psei ended 2019 higher by only 4 7 to close at 7 815 26 here are some of the positive developments that should have pushed the philippine stock market much higher in 2019 advertisement falling inflation after peaking at 6 7 percent in october of 2018 inflation has been on a downtrend in 2019 thanks to lower rice prices lower oil prices and tightening measures implemented by the central bank in the second half of 2018 in the first eleven months of 2019 the average inflation rate was 2 5 percent much lower than the 5 2 percent average inflation rate for 2018 falling interest rates largely due to falling inflation interest rates declined sharply the 10 year bond rate fell to 4 5 percent as of end 2019 which is even lower than its end 2017 level of 5 1 percent moreover the bsp loosened its monetary policy by cutting its benchmark rate by 75 basis points and reducing banks reserve requirement ratio by a total of 400 basis points strong economic growth after averaging only 5 5 percent in in the fist half gdp growth recovered in the third quarter reaching 6 2 percent growth picked up due to the recovery of consumer spending which suffered from poor consumer confidence in the first half and the rebound of government spending which suffered from the delayed passage of the budget and election spending ban in the first half cheap valuations at the start of 2019 the psei was trading at only 15 6x p e well below its historical average of 17 6x at the said level the implied earnings yield was 6 4 percent higher than the 10 year bond yield of 5 1 percent stronger peso finally the peso strengthened instead of weakening much to everyone s surprise recall that the peso depreciated sharply in 2018 because of the government s aggressive infrastructure spending program which led to a higher budget deficit and the current account deficit given the government s plan to continuously increase infrastructure spending in 2019 everyone was bracing for the peso to depreciate however because of the government s underspending caused by the delayed passage of the budget and the surprise drop of interest rates globally the peso strengthened to end the year at 50 84 to 1 from 52 59 to 1 as of end 2018 on the other hand here are the negative developments that hurt the performance of the philippine stock market in 2019 worsening us china trade war at the start of the year the consensus view was that the us and china would come up with a trade deal in 2019 however in may the us surprisingly announced that it would resume with tariff increases and impose even more tariffs on chinese goods china retaliated by imposing more tariffs on american goods the heightened uncertainty brought about by the worsening trade tension between the two countries hurt business confidence prompting a lot of companies to hold back on their investments negatively affecting global economic growth appetite for riskier assets such as emerging market stocks including the philippines was also negatively affected prompting most investors to shift to safe haven assets such as us sovereign bonds and gold advertisement heightened regulatory risk the philippine government s recent decision to revoke the extension of manila water and maynilad s water concession from 2022 to 2037 highlights the increasing level of regulatory risk in the country as a result even though our economic growth prospect is very attractive and valuations of stocks are cheap concerns that the government can change regulations and provisions of contracts anytime is causing investors to stay away especially from buying shares of companies that belong to highly regulated industries consequently although several emerging markets already started to go up during the past few weeks the psei has decoupled and continues to lag next year should be better for the philippine stock market given favorable domestic economic conditions attractive valuations of stocks and the signing of the first phase of the trade deal between the u s and china however it remains to be seen whether investors will choose to ignore the heightened regulatory risk given everything else that is working in favor of the philippines

democratic presidential candidate former vice president joe biden speaks at williamsburg high school friday dec 27 2019 in williamsburg iowa kelsey kremer the des moines register via ap in 2019 democrats running for president announced a slate of multitrillion dollar proposals aimed at transforming the country and combating the economic and social ills they blame for giving rise to president donald trump but as the year comes to a close the mounting price tag of those plans has become a point of contention between the liberal and moderate wings of the party no one inside the beltway seems to ask how much the status quo costs sen bernie sanders i vt wrote thursday on twitter defending his proposals by citing estimates of deaths caused by air pollution and a lack of health care we have the resources and a moral obligation to pass medicare for all and a green new deal sanders agenda would cost more than 50 trillion over 10 years more than the plans of any other democratic candidate like the others he would pay for his plans by raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy as democrats seek to appeal to a broad swath of voters candidates are airing proposals that include government supported health care and child care free college student loan forgiveness transformative climate policies massive pay raises for teachers and a universal basic income among others a washington post review of the major spending proposals of the leading democratic presidential candidates found 10 year costs ranging from about 4 trillion to more than 50 trillion the annual federal budget now is about 4 5 trillion even the most sparse of the 2020 plans dwarfs what successful democrats pushed before as she seized the democratic nomination in 2016 hillary clinton proposed a 10 year agenda estimated at 1 45 trillion according to the committee for a responsible federal budget the rapidly rising price tags and expansive reach of the current plans has led to charges of socialism from republicans but in recent weeks more moderate democrats have been the most vocal critics of their liberal colleagues spending plans on issue after issue we ve got to break out of the washington mind set that measures the bigness of an idea by how many trillions of dollars it adds to the budget or the boldness of an idea by how many fellow americans it can antagonize south bend ind mayor pete buttigieg said during the democratic presidential debate this month in los angeles sen amy klobuchar d minn who has said her priority as president would be a 1 trillion infrastructure program has questioned the practicality of her competitors more expensive proposals where i disagree is i just don t think anyone has a monopoly on bold ideas she said during the debate i think you can be progressive and practical at the same time the post analysis focused only on the broad categories of health care housing the environment criminal justice education child care and other anti poverty initiatives using self reported estimates from the campaigns of the candidates leading nationally and in early states sanders buttigieg former vice president joe biden and sen elizabeth warren d mass the review found a shared desire to strengthen the social safety net enlarge the federal government and reduce inequality but each arrived at different ways of doing so with varying price tags sanders for example would increase minimum salaries for teachers to 60 000 and provide free breakfast and lunch to every public school student in the country as part of an agenda that tops 51 trillion over 10 years among a set of plans with a total 10 year cost exceeding 30 trillion warren proposes subsidizing child care for almost all americans and reducing rental costs nationwide by 10 percent biden s agenda a more moderate set of proposals costing more than 4 1 trillion over 10 years calls for tripling funding at low income schools and making community college free buttigieg who unveiled a 1 1 trillion 10 year economic plan in november now has spelled out more than 5 5 trillion in federal initiatives he has criticized warren and sanders for their free college programs that would provide a universal benefit regardless of income trump has seized on the democrats spending proposals and led the gop characterization of them as socialists he has warned that the true outcome of democrats plans would be higher taxes they say we re going to give away your health care we re going to do free education we re going to cut student loan debt down to nothing trump said in september during a speech to the house republican conference in baltimore everything is given away yet trump signed a 1 4 trillion spending bill this month that will add more red ink to the record 23 trillion national debt republicans signature legislative achievement under trump a massive 2017 tax cut whose benefits skewed toward corporations and the wealthy has helped pushed the annual federal deficit past 1 trillion but many republicans following trump s lead have largely abandoned the concerns about debt and deficits they expressed during former president barack obama s tenure democrats have likewise felt free to sidestep discussions about the 23 trillion national debt during their primary contest said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics the fetters around fiscal responsibility have been thrown off said zandi who has analyzed the spending plans of several democratic presidential candidates there s no real political constituency for fiscal discipline either on the republican or democratic side indeed several trailing democratic candidates have like klobuchar and biden been critical of the spending surge but have found voters largely shrugging off their concerns other lower polling candidates in the historically large primary also have built their candidacies around costly and ambitious initiatives entrepreneur andrew yang has backed a universal basic income of 12 000 per year for every american adult which he estimated would cost 2 4 trillion per year or 24 trillion over 10 years he has also proposed giving 100 in democracy dollars for every american voter to use to participate in the political system sen cory booker d n j has proposed baby bonds for every newborn several candidates have expressed openness to the idea of providing reparations to the descendants of enslaved americans for his part trump has boasted at rallies about spending trillions of dollars on the military and giving more than 28 billion in payouts to farmers affected by the trade war he sparked with china and other countries speaking to a conservative group in west palm beach florida on dec 21 trump praised his administration for securing more than 2 5 trillion in military spending dismissing the idea that the increased funding had added to the growing budget deficit let me tell you about budgets i m a big budget person but when it comes to the military there is no budget he said in his 2016 campaign trump differed from other republicans by brushing aside proposals to curb social security and medicare spending which members of his party had long argued were necessary to halt runaway deficits he has pledged to get serious about fiscal discipline and reducing the deficit if reelected but his campaign has not put forward a plan to cut spending democrats have said trump s 2016 election and the policies he s pursued while in office require bold countermeasures that will level the playing field for middle class americans they ve sought to outdo one another by targeting primary voters concerned about issues including systemic racism climate change and education an nbc news wall street journal poll released this month found that 56 percent of democratic primary voters prefer candidates who propose large scale policies that cost more compared with 38 percent who like candidates pitching less expensive policies that would bring less change but potentially be easier to pass into law with just a few weeks before primary voting begins some of the more moderate candidates are increasingly hopeful voters will be repelled by the rising price tags of the most ambitious proposals biden who is leading the national race in most polls and leads with voters who prefer smaller scale change has repeatedly challenged his rivals to explain how they would pay for their spending programs warren has been the most detailed in outlining the costs of her various plans and how she would pay for them with a 2 percent wealth tax on fortunes exceeding 50 million and other tax hikes on the wealthy warren has said she would be able to fund a broad expansion of the federal government s social contract without raising taxes on middle class americans warren advanced in the polls earlier this year as she released dozens of plans offering vast benefits to most americans by redistributing wealth that has become increasingly concentrated among the rich calculators on her campaign website allow americans to find out how much money they would save through her plan canceling student loan debt and how much extra cash they would receive from her proposal to provide an extra 200 monthly for everyone receiving social security her momentum appeared to stall after she was pressured to release her own plan for universal health care warren s 20 5 trillion proposal her most expensive plan yet would be funded through an array of taxes on the wealthy and corporations both sanders and warren who continue to face bipartisan questions about the costs and feasibility of their health care plans have said most americans would pay less for health care under a government run system that eliminates premiums deductibles and the private insurance companies that collect them but over the course of the year several democratic candidates backed away from medicare for all citing its requisite tax increases and its upending of the private insurance industry i believe this hits the middle class too hard sen kamala harris d calif wrote in july about sanders proposal to pay for his medicare for all plan with a 4 percent income tax on most families harris who had proposed an ambitious agenda estimated at more than 12 3 trillion dropped out of the primary this month in addition to his medicare for all proposal eliminating out of pocket health care costs sanders has also pledged to have the government wipe out all 1 6 trillion in outstanding student loan debt his proposal announced in june went even further than warren s pledge to eliminate debt for 95 percent of the people who have student loans sanders has pledged to pay for his agenda by reversing trump s tax cuts and imposing a wealth tax and a series of tax hikes on the finance industry and more he has acknowledged that his health care plan would raise taxes on middle class americans but he insists that would be offset by the trimmed costs candidates have also touted 13 figure price tags as they ve competed to show their visions for combating climate change warren s 3 trillion plans include a tenfold increase in federal spending on clean energy research and development she also proposed a 10 7 trillion green jobs plan to invest in environmentally friendly industries buttigieg s 1 5 trillion plan creates a national extreme weather insurance program biden s 1 7 trillion plan aims to achieve net zero emissions of carbon pollution by 2050 sanders has boasted that his plan the most expensive at 16 3 trillion would declare climate change a national emergency eliminate fracking and ban all imports and exports of fossil fuels several candidates have pushed ahead with expensive plans by arguing that the cost of not acting far exceeds the price tag for their proposals my opponents and critics say bernie you re proposing to spend a lot of money on climate sanders said recently at a rally in los angeles and i say what is the alternative others have followed the example of trump who was able to win in 2016 by making broad promises that connected with voters while disregarding political structures of washington policymaking such as detailing how he would pay for it said michael strain an economist at the right leaning american enterprise institute these policies are so large and so different from what we ve seen that it s hard to come up with a good estimate of how much they would cost and how disruptive they would be strain said of the democratic proposals that creates political space for the candidates

the nigerian economy faced a lot of challenges in the outgoing year amid a slowing global economy elevated geopolitical risks and fragile investor sentiment writes obinna chima notwithstanding the positive gross domestic product gdp numbers recorded by the country in 2019 the economy is still not out of the woods yet the economy hit a lot of bumps in the road in the outgoing year and the way forward is unlikely to get any smoother from concerns of political risks prior to the 2019 elections that took place in the first quarter of the year the country s broadening fiscal deficit its continued weak revenue generating profile rising population widening inequality and a myriad of other economic challenges the economy struggled to exceed two per cent with third quarter 2019 gdp at 2 28 per cent also crude oil price nigeria s major source of revenue remained soft in 2019 in addition nigeria s current account ca balance has shifted to deficit from a long standing surplus pointing to deteriorating macroeconomic imbalances and adding to external vulnerability owing to this and some other concerns fitch one of the leading global rating agencies anticipated that the ca in nigeria would record a deficit of 1 6 per cent of gdp in 2019 its second weakest level in 24 years after a surplus of 2 6 per cent in 2018 fitch forecasts the ca deficit will moderate to an average of 0 7 per cent of gdp in 2020 2021 it stated this in its latest rating on nigeria where it revised the outlook on nigeria s long term foreign currency issuer default rating idr to negative from stable but affirmed the country s rating at b it also pointed out that general government gg debt in the country remains on an upward path while particularly low fiscal revenues and structural shortcomings in public finance management pfm constrain its ability to support a rising debt burden according to fitch the gg debt revenue ratio is particularly high at 333 per cent federal government fgn debt 777 in 2019 and will rise close to 400 per cent fgn debt 922 in 2021 well above the forecast b median of 248 per cent as a result of this it stated that nigeria s medium term economic outlook was subdued fitch also projected an average gdp growth of 2 4 per cent for the country between 2019 and 2021 this it stated would be well below the b median of 3 4 per cent and the five year average demographic growth rate of 2 7 per cent the prospects for supply side fiscal and exchange regime reforms that could tackle the major constraints for nigeria s credit profile are weak as reflected by the record in recent years emerging rivalries within the ruling apc party possibly sparked by early dissensions over the 2023 succession to president buhari could hamper policy making it stated prior to the fitch ratings moody s investors service another global credit rating agency had also changed its outlook on nigeria s ratings to negative from stable according to the rating agency the negative outlook reflected moody s view of increasing risks to the government s fiscal strength and external position it explained already weak government finances will likely weaken further given an extremely narrow revenue base and persistently sluggish growth that hinders fiscal consolidation as pressure mount there is a risk that the government resorts to increasingly opaque and costly options to finance a moderate but rising debt burden moreover vulnerability to an adverse change in capital flows is building in light of nigeria s increasing reliance on foreign investors to fund the country s foreign exchange reserves furthermore it pointed out that its decision to affirm the rating at b2 recognised a combination of credit strengths including the country s large and diversified economy supported by vast oil and gas endowments notwithstanding persistent credit weaknesses such as its very weak institutions and governance framework and in particular poor public finance management concurrently moody s has maintained nigeria s country risk ceilings at their current levels foreign currency bond ceiling at b1 foreign currency deposit ceiling at b3 and local currency bond and deposit ceilings at ba1 moody s also said the drastic reduction in nigerian banks non performing loans npls will help in reducing the risk of capital erosion from unexpected losses and lessens the need for loan loss provisions external reserves so far in 2019 the country s external reserves have depreciated by 10 5 per cent or 4 105 billion from the 43 075 billion it was at the beginning of the year to 38 970 billion as of december 19 the decline was attributed mainly to foreign exchange market interventions and direct payments the external reserves position could finance 5 3 months of imports of goods and services or 9 3 months of goods only using the import figure for second quarter 2019 a breakdown of the external reserves by ownership showed that the share of the federation reserves was us 0 32 billion 0 8 federal government us 6 09 billion 15 7 and the cbn us 32 37 billion 83 5 inflation the consumer price index cpi which is used to gauge the level of inflation in the country hovered around 11 per cent in 2019 despite concerns of inflationary pressure since the closure of all the country s land borders from the 11 35 per cent it was in january the cpi stood at 11 85 per cent at the end of november 2019 the cpi for november released by the national bureau of statistics nbs had shown that food inflation rose to 14 48 per cent compared to 14 09 per cent in the preceding month the cpi report attributed the rise in the food index to increases in the prices of bread cereals oils and fats meat potatoes yams and other tubers and fish the average annual rate of change of the food sub index for the 12 month period ending november over the previous 12 month average was 13 65 per cent 0 11 percentage points from the 13 54 per cent in october monetary policy the monetary policy committee mpc met a total of six times this year the benchmark monetary policy rate mpr which was at 14 per cent at the beginning of the year was lowered to 13 5 per cent after the first two months and was left at that rate throughout the year the central bank deployed a lot of unorthodox monetary policies using its development finance mandate in its quest to reflate the economy the cbn governor mr godwin emefiele who during the year was reappointed for a second term of five years by president muhammadu buhari has continued to defend the central bank s unconventional monetary policy the cbn governor explained that just like fiscal policy monetary policy could at a time when development challenges abound complement the efforts of fiscal policy in employment generation wealth creation and attainment of other growth objectives he highlighted countries such as the united states of america brazil among others that had to rely on unconventional monetary in times of economic difficulties to resuscitate growth within the cbn our unconventional methods especially in the management of the forex market and our development financing supported by the orthodox approaches in the form of our timely adjustments of monetary policy rate have been able to optimally balance the delicate objectives of price stability and real output growth we will continue to develop policy instruments and device ways of ensuring that an optimal mix of heterodox policies is continually deployed to engender the overall wellbeing and prosperity of the nigerian economy our overall aim remains the concurrent attainment of price stability real growth full employment and poverty reduction he added nevertheless nigerian banks non performing loans npls reduced to 6 6 per cent at the end of october compared to the 14 1 per cent it was in 2018 this was the first time the npls would drop to a single digit in the past 42 months reacting to this development moody s banking analysts mr peter mushangwe described it as credit positive the nigerian banking system s non performing loans ratio reduced to 6 6 per cent at the end of october from 14 1 per cent a year earlier according to the central bank this is credit positive as lower npls reduce risk of capital erosion from unexpected losses and lessen the need for loan loss provisions the improvement in asset quality is mainly due to banks growing loan books write offs and successful workout of exposures he stated moody s has maintained a stable outlook on the nigerian banking system our view reflects the banks resilient capital buffers and their stable deposit bases although nigerian banks asset risk and profitability will remain key rating challenges we expect these challenges to gradually ease in 2020 as the economy improves further the agency added analysts reactions in his assessment of the performance of the economy in 2019 a former director general west africa institute of financial and economic management waifem prof akpan ekpo noted that the economy didn t perform better in the outgoing year the data speaks to that that the economy has not done well for example up to the third quarter of 2019 the major macro indicators all moved the wrong direction for example inflation rate is still double digit unemployment and under employment is about 43 per cent once you have those two that high then there is a problem the rate of growth is about 2 1 per cent which has been sluggish since we came out of recession in 2016 but that rate of growth is less than the rate of growth of the population if you combine all of those those indicators and look at the lending rate which is still very high then there is no say you can say the economy has done very well it is really a dismal performance he argued on his part the president chartered institute of bankers of nigeria dr uche olowu described the outgoing year as being turbulent but if you look at the antecedent of what has happened before now the ship has been steadied that is the best you can describe 2019 you have unemployment still very high the exchange rate has been stable and the central bank has done a good job by defending the naira and monetary policy has been very stable of course the oil price has done nigeria good because the volatility wasn t much in 2019 but in terms of infrastructure we have not seen the impact he added however the general expectation among nigerians is that in the coming year some of the investments in infrastructure such as rails and roads would have been completed and the situation in the power sector addressed to enhance ease of doing business in the country and strengthen economic growth

zhaokang jiang is a veteran international trade and customs attorney specializing in customs international trade and supply chain legal and business consulting services for both global companies and small firms he worked for the chinese government in rulemaking trade negotiations and customs enforcement before entering private practice in the u s in 2000 today zhaokang is managing director of washington d c based gsc potomac and continues to provide guidance to clients on customs and trade compliance he also consults on public policy projects for the chinese government world customs organization world bank u n conference on trade and development and world trade organization wto he is a frequent lecturer at universities and other organizations as well as an author on trade and customs modernization and compliance e commerce and the digital and new economy american shipper recently sat down with zhaokang to discuss china s continued efforts to modernize its trade policies and customs practices and procedures american shipper china was working on trade and customs modernization before it joined the wto about 20 years ago when was the last time that a comprehensive rewrite of the china customs laws took place how long did that process take and in your view was it successfully implemented throughout china customs zhaokang the last comprehensive china customs law revision started in 1998 when intensive major trade negotiations with the u s and europe presented challenges and opportunities for china s institutional reform and modernization and was passed by the congress of china on july 8 2000 it then took effect on jan 1 2001 it took about another three years to revise and draft the administrative regulations and rules when drafting the new customs law a task force reviewed the customs and supply chain process customs laws and regulations of other countries and proposed new programs such as customs rulings surety advance clearance and self compliance there have been some minor changes to china s customs laws since then which took place in 2013 2016 2017 and 2018 based on continued observance of best practices in the u s eu and other countries china customs has also made significant changes related to regulations information technology infrastructure and organizational and procedural improvements the china customs law of 2000 has basically been well implemented nationwide but new questions other than conventional customs valuation and classification technical issues and challenges such as cross border e commerce fair competition product safety environmental protection and rules of origin have arisen during the past 20 years china customs is an enlarged organization encompassing 43 districts six national centers of excellence for revenue management and compliance risk management 450 ports of entry and a staff of about 70 000 to implement new regulations and procedures customs headquarters in beijing will monitor reports from the districts conduct field studies and receive input and proposals from the trade community and other government agencies china customs officers conduct a cargo exam american shipper what changes in trade as well as regulatory implementation did china s customs laws not foresee when first implemented did the laws anticipate the possibility of trade disruptions such as bilateral free trade agreements and tariff fights that we re seeing today what about the increase in e commerce exports as well as container exports in general from china zhaokang undoubtedly there have been significant changes in the past 20 years for china s trade and business environment trade volume in 1999 was about 360 billion and reached 4 62 trillion in 2018 and is expected to reach 5 trillion in 2019 the country s e commerce grew from almost zero to 1 3 trillion of which 200 billion was cross border china implemented an e commerce law on jan 1 2019 which generally requires the government to treat different business models fairly and equally as well as protect consumers china has signed and implemented free trade agreements with asean australia singapore pakistan new zealand chile peru costa rica iceland switzerland maldives georgia hong kong macao and holds ongoing negotiations with the gcc gulf cooperation council japan and korea sri lanka israel norway mauritius moldova panama and palestine the regional comprehensive economic partnership rcep agreement is expected to be signed early next year while bilateral trade agreements were considered as early as 2000 other significant trade disruptions were not expected this has resulted in new challenges for china customs including rules of origin regulation and enforcement balance between trade compliance and facilitation and intellectual property rights protections and consumer product safety china is also reviewing and revising its export control legislation american shipper describe the most significant regulatory and policy changes that china customs has undertaken since the country joined the wto zhaokang in the past 20 years especially before and after the wto trade facilitation agreement was accepted in september 2015 china has made great efforts to further modernize its trade and customs environment for trade efficiency and compliance enforcement after its adoption of a customs ruling program in 2002 china customs implemented new regulations regarding customs online monitoring and control for processing trade in 2006 in 2012 the agency implemented its first rules for cross border e commerce retailing but the pilot implementation was limited to certain ports and mainly certain large e commerce platforms in 2014 china customs implemented the enterprise classification and authorized economic operator programs for customs and trade compliance facilitation and security the agency working with other governmental partners implemented free trade zone pilot programs for periodic entry of customs clearances introduced a paperless customs entry process emphasized informed compliance with the trade and strengthened its enforcement of intellectual property rights in 2017 china customs announced its customs clearance integration and comprehensive reform to promote nationwide centralized customs clearance and procedures establishing six national centers for revenue administration and risk management with the international trade single window project it has further advanced customs automation and trade facilitation by integrating more government agencies such as the ministry of commerce the state administration for quarantine inspection and quality the state taxation administration and the administration for foreign exchange into the e port customs and trade automation platform in 2018 china customs absorbed the commodity inspection and quarantine administration into its operation china customs officers display a seized shipment of counterfeit handbags american shipper how important is it for china customs to continue upgrading its laws and regulations how fast can this be done especially with the rapid pace of change in trade in your view is china customs committed to upgrading its laws and regulations zhaokang the leadership of the central government and customs administration have a sincere commitment to further modernization of trade and the customs laws and regulations however china must shift its international trade from a gross growth model to a quality growth model with rule of law to reduce trade disputes and ultimately reduce transactional costs and best service the people we must especially recognize that fair competition intellectual property rights protection and product safety are critical for establishing a trusted business environment for the consumers all these cannot be accomplished by customs alone in october 2019 the chinese central government announced its nationwide cross agency regulations on improving the business climate in my view the crucial elements to further trade and customs modernization in china include a comprehensive review of the trade supply chain with an emphasis on centralized simplified and transparent processes and procedures for both the trade and customs officials to follow this should also include integrated port and border management and reorganization where necessary to remove hurdles from legitimate trade and remove loopholes for violations we would like to see china customs promote national pilot programs that effectively apply the latest information technology and data science such as gs1 blockchain and ai to prevent fraud and promote efficiency and compliance intelligence driven risk management and targeting is most effective china customs must continue to engage in bilateral and multilateral cooperation to share information and knowledge with other customs agencies and build customs trade partnerships aimed at capacity building and compliance and facilitation of cross border trade american shipper china customs this year introduced the customs further reform framework 2020 which considers the role and operation of the agency through the remainder of the 21st century how important is it for china customs to commit to this type of future framework zhaokang with the 21st century framework initiated by wco the trade community expects that the china trade and customs environment be based on the following values of rule of law in trade transparency due process fairness justice imparity predictability consistency uniformity and efficiency which demands the government improve the customs and trade legal system this must be accomplished through detailed customs law regulations implementation of rules and orders ruling decisions and providing compliance guidance the new campaign and process for revising the national customs law and regulations fitting for the next generation of commerce demands a deep dive review and may take two to three years at the least while uniformity consistency and transparency of customs laws and regulations have been improved over the past decades there are still issues with different processes that result in unfair treatment and compliance concerns for businesses operating in different customs districts some pilot programs such as for cross border e commerce and free trade zones that operate without limitations may create significant discrimination and inconsistency for companies timely evaluation process must be conducted on all programs to ensure cost effectiveness and fair competition i would like to reiterate that china and the whole world should have a rules based international trade and customs environment for the sake of openness efficiency compliance fair competition consumer protection and sustainable growth

if simple words are used to set the tone for financial markets in 2020 i would choose the term lucidity because the global economy s woes could not be solved in 2019 it is only because global interest rates have been at low or ultra low levels in addition to indications that the united states and china were suspending their trade war that the global markets not only got a breather but even witnessed a crazy rally in may therefore here my six predictions for 2020 1 us stocks are by no means cheap but have they peaked an analysis of the s p 500 index s pe ratios when it peaked in 2000 and 2007 shows that us stocks are now in an awkward place but since large enterprises still have enough cash for repurchases combined with the momentum of the market economy and corporate earnings it is believed that the s p 500 will perform like it did in 2000 and not go down until the pe ratio rises to nearly 28 times which also means there is still room for a 15 percent rise for us stocks but 2020 may be the year that us stocks peak 2 the performance of hong kong stocks in 2019 was indeed a miracle there are many factors that could trigger a disaster but funds are attached to the market for now and show no intention of heading for the door it could be that investors are unwilling or unable to leave because it is difficult to exit when they are still holding assets rather than funds therefore while people fret over hong kong stocks in 2020 the market s performance could be beyond imagination with the hang seng index rising by more than 20 percent because the best way to convert assets into capital is to have a wild rise in the market 3 in addition to singapore malaysia thailand the philippines vietnam south korea and other asia pacific stock markets did not have ideal performances in 2019 when compared to europe the united states as well as japan and other developed countries but the valuation of us stocks is much less attractive than these countries so money should return to asia pacific markets in 2020 since the hang seng index is also expected to climb more than 20 percent the rise of many stocks should match that of the hang seng s 4 gold didn t fare badly in 2019 which is a bit odd because why was it able to rise steadily when inflation and risk aversion was less pronounced the only reason is that monetary policy is ultra loose around the world and the market feels that the value of money will continue to fall as a result of central bank policy gold is expected to hit us 1 800 hk 14 040 in 2020 as monetary policy remains loose and currencies continue to fall in value but its real peak won t come until 2021 5 the australian dollar is likely to be the currency of choice in the first half of 2020 as rising gold and other resource prices lead to a rebound in the persistently depressed currency however if you really want look long term when the us dollar rises to 113 yen or above you should collect the yen as the market will rush to buy the yen as a safe haven currency if risks spike in the fourth quarter 6 the trade war between china and america is a temporary truce if us president donald trump is re elected come november the trade war between the superpowers may turn into a cold war if this happens hong kong may once again become a bargaining chip between china and the us in 2021 so beware hong kong s real winter may not come until the fourth quarter of 2020 or 2021 andrew wong is chairman and ceo of anli securities

there is also the problem of unemployment in towns rural people have little interest in migrating there lost decades of growth growth in africa slammed to a halt in the early 1980s braked by a debt crisis and structural adjustment policies it took two decades to recover per capita gdp as measured in constant us dollars shows the up and downs although these figures are official and do not cover africa s large informal economy 1 112 in 1960 1 531 in 1974 1 166 in 1994 and 1 657 in 2018 if you do an assessment over 60 years something serious happened in africa with the loss of 20 years but there is no denying that what is happening now is more positive cottet said the imf s and world bank s structural adjustment programmes broke the motors of growth said nubukpo whose book l urgence africaine the african emergency makes the case for a revamped growth model the belt tightening programmes emphasised the short term to the detriment of investments in education health and training new thinking needed africa has a low rate of industrialisation is heavily dependent on agriculture and its service sector has only recently started to emerge we have not escaped the colonial model basically africa remains a producer and exporter of raw materials said nubukpo he gave the example of cotton 97 percent of africa s cotton fibre is exported without processing the phase which adds value to raw materials and provides jobs for jean joseph boillot a researcher attached to the french institute for international and strategic affairs africa is still seeking an economic model of development there is very little development of local industries he said this can only be achieved through a very strong approach of continental industrial protection but this is undermined by the great powers in order to pursue free trade the chinese the indians and westerners want to be able to go on distributing their products governance problem lack of democracy transparency and efficient judicial systems are major brakes on african growth and wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few said the experts of the 40 states deemed last year to be the most world s most corrupt countries 20 are in sub saharan africa according to transparency international africa is not developing because it is caught in the trap of private wealth and the top wealth holders are african leaders said nubukpo we must promote democracy free and transparent elections to have legitimate leaders who have the public interest at heart which we absolutely do not have nyamnjoh also pointed to marginalised groups there should be more room for inclusivity of voices including voices of the young voices of women afp

the current economic expansion shows no obvious signs of stalling economists in general expect 2020 will see another year of growth even if not quite so robust as in 2019 that should usher in a decent year for the stock market especially as presidential election years tend to be upbeat but while a recession appears to be at least a year away things could unravel quickly in spite of record low unemployment and continued steady if unspectacular growth the economy seems fragile lee mcpheters an economics professor at arizona state university said here are some contrarian negative signs perhaps even bubbles to beware amid what is still broadly considered to be a generally upbeat backdrop student loan debt strategies to pay it off faster smarter are your bank deposits safe potential problems could be brewing maxed out consumers consumer spending drives more than two thirds of the economy so if average americans are buoyant that s a good sign that describes the current situation with continuing high consumer sentiment readings and solid holiday seasons sales but there are pockets of weakness personal debt is where the heart of my concern lies jonathan smoke chief economist for cox enterprises in atlanta said many low income individuals those with poor credit and younger adults are grappling to make ends meet even after a decade of economic growth renters are getting squeezed by higher rents and auto loan delinquencies and defaults are ticking higher which partly explains sluggish new vehicle sales auto loan delinquencies for subprime borrowers already are at a higher level than at any point leading up to and including the great recession smoke said rising delinquencies and defaults could lead to more personal bankruptcies he added smoke also sees a lot of americans going overboard on holiday spending this season many will require income tax refunds early next year to dig out of their holes he said story continues foreign trade and a global slowdown the threat of disruptive trade disputes has eased in recent weeks with the u s house of representatives passage of a new trade agreement with mexico and canada and with word that the white house and china have agreed to ease tariffs still in a survey released in december by the blue chip economic indicators newsletter member economists ranked trade disputes with china as easily the most worrisome peril ahead of weaker corporate profits a general global slowdown and other threats though exports and imports are less vital to the u s than they are to china europe and most other nations trade friction and slower global growth pose risks here too that s partly owning to broadening of the global supply chain mcpheters said energy prices especially for oil are another background threat even if not all that apparent at the moment global geopolitical conflicts or even a natural disaster such as a middle east earthquake could raise the price of energy and trigger recession mcpheters said there are no signs of spiking oil prices but external shocks are always a risk general business uncertainty business investment has been soft lately and unease among top executives could be a factor indicators that gauge ceo confidence and sentiment among business leaders have been declining mcpheters considers uncertainty as to the likely cause of that sources of uncertainty include the 2020 presidential election brexit and possible tax hikes if the election yields a change in the white house or congress he said leading democrat presidential contenders have called for an array of higher taxes including on corporate income a scenario that could spook investors and executives anything that contributes to even more uncertainty about policy politics or geopolitical conditions would tend to dampen spending and growth mcpheters said he also sees the potential for external shocks from natural disasters such as droughts fires hurricanes earthquakes and major storms smoke cited weak auto and aircraft sales as signs of business sluggishness though he considers recent strong construction numbers and buoyant sentiment among homebuilders as favorable as long as housing is positive it s very difficult to envision the u s going into recession he said threat of higher interest rates interest rates have been subdued for a long time but any spike could pressure economic growth both for businesses and consumers jack ablin chief investment officer at cresset capital management in chicago worries about a possible interest rate impact on what he considers bloated corporate debt levels excluding ious issued by banks and insurance companies in the normal course of their operations corporate debt as a percentage of gdp is near an all time high he said also worrisome a large percentage of that corporate debt carries adjustable rather than fixed interest rates that could translate to higher borrowing costs for businesses if rates were to spike we are highly levered and a lot of that leverage is floating rate ablin said he considers current lofty levels of corporate debt to be a distortion that could hurt profits undermine the stock market and slow the economy rising rates also could pressure many consumers including those with growing balances on high interest credit cards smoke noted growth still probable though to reiterate the consensus among economists including those quoted above is that 2020 will be a decent if slowing year for the economy in november 53 forecasters surveyed by the national association for business economics predicted growth of 1 8 in 2020 down from an expected 2 3 in 2019 with recession odds rising from 5 currently to 43 by the end of 2020 against this backdrop of slowing growth negative developments could be enough to tip the scales and they re often difficult to foresee in 2007 for example federal reserve officials were forecasting a solid year of economic growth but the economy then spiraled into recession the moral is that even top economists with the full resources of the federal reserve system can be wrong said mcpheters reach wiles at russ wiles arizonarepublic com or 602 444 8616 this article originally appeared on

what a difference a decade makes on this exact date 10 years ago i dropped a friend to shannon airport another statistic in the gathering gloom of ireland s great recession an individual with a canny eye for a good property deal he had eventually like many over extended himself with debts far our weighing income with neither the responsibility of a wife or children he had posted back his house keys to the bank the day before and departed these shores to start anew in california by early 2010 so called jingle mail had become a sad reality for numerous people reneging on their mortgages enacted by sending the keys back to their bank the friend is now settled in melbourne and only visits ireland for marriages funerals and the odd all ireland as he puts it by september 2009 over 26 000 homeowners found themselves in arrears with those in negative equity standing at 116 000 a figure set to rise to 196 000 by the end of 2010 while interest rates were still reasonably low at that point the average shortfall between house values and mortgage debt hovered around the 40 000 mark it was an environment exacerbated with the main banks clamping down on switchers and other institutions like bank of scotland opting to leave the irish market completely yet while the reality of recession was unavoidable to even the most financially myopic by 2010 the damaging pieces of this desperate jigsaw had already assembled two years earlier in january and february 2008 the us sub prime mortgage crisis had reached a point where it was impacting across the atlantic including the nationalisation of northern rock by the uk government march saw the prestigious bear stearns bank almost go under until it was bailed out us taxpayers to the tune of 30bn 27bn a reality fast coming down the tracks for ireland a week later on the infamous st patrick s day massacre anglo irish bank shares slid 15 and the irish stock market closed at its lowest level in three years significantly building and construction shares suffered most after a summer of upheavals the spark that led to the global conflagration came in september when lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy in new york causing massive turmoil in the global financial system the sight of workers taking to the streets with nothing but cardboard boxes became the modern equivalent of the 1929 crash an image that flashed around the world given legs by the 24 7 news cycle then came september 29 a date thereafter destined for inclusion in any irish economics degree with the bank guarantee when the government took the overnight decision to guarantee the banking system a move that would eventually cost the irish taxpayer billions for those who lived through it the greatest recession in modern times saw the fabric of irish society changed at its deepest level the years following the crash saw unemployment reach 15 matched by property values plummeting over 50 between 2008 and 2013 one infamous survey by the irish league of credit unions revealed that a quarter of irish people had less than 20 per week to live on after basic bills were paid a situation clearly linked to a doubling of calls to st vincent de paul after the wild excesses of the tiger years luxuries took serious hits across the board with new car sales plummeting by over 60 and alcohol consumption dropping cutbacks went to the heart of normal life with a bord bia survey showing the average household spend on groceries was down 600 while 80 000 people opted out of their private health insurance between 2008 and 2011 everywhere from corner shop encounters to office coffee breaks a feverish atmosphere of uncertainty prevailed as tales of terrified depositors taking out their savings talk of possible bank failures dominated every conversation huge concern was sparked any time an atm flashed an out of order message the public broadcast confessionals joe duffy and pat kenny on radio and vincent browne on television abounded with tales of financial hardship and recurring pleas of who will save us if it all keeps dropping restaurants closed and pubs closed early from lack of trade the building and retail trades took major hits with hundreds of half finished housing developments ireland became the land of the ghost estates in news reports everywhere from cnn to the wall street journal a decade ago nama entered the irish lexicon it was also the year the government injected by one way or the other the first of the billions into anglo irish bank of ireland and aib that september witnessed black thursday when the late finance minister brian lenihan admitted taxpayers were facing a bill of tens of bilions to save the banking system and outlined a savage austerity programme by november lenihan headed to brussels to apply for a 67 5bn bailout for the state this was the time that a second new word entered the irish economic lexicon as the troika lenders of the eu the imf and the ecb came to town sitting as we are on the cusp of 2020 ireland has plenty of economic dilemmas to deal with everything from the brexit fallout to danger signs that the 12 5 corporate tax rate may be challenged serious though these issues may be they surely pale in comparison to the hellish reality the nation confronted on january 1 2010 if the decade just passed had a theme song it would surely be gloria gaynor s i will survive a tune every irish citizen knows by heart
pankaj mishra as the year ends a partial and brief cease fire seems imminent in donald trump s trade war on the world the united states and china may sign a deal as early as next month but make no mistake the protectionist impulse behind the trade war remains as ineradicable as ever nor should it be forgotten that economic nationalism has guided the destiny of all major nations since the 19th century according to the ideological prejudices of the present built up over nearly four decades of globalization free trade and deregulation represent the natural order of things history however tells us that the united states was a protectionist power for much of its existence and the tariff was a crucial factor in its dethronement of britain as global economic leader by the early 20th century as william mckinley put it in 1890 we lead all nations in agriculture we lead all nations in mining we lead all nations in manufacturing these are the trophies which we bring after 29 years of a protective tariff the argument for economic nationalism against a manufacturing giant such as britain was simple british free traders claimed that their ideology was best placed to bring prosperity and peace to the world their critics in countries less economically advanced than britain such as germany s friedrich list the 19th century s most influential economic theorist argued that free trade could only be a goal rather than the starting point of modern development economic self strengthening for nations required that they protect their nascent industry until it becomes internationally competitive notwithstanding britain s rhetoric which periodicals like the economist amplified it had arrived at free trade after a successful policy of tariffs it also used military power to acquire foreign markets for its surplus goods and capital in the late 19th century one aspiring power after another set out to match the british the americans were not alone italy while seeking to modernize its economy imposed massive tariffs on france germany and japan nurtured domestic manufactures while trying to shield them from foreign competition even britain following its settler colonies australia canada and south africa came to abandon free trade by 1932 the united states protectionism peaked with the infamous smoot hawley tariff act of 1930 the us moved swiftly to embrace free trade after world war ii only because its manufacturing industries dominant over the world s war ravaged economies needed access to international markets even then the cold war s military and diplomatic urgencies turned the united states into an unlikely protector of japan s manufacturing industries as they were rebuilt into world beaters trade practices of the kind deemed unfair by trump today ranging from loans and subsidies to national conglomerates and restriction of imports were key to the rise of not only japan but also such east asian tigers as south korea and taiwan trying albeit much less successfully to build a manufacturing economy india imposed some of the world s highest tariffs after a short lived experiment with trade liberalization which resulted in a 53 billion trade deficit with china india today has retreated into its old protectionist crouch it is hard to see what else it can do the rise of china as a manufacturing powerhouse has made even the united states renounce the posture of international cooperation it assumed after world war ii the multilateral institutions such as the world trade organization that the us helped set up no longer seem to serve its purposes moreover the argument first widely heard in the us during the debate over nafta in the 1990s that free trade enriches the wealthy at the expense of the poor and the middle class not to mention the environment has become politically much more potent it is clear today that the advocates of free trade ignored for too long the volatile political problems rising from wage stagnation and income inequality upholding the economic law of comparative advantage they also managed to downplay the higher law that governs international economic relations might is right following the british imperialism of free trade powerful countries have consistently practiced what they denounce in others for instance the united states while insisting that other countries reduce state intervention has nurtured high tech industries in ways that violate wto agreements and which are shielded from sanction only by the fig leaf of defense requirements the bluff of free trade first called in the 19th century by an industrializing america against britain lies exposed yet again as china aspires to be the 21st century s new hegemon free trade turns out to be something that helps a rising great power until it doesn t and which most countries claim to practice while trying to subvert its principles as much as possible trump s trade wars are of course dangerously reckless in a world more interconnected than ever before but they have served to clarify the challenge ahead to devise multilateral institutions that acknowledge protectionism rather than free trade as the deeper and more

the difference between success and failure in forex trading is very likely to depend upon which currency pairs you choose to trade each week and not on the exact trading methods you might use to determine trade entries and exits each week i am going to analyze fundamentals sentiment and technical positions in order to determine which currency pairs are most likely to produce the easiest and most profitable trading opportunities over the next week in some cases it will be trading the trend in other cases it will be trading support and resistance levels during more ranging markets big picture 29th december 2019 in my previous piece last week i forecasted that the best trades were likely to be long of the s p 500 index following a daily new york close above 3222 and long of the nzd jpy currency cross following a daily new york close of the usd jpy currency pair above 110 00 this was a good call as the s p 500 index closed at 3224 on tuesday and then rose by 0 50 to end the week at 3240 unfortunately the usd jpy currency pair never closed above 110 00 as the nzd jpy currency cross also rose over last week last week s forex market saw the strongest rise in the relative value of the new zealand dollar and the strongest fall in the relative value of the u s dollar fundamental analysis market sentiment fundamental analysts are leaning in favor of the view that the recent quarter point cut in the u s interest rate will be the last cut for a while with jerome powell recently signaling there are likely to be no further cuts and maintaining an upbeat take on the u s economy however recent retail sales data was disappointing suggesting weaker consumer demand the u s economy is still growing but there are some fears of a pending recession a major issue concerning sentiment on the u s and global economies is the trade dispute between the u s and china although the situation has improved here as it seems that phase one of a u s china trade deal is about to be signed the benchmark u s stock index the s p 500 again ended the week at an all time weekly closing high price there are several few long term trends in the forex market notably bullish trends in all the major currencies except the u s dollar and the japanese yen with both trending weaker especially and most notably the u s dollar technical analysis u s dollar index the weekly price chart below shows last week printed a bearish piercing candlestick which closed very near the bottom of its price range the price is below its level from 3 months ago but still just a little way above its level from 6 months ago which is bearish but mixed the price is still below the key resistance level at 12361 and has printed a new lower resistance level at 12310 we have mostly bearish signs here suggesting that next week s action is likely to be bearish on the u s dollar s p 500 index the weekly price chart below shows that last week printed a bullish candlestick which closed near its high and above all its weekly closing prices of all time these are bullish signs suggesting that the price is likely to rise further over the coming week eur usd the price of this major currency pair made its highest weekly close in almost 5 months at the end of last week friday s candlestick was strongly bullish on volatility about twice as high as the average level which tends to be a very bullish sign there is still resistance until 1 1200 but the price seems poised to make a major long term bullish breakout here nzd usd the price of this currency pair made its highest weekly close in 5 months at the end of last week the price has just broken above several key resistance level and has very strong short and medium term bullish momentum which looks likely to continue into this next week conclusion this week i forecast the best trades are likely to be long of the s p 500 index following a daily new york close above 3240 and long of the eur usd and nzd usd currency pairs
skip to comments posted on by seekandfind what a difference a year makes 2018 was tough on investors and it ended with stocks in retreat the decline was triggered by growing fears of a prolonged u s china trade war fueled by president trump s i am tariff man tweet on december 4 in addition the federal reserve was in a multiyear cycle of rate hikes nobody knew it at the time but the last hike occurred on december 18 2018 across nearly every major asset class 2018 was a bad year fast forward to december 2019 a yearlong rally accelerated in the fourth quarter with stocks ending the year at or near all time high levels u s china trade tensions remain but a phase one trade deal has been signed president trump removed the threat of new tariffs against china in return china pledged to purchase at least 40 billion a year in u s agricultural products in addition the fed pivoted in 2019 and eased monetary policy three times the central bank has signaled it s now on hold for the foreseeable future in the end 2019 was a fantastic year for investors across almost all asset classes like i said what a difference a year makes nobody predicted 2019 would be such a banner year most of us suffer from recency bias and tend to believe whatever just happened will keep on happening and yet after a 2018 in which pretty much nothing worked for investors in 2019 pretty much everything worked the envelope please in 2020 i expect the goldilocks scenario we re in to continue nobody has a crystal ball i make no claims to being clairvoyant but here are my reasons for continued optimism economic growth is solid but not too hot for the fed in anticipation of faster global growth next year major stock markets around the world are making 52 week highs as 2019 comes to a close in addition fed chairman jay powell raised the bar on what it will take for the fed to raise rates inevitable weakening of the dollar it s hard to imagine the greenback won t soften in the coming year but gold bugs bitcoin fanatics and others calling for the dollar s demise are likely to remain disappointed my advice is to have some exposure to gold as a hedge but don t allocate more than 5 of your assets to the yellow metal or other anti dollar plays stocks over bonds equity valuations are high by historical standards but not outrageously so more importantly stock valuations look cheap compared with bonds as i wrote in a previous piece notably u s treasurys remain in high demand because our yields look good relative to the negative yields in europe and japan global demand for treasurys will help keep yields at relatively low levels and bond prices up the price of a bond moves in opposition to its yield no signs of irrational exuberance investor sentiment while improving lately remains subdued given the market s streak of record highs retail investors remain skittish and don t trust the rally americans are pulling money out of stocks rather than rushing into them a record 135 5 billion was pulled out of u s stock mutual funds and exchange traded funds etfs this year as i ve written before in addition margin debt people borrowing money to buy more stocks is at its lowest level since june 2005 historically bull markets don t end until everybody gets excited and jumps into the pool a body in motion finally there s a lot of chatter along these lines because the past decade was so good for stocks the coming one will be bad but that s now how markets work what we can learn from history is that bull markets tend to run for much longer than most investors would ever think is possible writes ben carlson of ritholtz wealth management in the 1980s the s p 500 rose nearly 400 including dividends producing annual returns of 17 but the 1990s were even better with the s p rising 425 or 18 annually a similar pattern occurred in japan the 1970s produced annualized returns of 400 which were bested in the 1980s when stocks rose an astronomical 1 200 2020 vision bull markets are built on momentum emotion and the fear of missing out carlson explains what if we re not in the bottom of the ninth but the top of the fifth what if the past 10 years were unbelievable for u s stock market investors but the next 10 years are just as good or better it s been said the market s job is to do the opposite of what most people expect it to do if that s the case the coming year and decade are going to be highly rewarding for investors good investing
the current economic expansion shows no obvious signs of stalling economists in general expect 2020 will see another year of growth even if not quite so robust as in 2019 that should usher in a decent

16 19 august 1976 chairing the non aligned movement the convening of the fifth non aligned movement summit in colombo saw sirimavo bandaranaike assume leadership of the 86 nation strong movement receiving the baton of leadership of nam from algerian president houari boumediène prime minister bandaranaike steered along a path of economic development with emphasis on collective economic self reliance aimed at reducing the gap between the developed and developing countries the demand for a new international economic order was made asserting the aspirations of the developing world and in support of an expansion of trade the 5th summit that was held at the newly constructed bandaranaike memorial international conference hall gifted by the chinese government was instrumental in positioning sri lanka at the centre of the developing world foreign relations secretary ravinatha aryasinha with the egyptian council for foreign affairs this article is based on ministry of foreign relations secretary ravinatha aryasinha speech titled sri lanka egypt relations and strengthening sri lanka s relations with the african continent at the egyptian council for foreign affairs recently ambassador mounir zahran chairman of the egyptian council for foreign affairs and ambassador of sri lanka to egypt damayanthie rajapaksa were also present it is indeed an honour to speak to you at the prestigious egyptian council for foreign affairs i must thank the ambassador of egypt in sri lanka hussein el saharty for encouraging me to visit the council and address you as you know i am in cairo to inaugurate the first bilateral political consultations between egypt and sri lanka and as important as our diplomatic engagements are so is scholarly exchange this has always been a key underlying principle of our interaction since ancient times and has enriched both our countries and mutual understanding there are two reasons at this juncture that make my remarks particularly timely from a sri lankan perspective which i trust will resonate with my largely egyptian but also other african and arab brothers and sisters first i am here today less than a month since the election of president gotabaya rajapaksa on 16 november president rajapaksa has pledged to nurture an independent neutral foreign policy centred on sri lanka s national priorities in relation to the development and security of our country and its people while not compromising our core values and aspirations in his inaugural address to the nation on 18 november president rajapaksa proclaimed we want to remain neutral in our foreign relations and stay out of any conflicts amongst the world s powers in maintaining relations with us we request all countries to respect our sovereignty and territorial integrity sri lanka and egypt both have been colonised by european powers in our case we were colonised by three the portuguese the dutch and the british in this historical context and the tussles being played out in the international arena to date among these powers as time tested and ancient civilizations our countries understand the merits of remaining neutral and allowing for the countries to grow according to the wishes of our peoples who have endeavoured to rebuild divided societies sri lanka looks forward to working with all our friends and partners on this journey towards social and economic progress prosperity and stability secondly since earlier this year the ministry of foreign relations has embarked on an intensified policy focus on the african region together with relevant line agencies in october 2019 set out a revitalised africa policy a set of initiatives to enhance our engagement across the political economic and cultural spheres in africa these initiatives provide the framework of our engagement with the african region and focuses on creating the multiple symbiotic linkages that will augment the sri lanka africa nexus through an expansion of our diplomatic presence enhanced economic cooperation and close co operation in multilateral fora and regional organisations i look forward to sharing some perspectives in this regard in the latter part of this presentation we are fortunate to have rich histories to draw inspiration from and a shared world view on many issues that have evolved through the post independence spirit of south south collaboration i have no doubt these will help us diligently navigate the prevailing global political currents historical context although formal diplomatic relations were established in 1957 the friendship between sri lanka and egypt goes back many centuries the first known map of the island of sri lanka named taprobane was drawn by the alexandrian greco egyptian geographer ptolemy in the second century a d ptolemy s world map prominently showed sri lanka in the centre g c mendis in his book early history of ceylon published in 1932 states that ptolemy named sri lanka salice with products being sent from sri lanka to egypt ranging from rice ginger and barley to sapphire silver and elephant tusks he also states that king buwanekabahu i 1273 1284 signed a trade agreement with the sultan of egypt in 1283 for the export of sri lankan products such as cinnamon precious stones and elephant tusks i must of course mention here that sri lanka does not deal in or profit from elephant tusks anymore the king s delegation travelled by sea to the head of the persian gulf and then by land to cairo through baghdad and the syrian deserts1 the mahavamsa the recorded chronicle of sri lankan history states that king buwanekabahu i sent several envoys to the sultan of egypt in the 13th century a d this is also mentioned in contemporaneous egyptian chronicles arab traders were pivotal for the trade ties between sri lanka and egypt they called my country serendib from which you may know the word serendipity is derived these trade ties expanded with the broader african region thanks to the indian ocean trading routes and common colonial history sri lanka s interactions with africa are as old as the country s history sri lanka welcomed frequent visitors from africa in ancient times including at the royal courts some of the visitors settled down in sri lanka and descendants of these early settlers still live in sri lanka today these are distinctive communities concentrated mainly in areas such as sirambiadiya trincomalee batticaloa and negombo they try to preserve their unique culture through their cuisine and particularly their music their contribution to the sri lankan culture is indelible and part of our proud diversity africa also comes to be mentioned in historical chronicles when under british rule members of the kandyan nobility including ehelepola maha adikaram the prime ministerial equivalent of the kandyan kingdom were exiled to mauritius in 18182 sri lanka s support to egypt and to african independence struggles our citizens have been comrades in arms against colonial rule from the early days we honour the egyptian freedom fighter colonel ahmad orabi pasha who in 1883 was deported to sri lanka then ceylon by the british colonial rulers he was warmly received by the sri lankan people and won their love and respect until his return in 1901 to his home country 1983 was declared the orabi pasha year in sri lanka in commemoration of a century since the arrival of colonel ahmed oraabi pasha as part of the commemoration a section of the maradana road in colombo was renamed oraabi pasha street reciprocally cairo s yehiya ibrahim street which houses the sri lanka embassy was renamed sri lanka street while living on the island following his exile from egypt colonel orabi pasha supervised the construction of the first modern islamic school in colombo in 1891 named zahira college his home in kandy has been transformed into a museum the orabi pasha cultural centre and features his personal belongings paintings and documents sri lanka s independence in february 1948 and egypt s revolution in july 1952 paved the way for further strengthening bilateral relations in the post independence era sri lanka s relations with african nations also strengthened further notably through sri lanka s support to their independence struggles this principled support to african liberation struggles was built on the post independence particularly post 1956 foreign policy of the late sri lankan prime minister s w r d bandaranaike it is said that when news came of egypt s late president nasser s decision to nationalise the suez canal company in 1956 then prime minister s w r d bandaranaike instructed sri lanka s permanent representative to the united nations ambassador r s s gunawardena to uphold egypt s rights in november 1956 the suez issue came to the un general assembly for the first time and sri lanka voiced its support of egypt there were no less than eleven resolutions related to the suez issue and sri lanka voted for all of them the prime minister attended the un general assembly not only in that capacity but also as the representative of the colombo powers his efforts to resolve the suez crisis pleased all the arab nations and sri lanka was treated as a great friend consequently sri lanka was appointed as a member of the suez advisory board egypt was the first african arab middle eastern country to open a diplomatic mission in sri lanka in 1957 following the former s independence in 1952 the late president gamal abdel nasser hussein took this initiative following sri lanka s strong support of egypt during the suez canal crisis in 1956 sri lanka s representation was upgraded to a full fledged embassy in 1958 9 14 october 1963 visit to the united arab republic with ceylon being held in high esteem by the egyptian people owing to the stand of the country during the tripartite aggression against egypt in 1956 before the establishment of diplomatic relations prime minister sirimavo bandaranaike was accorded a warm welcome by president gamel abdel nasser and prime minister ali sabry disarmament and tension in south vietnam topped the agenda of her discussions which also resulted in the uar agreeing to purchase a higher quota of tea from ceylon egypt which had joined syria to form the united arab republic had played a key role with ceylon at the height of the sino indian border dispute and exerted tremendous effort to avoid an outbreak of war travelling to alexandria and luxor prime minister bandaranaike witnessed the development activities undertaken and the work implemented to speed up the process of development in turn when prime minister sirimavo bandaranaike nationalised the british us owned oil companies in 1961 to establish the ceylon petroleum corporation there was an oil embargo imposed on sri lanka by the affected parties hearing about this critical situation president gamal abdel nasser wasted no time in sending us a ship load of oil which assisted sri lanka in averting a domestic crisis this was buttressed by the steady friendship between our leaders which set the tone of co operation and support prime minister sirimavo bandaranaike visited egypt in october 1963 on the invitation of president gamal abdel nasser in 1964 to participate in the 2nd non aligned conference and again in october 1970 to attend the funeral of president gamal abdul nasser prime minister dudley senanayake visited egypt in may 1969 and president j r jayawardene paid an official visit to egypt in 1983 egyptian president anwar sadat visited sri lanka in 1976 for the non aligned summit held in colombo on the passing of president nasser prime minister bandaranaike declared two days of national mourning and the day of his funeral was declared a holiday the prime minister s statement at the commemoration ceremony of the late president noted that he was not only a leader of the arab world an afro asian leader and a leader of the nam but also someone who fought against foreign domination partnering in nam and south south co operation sri lanka and egypt s greatest contemporaneous collaboration no doubt has been through the genesis growth and continuing spirit of the non aligned movement founded in 1961 however its origins could be traced to the 1955 bandung conference of afro asian countries in which both egypt and sri lanka played a prominent role sri lanka has been at the forefront of supporting the liberation struggles in africa particularly the anti apartheid struggle in south africa sri lanka s position was clearly manifested during its chairmanship of the 5th non aligned summit held in colombo in august 1976 under sri lankan prime minister sirimavo bandaranaike the world saw one of the strongest collective positions taken by the movement against the policy of apartheid the african national congress anc attended this summit as observers at the invitation of the government of sri lanka addressing the session prime minister bandaranaike was to observe we stand resolutely behind the peoples of africa in this struggle the outcome of which will determine whether humanity can progress in peace and brotherhood referring to south africa in her inaugural address at this conference madam bandaranaike observed racism in southern africa is a residue of old colonialism elaborately entrenched on the myth that some people are born superior to others on grounds of colour with a macabre inventiveness all their own racist regimes in south africa and rhodesia have instituted policies directed towards the systematic erosion not only of the democratic rights of the majorities in these countries but also of the fundamental human rights enshrined in the charter of the united nations arab traders were pivotal for the trade ties between sri lanka and egypt they called my country serendib from which you may know the word serendipity is derived these trade ties expanded with the broader african region thanks to the indian ocean trading routes and common colonial history sri lanka s interactions with africa are as old as the country s history sri lanka welcomed frequent visitors from africa in ancient times including at the royal

and part of our proud diversity attending the 31st session of the unga in september 1976 as the chairperson of the nam prime minister bandaranaike reiterated her support and that of the non aligned movement to the african people s struggle in the following terms what the colombo documents seek to convey is that the river of history cannot flow backwards and that the longer the racist regimes take to realise this the more serious would be the consequences for peace on that continent and elsewhere she added all initiatives towards a just solution for these problems are naturally welcome as long as they are genuinely designated to expedite the transition from obduracy to reason at the same time i should make it clear from this forum that if reason were to fail and the peoples of africa were forced to resort to the ultimate solution through armed struggle every non aligned nation will stand solidly behind them later addressing the 15th nam summit in sharm el sheikh egypt in july 2009 president mahinda rajapakse in his address emphasised the importance of all nam members standing together to defeat terrorism and rally against the use of sanctions against individual countries our society is a caring society and people from all parts of the country have come forward to assist those who were displaced we are confident that our government together with our civil society and with the support of our international friends will ensure that all displaced persons resume their normal lives very soon and partake fully in the social political and economic development on which my government has embarked we have noted the comments made by our colleagues with regard to the use of sanctions against individual countries sanctions whatever the cause only punish the people of that country punishing a people must never be endorsed by the international community as a student of history and political science i have sought to detail this historical context somewhat copiously for many both in my country as well as yours have forgotten it co operation in other multilateral fora throughout more than six decades sri lanka and egypt have worked closely in all international forums to disseminate peace and stability regionally and globally decision makers in cairo and colombo have not spared any efforts to mutually support each other on a wide range of international issues including combating terrorism and organised crime establishing a culture of peace and tolerance supporting territorial integrity and rejecting all forms of separatism as well as rejecting attempts of foreign interference in the internal affairs of our respective countries 1 historical relationship with egypt 2 dailynews lk 2019 ehelepola maha adikaram of the kandyan kingdom available at we have also collaborated in disarmament and in sustaining world peace and security an example of this is the unga resolution prevention of an arms race in outer space sri lanka and egypt have been tabling this annual resolution for over two decades at the un general assembly as per the practice our two countries take turns to introduce this resolution at the unga first committee and leads in the co ordination of the draft resolution sri lanka and egypt have also continued to support each other at the human rights council we have worked together on many resolutions moved by egypt in support of the standards we wish to see upheld for the benefit of all peoples all over the world such as protection of the family access to medicines in the context of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest standards of physical and mental health and right to work attending the 31st session of the unga in september 1976 as the chairperson of the nam prime minister bandaranaike reiterated her

and the peoples of africa were forced to resort to the ultimate solution through armed struggle every non aligned nation will stand solidly behind them sri lanka and egypt can remain confident of mutual support in international fora especially in human rights which while created for the betterment of our peoples is unfortunately getting ever more politicised with domestic politics and vote bases affecting the conduct of international relations in the face of such situations south south solidarity as exemplified by sri lanka and egypt has played a pivotal role to stand up to outside pressures although we have not always been successful it is important that our countries continue to stand together to overcome our shared challenges the un conference on the law of the sea unclos in which our countries have played a pivotal role continue to remain the core of the global ocean governance regime new issues and challenges require collective reflection and deliberation by nations to find effective solutions cross sectoral rules based approach in pursuance of this objective demands understanding on the critical role the indian ocean region plays in driving the global economy as well as of the impact on the environment and climate change together with sri lanka egypt was one of the eight founding states of the indian ocean marine affairs co operation iomac through the then african asian legal consultative committee now aalco first in colombo at the 1981 sessions this was a pioneering ocean management movement initiated by countries of the region joined by extra regional

navigation and unimpeded maritime commerce in the indian ocean region sri lanka considers the strengthening of security safety and sustainability of activities in the indian ocean as an important objective in the context of expanding ocean activities and the rise of geo political complexities in furtherance of this objective sri lanka heads the indian ocean rim association iora working group on maritime safety and security wgmss last year the terms of reference of the working group were prepared and on 7 to 9 august iora members gathered in colombo and finalised the work plan for two years egypt is an important dialogue partner in iora and almost all nine dialogue partners of iora have shown willingness to get involved in the suggested activities of the work plan of iora maritime safety and security working group bilateral relations current status prospects and challenges egypt and sri lanka are bound by more than twenty bilateral agreements and memoranda of understanding covering the fields of trade investment culture arts education civil aviation political consultation and security it would be presumptuous of me to unilaterally try to surmise on our current status of bilateral relations which is the subject of the deliberations that are due to take place tomorrow at the foreign ministry however from a sri lankan perspective let me attempt to summarise some priority areas as i see them 1 trade as we said trade is where our relationship started and therefore should remain a centre of attention i am told that the first agreement we had was a fascinating tripartite agreement between ceylon egypt and japan where we gave you tea you gave them oil and they sent us machines trade between egypt and sri lanka has been transacted in free convertible currencies up to 1954 from 1954 to 1977 a barter system of trade was conducted through a trade and payment account in 1977 a new bilateral trade agreement was signed under this agreement hard currencies were used as the medium of settlement of trade balances in more contemporary times the 1987 agreement on trade and economic co operation provided a broad framework which eventually paved the way to establish a joint commission the objective of the joint commission was to expand relations on trade and economic development facilitating exchange of information on trade and trade missions however the egypt sri lanka business council originally founded in 2004 has become dormant while we urgently need to reconvene the joint commission on trade and economic cooperation which last met in 2002 as for product categories egypt is a large tea consuming country and is one of the ten leading importers of tea in the world while in the 1980s sri lanka provided 60 of your requirement following the imposition of high tariffs and later the emergence of regional trading blocs this market share was to dwindle to 5 particularly at the public level however i am advised that our premier tea brands such as dilmah superfine akbar impra and jaff continue to offer gourmet speciality tea to the discerning tea connoisseurs in egypt we must expand this to also reach your super markets and cafes through better market facilitation because many of your people when they meet us tell that they used to love to drink our tea but that they now can t now find it in the egyptian market it is also a noteworthy feature that egypt is the largest market of desiccated coconut from sri lanka for the purpose of the confectionary industry in addition sri lanka has been exporting rubber products leather products spices coir products confectionary cocoa and cocoa based products porcelain and ceramic ware sri lanka s imports from egypt are mainly chemical and plastic products metal based products fertiliser oils and fresh fruits we are also trying to get a few of your major investors interested in coming to sri lanka and getting more involved egypt has requested sri lankan investors to invest in the field of agriculture tourism textile and garment industries communication and information technologies and oil refinement while sri lanka welcomes egyptian investors to the colombo port city 2 agriculture egypt is an intensive user of modern technology to improve productivity of agriculture and we seek opportunities for sri lanka to learn from the expertise of the agriculture research institute of egypt on cultivating citrus fruits pomegranate mango and date palms and cultivating rice in the saline water the egyptian side may also obtain from sri lanka technical support to obtain plant materials of pineapple and selected mango varieties using tissue culture technology 3 defence terrorism is no stranger to either sri lanka or egypt both our countries have lost presidents to terrorism this scourge has continued to harm our peace loving people and hamper the development of our nations having defeated one of the world s most organised and ruthless separatist terrorist groups the ltte after almost 30 years sri lanka was resolutely on the path of rebuilding and reconciliation when the isis inspired attacks of easter sunday took place in april this year killing over 250 persons in churches and luxury hotels within a span of a couple of hours it is to the credit of our security forces and intelligence services that normalcy was restored and law and order re established however it has awakened the law enforcement agencies to this new phase of violent extremism based on religious belief and adjust to the demands of this new face of terror to protect sri lanka s citizens we are very conscious that you fight the same battles and it is very important that we try to understand and get whatever help we can from your country so that we could do this much better because we have a 10 muslim population of which 99 are peace loving and who have had nothing to do with any of this in fact it is because of them that the perpetrators of this crime were pointed to and we could neutralise the second and third layers who were also ready to carryout terror attacks so we feel that we have to help the muslim community of sri lanka by insulating them from the spread of extremist ideology because there is a lot at stake for them as much it is for our country 4 culture another area which is important to look at is the cultural aspect sri lankans and egyptians have influenced each other in the arts music literature and architecture for centuries evidence suggests mutual influences between ancient civilizations in both nations from the dawn of recorded history in the modern era these exchanges have been dominated by the youth of our countries with mutual participation in folk festivals and cinema competitions how you handle artefacts might also be a useful area in which we could exchange expertise given that it is an important area in the global south and expertise is limited 5 academic exchanges the final area in this regard that i want to focus on is academic exchange our academic exchanges unfortunately in recent times have been largely focused on scholars exchanged on religious basis we need to diversify the areas of co operation and academic exchanges to include other areas because that will make the exchange more equitably beneficial to all social and religious groups in sri lanka the other area which i would like to see develop is in the exchange of diplomats and i have been discussing this with your ambassador in colombo for some of your cadets to come to our diplomatic training institute and for ours to come to cairo i say this because yesterday i was interviewed by a young egyptian journalist who i gathered did not know of prime minister sirimavo bandaranaike i told him not to feel too bad because my guess is that most of his sri lankan counterparts would possibly not know who president nasser was either we have not done justice to that rich history of the 60s 70s and the 80s in the successive decades and we must try to find our way around it and get back to a stronger footing otherwise people will forget the closeness of the relationship which we have had that you stood by us and we stood by you and i think we must not let that be forgotten sri lanka s broader relations with africa if i may turn now to sri lanka s broader relations with africa reinforcing sri lanka s longstanding relations with the region in 2014 sri lanka was accorded associate membership status in the african union au as a non member state which was in keeping with sri lanka s desire to maintain close relations with the african region i take particular interest regards this decision because as prun geneva my voice was probably one of the strongest advocating that we should do so and ever since i have advocated broadening and deepening that relationship we opened a resident mission in addis in 2016 which has given renewed impetus to strengthening our co operation with africa the foreign ministry in colombo has been actively taking part in activities promoting african culture organised through the resident missions these included the africa day celebration under the chairmanship of egypt this year and the event organised by south africa to pay tribute to the enslaved africans brought to sri lanka then ceylon by colonial rulers in the 1800s to build the galle fort with the participation of the descendants of those enslaved who made sri lanka their home and who continue to preserve the cultural practices of their forefathers however at the political and economic level in a pan africa sense so far we have done little of the 54 african states recognised by the un at present sri lanka enjoys formal diplomatic relations with 45 and has resident missions in six of these specifically nigeria egypt ethiopia kenya seychelles and south africa furthermore sri lanka has concurrently accredited our ambassadors from these resident missions to cover most of the african countries we are having relations with additionally sri lanka has appointed 10 honorary consuls in the african region where we want to go deeper and where concurrent accreditation is not sufficient we also have the benefit of four missions from the african continent in colombo concurrent accreditation of a large number of ambassadors from new delhi as well as a number of honorary consuls of african countries based in colombo the current decade has witnessed a reasonable growth in sri lanka s economic engagement with a number of african countries yet there is a great potential to increase trade and investment in a manner beneficial for both sri lanka and africa in 2018 bilateral trade in goods amounted to 466 million accounting for 1 4 of sri lanka s total trade maintaining a modest trade surplus with the region sri lanka s exports to africa in 2018 amounted to 249 million 2 1 of sri lanka s total exports while imports from africa stood at 217 million 1 1 of sri lanka s total imports tea rubber electrical machinery and paper account for 63 of total goods exported by sri lanka to the african region while minerals and fuel edible fruit beverages and perfumes add up to over 80 of sri lanka s imports from africa sri lankan companies are also engaged in a number of investment projects in africa notably in the areas of garment manufacturing construction it and confectioneries particularly as a major exporter of apparel sri lanka s private sector has invested in a number of african countries in this sphere optimising on the african labour market raw materials and access to western markets through preferential tariff schemes such as african growth and opportunity act agoa and everything but arms eba their technological advances and healthy labour practices exemplified through garments without guilt has been the selling point this must be emulated in other areas as well and sri lanka and africa can work together through the private sector to be economic drivers employment generators and contributors to the development story of african economies in this regard i am happy to note that hela clothing a sri lanka based apparel manufacturer with factories across kenya and ethiopia is being awarded the most inclusive employer of 2019 award by the ethiopian centre for disability and development ecdd for its efforts to promote disability inclusive development in ethiopia recent developments in africa in terms of intra regional economic integration particularly with the coming into force of the afcfta africa continental free trade area in may 2019 have created attractive pull factors for our private sector to be interested in the huge potential of the african market due to its relative proximity while also providing an alternate market in the context of mounting uncertainties in the global economic environment particularly in the west one of the main markets for sri lanka once fully operational the african continental free trade agreement will add further stimulus to the trade and investment relationship between countries in africa and sri lanka vision and a new policy for enhanced co operation with africa it is clear that there is considerable need as well as space for our relations to grow and in fact to thrive i strongly believe that based on our historical linkages with africa and in view of the rapid changes taking place in this great continent which holds much prospect for growth as well as in sri lanka given its strategic location in the middle of the indian ocean it is in our interest to maximise these for mutually beneficial economic and political gain it is this consciousness that led the ministry of foreign relations to recently operationalise a revitalised africa policy that aims to address convergences and opportunities towards a more fruitful and mutually beneficial relationship between sri lanka and our african partners it is noteworthy that this policy document has been prepared in consultation with the relevant sri lankan line agencies as well as colombo based heads of mission from africa and honorary consuls representing african states and sri lanka s mssions and honorary consuls in africa i must appreciate here that your ambassador in colombo hussein el saharty was also very involved in this process and participated in all our discussions in the coming years this policy document is expected to guide our relations with african nations more concertedly and consistently it comprises a set of initiatives to enhance our engagement across the political economic cultural spheres in africa key recommendation areas include strengthened bilateral engagement through high level visits political consultations and joint commissions we believe the first round of the political consultation between egypt sri lanka will pave the way to further enhance our bilateral engagement in africa while sri lanka also has similar on going political consultations with south africa we look forward to commencing political consultations with other african countries including ethiopia uganda and seychelles in the coming years the expansion of diplomatic presence and political integration from its current six resident missions and 12 honorary consuls to facilitate the envisaged future expansion of relations between sri lanka and africa enhance economic co operation through greater trade and investment as well as by strengthening the trade facilitation frameworks such as through bilateral agreements in investment protection avoidance of double taxation enhancing air and sea connectivity harmonising of standards leveraging co operation in multilateral fora including regional and international organisations in a mutually beneficial manner especially through greater engagement with the departments of the african union in this regard sri lanka looks forward to working in close collaboration with the african group of countries through its missions in africa geneva new york and new delhi to further solidify friendly relations in multilateral fora mainly in the united nations and in other multilateral bodies such as the human rights council international organisation for migration iomac etc also sri lanka expects to broaden our partnerships with africa in finding solutions to cross cutting issues that affect both our societies such as climate change combating terrorism transnational crimes including illegal migration and drug trafficking having created better awareness of africa and its emerging opportunities in terms of social economic and political opportunities within sri lanka and of sri lanka within african countries we hope to work with our african friends to build on our longstanding links towards more substantive and productive outcomes having created better awareness of africa and its emerging opportunities in terms of social economic and political opportunities within sri lanka and of sri lanka within african countries we hope to work with our african friends to build on our longstanding links towards more substantive and productive outcomes it is hoped that through these endeavours we will be able to expand sri lanka s footprint in africa and tangibly increase our economic engagement which is currently at a nascent stage significantly in the areas of trade investment and people to people ties in a mutually beneficial manner it is expected that the operationalisation of the african continental free trade agreement will add further fillip in this endeavour conclusion the bonds that tied us in the past are still very relevant the problems that we faced then might have changed from the fight against colonialism to its modern day manifestations of dominance but we have to fight it the same way the new enemies of separatism and extremism are common enemies to both of us this visit comes at a time when we have appointed a new ambassador of sri lanka damayanthie rajapaksa who assumed duties in cairo just a month ago she presented credentials only last week but has hit the ground running and together with her team has prepared to ensure that the first ever bilateral political consultations between egypt and sri lanka will be successful as we seek to re invigorate this relationship with egypt and with broader africa we must do so in the same spirit that we have each contributed to one another s struggles from the times of the bandaranaikes and nassers our children and students of international politics must understand that when our countries and leaders took those bold steps there were consequences we faced but we did it nevertheless because we believed in the principles we were fighting for whether on the suez canal issue against apartheid or as we continue to unwaveringly do to this day in support of the palestinian cause i wish to conclude by assuring you that sri lanka will be steadfast in its support to your country and towards africa and we hope the bilateral political consultations will generate momentum at the diplomatic and political level that will be carried forward and sustained by our respective business leaders civil society academics journalists and most importantly by our peoples at large

by david haggith did you know dr frankenstein created a monster that stays alive to this day by eating zombies neither did the zombies neither apparently did dr frankenstein in fact the zombies being braindead as zombies are do not realize that they are also keeping alive the diabolical doctor who made the monster that is eating them this little article however is going to tell you how all of that has become the strange case of the world as we all know it today and at the end of the article i m going to give everyone access to the first patron post i wrote as my thank you to supporters who chose to keep this blog alive at the close of last year that post was titled 2019 economic headwinds look like storm of the century before i do i want to recap 2019 by shining a light on the occulted diabolical nature of the single most important economic event this past year so that you can read the article in an appropriate frame of mind you would not after all watch a horror movie without first turning out the lights to set the mood in this case however i must also turn on a single small lamp to shine a light on the face of the monster hidden the dark corner of the banking world then we will be ready to review the article in context of all that transpired one purpose i had for laying out what i thought would be the prevailing headwinds in 2019 was of course to help people realize what they should keep their eyes on for their own sakes that may or may not give them information they factor into investment decisions but investments decisions are not at all what this blog is about investment decisions depend on personal tax considerations appetite for risk and prosperity versus safety and security which changes with age in life and all kinds of other factors my main purpose henceforth was and is to develop my continuing saga about the great recession in which dr frankenstein dr fed frankenstein to be precise created the monster that still ravages the earth to this day and to lay out the completely predictable death of dr fed s monster for the dismal comfort of those the dred doctor pretends to be curing with his gift of reincarnate life that is eating away at them limb by wasting limb you see i was almost certain 2019 would eventually become the big year to prove out this central theme of my past decade of writing a period which i have devoted to covering the life of the resuscitated monster and its demi creator to put it in the doctor s own technical terms the fed s failure at its balance sheet unwind would become in my terms the great recovery rewind toward the end of the year establishing once and for all that fed frankenstein did not ever create self sustaining life with that certainty burning in my fevered mind the one point i continued to drum home throughout the year that followed this january 2018 post of which i am writing was the development that would impact us all by the time the fed s tightening of the rack on which its recovery monster was bedded came to a scheduled close at the end the summer of 2018 in anticipation of your reading the full tome i present you with a summary sample of the pre gloom enlightenment you are about to receive the fed s great recovery rewind tightens to breaking point the ultimate downdraft for the entire global economy is the fed s balance sheet unwind if you get that you re ahead of the fed because they clearly don t and neither do market analysts or most economists the great rewind is far more significant than the fed s targeted interest rates which really have just been playing catch up to what the zapping out of existence of fiat money is doing as money disappears from the monetary system we see those pumped up bank reserves insidiously collapsing as shown in the chart below these reserves were supposed to be our insurance against another banking blowout like the last one they are down now by a trillion dollars since their high in the fall of 2014 at the end of summer what in fact we got was exactly such a banking reserve blowout a supernova of a monster in the financial universe in that it has already expanded into a half trillion dollar fix and we don t yet know if that is the end of it it burst into view before all mankind when very few except the fortunate forewarned here and in a few haunts elsewhere expected it it jolted even the unready dr fed into rapidly taking his balance sheet right back to where it was before he began foolishly tightening the screws on his weak mirage of a recovery as my evidence of the alacrity with which the foul doctor has had to respond note that he is now running backward twice as fast as he originally walked down that slope of reducing reserves on his balance sheet to me this theme is the most important economic lesson of the past year because if the citizenry in the united states doesn t learn that heir frankenstein really does not know what he is doing all of us are going to endlessly redream this nightmare after every economic collapse the repo crisis of 2019 proves that dr fed s recovery plan is more like a ponzi scheme than a recovery and it proves there is no exit in what he has planned unless you help make one for him until this all blows up spectacularly i doubt we ll get enough people awake to help make any useful change it is like a ponzi scheme in that a ponzi scheme is a trick that only keeps working so long as someone keeps feeding it the principal schemer must reinvest all the money made from one round of beguiled investors in targeted payouts to show unreal investor gains in order to attract a larger round of suckers to buy in to the next round until he s rinsed and repeated the cycle enough to where he is ready to run with all the spoils dr fed isn t looking for a new and bigger round of suckers because he already has the whole world in his circle of influence as i shall soon describe in morbid detail but his frankensteinian recovery plan of energizing the dead into new life is like a ponzi scheme in that the plan will be discovered as a fraud as soon dr fed aided by his central colleagues around the world stops creating bigger rounds of new money in order to keep energizing the scheme so that it wiggles and leaps appearing to live on its own which in fact it does not do not fall for his sly machinations true recoveries like true living creatures sustain themselves that s why they are called recoveries the dying recover to live on their own you give some necessary artificial life support to the patient temporarily until his or her own body heals to the extent that it can live a happy life on its own the mission is accomplished only if you can remove the life support one day and the patient thrives dr fed s patient who collapsed in the great recession remains moribund requiring full life support a full decade after dr fed s monstrous recovery program began i raise as my proof against dr fed the year 2019 the overarching theme of importance that must be recognized if we are ever to enjoy true economic vitality is that 2019 proved the fed s operations have created nothing that should ever live in this world the mock recovery of the corpse that fell to the ground in the great recession remains utterly dependent on forever fedmed and functions nothing like the real economy this nation enjoyed for hundreds of years even with its many ups and downs this one dances only because it gets sparked by dr fed s various apparatuses from time to time the hard evidence is this we got to see fed frankenstein pull out the last feeding tube in the summer of 2019 and shortly thereafter the financial system went into paroxysms that were completely predictable long in advance by anyone understanding the galvanic wizardry behind dr fed s whole life giving deception ever since then the financial quacks who work with dr fed have been scurrying all over his o r to get their braindead stitched together patient who looks more like a crazy quilt of flesh than a person settled back down by stuffing the tubes back up its nose and down its throat and into its lungs in order to bring food and oxygen supply back to where everything was before these madcap medics attempted to pull the tubes and prove their monster could live on its own they proved it cannot period they have tried to pull the curtain around their present operations to obscure their scurrying by telling the world they are not doing what they are now doing do not look behind the curtain this is not qe the desperate attempt by these financial frauds to save this flopping body of gel that remains of a once strong economy is intended to convince us that the frankenstein fed has not eviscerated all of us you see the dirty secret is that we are the braindead patient on dr fed s operating table and we are watching all of this as an out of body experience there is the twist in my tale but there is one more tale to tell we meaning the collective populace of the united states are braindead because we have fully the authority to stop this unholy doctor but we as a collective are in a coma allowing it to happen you see the other dirty little secret that is evading our collective mind is that dr fed frankenstein himself is only kept alive by the patient he is operating on we could pull his plug in a heartbeat if we wanted to but we re so afraid we ll die on the table without his help that we keep letting him conduct his filthy experiments all over our body politic we do not arise from the table and take action against the mad doctor lest his own death brings our own and it very well might so utterly dependent upon him have we allowed ourselves to become that who is there left can save us the fact of our deathlike state can be seen in the how we still flop on the table after an entire decade of this grotesque experimentation we saw stocks crash and the bond market start to collapse as soon as dr fed was fully engaged in ripping out the tubes now we see this mephistopheles of mad medicine scrambling to repair the damage he and his hunched over assistants brought to their own fake recovery adding back the oxygen of interest cuts and pumping new food into the system via constantly increasing doses of new quantitative easing so our own quantitative wheezing goes on forever in order for fed fiends to maintain the illusion of having fixed us but we are as far from fixed as ever my friends we have never been so sadly sick as we are now but zombies do not know they are the walking dead why has it all turned out this way why so easily predictable if so unseen by many because plainly to those few cells who are not comatose you cannot heal something without surgery aimed at removing its actual internal cancers entirely you cannot pump blood into a debt tumor and feed it to help it grow it much bigger bubble and think that s going to solve debt cancer you re saving the tumor not the patient you cannot stitch together two failing banks that are too big to fail and not create a bigger monster even if that somehow keeps the dead one alive it only turns the two into a bigger more hideous beast what dr fed did was stitch one dead body to the unhealthy body of another creating a siamese twin that drags along and lives off of one head that was in fact the fed solution time and again and the whole of us citizenry watched it happen to us and said we hope this works well collectively we did why would it how could it who could ever hope that except those in denial of the foul condition of their own fetid flesh we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us these things should be obvious but we as a collective of barely jiggling cells lay in our coma on the table and watched all of this continue for years from outside of our body why else would any of us have ever believed that sewing together two or more banks that were too big to fail would somehow save us from the peril of having banks that are too big to fail fall on us it s ludicrous we re going to be saved now by creating a worse situation for later you have to be braindead to buy into such a scheme but buy into it we did for ten years not you but we the collective some of us brain cells recognize this problem but obviously most do not or this would not be happening to us those that do are trying to wake the rest of the brain cells from this morbid slumber before it is too late but many of us fear it already is too late the fed s fix was to feed the cancerous banking cells and let the rest of the body starve in other words feed the billionaires more billions and promise that a little trickle of the blood being pumped into those large tumors will somehow leak out to feed the rest of the body what we now have become is a grotesque wobbling blob of cancer masses on the table that is an embarrassment to ourselves as a once great nation because anything that once resembled healthy free markets has atrophied almost completely fed co has to keep feeding the cancer cells to keep them living enough for the occasional spark of electricity to make them bounce and look alive because the real market based economy shriveled to almost nothing years ago the cancer is just about all that is left of us the evidence of this outcome is that corporations have to keep feeding their own stocks with stock buybacks financed by the fed s cheap money to billionaires because actual revenue growth from middle class customers died on the operating table their stocks are going up but their vital signs have been going down for a long time the fed feeds the whole world with its dollars yet the whole world economy is collapsing us banks have to keep feeding their government s wobbling fat cells by buying up greater and greater rounds of government debt which requires dr fed to keep soaking that debt up because its own member banks are becoming so bloated with government treasuries they are reluctant to take treasuries as collateral for overnight repo loans any longer they are stuffed with treasuries but short on cash used to buy those treasuries a burden laid upon them the whole world has been reduced to a quivering mass of cancer cells as purple as my prose and tubes all with connections to back fed labs similar situations have developed throughout the world why would it fail how could we know because of one primary reason that history should have taught us all centrally planned economies with their manipulated markets have never been the ones in which human beings thrive the central geniuses no matter which human beings you choose or which ones anoint themselves do not ever have the brain power and never will to manage something as intricately complex as a national economy think about it the fed has been desperately trying to drive stock and bond markets forever upward what if those market s smartest course was to go down for awhile but the fed just wouldn t let it happen because it doesn t want that going down is what the great recession accomplished our goal from there should have been cutting out all the cancer and corruption and fixing regulations that were stripped away putting bad debts to death etc but not juicing up markets to try to fake life and pretend that it was still going on just because we can zap the blob on the table with some lightning and make it jump and quiver markets went down because they were too high to be supported by economic fundamentals in the first place houses for example priced at their peak were not affordable under wages that had long failed to rise more of the trickle down economics that hadn t gotten wages to rise any in the past score of years certainly was not going to do so in the next ten yet that s what we bought into capital gains tax cuts that hadn t built any factories in the us as we continually witnessed a net outflow to every other part of the world certainly were not going to turn life around here in these united states these things should have been obvious we needed major economic repairs we opted for fake life instead we never never woke up we ve been lying on the operating table for ten years but we re afraid we ll die without dr fed humans seem to think life needs their centralized control but it does not no group of humans should ever be given the level of economic control that we continually give to dr fed and his assistants there is certainly a place for regulations and regulatory agencies to establish and maintain level and fair playing fields among corrupt human beings in fact the tear down of glass steagall which largely kept banks out of stock markets remains a huge part of the problem but there is no place for regulators to be the leaders playing the markets in order to run them in certain directions that the leaders feel is right for everyone because they fear pain too especially when you give these regulators the ability to create infinite amounts of cash as they see fit with the ability to zap infinite cash into being on a computer chip and the ability to play in markets via your member banks you can corner and control every market that uses your electrical currency the fed has engineered the biggest monstrosity you could ever hope not to see and my goal is to try to get people to wake up and see what they don t want to see and to support your arguments in the same battle so we collectively stop giving the fed the power to do what it keeps doing because it is still we the people in this democracy that keep electing two parties who both equally assure the federal reserve s role in doing all of this the patron post that laid it all out for 2019 in my last article i said i d lay out the predictions i originally made for 2019 in my first patron post as a way to recap the year and review how i did or did not i ve decided to just make that post accessible to everyone now that the end of the year is here so you can judge it for yourself i think it might be fun for critics and supporters both to see if the hits outweigh the misses in your own mind bearing in mind no one bats a thousand and i did not either i m not a prophet just someone trying to see deduct where the trends are going so of course i have some misses for the purpose of my own internal audit as i reflect on that post i have to consider whether or not i will venture more predictions based on how well those turned out mostly i ll be looking at how well the main event turned out that s a two parter a major repo crash which i later said would cause a recession starting most likely at the end of summer due to diminished bank reserves as i ve qualified all along we won t be able to accurately evaluate those predictions until late in january 2020 at the earliest because that is when most of the stats for the final quarter of 2019 start to come in if i m off by much i ll try to stop myself from making predictions because i genuinely don t believe the world needs false prophets of any kind including those who turn out to false prophets about false profits i can still write on the economic events of the the day without projecting where i think they are leading should my ability at triangulating trajectories prove to be failing i point it out now because one big reveal could happen at the turn of the year as my previous articles about the monster that i and some others call the repocalypse have talked about though the fed has done a lot more than i thought it would to prevent that the very fact that it has scrambled to such an enormously visible degree says a lot about how serious it really became no one doubts this has been the fed s biggest repo crisis in its history i referred to 2018 as the year of the bear in the article that i m now going to give you access to as i spoke about where things were going with stocks and other economic and political matters in the newly dawning 2019 that would follow the arrival of that little bear in stocks which also would have been a very very great bear had the fed not slammed the brakes on its interest increases and promised to back off on its tightening now it has even gone back to interest cuts and easing the total opposite of all it originally claimed it would do the article covers many anticipated headwinds for the year just passed but you ll see its central motif was the crisis that was coming to bank reserves because of that tightening and how that might play through other markets i clearly didn t believe stocks would do as well as they did however i also did not predict any further crash than the one that timed out as expected in the december that had just passed i mention that because i m sometimes accused of having predicted a market crash in 2019 and you can see from the article that i did not my focus in the article moved quickly away from the big events that had just happened in stocks to looking at the big events i expected to occur in the repo world in 2019 noting that would be where the action developed for the next significant stage in the collapse of dr frankenfed s fake recovery my focus on this blog has always been what is happening to the overall economy and its fundamental supports and where the economy is going not how to play the stock market this is not an investment blog and it has never pretended to be one however when as in 2018 i think the stock market will be the major economic news of the year then of course i will lay all of that out for 2019 however i said the big bad activity would in the banking world particularly showing up in repos and other growing credit problems i can t say i precisely caught how the repo crisis would play out in all of its particulars i did not but the belief that it would develop into the biggest set of economic problems to emerge in 2019 especially later in the year plays throughout the article if it takes half a trillion dollars to build a dike against them they are clearly a flood that would have overwhelmed us since that is comparable in size to what wwe saw at the start of the great recession only all aimed at repo since it was on the last day of 2018 going into the first day of 2019 that the repo crisis poked one eye above the water for the first time now is the perfect time to review that article we had seen ripples on the surface prior to that in the form of bubbling fed funds rates which i noted from time to time but not the actual monster as we come to that same annual turn in a few more days where we first saw the monster we ll get to see whether or not the fed s half trillion dollar cocktail of financial medicine has taken the evil out of the beast it created or if the beast is about to transmogrify into something more horrific for future warning let me just say that even if it appears the fed has chopped off the monster s head as we roar into the twenties don t be surprised if it grows another one don t be like the cliche fool in the horror films who thinks the monster is really dead as he stands by its disembodied head with its claws twitching near his feet even after he s seen how nearly impossible is this monster to kill the fed s frantic medicine is all designed to be temporary as if the fed thinks this is a temporary problem if the fed does not keep rolling the temps along into perms a new head will rapidly emerge maybe by tax day in fact i strongly suspect tax day concerns are why the fed has said it will continue purchasing short term treasuries until april of 2020 it wants the program to be up to full support by this december 30th and to remain that full until april 15th while pretending probably even to itself in denial that it can fade the intervention after that the fed can never fade the robust intervention it has been forced to make while the president taunted the fed head for his incompetence just know the monster the fed has created has many lives all of them dead ones like zombies sparked into animation by dr fed s lightning quick flash cash generator so if the fed doesn t move decidedly back to lasting qe the monster will be back to haunt us again next time banks have large seasonal transactional needs all of which is not to say the repocalypse will not return in time for this happy new year regardless of dr fed s interventions to try to medicate and mediate the damage of its monstrosity it is more to say that if such grand interventions do keep the monster from biting us this new year still do not comfortably join the comatose we have not resolved the insidious disease that runs throughout our body not one bit we have all of that work yet to do hiding under the covers does not kill the monster or the unrestrained ungodly doctor who keeps recreating it
economic expansions are most often killed off by rising interest rates or financial crashes surprises that cause economy wide demand for goods and services to fall rarer is the supply side recession in which economies are deprived of their productive capacity not since the oil price shocks of the 1970s has there been a global downturn that can be attributed primarily to supply yet if a worldwide slump happens in 2020 it may fall into that category because it will have been caused primarily by the trade barriers erected between china and america the trade war between the two countries intensified for most of 2019 when it had been expected to come to an end relations eased a little in october 2019 with the postponement of some tariffs but an end to hostilities is some way off it remains possible that the average tariff on american imports could start the new year at 6 easily the highest this century moreover tariffs are expanding to cover imports for which there are fewer ready substitutes firms and their supply chains are being forced to make disruptive adjustments which will eventually bubble up and spill over into the broader economy history offers little guidance as to what a trade war recession looks like or what the right policy response is nor it seems is economic theory much use it predicts that tariffs like all supply side disruptions will be inflationary in fact the most visible effects of the trade war to date have been declining business confidence a global manufacturing slump and tepid investment inflation expectations have been falling as have long term interest rates that makes the slowdown look more normal an upside of this is that the right policy response becomes clearer economies will need stimulus america s federal reserve has already cut interest rates and the european central bank ecb has restarted quantitative easing qe while chinese policymakers have eased both monetary and fiscal policy yet rich world central banks are running up against limits on monetary policy interest rates in europe are already negative and the ecb cannot buy bonds for ever without hitting legal constraints the fed does not have much more room to cut rates the only central banks that look free to support their economies are those in emerging markets where rates are higher and looser fed policy is a boon because it removes downward pressure on their currencies turnover among top global officials is a further source of uncertainty christine lagarde is taking over at the ecb though she shares the doveishness of her predecessor mario draghi she will struggle to hold together the central bank s governing council as its northern members become ever more agitated by negative rates and bond buying britain is due a new bank of england governor to replace mark carney kristalina georgieva a senior world bank official has replaced ms lagarde at the helm of the imf and america s presidential election will have profound implications for both the trade war and economic policy if donald trump is re elected investors might anticipate an assault on the fed s independence which includes replacing jerome powell its head with a more pliant figure when his term expires in 2022 a democrat in the white house by contrast might reverse mr trump s tax cuts and mount an assault on the rich either way american monetary policy will enter a period of flux in 2020 the fed will finish a review of its monetary policy framework it will probably commit to targeting 2 inflation on average over the economic cycle as a whole rather than all the time tolerating inflation overshoots after a downturn should allow it to fight a slump more aggressively the fed must also grapple with the consequences of having unwound qe in recent years by making central bank money scarce this has recently caused trouble in overnight money markets the fed will expand its balance sheet again to ease the cash shortage and ensure the transmission of its monetary policy through the financial system a scary scenario a recession is not inevitable in many countries especially america healthy labour markets and confident consumers are bulwarks against one yet these defences are beginning to show cracks and there is a worst case scenario that should worry central bankers everywhere that the trade war turns inflationary after all perhaps compounded by rising oil prices even as growth slows the world economy is teetering on the brink of an unfamiliar type of downturn with central banks in a period of flux it is an uncomfortable position to be in this article appears in the world in 2020 our annual edition that looks at the year ahead see more at worldin economist com

men make their own history but they do not make it just as they please they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves but under circumstances directly encountered from the past the tradition of all the dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brain of the living max 1852 1970 15 if we must understand the possible future direction of the society and make it under circumstances directly encountered from the past as said by marx we must therefore attune to dig deeper into the current trends of nature with this and digging deeper into the past and microscoping the current trend of liberia once can safely conclude that george weah and his cabal of state looters are product of historical accident noting to argue the ascendancy of the current regime is an historical accidental packaged and imposed on the people by their class oppressors of course that element is madam ellen johnson sireleaf the sirleafs then used the anger of the people and bought their ignorance of governance to further protect she and her cryonics it then became a necessity to the people to throw liberia to the dogs as it stands we can t locate the flash neither the bones of the states it is now palpable that the current intense human suffering and the crumbled economic structures coupled with an unworkable policy of the weah s government is nothing for him to worry on he sees them as irrelevant and trivial to issues for us it is not a surprise we saw him long ago as a carpenter captaining a cargo ship over a deep sea in the midst harden poverty this president took the airwave only to tell the people how he and some politicians eat at one another house a total display of immense leadership tragedy nearly two years as president of the state he further exposed his least understanding of complicated governance issues especially in a troubling economic and political time like ours this president who has only spoken to the people through a prerecorded and edited audio since his ascendency to the highest seat of the motherland took the airwave on friday december 20 2019 and spewed out compiled gibberish to an unimaginable zenith the interview was nothing but a serious national embarrassment with an irreplaceable damage to the image of state it further validates our consistent argument that president weah swims in idea and leadership insolvency we still doubt that this bankruptcy is even repairable with this go with us as we dig into mr weah s interview comrades people are laid off wages has being unreasonably reduced and persistently delayed inflation is an all time high of 31 30 percent as of august 2019 and the citizens are struggling to cope with prices of commodities as they keep sky rocketing with all of these the president seems not be in control to him the economy pitfall is a nature force the crises are therefore normal as stated by him during his interview such statement that the current crisis of the state is normal sounds hysterical and irreverent to mass of the struggling people who has been relegated further to the dungeon of unrecoverable poverty by mr george weah and his gang of incompetent bigots mr weah need to know that no crises in human history are normal all crises are initiated by enforcing contradictions and other imposing conditions that act on the existing condition therefore the prevailing economic condition of the state is not normal it is a condition melted on our people by you and your predecessor it has become complicated due to the inability of your administration to find a genuine solution we therefore reject your claim that the current situation of the state is normal in a country where the leaders lives with deceptions it signifies dancing on a rope over a deadly valley president weah is that character he is dangling in blatant falsehood and diabolical deceptions he has chosen to run the nation as gangster paradise he befriends corruption with smile and openly frowns on transparency he parades with lies and pompousness while milking the sucking the resources of the state an outcome of chosen an inexperienced carpenter to captain a cargo ship over a deep sea indeed the result will be nothing but a disaster mr president you are noted for poor proper recollection of the past we can therefore not get tire reminding you on january 22 2018 delivering your first legislature agenda to the 54th legislature in the joint chambers of the capitol you asserted that the country s economy is broken and by extension the government on the contrary your predecessor madam sirleaf debunked you on february 13 2018 that the national coffers are not empty with this response your government is yet to respond to madam sirleaf neither have you commissioned a comprehensive audit of her regime another lie pulled out shamelessly by the president is the circumstances surrounding the missing sixteen billion liberia dollars and the twenty five millions united states dollars misapplied by him and samuel tweh he stated in his interview that the l 16billion came in the country but not under his administration here again we see the president as messenger of lies abusing the patience of the people how can president weah tell the public that his administration never received 16 billion when said funds was taken from the freeport of monrovia on march 2 2018 is this not him who was inaugurated on january 22 2018 as the president of liberia of course it is mr weah again we hold weah and his gang of looters solely responsible for our missing billions he is the chief culprit noting can t convince us that president weaah and the cdc are innocent of our missing billion not even an adapted report that was intended to seizure him from public persecution the president s interview was just outrageous as the existing contradictions under his administration the president sat on the radio and rang praises on a samuel tweh the man who looted us 25 million and this president wants us to believe that the current economic crisis is normal no it is not how can you choose to protect a certified thief who manages the fiscal affairs of the state and wants the citizens to believe that the current economic crisis is normal this is a total mockery the president claims that people don t have confidence in the banks you want the people to trust a system that does not meet up with their demand in the midst of an unbearable hardship you create an artificial shortage of money to make the citizens feel that there is true shortage of liberian dollars the banks are holding on to the people money they are losing their friends and relative to death starvation is eating up people their kids are thrown out of school they can t respond to their daily economic demand and you want them to trust this system that does not work for the poor mr president it is now time that you transition from comicality to puffer a matured statesmanship governing a state like liberia is not the same as pushing a round object for ninety minutes when the country has an excessively corrupt and dysfunctional system the president becomes the chief priest of lies and messenger of hate president weah is indeed a chief priest of falsehood his tongue dances better than his legs on his recent interview he said his government does not support war and economy crime court on the contrary this same president wrote the national legislature on september 12 2019 asking them to provide guidance on all legislative and other necessary measures towards the implementation of the truth reconciliation trc report including the establishment of the war and economic crimes court this same president repeated his call for war and economic crimes courts when he addressed world leaders at the un general assembly in september of this year again we can say his recent rejection to bring the perpetrators of crime against humanity to justice by establishing the war and economic crime courts proves that mr weah does act on facts but instant and emotion that dictate to his current position thee impact of his decision is never a concern to him comrades mr weah and the cdc have plundered the state into mess he can t escape his indictment in the court of public persecution he must account the time is not what matters the present condition will inform the next move of the people it is a fact mr weah is a very simple footballing president he does not understand the nuances of complicated governance issue his responses to critical questions as seen in his last interview is a total shame the government is a mixture of incompetent and loosed talking bureaucrats the appointed officials of the government are impressionists who serve not to improve the material condition of the people but to facilitate mass looting of state resources indeed liberia has fallen the economy is crumbling the health system is in ruins the working class labor daily but can t get their poverty wages sadly we have a president that is yet to wake up from his slumber during his interview mr weah elected to praise his predecessor madam sirleaf the political thief who robbed the liberian people of their votes to give him power a sirleaf who along with her clique of thieves looted and bankrupted the national oil company of liberia nocal and other state s resources a sirleaf that embraced nepotism and cronyism with no regard to the rule of law a sirleaf that embraced corruption as her working tool you praise this sirleaf but criticize her party it baffles us to query the difference between madam sirleaf and the unity party the belief that weah and his gang of thieves will deliver liberians from gloomy poverty to prosperity is an illusion that only makes sense to his zealots who have dug themselves in the mud blind sycophancy mr weah is a fair product of fraud and political conspiracy he lacks what it takes to understand the nuances of a complicated governance issue especially in a troubling time like this by all means what mr weah spewed out on december 20 2019 during his purported live radio interview did not in any way surprise us we long predicted mr weah our call to the masses is to remain resilient and battle the excess mess created by madam sirleaf and complicated by his imposed the masses are the makers of history at the point of objective condition they will liberate themselves through the guidance of conscious patriots

american writer saying that the holidays can be stressful what with all the people events and spending many of us worry about is a cliché but even if it is at least this time of year imposes the

oddly with trying to round up records for your tax returns it sort of refamiliarizes you with who you are or at least where you came from back when i was around 12 my parents a couple of my siblings and i spent the new year s weekend in jackson n h where we skied clumsily a bit and stayed at a b b but called an inn the place was owned by an episcopal minister he was quite funny on new year s morning he greeted everyone with a boisterous happy feast of the circumcision but it was clear how hard the couple had to work to keep their little business going ministering so to speak to the almost 24 7 needs and desires of their about 15 guests e g directions to local ski areas and other attractions drugstores and doctors cocktails but not too many for the adults and huge breakfasts for all it was an early introduction to the challenges of running a small business xxx after a day and night of very subfreezing temperatures it got to about 40 degrees the other week and i spotted a small fly

mental health is eroding and we seem to hate everyone else gerard baker in his dec 20 21 essay in the wall street journal farewell to the 2010s the uneasy decade of populism a few years ago we had a nice family to lunch they re a very internationalized crew anyway what struck me in almost comic form was that they were spending much of the meal on their new smartphones making global travel plans and otherwise communicating with the wide world the very ugly table around which we sat by the way has quite a history it was made in a french military prison in lebanon in the 1920s my wife bought it off the daughter of the french army officer in charge of the prison i thought of that meal the other day when i came upon a story in the atlantic magazine about landline phones before smartphones most households had one or at the most two phones families had to share them and the phones were generally in such public places as the living room the kitchen or the front hall so there was much less privacy than with cell phones and so more communal family knowledge now phones tend to keep us separated but then this is part of a broader tendency to eschew physical person to person communication in favor of communication via screens by making it easier to avoid having to become habituated to real face to face contact these digital devices seem to lead to more and more people being anxious when for instance being interviewed in person not on skype for jobs hr people tell me that some young job applicants avoid looking at their interviewers in the eyes i m old enough to remember when small towns had party lines that enabled operators of what was called the phone company a tightly regulated monopoly to monitor phone calls and do such things as telling pranksters usually kids to hang up or to call an ambulance it was truly a community service it wasn t always a very efficient system but it could be pretty entertaining and some family disasters were averted through the heroic efforts of operators at their switchboards to read the atlantic s article please hit this link lost lunches a cousin of this phenomenon is the dearth of working people taking the time or being allowed

called the conventional wisdom or the general consensus most turn out to be wrong in varying degrees because there are so many variables in real life although we have computers that process data at

statistician former options trader and risk analyst who has deeply studied randomness probability and uncertainty read his 2007 book the black swan consider the black swan called 9 11 which changed so much it caused wars reduced our civil liberties made travel more difficult and encouraged already dubious u s fiscal and monetary policies that helped create the crash of 2008 and the great recession which helped set the table for donald trump and digitization continuously speeds up changes which affects all of life back in the 60s british prime minister harold wilson was quoted as saying a week is a long time in politics now you can say that a day is a long time in politics in the economy and elsewhere 2020 will feature lots of dramatic headlines and near hysterical breaking news on electronic media most of it will end up forgotten in days except by a few people most directly affected such as relatives of those killed in plane crashes the vast majority of such headlined stories have no effect on the course of history the article that may turn out to have the most long term significance might be buried on the bottom of page 13 of a newspaper i always liked the crazy poet ezra pound s remark that literature is news that stays news xxx of course there s the very political year of 2020 with perhaps more black swans than usual perhaps the fat and old trump will keel over to be succeeded by his robotic valet mike pence perhaps the old but not fat joe biden will die perhaps the mostly gop run u s supreme court will surprise us and force the release of trump s financial records one thing s for sure the word conservative will continue to be misused by those in trump s tribe many of whom tend to be in the strongman cult neofascist camp traditional conservatism opposes rapid changes and promotes honoring civic minded traditions including civility and public integrity while abhorring demagoguery it also respects careful economics pay as you go and not ever deepening deficits traditional conservatism perhaps best exemplified by the writings of edmund burke emphasizes the need for the principles of a transcendent moral order so much for that these days xxx so as always there s lots of stuff to be stressed about in the public square as we head into the new year the best way to deal with it is to concentrate on the things that remain almost entirely private for us including enjoying the daily beauties around us such as while walking on a bright cold dry still late january day and noticing it s staying light later and tightly ration tv watching and social media use and so it goes of course the crazy joseph giachello who murdered one person julie lynn cardinal and injured two other people in westerly and then killed himself had no trouble buying a

rifle association and the national republican party and that so many guns are around anyway americans must simply accept the inevitability of shootings like the one is usually peaceful westerly view larger david lehman perhaps unfortunately a former goldman sachs partner has some interesting ideas about how to boost still rich connecticut s economy and particularly how to lift its troubled cities gov ned lamont a democrat has named mr lehman to be commissioner of the nutmeg state s department of economic and community development he may have some lessons for rhode island and massachusetts some of his ideas are predictable such as improving commuter rail service and the roads more and closer partnerships with colleges and universities and boosting job training for growing occupations such as health care software and engineering but what has jumped out is that instead of handing out tax breaks and other financial incentives to get companies to move to or expand in the nutmeg state he d have the state hand out these goodies only after they created well paid jobs bloomberg news noted that would be a gamble in the current relentless arms race among states and localities to lure jobs but connecticut with its location between the two thriving at the moment economic powerhouses of new york and boston might be better placed than most states to succeed with this new strategy mr lehman also wants to encourage a resurgence of the state s cities which with exceptions in some parts of them e g the area around yale in new haven are in poor shape he wants policies that would double the populations of its cities which now range from 100 000 and 150 000 over a 25 year period he told bloomberg we ve got the suburban and rural thing covered new economic growth will be in these higher density transit oriented developments note that as in massachusetts and a lesser extent in rhode island the growing emphasis is on using mass transit to maintain and spur prosperity back when i lived in connecticut in the 60s its cities still had large and stable middle class populations in large part because of a still thriving industrial sector mr lehman will be a hero if he can bring the middle class back to these places meanwhile the rhetoric continues about masses of millionaires said to be fleeing connecticut and other high tax states to move to florida of course some people do move because of taxes but the phenomenon is exaggerated i know a bunch of these folks as this commentary from the left leaning institute on taxation and economic policy notes m most millionaires are married are more likely to have children and are economically and socially tied to where they made their money in connecticut s case many in nearby manhattan they benefit from where they are living because they have home field advantage they know the area have connections and most are working rich and moving could actually set them back in their career and productivity there is a reason they chose to live there in the first place whether that be career opportunities the education and public services offered or overall quality of life by the time they are making enough to think about moving to save on their taxes they are already deeply embedded into their communities and living comfortably enough that the state tax savings at stake would not fundamentally change their quality of life even if they somehow did find a way to continue earning a very large income in a new locale the people who do tend to move most frequently are young college graduates and the lowest income residents looking for higher pay and a better quality of life and state tax rates are not central in these groups decision making of more interest to me is what the long term impact of all these people moving to florida will be on the sunshine state s taxes will a growing demand for services lead it to impose an income tax to pay for them and what will be the effect of rising seas from global

pensions investments 19 april 2010 if problems arise you ll have the world bank on your side mr vaughan smith said photo skip o donnell by drew carter european pension funds are investing in global farmland with a focus on emerging markets allocations to farmland tend to be small typically less than one tenth of 1 of total assets but pension fund officials like the investments for the low correlation to other asset classes and the targeted annual real returns of 10 or more and while earlier farmland investments were made directly the more recent investments are being done through funds that aim to capture returns on crops livestock or other agriculture products as well as appreciating land values farmland is one of the most interesting investment options arising in the past couple of years said jelle beenen partner at mercer llc and head of its financial strategy group in the netherlands in a very rough estimate mr beenen put total dutch pension fund assets in farmland at 2 5 billion to 3 billion 3 4 billion to 4 1 billion the total dutch pension market is 740 billion pension funds that have made global farmland investments include the 208 billion stichting pensioenfonds abp heerlen netherlands the 84 3 billion pensioenfonds zorg en welzijn zeist netherlands and the 206 5 billion swedish kronor 28 8 billion ap fonden 3 stockholm algemene pensioen groep nv which manages assets of abp began looking into farmland in 2007 as part of a push for innovation at the money management firm which manages 240 billion in total apg has a few hundred million euros invested in farmland primarily in latin america australia new zealand and eastern europe said jos lemmens senior portfolio manager commodities at apg basically the world is our farm mr lemmens said choosing a country or region for investments just depends on the specific project and whether the risk return profile is right he said farmland can be a better way of getting exposure to soft commodities such as wheat or corn because farmland returns are less volatile than commodity futures annual returns of 8 to 12 are expected on average with some riskier countries and or crops expected to deliver 20 he said russia and ukraine ap3 has invested 267 million swedish kronor in publicly traded companies that invest in farmland primarily in russia and to a lesser extent ukraine said christina kusoffsky hillesoy the fund s head of communications and sustainable investments two examples of these companies are alpcot agro and black earth farming ltd each of which buys farmland in eastern europe and oversees management on the land it s a very small part of our portfolio ms hillesoy said adding that fund officials like the diversification farmland brings to the portfolio we also believe there s a high potential for high returns in the farmland industry she declined to disclose the fund s returns on farmland investments which were made in 2008 pfzw had allocated up to 50 million to new york based nch capital inc which also invests in russian and ukrainian farmland as of dec 31 2008 the most recent data available officials at apg ap3 and pfzw all cited portfolio diversification as the primary reason for investing in farmland with possible inflation protection being a secondary reason pension fund officials emphasized they are careful to ensure farmland investments follow best practices for environmentally and socially responsible investing it is a long term investment so we want it to be as sustainable and environmentally responsible as possible apg s mr lemmens said we wouldn t want to be involved in unsustainable palm oil production for example we try to do the right thing while developed countries typically offer more political stability land prices are usually high and farming techniques are advanced but in developing countries managers can raise values by consolidating farms and boosting production in these countries managers also aim to add value by building businesses around farming and for those who view farmland as a socially responsible investment by helping build wealth and improve farming techniques within local communities however developing countries also present political risks and that has prevented many institutional investors from taking the leap into farmland investing said ken jones a lincoln england based director in agriculture investing and valuation at real estate broker savills plc i m sure it s going to come but it s early days at the moment mr jones said few from u k many investors and managers in the u k have started looking for farmland opportunities but few have pulled the trigger experts said in fact schroders plc dumped plans for a 250 million 387 million publicly traded global farmland fund it announced in august 2008 a schroders spokeswoman declined to provide additional information u k pension funds after having mostly abandoned direct farmland investments in the 1990s are beginning to show some interest in emerging market farmland investments however interest among european pension funds especially in the netherlands and nordic region is becoming much more widespread said reza vishkai head of specialist investments at insight investment management global ltd london now you re seeing a lot of interest in it as an asset class for pension funds he said insight which manages assets of 88 1 billion is gathering investments for its first farmland fund the fund structure which is new for farmland investments demands much less governance by pension funds than do direct investments and also allows for a global approach which improves diversification mr vishkai said also typically funds have a more active investment angle he said for example managers can boost land values by consolidating farms and enhancing farm production through using better equipment seeds and techniques london based silverstreet capital llp is launching a 300 million fund in june that will invest in farmland in africa but it also looks to create supply and processing businesses off the initial investment said gary vaughan smith silverstreet s chief investment officer by helping surrounding farmers improve techniques the fund will create demand for fertilizer for example or become the natural buyer of excess grain plans include developing tilapia fish farms fed off the grains raised at nearby farms farmland funds in africa often focus on sustainability or social responsibility south africa based futuregrowth asset management ltd expects to raise 400 million for its old mutual african agricultural fund a closed end fund with a three year lockup that invests in farmland in south africa and other countries in sub saharan africa as part of a government plan to return farmland to black farmers the fund will buy land at approximately 80 of its current value train locals in advanced farming techniques then sell the land back to the government at 100 of current value plus inflation increases the interest of the fund is totally from a socially responsible point of view said james howard cape town based fund manager at futuregrowth a boutique within old mutual investment group sa that manages 100 billion rand 13 7 billion the fund is targeting investments from european institutional investors especially in the netherlands savills mr jones said he expects successful funds to be either publicly traded or closed end where investors know they are locked in for a longer period before anyone invests now they want to know how to exit mr jones said it s the first thing they want to know fundamental attraction farmland is an attractive investment because of secular fundamentals experts say agricultural commodity prices which boomed in 2008 still haven t risen in real terms for decades meanwhile the growth in population and wealth will increase demand for food while the supply of farmland is limited but risks especially political risks loom large when investing in developing countries at hewitt associates consultants feel farmland is too narrow and illiquid an investment for pension funds that s not to say we don t think that the theme behind farmland isn t interesting we think agriculture is interesting and worth exploring said tim currell investment consultant at hewitt based in leeds england at the moment our focus is on playing the agriculture theme through equities because it s something familiar to pension schemes and because it s liquid messrs vaughan smith and howard admit that political risks in africa are significant but can be mitigated by investing in multiple countries also both plan to use insurance offered by the world bank s multilateral investment guarantee agency if problems arise you ll have the world bank on your side mr vaughan smith said they re going to have enormous clout if there are any difficulties miga currently holds total exposure of 7 5 billion 864 million of which is in the agribusiness manufacturing services and tourism sector and has backed projects worth 21 billion since its inception in 1988 contact drew carter at
chris martenson good riddance to the twenty teens this is my last report from the good old twenty teens in some respects they didn t turn out at all like i thought they would but in many others exactly as predicted i badly underestimated the system s ability to perpetuate obvious frauds and swindles without causing a social rebellion and worse to watch so many otherwise intelligent people participate with glee negative interest rates back in 2008 when the crash course first came out you would have never convinced me that we d be sitting here at the cusp of 2020 with 11 trillion of negative yielding debt i have to place that phrase in quotation marks because although i can write those words i haven t a clue what they actually mean in a world where money is supposed to be a store of value how can money in the future be worth less than money today perhaps pablo escobar could help us here as he reputedly factored in a 10 loss on all his buried cash due to rats water damage mold or forgetting where he placed it thee twenty teens saw the extinguishment of bond vigilantes leaving nobody to seriously push back on the abomination of negative rates only speculators are left these days perfectly happy to place the bet that they ll be able to sell their negative yielding bonds to a greater fool at a higher price there s no such thing as a bond vigilante anymore only speculators perfectly happy to pull on a slot machine lever in the hopes of selling their negative yielding bonds to some other punter later on at a higher price paying any government to lend it money is a swindle buying greek national debt with a lower rate of return than us treasury debt is a swindle these and a thousand others completely obvious swindles and yet here we are with the vast machinery of state and corporate journalism aligned to tell you how good and right they all are shale oil i also underestimated the longevity of the recent shale oil boom i studied it intently early on concluded it was a money losing enterprise and then patiently waited for investors to wake up to that reality this realization has been slow to dawn on them but it s finally becoming understood slowly grudgingly however that s after 10 years of massive losses for hapless investors in the shale oil space shale company bond and equity holders have been slaughtered though those vast losses are yet to be recognized the reason while the capital raised from bond sales and equity offerings has already been spent so are the wells that were drilled with that money they re played out raising new capital merely obscures that any money that has not already been returned to investors can t be and won t be because of this dynamic source what does the above chart tell us only that the very best shale operator in the world operating in the very best shale play in the world sees an 82 decline rate in average well output in the first year which means that if that well has not entirely paid itself back within that first year it probably won t generate any returns for bond or shareholders to enjoy ever it also means that all the debt and equity capital poured into the ground between 2008 2017 is now invested in wells that are effectively depleted bluntly if the returns have not already happened on those monies they probably never will how could they the wells are mostly drained the table below shows the equity losses for a small sampling of afflicted companies hundreds of other shale companies have already gone completely bankrupt with similar staggering bond losses to investors it still doesn t make sense to me that the obvious cash destroying financial math of shale oil has proven so misunderstood that an entire decade has passed before the media and wall street have started to catch on live and learn old barnum there s a sucker born every minute new barnum investors are the best suckers there are more amazingly there has been such a rush to rip the shale oil out of the ground that the accompanying natural gas is simply burned off into the night sky all that lost fossil energy will never be used constructively other than signaling to the wider universe how moronically wasteful we ve been with a precious resource as a dec 24 2019 bloomberg article put it producers in the permian are already flaring record levels of natural gas the texas railroad commission which oversees the oil and gas industry in the state has granted nearly 6 000 permits allowing explorers to flare or vent natural gas this year that s more than 40 times as many permits granted at the start of the supply boom a decade ago source that was 6 000 opportunities to not be moronic and we passed on every single one there will come a time in the not too distant future when people will look back shake their heads and pass harsh judgment on the generations involved with wasting so much precious energy unless in dr seuss book the lorax the hero warns of the self destructive impacts of industrial and consumer exploitation of the natural world and its denizens the book ends with a final warning unless unless our destructive practices are halted and reversed much of the natural world will disappear forever never to return gone is gone man the distressing trends in the environment warned of in the lorax and in the crash course have sadly only become gotten predictably worse over this past decade i hate being right about those meanwhile i see a lot of people fretting about if how various carbon emission targets are going to be met let me alleviate the suspense they re not every single economically retrievable lump of coal and molecule of oil and gas is going to be extracted and burnt before we give up our addition to fossil fuel why because without energy nothing is possible especially our ridiculously comfortable lives of massive over consumption and fossil fuels remain unmatched in their net energy returns compared to today s alternatives even australia s current shattering of all its heat records with growing swaths of the continent literally aflame hasn t managed to trip any alarms in the skull of the australian pm scott morrison whose single major policy initiative on the matter was to enact harsh new penalties on any australians who might protest against the coal industry no one cares until you threaten to dampen corporate profits or impede the unchecked march of break neck resource extraction if you do then you re branded a threat a terrorist or indulgent and selfish in the words of mr morrison after all what could be more indulgent and selfish than advising we proceed with caution so as to protect society s future prospects in a post peak world we re probably not going to be seeing too many bananas way up north where i live in january and i m pretty sure the current ones individually wrapped in plastic won t be available any more there s something so offensive about an individually wrapped banana that it strikes

trouble soils continue to erode species are disappearing and weather events are getting more and more chaotic only a fool would build or re build as the case often is in a 500 year flood plain we can now count on those to be routinely swamped yet as a completely non sensical counter to all this the central banks of the world led by the fed have mounted a particularly spirited effort to make the wealthy insanely wealthier and by every measure they have not only succeeded but are determined to top their former high scores fed tastic one thing i never ever not once ever foresaw was the markets being a ok with the massive distortions the world central banking cartel has saddled the world with over the past decade 15 trillion in new currency printed from thin air the cramming of interest rates to 5 000 year lows negative interest rates the complete perversion of price discovery all in the service of making a very very few wealthy people even wealthier all while absolutely screwing the former middle classes slow roasting pensions and destroying the retirement dreams of millions living on a fixed income despite the fact the 99 9 of all journalists are decidedly not in the camp of the winners here they nonetheless take pains to never ask a single tricky question of the fed nor ask anything about its stated policy of robbing from the many to give to the few here s a still shot of the media over the past ten years engaging with the fed after ten years of non stop interventions the central banks have created the worst asset price bubble in history and are now trapped to try to keep it from popping they re being forced to use increasingly desperate measures not seen since the hairy depths of the worst moments of the great financial crisis over the past decade the markets morphed into markets which then metastasized into markets they are now so perversified that they are well and truly markets signifying that they lack any resemblance to a place where honest participants set honest prices collectively the world s central banks have undertaken more emergency easing than at any point in time since ever global central banks have cut interest rates roughly 90 times over the past year the largest cumulative easing since the financial crisis according to canadian imperial bank of commerce data while the fed accounted for three of those taking its policy rate down to a range of 1 5 to 1 75 that s still higher than much of the rest of the developed world including japan and europe where rates are near or even below zero it s very hard for the average foreign investor to survive we re still at a point now where it s max desperation source bloomberg how about that feeling better yet i certainly don t but don t tell the stock markets which are now

evil twin operated a utility he d operate the us equity markets while the average household in the us slips farther and farther behind going deeper and deeper into debt the fed congratulates its efforts believing it s doing god s work again here s the media on all this at this point you really ought to be asking yourself why exactly are the world s central banks led by the fed freaking out so badly right now as we close out the twenty teens all i can say is you d better start working on providing the basics for yourself and your family because when this credit cycle finally ends it s going to be horrible which is precisely what the central bankers know too while you and i may share in that knowledge it remains unacceptable to talk about in public the overton window does not allow for such talk anywhere and certainly never in the mainstream media which is on track to close out the twenty teens having failed in its fourth estate duties more comprehensively than any other press cohort in history the end of magnificent folly there s a great emergency happening right now but society is not acknowledging it the social mood is darkening fourth turning style and people are protesting and risking life career and limb to express their anxiety and frustration with the policies of team elite but don t expect to hear about that on the nightly news or in the mainstream press the economy is doing so great that central banks are applying record breaking amounts of funny money stimulus to counter something or more accurately to avoid something i hold the view that people are organisms and that we re wired to know when our nest is getting fouled our instincts honed over millions of years of evolution are to migrate to a new less polluted or played out home that only makes sense but the problem is that now there s nowhere new to go no next valleys no unpolluted corner to wander off to and inhabit for a while so those of us who are of an age and remember when a porch light left on for an august night would attract a zootopia of strange and wonderful insects to our screen doors how many of you are now deeply anxious as i am at the creepily barren screens we now wake up to it s as if the rapture happened only surprise god took the insects because they didn t have any clothes to leave behind nobody noticed but we ll soon notice the ramifications of knocking out them and other key pillars of the food chain on which we depend as i look forward i sincerely hope we can do a lot better in the 2020 s the bar is current set depressingly low but we probably won t that s the reality what will the 2020 s hold more of the same likely though also some very sharp differences because the effects of a lot of our current bad decisions will come home to roost very soon my simplified view of the 2020 s is this you better be working on your garden s soil developing a tight and close trust network and be emotionally prepared to adapt quickly to new situations and circumstances in part 2 the coming decade will see the end of today s magnificent folly we explain why given today s systemic distortions and deformations predicting the events of the next ten years will be much easier than it was for the twenty teens largely because there s little room left down the road to kick the can further conflict contraction and consequences will define the coming decade it will be a time of loss scarcity and pain for many but it need not be for you not if you use the time we have remaining wisely peakprosperity com
the economic collapse is already here it s already here they re just not televising it there are not telling you about it if you look at central bankers they ve never been right about any stock market crash any depression any recessions ever bank failures are happening all over america the bank collapse has started for weeks now the fed is bailing out the rotten bankers left and right the fed is easing restrictions easing laws to eliminate what bankers need to do risky investing with your money your money the money you put into savings or checking accounts that they re holding their gambling with it on derivatives so what s happening is that bankers are in trouble they re not liquid they don t have cash bank to bank lending called the repo hit up to almost 10 which is crazy when interest rates at all time low almost at 0 in america we never had interest rates this low before what i want you to pay attention to is what happened in 2006 in 2006 there were zero bank failures and then in 2007 there were three bank failures and then it went to 25 bank collapses in 2008 and we experienced a huge stock market crash and global financial collapse now what i want to show you right now is 2018 has zero bank failures in 2019 has three bank failures this looks like the exact same thing that s happened 11 years ago then what is going to happen in 2020 first it was wells fargo bank of america and now capital one they re all going down for many days is this a show is this a test run this doesn t look natural to me we have a repo crisis a liquidity crisis a pension crisis a sovereign debt crisis a monetary crisis and a crisis of the democratic model with mounting turmoils and ever increasing separatist movements around the globe he who panics first panics best capital one bank went down for hours the banks are down this is the third bank in just a few months that s been totally down we had wells fargo a couple of months ago that was totally down and then we had bank of america it was entirely down and now it s capital one that is down and by all means no word of it in the news guess what thousands of people failed to gain access to their money to pay rent or to buy food or to buy lunch or pay for their gas because their system was all down now is this a coincidence this is the third freaking bank in less than a couple of months that has been totally down are they getting hacked is this occurring due to the repo market or because there s no liquidity we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us that s why the fed is bailing out these banks a the tune of a hundred and fifty billion not millions but billions a day every day that is a bail to these rotten banksters at a hundred and fifty billion per day the bank collapse has actually started that s why we have the repo market this time the fed doesn t have the mini stimulus to inject the patient the economy to survive because they re already at all time low interest rate they already you know or be queuing money they re already belling out banks as reported by to bloomberg global banks are inadvertently stocking up on risky corporate loans as a result of investors starting to slash risk in the credit markets barkleys and deutsche bank are complicated bankers but last to see investors getting ready for the 2019 recession and smart money leaving markets billions are small when taking into account 70 trillion dollar in negative yield bonds that project vulnerability to every country i cannot remember ever having repos and zero percent interest rates at the same time how can we have a shortage of liquidity when at the same time money is being loaned at that sort of low rate quantitative easing is not anymore working and the banks can t borrow any more money at a particular point there will be a big bank collapse or multiple failures which will include at the very least some kind of a bail in and supposedly some sort of bailout even though they might name it something else when and which banks is still to be disclosed the repos are the last line of protection the level of recklessness and arrogance showed towards ordinary people and the real economy is staggering but then again we all know what is at stake here the very survival of the us dollar
a decade ago the prime ministers of britain spain greece and even hungary were from the center left many went on to swiftly lose power but then socialist governments emerged in france and italy now the political brand looks like an anachronism populism has tested the ability of mainstream parties to adapt and some on the center right are regaining their footing that cannot be said of the traditional left it gravitated toward the middle ground in the 1990s and then paid a price for selling out but a pendulum swing to 1970s style radical ideology has been shown to be just as out of sync with the times this year ends with the humiliation of the labour party in the u k s dec 12 election and germany s social democrats more unpopular than at any time in living memory in italy and spain the center left are in government only thanks to precarious alliances with the anti establishment groups that grew from the 2008 financial crisis for jacob funk kirkegaard a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics in washington the malaise runs deep indeed as far back as the cold war era of the early 1970s there has not been a charismatic and genuine left wing leader who made a true difference in europe since willy brandt who won a nobel prize for building bridges between east and west and paving the way for german reunification this is what the parties are facing as we enter 2020 britain brexit battered voters were turned off by labour leader jeremy corbyn s promises of a socialist revolution which was to include everything from nationalizing industry to free broadband the party lost scotland years ago but this month areas of england s post industrial north abandoned labour some for the first time in their history harking back to the wilderness years in the 1980s corbyn is the most unpopular opposition leader in british history tony blair returned labour to power by dragging the party to the center winning three back to back elections but his catastrophic decision to follow the u s into war in iraq wrecked his legacy and made him toxic at home his warning this week was existential the choice for labour is to renew itself as the serious progressive non conservative competitor for power in british politics or retreat from such an ambition in which case over time it will be replaced blair told an audience germany at the heart of the identity crisis is a harsh reality working class voters have been abandoning the very parties whose raison d etre was to protect them blue collar workers are switching sides today there are not only fewer of them as economies have evolved to more high skilled labor but those left are more socially conservative and opposed to immigration like its counterparts elsewhere in europe germany s social democratic party has struggled to find the antidote for a tidal wave of anti immigration sentiment and to stop the greens sopping young environmentally conscious voters the spd is now pinning its hopes on a pair of unknowns to lead it out of an existential funk after governing with chancellor angela merkel s conservatives damaged the brand today the spd the country s oldest party polls in fourth place with less than 15 the greens could potentially displace the spd in the coalition down the line proposals like a tax on the wealthy and an increase of the minimum wage were dismissed by one spd critic as a warmed up box of socialist moth balls if they move further to the left the spd will stop being a people s party warned andrea roemmele professor of political communication at the berlin based hertie school france when it comes to a plunge in popularity few leaders can better francois hollande the country s most reviled president his socialists are on life support and his former prime minister pronounced the party dead and gone for sure the french socialists were always prone to infighting in 2002 their failure to unite behind their candidate for president allowed far right leader jean marie le pen to make the run off against incumbent jacques chirac but this time the way back seems much longer president emmanuel macron was the beneficiary more recently creating a centrist party that triumphed in 2017 he has since emerged as the strongest voice in the european union italy political fluidity is another challenge especially in parts of southern europe without a two party system or where the political landscape has fragmented beyond recognition gone are the days when you stuck to your tribe for life voters are willing to get experimental and there is no better political laboratory than italy where parties surge and disappear in the blink of an eye there the strangest alliances are forged such as that between rival populists it explains how the center left has changed its name countless times its latest incarnation as the democratic party is trying to rebuild its support base and is in government with the populist five star movement but together they poll about the same as matteo salvini s anti immigration league which is itching for an election and will eventually get one spain and portugal when that time comes the center left strategy in italy is to lure voters away from five star in spain it s a gamble that pedro sanchez was banking on when he called two elections in the space of a year to try and shake off his dependence to far left populists podemos it hasn t worked out he too is trapped in a marriage of mutual and temporary convenience that leaves portugal as a left wing oasis in europe but one that increasingly feels like an exception greece tribal politics was the norm in greece until the country became the epicenter of europe s debt crisis two parties traded power since the junta fell in 1974 but then as the socialist pasok party became the biggest political casualty of the upheaval a group further to the left filled the vacuum alexis tsipras s coalition of the radical left or syriza shot to power in 2015 and effectively challenged europe to a duel over austerity and greece s euro membership he blinked turned into the marxist fireband tamed into submission by brussels and was ejected from office this year he left with his international reputation enhanced but at home the conservative new democracy is back in power malta on the mediterranean island of half a million people the labour party was enjoying a long stint in government until the country s legacy of failing to tackle corruption caught up with it joseph muscat prime minister since 2013 was lauded for malta s economic growth now he s the lightning rod for anger over a murder scandal two years after the brutal murder of journalist daphne caruana galizia the police investigation has reached muscat s inner circle he denies any involvement and resigned saying he will step down next month protesters want him gone now scandinavia in sweden a far right surge rocked a beacon of liberal democracy the social democrats managed to cobble together a government but for first time in decades they are no longer the most popular party in most opinion polls as the anti immigration sweden democrats overtook the social democrats in denmark at least were able to return to power this year though in part by adopting some policies of its anti immigrant rival by tightening controls eastern europe in eastern europe socialist parties have been on the slide for years as right wing populist leaders like hungary s viktor orban and jaroslaw kaczynski in poland cemented their power by portraying some opponents as apologists for communism kaczynski s law justice party won a second term in october with an outright parliamentary majority albeit against a main opponent that s from the center right but in romania the left leaning social democratic party was part of the government for more than a decade until its minority administration collapsed last month for former party leader and national strongman liviu dragnea it arguably couldn t get any worse he was jailed in may for corruption
when it comes to technology we depend on others be it phones cars airplanes maybe 20 years ago china was behind us but now they are light years ahead of india we are in a pathetic state in consumer electronics show in las vegas i couldn t find a single indian company out of some 4 500 stalls about 2 000 were chinese about 1 000 us and then there were vietnam cambodia hong kong but not a single indian vendor that tells you a lot about the state of affairs here and yet we produce some of the best brains that design these devices that go into them when are we going to wake up this was what professor arogyaswami paulraj had said more than seven years ago economic times reported april 04 2012 the situation basically remains the same today he is not a communist not an anti national nor a china agent the pollachi coimbatore born engineer served in the indian navy for 26 years then he became professor emeritus in the department of electrical engineering at stanford university he made pioneering contributions to the theory and development of what is called the mimo multiple input multiple output technology mimo lies at the heart of the current high speed wifi and 4g mobile phones for that and other work in the wireless space paulraj won prestigious awards like ieee s alexander graham bell medal and the marconi prize and was inducted into the us patent trademark office s national inventors hall of fame there is tall talk about india overtaking china and comparisons are made in india about both what paulraj said and reiterated seven years later recently puts things in perspective paulraj who established three research labs in india before moving to stanford has so far built and sold three technology companies and advises both the us and chinese governments on technology policies since wireless communication has become core to economies with substantial national security implications paulraj has been closely involved in academic industry and government discussions around it and related technologies particularly in the us but also significantly in china brain drain was once identified as a problem india faced now it is glorified as export of services a major earner of course they are derisively called in some quarters as software or hitech coolies his views reviewed here are hence worth a keen hearing india has a vast technology workforce working for multinationals such as qualcomm and huawei there is fantastic amount of talent i built and sold three companies all of them had back end centres in india the best wireless chips are built out of india because there is incredible amount of math that go in there this he he said in a recent interview to the same paper et tech november 08 2019 congress made claims how from rajiv gandhi to pv narasimha rao to manmohan they had laid foundations for modernizing india and now bjp and modi led nda make tall claims mouth big slogans make in india skill india etc but reality is staring but they are light years ahead of india we are in a pathetic state why we can learn about this from his observations another interview he earlier gave to times of india tnn oct 17 2019 amplified some of his views is it capital or government policy that is not helping india what is the performance of iits and iims paulraj answers clearly the technology talent is here the one thing that is missing in bengaluru and hyderabad is that it also needs skills such as marketing and product management those kind of skills technically are sitting in the headquarters of global companies and india units are only the tech shop why are we at near zero there is no effective government policy technology is here not because of iits in fact most of the talented engineers come from often unknown engineering colleges what has been the indian government policy and where does it differ from china s after all both operated in the same globalized market paulraj had said in 2012 china s thinking is probably that they don t want chinese companies to adopt a foreign technology until their own technology has a reasonable user base they will do it only on the basis of national interest now he amplified india should insist that global companies transfer technology for hi tech purchases and build local intellectual property ip china never bought technology in general without demanding transfer of technology it would say i will buy this jet engine from you mr rolls royce the next generation of jet engine should have 5 of chinese headquartered ip you can start the company fund it completely but it is in our jurisdiction that ip is part of the system if not i will buy engines from ge and they would play one company against the other all these companies in order to get market share would be ready et china never bought anything from the us without insisting that they want 10 of the ip in the product in three years the ip must be from a china headquartered company tnn we have created no such mechanism in india he says in the last 25 years we would have bought maybe close to 800 billion worth of high technology stuff but we have got no transfer of technology he was candid as the title of the report suggested india should emulate china in tech transfer we have technology knowledge but lack marketing knowledge he says but this is not exactly the case the difference however is much more basic there is no dearth of marketing knowledge all our iims and ibss international business schools are tuned and honed to serve foreign capital i e the mncs and their compradors in india the media highlights how campus selections by mncs are offering handsome packages to buy over our young talent and make them to serve their interests what is missing is the political will to develop an independent economy that has been the case whether it is upa or nda swadeshi skill india and make in india are in effect empty slogans and make no difference in this respect our talent pool is trained in the same pattern we work for them mncs for cents on the dollar indian compradors have no need to train them to serve indian interests we are all working for them mncs for cents on the dollar says paulraj that is the mind set of the comprador within bengaluru there must be enough knowledge to build what huawei has but they are all sitting in american companies india s technology power can only come from india headquartered companies even if there are 100 intels in bengaluru it s of no value to us mr trump can shut them down tomorrow besides we are all working for them for cents on the dollar the real dollars are all sitting in the united states we are a huge market we have not used our market power tnn that is the difference between real independence and dependence compradors are happy with the latter they don t want risks you can build anything in the world but if the company is not headquartered here then you have zero control any country gets influence presence and strength if the company is headquartered there on that count in the information and communications technology ict area india virtually has zero market share one thing missing in india is venture capital in this high risk business 80 of companies fail whether it is in china or in the united states technology companies fail because the market is so competitive one out of ten companies succeeds and makes a whole lot of money that is how the vc sustains is it capital or government policy that is not helping india making vc money available has not happened and the government has failed with its policies what are the prospects how is hitech education tuned for future paulraj answers these questions what about the large indian it companies indian it firms have made enormous money through services the hi tech road is very risky how about industry university collaboration in india do you see that happening i worked with professor anurag kumar director of indian institute of science on the 5g committee for india kumar was talking to iit directors on how to move the needle as not one idea in 5g technology has come from india the professors told him that what is missing is entrepreneurial zeal paulraj does not say so but crony capitalism thrives in india we have iits iims etc to serve the mncs and the cronies and the government feeds them all at public expense starting a company is very hard these people are very comfortable the government gives the money in stanford i have to fight for every dollar to fund my students writing papers is easy building prototypes and working with hardware is messy and difficult work frankly not much is expected ultimately if the systems are working people are making money they indian professors would take risks today the barriers are too high for them to take risks while india is seeking to curry favor with imperialism us in particular china has chosen a path of independence driven also by hitech the difference between china and india is also clear from what dr paulraj says paulraj has been closely involved in academic industry and government discussions around it and related technologies particularly in the us but also significantly in china so his words carry lot of weight not only for policy makers but also academic leaders india is bonded to usa which in turn seeks to pitch india as a rival to china what are the future prospects this can also be seen from his words china s tech advance is scaring the us is the title of the interview he gave to times of india tnn oct 17 2019 in a discussion with geo political and strategic experts organised by the synergia foundation in bengaluru recently times reported paulraj focused on china s extraordinary advances in technology his thesis is that economic power and global influence is increasingly linked to mass market high technologies like information communication technology pharma robotics industry 4 0 civilian jets these are the greatest value creators they create income and help build a military which protects the economy this we may add is different from a military that saps our economy and serves foreign interests i e imperialists and their defence corporates mostly of usa israel france and also russia india spends around rs 4 lakh crore rupees a year on defence and a big chunk of this goes to feed western merchants of death and their india compradors is this all for defending india or looting india to the tune of billions of dollars is this nationalism or something else the union cabinet on november 20 last had cleared a two year moratorium on spectrum payments that will give more than rs 42000 crore to india s three mobile companies two of which bharti airtel and vodafone were in huge losses and debt amid brutal competition and a business war by ambani s jio which is also rewarded now this after all the big and prolonged campaign on spectrum allocation scam but all this funding in the name of defence and hitech does not alter the state of dependence it rather rewards the compradors china sent thousands of scholars to the us to learn from it paulraj said the largest group of visitors to his group in stanford were chinese a lot of his students go and teach in china nobody ever comes to india but they go to china because the mechanisms to do that are there china has sucked in knowledge china also started building universities focused on research he said some of those universities became so good that those like stanford felt compelled to work with them not one top indian institute features in world s top 200 there is a big push now for so called institutions of eminence including private universities in india modi govt reinforced that but money alone can not help as seen from saudi experience the saudis would come to stanford saying we ll pay you we ll spend billions to set up a university we never went but we opened a centre in tsinghua university we felt both could benefit paulraj said today in the prestigious qs world university ratings tsinghua is in the top 20 and there are 10 chinese universities in the top 100 a list dominated by the us and europe paulraj said the quality of chinese research papers are extremely good and he said they are much more hands on they build stuff there all this focus on research into high technology has made china a leader in critical areas and they are seen to be rapidly advancing in others hitech advance of china a factor for trade war what is going on is not mere trade war by usa it is somewhat like sanctions a war without arms to contain china and india is sought to be roped in as we can see us projects and comprador media trumpets india as if it is a rival to china but china is light years ahead of india this can be seen from what paulraj says the us is today looking at every angle to block china it has created a list of chinese companies that cannot get american components or technologies huawei is one of them the us government paulraj said has thought of sending all chinese students home that has not happened but stanford cannot accept any more chinese visitors all grants given by chinese companies to stanford professors have been frozen they cannot use them china cannot invest in any venture capital fund that invests in american high tech they are really building a berlin wall between china and the united states paulraj said china never bought anything from the us without insisting that they want 10 of the ip in the product in three years the ip must be from a china headquartered company in wireless paulraj said huawei has become the company in the world the best technology cheaper than the rest of the world nokia ericsson and samsung are nowhere close the arrest more than an year ago and prolonged detention eversince with false pretexts by canada of the cfo ms meng wanzhou of huawei is part of this trade war that crossed all its limits it may be noted the detention was at us behests and with a us warrant us is calling for her extradition too after waiting for sometime china retaliated by arresting canadians including ex diplomat micheal kovrig in ai artificial intelligence china is beginning to dominate in a typical ai conference paulraj said 60 of papers would be chinese and the remaining would be from the us and europe the chinese are also using ai in mass applications in quantum computing qc china is seen to be as good as or better than the us qc can help crack encryption and which in turn has serious national security implications in supercomputers china rules when barack obama decided not to supply computer chips to china to build supercomputers they built their own processors whose speeds paulraj said are stunning in biotech the chinese are seen to have a lot more publications on a very powerful tool used called crispr the us paulraj said is mortally scared of these advances china has made tnn interview they are said to have been particularly unnerved by chinese president xi jinping s goal set in 2015 that 70 of products in china should contain chinese ip by 2025 and hence the trade war ever intensified india is being used by usa it is being drawn to side with usa in this trade cum tech war which is not in india s interest this can be seen from the following self evident report china concerned over india us closer ties that is the title of a pti sep 24 2019 report ascribed to subramanian swamy of bjp and close to the indian establishment swamy a rajya sabha mp was in beijing on a five day visit on the invitation of the tsinghua university where he addressed a meeting on the progress made by china in the last 70 years he also took part in the interactive meetings with chinese officials and think tanks and with diplomats on both sides there is a certain concern in china which we need to remove as to where india us relations are moving in the context of what is happening between the us and china he said china is locked in a bruising trade war with the us since last year the two top economies of the world were locked in a strategic rivalry as china is fast expanding its global influence swamy who has been visiting china and interacting with the ruling communist party officials for over three decades said india should do take some confidence building measures to allay beijing s concern on india us ties india china relations are primary important america is far away and america has its own cost benefit analysis i think we must therefore ensure that our relations with china are healthy he said china s concerns included india s participation in the quadrilateral security dialogue involving the us japan and australia as well as the indo pacific concept and beijing s apprehension over its impact in the disputed south china sea swamy said swamy of course mentioned india s deep concern that china is supportive of pakistan even while they are sending terrorists to india but he has a solution swamy said he has suggested to china to establish an india china and pakistan track 2 dialogue to discuss issues related to terrorism i suggested that there could be off the record meeting of the indians chinese and pakistanis because there was an admission that china is also suffering from islamic terrorism so we then have common interest there it could be non official like track 2 they were enthusiastic about it he said india more so modi regime hobnobbed with usa israel etc and boosted indian big business to emerge as a counter to china as desired by usa but this policy did not take off given india s perpetual policies of dependence see this times report no major make in india defence project has taken off in 6 yrs rajat pandit tnn dec 2 2019 none of the major make in india projects in the defence arena ranging from new generation stealth submarines minesweepers and light utility helicopters to infantry combat vehicles transport aircraft and fighter jets have actually taken off in the last six years these long pending projects collectively worth over rs 3 5 lakh crore are either stuck or still meandering through different stages without the final contracts to launch production being inked toi in october 2017 had done a stock taking of six mega make in india projects to find that bureaucratic bottlenecks long winded procedures commercial and technical wranglings coupled with lack of requisite political push and follow through continued to stymie their launch two years later the story more or less remains the same for seven major projects the defence ministry says several measures have been taken to promote indigenous defence production which include revisions in the defence procurement procedure dpp and fdi policy simplification of make procedures and offset guidelines notification of the strategic partnership sp model and the decision to set up two defence industrial corridors in tamil nadu and up in fact indigenous defence production has been india s stated goal for decades including by the congress regimes obviously it did not take off despite modi and bjp what is common between the two regimes is a policy of subservience to imperialism us in particular india chose to be with us and the results are there to see this is in contrast to the policy of independence pursued by china despite the same world situation dominated by us and imperialist globalization thrust by them impacting on china the latter asserted its way paulraj s narrative shows the gulf between them india should emulate china in tech transfer he suggested but given india s aspirations to be a regional hegemon not only in south asia and asia pacific if possible and india pursuing expansionist policies such a turn as suggested by paulraj is not being taken us trade war is hurting india too still india rather prefers to be subservient to us hoping that would help its aspiration to be a counter to china as wished by the west and usa with such policies of dependence and subservience it is the the cronies who gain and join the lists of the richest in the world and that is detrimental to india s interests the pseudo left in india aping their western peers don t see all this some of them see not a subservient but an imperialist india and some others theorise how china turned social imperialist they have their own dogmatism and have no regard for facts seen by technocrats like paulraj the author is a political observer who contributed to countercurrents org

i ll now turn it over to yogesh yogesh gupta president and chief executive officer thank you brian good afternoon everyone and thank you for attending our third quarter earnings call as you ve seen in this afternoon s press release we had a really strong q3 performance sustaining the momentum we ve seen in our business throughout this year both revenue and eps were well above the high end of our guidance range and cash flows were very solid as well the over performance was driven by our openedge segment which included better than expected revenues from ipswitch and by the timing of deals in our dci segment i continue to be encouraged by the performance of our core business based on our consistently strong execution and the opportunities we see within our segments we are again increasing our annual guidance for both operating margin and earnings per share in addition despite additional fx headwinds as we head into the fourth quarter we are increasing the midpoint of our revenue guidance by over 1 million as i mentioned ipswitch performed very well during the quarter and we remain ahead of expectations with our integration efforts and the realization of cost synergies helping to drive both revenue growth and profitability upside this was the first full quarter of ipswitch operations within our results and i m more than convinced than ever that this acquisition is proving to be a winner for us paul will provide more detail on our q3 results but i would like to focus my remaining remarks on our strategy moving forward and on some of our financial goals for fy 20 and beyond underpinning our strategy of course is our strong and stable core business which has high levels of recurring revenue and as i ve stated many times a flattish revenue growth profile and with the success of ipswitch we have demonstrated that accretive m a can drive meaningful inorganic growth along with increased scale and cash flows we believe our success with ipswitch is repeatable and by allocating capital to accretive acquisitions we can leverage our consistently strong cash generation to replicate the ipswitch playbook and drive real shareholder value over the long term therefore our major focus for fy 20 and beyond will be on maintaining a strong and stable core business augmented by m a that is similar in profile to ipswitch we believe that successful execution of this strategy can produce 10 to 20 annual inorganic revenue growth with a goal of doubling our revenues over five years key to this strategy will be maintaining our disciplined criteria for acquisitions to reiterate acquisitions must first be complementary to our business in terms of product audience and growth profile with high retention rate and high levels of recurring revenue they must also be cost synergistic and accretive to earnings and cash flow with margins after synergies that are consistent with our overall operating margins and a return on invested capital that is well above our weighted average cost of capital we are focused on companies within the infrastructure space particularly in the areas of application development data integration and data quality database and database management and devops we ve been actively building a pipeline of opportunities which include carve outs from strategics our experience in operating businesses with long standing customer bases and high levels of recurring revenue is a real advantage for us we can utilize our operating model to scale acquired businesses and provide a better long term experience for their customers which can be a deciding factor for many sellers the market remains hypercompetitive making it difficult to predict the timing of transactions as we stay disciplined in our approach by choosing only targets that will meet our strict criteria like ipswitch we believe an accretive m a strategy will drive significant scale and cash flows and will be key to maximizing shareholder value over the long term as we execute on this strategy we will maintain an extremely shareholder friendly capital allocation policy in addition to m a our strong cash flow generation enables us to also return meaningful amounts of capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks we remain committed to allocating approximately 25 of our annual free cash flow to dividends in fact we announced today that our board has approved an annual dividend increase of 0 04 per share beginning in the fourth quarter of this year this is the third year in a row that we have increased our dividend since it was established in 2016 reflecting the confidence we have in our ongoing cash generation as well as our commitment to returning capital to shareholders turning to share repurchases we continue to believe that they provide a solid low risk return to shareholders and our target will be to buy back shares at a level sufficient to offset the annual dilution from our equity plans of course we have the additional flexibility to increase reduce or suspend buybacks depending on market conditions and on the size and timing of m a activity as we stated at the time of the ipswitch acquisition we do not intend to repurchase any shares in q4 of this year shifting gears as you know we have also been targeting organic growth in the cognitive modern application development market in late 2018 we began to ramp up our sales and marketing efforts to take advantage of the increased interest we saw in our kinvey platform however after 12 months of competing in this market we have not seen the level of traction and bookings acceleration we had hoped for although our pipeline did expand as we ramped up our sales and marketing efforts the number of deals and new customers we obtained does not justify our level of resources and investment we are disappointed in this development and while we still believe there are opportunities for us within the modern application development space we are not expecting a meaningful contribution from our kinvey platform for the foreseeable future as a result we are reducing our current and ongoing spending levels in this area coupled with our solid core business and the inorganic growth we can drive through accretive m a this decision will contribute to higher margins and drive meaningful shareholder value turning to fy 20 i want to provide a preliminary directional view of our expectations for a few key financial metrics we will provide more specific guidance in january but we currently see revenue growth of 4 to 5 for next year driven by the following first a full year revenue contribution from ipswitch versus only seven months in 2019 second flattish revenue for our openedge and ad d segments and lastly although the acv of our dci segment will remain unchanged for fy 20 at 32 million to 33 million we do expect a year over year decrease in dci revenue of approximately 15 due to the timing of oem renewals we are targeting operating margins to further expand in fy 20 increasing an additional 100 to 200 basis points from our fy 19 guidance of 37 this is a reflection of our ongoing productivity improvements as well as the reduced investment in our kinvey platform that i discussed earlier we remain committed to operating as efficiently as possible and given our current profile we are targeting operating margins in the high 30s range going forward in summary i m really proud of our execution over the first three quarters of 2019 our core business remains healthy and stable and ipswitch has performed even better than we had planned over the first four months making it an excellent model for future acquisitions we will work hard to close out this year with a strong q4 and i m confident that we can achieve our full year financial target for fy 19 we will continue to focus in q4 on the ongoing integration of ipswitch and on further executing on our accretive m a strategy i am very excited about our positive outlook for fy 20 as well as our longer term inorganic growth opportunity i believe that through hard work and execution we can achieve our goal of doubling the size of the company in the next five years which will drive significant shareholder value over that time i m now going to turn things over to paul to review our q3 performance in more detail and to outline our financial expectations for q4 and fy 2019 paul paul jalbert chief financial officer thank you yogesh and good afternoon everyone as a reminder all financial results that i ll be referring to in my remarks are on a non gaap basis i m very pleased with our third quarter financial performance total revenue came in at 158 5 million which was 3 5 million above the high end of our guidance range our overachievement was primarily driven by better than expected license sales for ipswitch higher maintenance revenue for openedge and the earlier than expected signing of several large oem deals within our dci segment our earnings per share was 0 75 for the quarter 0 05 above the high end of our guidance range due to the higher than expected revenue looking at consolidated revenue for the quarter compared to q3 of last year total revenue of 158 5 million was 25 higher than a year ago at actual exchange rates and 26 higher on a constant currency basis this includes a negative 1 4 million impact due to foreign exchange fluctuations which was 400 000 greater than our expectations license revenue of 30 8 million increased by 35 from a year ago at actual exchange rates and by 37 on a constant currency basis the increase was due to the license revenue from ipswitch as well as the renewal of higher number of multiyear term oem contracts within our dci segment as compared to last year our maintenance and services revenue was 84 7 million an increase of 21 year over year at actual exchange rates and 23 on a constant currency basis this increase was again primarily due to the addition of ipswitch but we also achieved slight maintenance growth in both our openedge and ad d products turning to our revenue by segment with all the comparisons at constant currency openedge revenue was 88 8 million for the third quarter up 29 versus q3 2018 now as a reminder ipswitch is being reported as part of openedge segment that was a primary driver behind the increased revenue license sales from our openedge partner channel continued to be stable including a solid quarter for saas related billings from our isv partners who offer their applications in the cloud we once again achieved maintenance renewal rates of well over 90 during the quarter for both openedge isv partners and direct enterprise customers turning to our dci segment revenue was 8 8 million for the quarter nearly double the revenue in q3 last year we have projected a significant year over year increase for q3 based on the timing of renewals of multiyear deals but we also completed several additional large oem renewals during the quarter that were not expected until q4 although the timing of these early renewals drove higher than expected revenue for q3 our view for the full year has not changed as a reminder our results fluctuate quarterly and annually for the dci segment due to the timing of oem renewals and the associated accounting treatment under asc 606 as yogesh stated in his remarks while in fiscal 2019 we are benefiting from the timing of this multi year renewals we expect next year s revenue to be impacted by a smaller number of renewals in 2020 for these reasons we believe annual contract value remains the most effective way to evaluate our dci business we continue to expect acv to be between 32 million and 33 million for 2019 consistent with 2018 since the economic value of our dci oem contracts is very steady and predictable we do not expect acv to fluctuate in a meaningful way going forward turning to our ad d segment revenue was 19 4 million for the quarter down 1 compared to q3 2018 the decrease was due to slightly lower license and service revenue partially offset by a small increase in maintenance total bookings were 19 4 million and are tracking well against our full year expectations for total revenue by geography with our international regions at constant currency north america revenue was 66 8 million up 34 versus q3 2018 emea revenue was 37 7 million up 15 latin america revenue was 5 8 million up 26 and asia pacific revenue was 6 7 million up 20 total cost and operating expenses were 69 7 million for the quarter up 68 from q3 2018 the increase was primarily due to the addition of ipswitch and was in line with our expectations operating income for q3 was 46 million an increase of 13 million or 40 versus q3 2018 our q3 2019 operating margin was 40 an increase of more than 400 basis points over q3 of last year and above our expectations due to the higher than anticipated revenue for the quarter q3 eps of 0 75 was 0 20 or 36 higher than last year the increase was primarily due to the higher revenue for the quarter including the contribution from ipswitch which was partially offset by a negative 0 01 impact from exchange rates moving on to a few balance sheet and cash flow metrics the company ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet cash cash equivalents and short term investments of 145 million our debt principal balance at the end of q3 was 299 million dso for q3 2019 was 53 days up 11 days sequentially and up 10 days from q3 of last year the increase was due to the timing of billings and associated collections in the quarter deferred revenue was 161 million at the end of the third quarter up 25 million compared to q4 of 2018 which was due primarily to the addition of ipswitch deferred revenue balances as a reminder our deferred revenue balance does not include ipswitch pre acquisition deferred revenue which is eliminated in purchased accounting under gaap we include this revenue in our non gaap results and guidance to better reflect our true business performance adjusted free cash flow was 27 million for the quarter compared to 21 million in q3 of last year year to date adjusted free cash flow is 92 million compared to 97 million in 2018 i d now like to turn to our business outlook and guidance for fiscal 2019 and q4 our revised full year guidance is 425 million to 428 million despite an additional 1 2 million of fx headwind since we last issued guidance of which 800 000 impacts q4 this is an increase of 3 million on the low end with no change to the high end turning to operating margin and earnings per share based on our ongoing efforts to run the business as efficiently as possible as well as the reduced investment in our kinvey platform that yogesh discussed we are increasing our annual guidance for both of these metrics we are raising our guidance for 2019 operating margin to 37 an increase of 100 basis points at the low end for eps our guidance is now 2 63 to 2 65 an increase of 0 11 at the low end and 0 08 at the high end compared to our prior guidance now as a reminder we are not planning on repurchasing additional shares during 2019 we expect to resume share repurchases next year and will provide more detail when we issue our annual guidance for fiscal 20 in january our guidance for adjusted free cash flow is 125 million to 130 million unchanged from our previous forecast and our expected tax rate is approximately 19 also unchanged based on current exchange rates total expected negative currency translation impact on our 2019 revenue is now 7 4 million an increase of 1 2 million from the guidance we provided in june the negative impact of exchange rates on our full year eps is now 0 06 an increase of 0 01 from our prior guidance turning to our guidance for q4 2019 in light of our q3 revenue overachievement we expect revenue to be between 116 million and 119 million a year over year increase of 18 to 21 the increase was primarily due to the inclusion of ipswitch revenue as well as a significant increase in dci which is expected to grow more than 90 due to the renewal of higher number of multi year term oem contracts as compared to q4 last year the total year over year currency translation impact on our q4 revenue is expected to be a negative 1 3 million we expect earnings per share of 0 73 to 0 75 for the fourth quarter compared to 0 54 in q4 of last year an increase of 35 to 39 this is in part related to the ipswitch contribution but also to our ongoing efforts to manage our business efficiently based on current exchange rates the expected currency translation impact on our q4 eps is expected to be a negative 0 01 and we expect our fourth quarter and full year gaap results to include a restructuring charge of 2 million to 4 million related to the reduced investment in our kinvey platform in light of our reduced expectations in this area we will also be assessing the carrying value of the associated intangible assets during q4 and expect to have a material reduction in the carrying value of those assets for gaap purposes as a data point the total book value to these intangibles was 24 million at the end of the third quarter in closing q3 was another solid quarter for us and we are well positioned to achieve our financial goals for 2019 our integration efforts for ipswitch remain on track and we expect to have substantially all of the 15 million of cost synergies in place by the end of 2019 well ahead of schedule i m pleased that we were again able to raise guidance for both operating margin and eps which reflects our ability to operate our business efficiently our cash flows are strong our overall business is healthy and i look forward to continued strong execution in q4 as we close out a very successful 2019 in addition we believe the success of our ipswitch acquisition represents a model that we can repeat in the future enabling us to scale our business further as we look ahead with that i d like to hand it over to brian for q a brian flanagan vice president investor relations thank you paul that concludes our formal remarks for today i d now like to open up the call to your questions i ask that you keep your remarks to your primary question and one follow up i ll now hand over to the operator to conduct the q a session questions answers operator thank you and we ll take our first question today from steve koenig with wedbush securities steve koenig wedbush securities analyst hi gentlemen thanks for taking my questions so maybe just so one quick one on ipswitch and then a follow up so cost and revenue outperformance so should we expect that they re on track for beating that 42 million that you re expecting this year i believe that was a number on revenue and can you give us just any sense of contribution in the quarter yogesh gupta president and chief executive officer so as you know we are not steve breaking out specific revenue contribution but yes they are ahead of the 42 million plan that you said for the year steve koenig wedbush securities analyst got it got it ok great and then on the so on the free cash flow guide i m wondering given the reduced investment in kinvey and then the ipswitch outperformance and openedge did will in q3 too maybe just some color on the potential for free cash flow upside maybe why could the guidance why can t it be better i guess is the question there and if i could slip one in on the margin improvement for next year that looks promising and i m wondering are there catalysts for as you continue to do acquisitions are there catalysts for doing better than the rule of 40 as you gain critical mass and gain operating leverage as a result of that maybe just kind of how should we think about the long term model yogesh gupta president and chief executive officer so let me start with the second one first and then i think paul can discuss the cash flow briefly steve so you know we actually see our margin expectations going up as you said thank you in part due to of course our reduced investment in our kinvey platform and in part due to our ongoing focus on running our business as efficiently as possible we of course expect our margin next year to be 100 to 200 basis points higher than the 37 guidance for fy 19 we believe that our margins at that level are extremely competitive but we also always strive to run our business as well as we can and as we pursue our accretive m a and scale the business up we ll continue to look for additional opportunities steve so that s the way we see it going forward steve koenig wedbush securities analyst right great thanks here guys paul jalbert chief financial officer yeah steve on your question on the cash flow right so regarding 125 million to 130 million right so about 92 million year to date we think given the actions that we re taking and most of those are in the fourth quarter you re not really going to see the cash benefits of that until 2020 so as i said it before our guidance we re comfortable with the 125 million to 130 million for the year steve koenig wedbush securities analyst ok great well thank you gentlemen and congrats on q3 yogesh gupta president and chief executive officer thank you steve paul jalbert chief financial officer right thanks steve operator next we ll hear from matthew galinko with national securities matthew galinko national securities analyst hey good afternoon thank you for taking a couple of questions for me paul jalbert chief financial officer hey matt matthew galinko national securities analyst hey hey do you think just given the pivot out toward m a and away from the organic growth strategy is it sort of ipswitch size the kind of the number we should be thinking about or do you have the infrastructure in place to do a little bit more than that and just kind of curious how you think about your capabilities now yogesh gupta president and chief executive officer yeah so matt first of all we think that we have a very strong team in place and we have the right infrastructure in place to be able to do these acquisitions on a regular basis and in a repeatable model in terms of the size of the acquisition the sweet spot the sweet spot for us is 10 to 20 of our revenue that doesn t mean we won t do something slightly smaller if it shows up or if something bigger shows up that is really going to make the right impact we would look at that as well so we re not hard constrained on the 10 to 20 range but that is a very effective range in terms of what we can acquire and integrate as you saw with ipswitch as well right so that s our sweet spot we actually continue to be very disciplined about looking for these and so when you are that disciplined you know we actually are looking at of course many more than we actually go after because of the discipline that we have and because of that you know size can be somewhat bigger or smaller matthew galinko national securities analyst got it all right and then maybe a little bit more on ipswitch now that you ve operated it for a little while i m curious if you re willing to go into a little bit more detail on sort of which of its products are outperforming i assume it s not necessarily the legacy stuff and maybe it s sort of the newer stuff but just kind of curious what you re seeing and what you re learning about how you re selling into the customer base and how that measures with your existing channels thank you yogesh gupta president and chief executive officer yeah sure matt so as you know there are two main product lines at ipswitch and two specific market segments they re in one is in the area of data movement and the other is in the area of network management wonderfully for us both those businesses are doing well so we re really excited about that our go to market for ipswitch has a significant indirect component to it through distributors and resellers and i think that being part of a larger publicly traded company i think that creates a level of comfort there as well and our organization both the ipswitch folks that have come on board as well as the progress people that are working with them have done a really really good job of working with our indirect channels to continue the momentum that we have there we are also selling direct so i don t want to imply that s only indirect there s a direct component of that business as well both sides of those channels are doing well so we re actually quite excited about this matt that ipswitch products are performing well across the board matthew galinko national securities analyst great thank you yogesh gupta president and chief executive officer you re welcome matt operator we have a question from mark schappel with benchmark yogesh gupta president and chief executive officer hey mark hey mark mark schappel the benchmark company analyst hey nice job in the quarter let me start off there yogesh gupta president and chief executive officer thank you thank you mark schappel the benchmark company analyst yogesh with respect to your prepared remarks around the kinvey business i was wondering if you could just go into some further detail of why you re scaling that business back so meaningfully i mean obviously you re seeing some deterioration in your pipeline or just it materially isn t materializing the way you thought it would i was wondering if you d just go into a little bit more detail there and also to any options maybe different options around the kinvey business like moving it off to a channel or even selling the business per se yogesh gupta president and chief executive officer yeah so of course so as you know as we ramped up our investment in this area beginning late last year we did see increased lead flow and pipeline building and so we had an expectation that bookings will begin to accelerate in the six to nine months later q2 time frame of this year however we have not seen the steady acceleration of deals and new customer wins that would justify our level of investment and effort and so we now feel quite strongly that reducing our investment is the right move for our shareholders at this time you know we re not abandoning it by any stretch of the imagination so we continue to support our customers we continue to have this effort still ongoing but at significantly reduced level and we believe that there are opportunities for us within modern application development going forward as well but we don t see a meaningful contribution in the foreseeable future so given all that it is our strong belief that our shareholders are better served at this time by our ongoing focus on running our business as efficiently as we can and augmenting that by accretive m a to deliver greater value mark schappel the benchmark company analyst great thank you that was helpful paul a question for you given the good quarter and the increased guidance for our fiscal year here i was surprised to see that free cash flow guidance was not being raised any thoughts there paul jalbert chief financial officer yeah i think you know as i mentioned to steve right so year to date we re at 92 million and we guided 125 million to 130 million and we re comfortable with that there i think some of the savings that are coming about as the reduction in our investments in kinvey right are not really going to be fully seen until 2020 mark schappel the benchmark company analyst ok great thank you that s all for me thanks guys yogesh gupta president and chief executive officer yeah thanks mark paul jalbert chief financial officer thanks mark operator at this time there are no further questions i will now turn the call over to mr flanagan for any additional or closing remarks brian flanagan vice president investor relations thank you

how do you impeach a president who has created the greatest economy in the history of our country donald trump tweeted in september trump has repeatedly claimed big economic benefits from his presidency and this claim undergirds a lot of trump s popular support but the truth is that trump is a failure economically both in his business career and in his actions as president it is time to connect the dots of trump s economic failures in a way that everyone understands a powerful way to communicate trump s true economic legacy is to brand him as bankrupter in chief trump this is the real bottom line of trump s business career and it is what he is actually doing to the country and to individual americans to drive home this message bankrupter in chief trump should be repeated after each new trump claim policy action and report that illustrates this message until most americans understand this as trump s true legacy the country s economic resources are being wasted while its future economic health is endangered trump campaigned on the promise of eliminating the federal debt within eight years but what his economic policies have actually been doing is bankrupting the country the u s government s budget deficit ballooned to almost 1 trillion in 2019 which is nearly a 50 percent increase during trump s time in office debt to top 4 1 trillion trump s overall contribution to the national debt for the bills he has signed into law is projected to top 4 1 trillion according to the nonpartisan committee for a responsible federal budget the largest portion of this increase is coming from trump s tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations which are projected to boost the nation s debt by 1 8 trillion according to this group s analysis trump promised this his economic policies would lead to growth in the economy of between 3 and 4 percent per year but the reality is that the economy has been growing at barely 2 percent over the past year and the average economic growth since trump took office has been a little more than 2 25 percent per year the promised benefits from the massive tax cut have not materialized and in fact the united states has now had two consecutive quarters of negative investment growth not only are trump s tax cuts not boosting business investment as promised but they are also bankrupting the country s economic future the nonpartisan congressional budget office projects that deficits will remain massive each year going forward until the total federal government debt reaches nearly 100 percent of the country s gdp gross domestic product under current law the federal government is projected to borrow an additional 13 6 trillion from the end of 2018 through 2029 boosting debt held by the public to 29 3 trillion squandered stimulus the country s ability to weather economic downturns has also been compromised because the tools of economic stimulus needed to pull the country out of a recession have already been squandered at a time when they were not needed the country s economic resources are being wasted with minimal benefit while its future economic health is endangered another of trump s great promises was that he would eliminate the u s trade deficit here again trump s performance has been disastrous far from declining the u s trade deficit is now running some 40 percent above the level it was running when trump first assumed office trump points to the rise in stock prices as evidence that his economic policies are working but the truth is that stock prices have increased during trump s presidency at about half the pace that they increased during president obama s first three years in office bankrupting individual americans trump administration policies are leading to bankruptcy for large numbers of americans farmers have been hit especially hard farm bankruptcies grew to the highest level since 2011 according to the american farm bureau federation farm debt in 2019 is projected to be a record high 416 billion the farm bureau reported in october while farm income is 29 percent lower than in the record year of 2013 and this is happening despite the trump administration directing nearly 30 billion to farmers in bailout programs which along with other disaster aid and insurance indemnities now accounts for nearly 40 percent of farmers income and a lot of that aid has yet to actually reach farmers trump promised that his tax cuts for the wealthy and for corporations would lead to more jobs and higher wages for all americans but here again trump has not delivered on his promises tax cuts an enormous flop from a purely economic standpoint the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 has been an enormous flop writes michael linden executive director of the groundwork collaborative average u s job creation per month has actually declined in the nearly two years since the law passed and wage growth has been only a small fraction of what the white house promised during his campaign and in his inaugural address trump promised to protect the forgotten man and woman he has actually been doing just the opposite by systematically dismantling many protections for individual consumers protections for individual investors protections for people preparing for retirement and protections for other americans the trump administration is probably the most anti investor and consumer protection administration in decades if not ever said dennis kelleher president and ceo of better markets an investor and consumer watchdog group not only have protections for individual americans been stripped from regulations and policies but enforcement of remaining laws and regulations has also plummeted the result concludes public citizen is that while trump once asserted that he was not going to let wall street get away with murder he now is allowing industry after industry to get away with just about anything this too will cause bankruptcies for large numbers of individual americans trump also wants to take away access to health insurance for millions by undoing the affordable care act this would be especially damaging to those with pre existing conditions many of whom could not buy health insurance before that law took effect and if trump succeeds in undermining the affordable care act this would cause financial ruin to many more people given that medical issues and costs are the number one reason americans file for bankruptcy a career of business bankruptcies trump cultivates a mythology that he has been tremendously successful in business the reality is that public records show that six times trump filed chapter 11 bankruptcies for his companies yes not once not twice but six times and even in cases where trump was able to avoid bankruptcy there were many business failures for example trump defaulted on the debt of his airline trump shuttle turning it over to u s airways the full extent of trump s failures in business has been largely hidden by this refusal to release his tax returns but the new york times was able to obtain tax information from 1985 to 1994 and these records revealed 1 17 billion in business losses in these 10 years alone in fact year after year mr trump appears to have lost more money than nearly any other individual american taxpayer the times concluded comparing his losses to publicly available irs information these revelations led to newspaper and magazine headlines like this one as a businessman trump was the biggest loser of all how was trump able to stay in business despite many bankruptcies and losing so much money the answer is that trump was able to structure his deals so that he was losing other people s money that of banks bond investors governments and others more than his own money passing losses to others trump and his failed airline adam scull photolink net newscom in other words trump was passing financial losses to those who supported him not surprisingly this led many banks and other financial institutions to stop providing financing to trump the principal exception has been deutsche bank of germany over the past two decades it was the only mainstream financial institution consistently willing to do business with mr trump who had a history of defaulting on loans the bank lent him a total of more than 2 billion about 350 million of which was outstanding when he was sworn in as president this is the same bank that was fined 630 million in 2017 by american and british banking regulators in connection with around 10 billion in suspicious trades being laundered out of russia it s not just banks that have failed to receive payments due from trump hundreds of small businesses individual contractors laborers and other ordinary americans have alleged that trump has not paid them numerous reports have documented these claims such as this usa today story hundreds allege donald trump doesn t pay his bills and this wall street journal article donald trump s business plan left a trail of unpaid bills then there is trump university which trump shut down after he settled two class action lawsuits and a civil lawsuit accusing him of cheating thousands of americans out of millions of dollars through what many called a sham unfortunately some of the 7 000 potential beneficiaries of the 25 million lawsuit settlement passed away before receiving any refund such as boyce chair of springfield n j who lost 34 995 on so called mentorship program tuition the bottom line is that just as trump bankrupted business after business and built his fortune by passing debt and losses from his failing enterprises on to others so too is trump today bankrupting the country and passing the debt and losses from his failing economic policies

chris martenson good riddance to the twenty teens this is my last report from the good old twenty teens in some respects they didn t turn out at all like i thought they would but in many others exactly as predicted i badly underestimated the system s ability to perpetuate obvious frauds and swindles without causing a social rebellion and worse to watch so many otherwise intelligent people participate with glee negative interest rates back in 2008 when the crash course first came out you would have never convinced me that we d be sitting here at the cusp of 2020 with 11 trillion of negative yielding debt i have to place that phrase in quotation marks because although i can write those words i haven t a clue what they actually mean in a world where money is supposed to be a store of value how can money in the future be worth less than money today perhaps pablo escobar could help us here as he reputedly factored in a 10 loss on all his buried cash due to rats water damage mold or forgetting where he placed it thee twenty teens saw the extinguishment of bond vigilantes leaving nobody to seriously push back on the abomination of negative rates only speculators are left these days perfectly happy to place the bet that they ll be able to sell their negative yielding bonds to a greater fool at a higher price there s no such thing as a bond vigilante anymore only speculators perfectly happy to pull on a slot machine lever in the hopes of selling their negative yielding bonds to some other punter later on at a higher price paying any government to lend it money is a swindle buying greek national debt with a lower rate of return than us treasury debt is a swindle these and a thousand others completely obvious swindles and yet here we are with the vast machinery of state and corporate journalism aligned to tell you how good and right they all are shale oil i also underestimated the longevity of the recent shale oil boom i studied it intently early on concluded it was a money losing enterprise and then patiently waited for investors to wake up to that reality this realization has been slow to dawn on them but it s finally becoming understood slowly grudgingly however that s after 10 years of massive losses for hapless investors in the shale oil space shale company bond and equity holders have been slaughtered though those vast losses are yet to be recognized the reason while the capital raised from bond sales and equity offerings has already been spent so are the wells that were drilled with that money they re played out raising new capital merely obscures that any money that has not already been returned to investors can t be and won t be because of this dynamic source what does the above chart tell us only that the very best shale operator in the world operating in the very best shale play in the world sees an 82 decline rate in average well output in the first year which means that if that well has not entirely paid itself back within that first year it probably won t generate any returns for bond or shareholders to enjoy ever it also means that all the debt and equity capital poured into the ground between 2008 2017 is now invested in wells that are effectively depleted bluntly if the returns have not already happened on those monies they probably never will how could they the wells are mostly drained the table below shows the equity losses for a small sampling of afflicted companies hundreds of other shale companies have already gone completely bankrupt with similar staggering bond losses to investors it still doesn t make sense to me that the obvious cash destroying financial math of shale oil has proven so misunderstood that an entire decade has passed before the media and wall street have started to catch on live and learn old barnum there s a sucker born every minute new barnum investors are the best suckers there are more amazingly there has been such a rush to rip the shale oil out of the ground that the accompanying natural gas is simply burned off into the night sky all that lost fossil energy will never be used constructively other than signaling to the wider universe how moronically wasteful we ve been with a precious resource as a dec 24 2019 bloomberg article put it producers in the permian are already flaring record levels of natural gas the texas railroad commission which oversees the oil and gas industry in the state has granted nearly 6 000 permits allowing explorers to flare or vent natural gas this year that s more than 40 times as many permits granted at the start of the supply boom a decade ago source that was 6 000 opportunities to not be moronic and we passed on every single one there will come a time in the not too distant future when people will look back shake their heads and pass harsh judgment on the generations involved with wasting so much precious energy unless in dr seuss book the lorax the hero warns of the self destructive impacts of industrial and consumer exploitation of the natural world and its denizens the book ends with a final warning unless unless our destructive practices are halted and reversed much of the natural world will disappear forever never to return gone is gone man the distressing trends in the environment warned of in the lorax and in the crash course have sadly only become gotten predictably worse over this past decade i hate being right about those meanwhile i see a lot of people fretting about if how various carbon emission targets are going to be met let me alleviate the suspense they re not every single economically retrievable lump of coal and molecule of oil and gas is going to be extracted and burnt before we give up our addition to fossil fuel why because without energy nothing is possible especially our ridiculously comfortable lives of massive over consumption and fossil fuels remain unmatched in their net energy returns compared to today s alternatives even australia s current shattering of all its heat records with growing swaths of the continent literally aflame hasn t managed to trip any alarms in the skull of the australian pm scott morrison whose single major policy initiative on the matter was to enact harsh new penalties on any australians who might protest against the coal industry no one cares until you threaten to dampen corporate profits or impede the unchecked march of break neck resource extraction if you do then you re branded a threat a terrorist or indulgent and selfish in the words of mr morrison after all what could be more indulgent and selfish than advising we proceed with caution so as to protect society s future prospects in a post peak world we re probably not going to be seeing too many bananas way up north where i live in january and i m pretty sure the current ones individually wrapped in plastic won t be available any more there s something so offensive about an individually wrapped banana that it strikes like a closed fist it s a shining reminder that we re accelerating down a slippery slope while blithely spraying astroglide ahead of us maybe we should preserve one of these plastic wrapped banana to place in a future buzzfeed sponsored smithsonian display titled you won t believe these 10 stupid things your forebears did meanwhile as you can plainly see below innumerable science based summits

trouble soils continue to erode species are disappearing and weather events are getting more and more chaotic only a fool would build or re build as the case often is in a 500 year flood plain we can now count on those to be routinely swamped yet as a completely non sensical counter to all this the central banks of the world led by the fed have mounted a particularly spirited effort to make the wealthy insanely wealthier and by every measure they have not only succeeded but are determined to top their former high scores fed tastic one thing i never ever not once ever foresaw was the markets being a ok with the massive distortions the world central banking cartel has saddled the world with over the past decade 15 trillion in new currency printed from thin air the cramming of interest rates to 5 000 year lows negative interest rates the complete perversion of price discovery all in the service of making a very very few wealthy people even wealthier all while absolutely screwing the former middle classes slow roasting pensions and destroying the retirement dreams of millions living on a fixed income despite the fact the 99 9 of all journalists are decidedly not in the camp of the winners here they nonetheless take pains to never ask a single tricky question of the fed nor ask anything about its stated policy of robbing from the many to give to the few here s a still shot of the media over the past ten years engaging with the fed after ten years of non stop interventions the central banks have created the worst asset price bubble in history and are now trapped to try to keep it from popping they re being forced to use increasingly desperate measures not seen since the hairy depths of the worst moments of the great financial crisis over the past decade the markets morphed into markets which then metastasized into markets they are now so perversified that they are well and truly markets signifying that they lack any resemblance to a place where honest participants set honest prices collectively the world s central banks have undertaken more emergency easing than at any point in time since ever global central banks have cut interest rates roughly 90 times over the past year the largest cumulative easing since the financial crisis according to canadian imperial bank of commerce data while the fed accounted for three of those taking its policy rate down to a range of 1 5 to 1 75 that s still higher than much of the rest of the developed world including japan and europe where rates are near or even below zero it s very hard for the average foreign investor to survive we re still at a point now where it s max desperation source bloomberg how about that feeling better yet i certainly don t but don t tell the stock markets which are now wholly owned subsidiaries of the central banks and the governments of the world that protect this cartel never miss the news that matters most zerohedge directly to your inbox receive a daily recap featuring a curated list of must read stories they perform a utility function but instead of delivering electricity to your home they siphon wealth from the many to give to the few if robin hood s evil twin operated a utility he d operate the us equity markets while the average household in the us slips farther and farther behind going deeper and deeper into debt the fed congratulates its efforts believing it s doing god s work again here s the media on all this at this point you really ought to be asking yourself why exactly are the world s central banks led by the fed freaking out so badly right now as we close out the twenty teens all i can say is you d better start working on providing the basics for yourself and your family because when this credit cycle finally ends it s going to be horrible which is precisely what the central bankers know too while you and i may share in that knowledge it remains unacceptable to talk about in public the overton window does not allow for such talk anywhere and certainly never in the mainstream media which is on track to close out the twenty teens having failed in its fourth estate duties more comprehensively than any other press cohort in history the end of magnificent folly there s a great emergency happening right now but society is not acknowledging it the social mood is darkening fourth turning style and people are protesting and risking life career and limb to express their anxiety and frustration with the policies of team elite but don t expect to hear about that on the nightly news or in the mainstream press the economy is doing so great that central banks are applying record breaking amounts of funny money stimulus to counter something or more accurately to avoid something i hold the view that people are organisms and that we re wired to know when our nest is getting fouled our instincts honed over millions of years of evolution are to migrate to a new less polluted or played out home that only makes sense but the problem is that now there s nowhere new to go no next valleys no unpolluted corner to wander off to and inhabit for a while so those of us who are of an age and remember when a porch light left on for an august night would attract a zootopia of strange and wonderful insects to our screen doors how many of you are now deeply anxious as i am at the creepily barren screens we now wake up to it s as if the rapture happened only surprise god took the insects because they didn t have any clothes to leave behind nobody noticed but we ll soon notice the ramifications of knocking out them and other key pillars of the food chain on which we depend as i look forward i sincerely hope we can do a lot better in the 2020 s the bar is current set depressingly low but we probably won t that s the reality what will the 2020 s hold more of the same likely though also some very sharp differences because the effects of a lot of our current bad decisions will come home to roost very soon my simplified view of the 2020 s is this you better be working on your garden s soil developing a tight and close trust network and be emotionally prepared to adapt quickly to new situations and circumstances in part 2 the coming decade will see the end of today s magnificent folly we explain why given today s systemic distortions and deformations predicting the events of the next ten years will be much easier than it was for the twenty teens largely because there s little room left down the road to kick the can further conflict contraction and consequences will define the coming decade it will be a time of loss scarcity and pain for many but it need not be for you not if you use the time we have remaining wisely peakprosperity com
low rates compounded by low inflation make it impossible for institutions not to keep betting on stocks pushing them higher analysts see high percentile of all time highs as a sign equities not yet signaling exhaustion dollar finishes week flat with no negative headlines to pressure markets little resistance and low trading volumes during the final full trading week of 2019 the is on track to match 2013 s 29 6 return the best performance of the decade for the benchmark to date during last week s trading u s indices including the spx and hit all time highs allowing stocks to keep gliding upward fueled by central bank accommodation and the promise of a u s china trade deal historically stocks have risen by an average of 7 0 during the year following a 25 or higher return but in 2014 the market still gained 11 39 indicating that good returns don t have to be followed by bad ones however given current lofty valuations we think investors need to incorporate lower expected long term rates of return into their strategies near 20 correction as 2018 closed near record returns as 2019 ends for the first time on thursday the nasdaq bested the 9 000 level amazon com nasdaq was among the top equity performers after the e commerce giant reported a record breaking holiday season while the calendar does not substantively dictate market cycles it does have a psychological effect as the year comes to a close shareholders and clients of institutional investors in particular generally take stock of the performance of their investments in many ways 2019 was like 2016 stocks at record highs with risk to the downside but exuberance just keeps pushing prices higher while we recognize that the fed s has a profound impact on markets both from the perspective of the growing money supply with downside risk diminished on the promise of continued accommodation such policy has always been used to combat roaring inflation never as a way for the fed to attempt to stoke inflation this disconnect with the fed s loosening despite no economic call for it is taking us to a place where investors have never gone before case in point we can t recall another market theme that has disappointed investors so many times and yet they ve continued buying it this past year featured 34 new record highs for the s p 500 following a late december correction that was barely below the arbitrary 20 gauge for a bear market 2018 s worst christmas eve on record since 2013 when the market fully recovered from the pre 2008 crash returning to the 2007 high the spx has hit all time highs 271 times that s a mind boggling 16 of all trading days during which the phenomenon occured according to factset analysts take this to indicate that new highs are not indicative of exhaustion these records were driven to a fair degree by 126 months of economic expansion indeed this past june u s growth overtook the robust numbers made during the 1990s claiming the record economists attribute the easy does it or goldilocks economy for the occurrence when growth overheats it burns out but if it s kept at simmer it can last and last and apparently last what has supported growth is the since the 1960s now at a 50 year low the u s labor market has expanded by 2 million jobs allowing consumers to remain confident and keep spending which is a good thing for the nation s economy since consumer spending makes up 65 of american the irregular circumstances low inflation coupled with low interest rates resulted in something highly uncharacteristic no 10 stock correction during the year indeed the s p experienced only two modest pullbacks a 6 8 drawdown in may and 6 1 in august for historical comparison corrections in the stock market defined as a decline of 10 or more have occurred on average about once a year also reflecting the low degree of fluctuation this past year the s p 500 experienced only seven daily moves up or down of 2 or more in 2019 compared with an average of 19 over the past 20 years according to factset another factor that boosted global demand for u s assets world gdp growth that decelerated to roughly 3 the slowest global growth in 10 years attributable directly to the trade spat treasury yields on the other hand were halved from the november 2018 highs to the september 2019 lows which is strange considering yields should rise along with equities as both accelerate on reduced risk in early november rates on the u s note ascended above the downtrend line since the november 2018 peak but have been unable to best the november 2019 highs and have been stuck between the two trends on friday they fell back below the 200 dma in october the 50 wma fell below the 200 wma triggering a rate death cross on the weekly chart for the first time since 2015 also on the weekly chart yields are developing a rising wedge bearish following the 55 drop between the november 2018 highs and the september 2019 lows the ended the week almost flat rising less than 1 however at the same time the greenback developed a rising channel whose bottom is being tested on the one hand the fed s reversal of the path to interest rates weighed on the dollar though on the other hand the demand for treasurys as the most reliable safe haven helped prop up the global reserve currency is up almost 36 for the year oversupply due to a global slowdown and u s shale production provoked a selloff during the course of the year however central bank accommodation and trade agreement hopes with recent data bolstering the argument for global growth pushed oil up 11 7 this month while the commodity s three month plunge from october through december 2018 which mirrored the wild equity selloff during the same period has been trimmed crude is still down more than 15

kansas city star mo dec 29 neodesha kan paula wells and her husband were just getting serious about how to fund their fifth grader s college tuition then a wealthy businessman instantly absolved them and their entire town of that particular obligation it s almost like i just got an 80 000 bonus into my retirement plan said wells who also has a kindergartner and that s very attractive to a lot of people this southeast kansas town of about 2 300 has been buzzing since a former resident in november announced the neodesha promise program which offers a simple yet extraordinary pledge anyone who lives here and graduates from the local high school can qualify for free college tuition the program was designed to give neodesha a unique and persuasive draw and people are already taking notice wells is the owner and pharmacist at porter drugs where she quickly recognizes customers and hands over their pills without ever asking for a name or id from her post at the back of the main street store she s already heard about families who plan to relocate here lured by the program that s a big deal she said because a month ago you wouldn t have heard somebody say hey i want to move to neodesha wells said an influx of new families will help keep local businesses afloat and possibly encourage new ones to open her independent pharmacy needs the town s sole grocery store down the street to stay in business because people who drive to a neighboring town to buy bread and milk at walmart are likely to fill their prescriptions there too you don t often hear of a program that comes along where there s no downside wells said while it s the first in kansas neodesha joins hundreds of other promise scholarship and grant programs across the country missouri s statewide a program for example offers two years of free community college and technical school for all high school graduates who meet modest academic requirements but the neodesha program will go further it covers a full four years of college tuition and fees offering a financial windfall potentially worth up to 44 000 per student with actuarial projections promising enough funding for at least 25 years the program stands to benefit an entire generation of students and their families while the gift was to the school the idea is to stimulate the economy as a whole said devin johnson a local bank vice president and mayor elect of neodesha how much or whether the town will actually grow remains to be seen but any uptick would be significant after the town lost more than 1 000 residents over the last 40 years local leaders say they re determined to capitalize on their enormous gift the donation has accelerated fledgling efforts to revive the defunct chamber of commerce and tackle the city s longstanding housing shortage residents in the surrounding area have called the schools to learn more interest in housing has spiked and families from kansas city 150 miles to the north and even as far away as pennsylvania have considered a move i m just trying to temper my expectations johnson said a one stoplight town obeying the posted 20 and 30 mph speed limits a driver can pass through neodesha in under three minutes on u s 75 after 7 p m the lights go out at beef burger bob s a 14 seat haunt promising the best yet among the only burgers in town on main street only the subway sonic drive in and pizza hut stay open any later the one stoplight town is so small that it lacks a coffee shop bar or diner so the group of retired men who banter over coffee early in the morning do so inside a gas station neodesha pronounced knee oh duh shay is the osage term for meeting of the waters so named because of the verdigris and fall rivers that converge just south of town but oil rather than water was the lifeblood of the town for years a successful well drilled here in 1892 sparked the wider frenzy for oil across kansas oklahoma louisiana and texas a replica of the norman no 1 well the first west of the mississippi river to produce commercial amounts of oil still greets visitors at the city s eastern entrance and pump jacks still bob along the horizon in the grain fields outside of town but the oil boom ended decades ago capped off by the 1970 closure of neodesha s refinery wilson county reached its peak population in 1920 according to census figures it s a similar story across rural kansas the population of 72 of the state s 105 counties peaked before 1960 and 68 kansas counties peaked before the dust bowl according to the university of kansas institute for policy and social research if there was ever a possibility for something to build neodesha back up there s no doubt that this is the opportunity said jennifer marler a neodesha native this is absolutely it she s a nurse at an assisted living facility in town and her significant other is the chief of the town s eight officer police force together they have five children the two older kids already attending college won t qualify for the new scholarship but for the younger kids the gift relieves a huge burden one daughter for instance already understands she can realize her hope of becoming a veterinarian marler loves the community vibe where it really feels like the entire village partakes in raising children but she said the town s economic fortunes have been on a little downhill spiral the scholarship program has already boosted optimism about the town s future she said i hope this does bring it back to thriving she said i do want it to be a place our kids can come back home to and more people can call it home in a town this small secrets rarely remain secrets so in the days before the program was announced people knew something big was happening but maler said few appreciated the scale of the news it was larger than anybody could have anticipated marler said you just think of all the kids that literally probably wouldn t have gone to college just because of finances and now they can i owe that community a lot when ben cutler grew up here in the 1950s and 1960s neodesha was a different place his mother was a church organist and his father farmed and worked as an electrician at the refinery paychecks from the refinery supported a wide variety of shops and small businesses this year when cutler traveled home he had to book a room at a comfort inn in nearby independence kansas while much has changed cutler is forever beholden to his upbringing here which he says provided him with an invaluable moral compass and work ethic i absolutely don t think i would be near as successful as i ve been without that early nurturing i got in neodesha said cutler calling from his home in arizona so i feel i owe that community a lot he moved away for college graduate school and a lucrative career in health insurance but he stayed connected to his hometown in 2014 cutler retired as ceo of ushealth group a company that provides health care to small business owners and the self employed this year the company sold to health care giant unitedhealthcare cutler had long supported nongovernmental organizations that combat hunger and poverty across the globe but his domestic interest was sparked by the success of another promise program in kalamazoo michigan he liked the idea for his kansas hometown for two reasons it might open the door for students who otherwise couldn t afford college and it could help rebuild his hometown even before the promise program neodesha s alumni association touted a hefty scholarship fund awarding more than 70 000 last year alone cutler didn t say how much money he committed to scholarships but he says his financial modeling shows the town has enough to cover college costs for 25 years and hopefully much longer than that i probably explored half a dozen different ways that i might use some of my capital resources to improve that community said cutler now 75 the more i studied it the more i was convinced that the best bang for the buck i could create was through the promise program the requirements the college promise campaign was founded in 2015 by civic nation a nonprofit dedicated to addressing some of the nation s most pressing challenges that s the universal theme of college promise though each program varies by location martha kanter executive director of the college promise campaign said it s less of a set program and more of a movement that continues to pick up steam across the country fueling that movement is the fact that more jobs than ever require some education beyond high school yet the cost of higher education has continued to climb with u s student loan debt now exceeding 1 5 trillion kanter said the college promise is underway in 330 towns funded by a variety of education government business and nonprofit entities each program creates its own eligibility requirements and promises the recipients must make some require that they remain or work in the state for a certain number of years after graduation funding levels vary the university of missouri system launched a promise and opportunity scholarship in 2017 budgeting 75 million over six years for need based scholarships at the university of missouri and the university of missouri kansas city it s paid for by a combination of dollars from the um system the universities and nonprofits with different programs all across the country kanter said it s difficult to provide overall numbers on college graduation rates that would indicate the success of the concept in neodesha the primary requirement of the promise program is residency graduates must have attended local public schools since at least sixth grade to fully qualify yet even those who start in the ninth grade can receive up to a 75 award students must also apply for federal financial aid do community service and leave high school with a minimum act score of 19 and a cumulative gpa of 2 5 the program will pay for college tuition and mandatory fees at any technical school community college or university that accepts pell grants those schools can be anywhere in the country though the award is capped at the highest price for in state tuition for 120 credit hours at a state school currently that s about 44 000 for four years at the university of kansas locals expect that to be a strong enough incentive to lure more people to move to town if this works like i think it s going to we should see at a very minimum 15 growth in the first three years said don adams a fourth generation resident who owns a financial services firm on main street he also served on the committee that helped put together the scholarship program he said the city has known for years it needs more housing an issue exacerbated after more than 100 homes were demolished following a 2007 flood neodesha touts a strong base of manufacturing jobs with several factories including cobalt boats known for its luxury speedboats but each day hundreds of factory workers leave the city and head home to towns across southeast kansas adams and others hope a boost in housing stock paired with the promise program will convince some of them to move in the city has already signed a contract with an iowa developer that specializes in rural residential development and it s purchased a deteriorating mobile home park it hopes to transform into single family lots this gives us a real reason why we need to go work our tails off adams said the city s already been preparing for this event they just didn t know it was coming promise in arkansas as neodesha prepares for growth many are looking at the success of a similar program nearly 500 miles away in southern arkansas the el dorado promise was launched in 2007 with a 50 million gift from locally based murphy oil corp the company promised to cover tuition and fees up to the highest cost for arkansas resident tuition at the state s most expensive public university which is currently 9 585 per year it can be used at any college in the country like neodesha people in el dorado expected the program to attract new residents retain current ones and revitalize a community in decline the city s 2018 population of about 18 000 was down nearly 3 600 from 2010 s count according to the u s census bureau but the program has enlivened el dorado in other ways said sylvia thompson executive director of el dorado promise she said the community voted for a property tax increase the first such tax hike since richard nixon was president to fund a new 52 million high school which opened in 2011 the high school is fabulous said thompson whose offices are housed there it is state of the art we used to have a school gym now we have an arena the following year the town raised taxes again to build a conference center and administration office at the local community college in the last 10 years el dorado has seen a new art district sprout a new 7 000 seat amphitheater new restaurants and three new hotels it reenergized the town and made us realize we could do anything she said more importantly el dorado became a school district that sends kids to college who are prepared for college said thompson a former teacher the high school nearly quadrupled the number of advanced placement courses offered and has been recognized by the college board for its high number of minority and poor students taking those courses the district now starts ap preparation in fifth grade the district saw that every child in every classroom now has the ability to go to college she said money is no barrier in el dorado 85 of graduates go to college every year half of them graduate from a four year college or university with at least a bachelor s degree thompson said school enrollment had been declining for 20 years before the promise program since then families have moved in because of it the district s student body has actually grown and is now holding steady she said when the promise was announced the decline stopped she said staying alive folks in neodesha say that even before ben cutler announced his gift their community was holding steady buoyed by a grit to keep the town alive they can point to plenty of stories of kids who grew up moved away and eventually returned and plenty of others who never left in the first place and the town hardly sits still with entrepreneurs frequently trying out new shops and restaurants even if they don t last walking outside of his office on the town s quiet main street gary larson rattles off the latest comings and goings the neodelicious home style cafe is one of the most recent businesses to close at least a dozen more storefronts sit vacant but it s hardly a ghost town local home decor shop the derrick not to be confused with the local newspaper of the same name just expanded into a bigger building a sporting goods store selling guns and fishing gear just opened and the building marked only by a faded sign for jo s doll menagerie was just bought up at auction and word is it will be repurposed into an arts space the downtown also shows off many of the charms of small town life an artificial christmas tree decorated by elementary school kids stands as an honor to veterans it sits in an empty lot in front of a vivid mural depicting old glory a towering oil derrick and the emblem of the local masonic lodge across the street the local physician s stately yellow victorian house looms over a perfectly manicured corner lot its yard connects to the doctor s office building next door that thing gets a lot of attention larson said all in all the town looks a lot like those that he visits in his work as a regional director for the fellowship of christian athletes all across kansas small towns struggle as their residents migrate to bigger cities but none in the state have the lifeline of the scholarship program everybody s kind of facing the same fight he said this is what makes neodesha different now behind our reporting how did the star hear about this story star reporter kevin hardy is a native of independence kansas about 15 miles from neodesha he first heard about the neodesha promise from friends on his social media feed who shared the original news but a text from a friend in kansas city prodded him to pitch the story for the star click on arrow at top right for more how did he report the story familiar with the area and understanding the threats to rural america hardy wondered how the news would resonate beyond the students and families who stood to benefit from free college from the first phone call it became clear that locals expected the program to fundamentally change the trajectory of their town and local economy so hardy headed home for thanksgiving a day early and talked to people in a town he s mostly driven through on the way to someplace else he enlisted the star s education reporter mará rose williams to help research similar programs nationally

themarket will this year be like the last one for stocks it is that time of the year when fortune telling becomes a popular past time in the financial markets every wall street strategist releases their projections for the economy the markets and earnings for the new year what strikes me about 2020 s crop of predictions is their similarity my own informal survey of analyst s forecasts seems to converge around a 1 8 percent 2 0 percent prediction for economic growth in the u s earnings for the most part hover around the unchanged mark or slightly better these professional forecasters are looking for no more than average gains in the rate of return ror for stocks based on the equity benchmark index the s p 500 what does that mean to me on average over the past 150 years or so the s p 500 index has returned roughly 4 5 percent if you add in dividends that ror increases to 6 7 percent you can read these consensus forecasts in one of two ways they could mean that none of these people who are paid to forecast really know what the stock market is going to do next year so they are hiding behind an average return if they are wrong they can always point to the fact that from a historical perspective the markets should have at least provided that much in gains the second possibility is that all of these high paid wall street pundits actually believe their forecasts in which case as a contrarian i worry that with everyone leaning to one side of the boat there is a chance that the markets will do something quite unexpected if that is the case you have to ask will stocks perform better or worse than the average ask yourself what could go right or wrong for the economy and therefore the markets in 2020 first of all we are entering a new decade the last one was wonderful for stocks the chances of a repeat performance in the twenty twenties could happen but i doubt it physics would tell you what goes up must come down but who says it has to happen next year for me the largest risk out there in 2020 is a spike in inflation this year wage growth finally exceeded the inflation rate it took the entire decade to get there plus trillions of dollars of global central bank monetary stimulus that stimulus is still going on and according to all these strategists should continue into next year on a worldwide basis if i accept that the u s economy will continue to muddle through and unemployment will continue to remain at record lows one could expect wage growth to gain even greater momentum and wage growth my dear reader is the main engine of inflation in this country in addition we could actually see economic growth higher than what the economists are predicting because it is an election year no one can predict what politicians will do or who will win an election this early in the political cycle yet the market s performance will depend on not only who wins but prior to that who is perceived to be winning however i can confidently predict that neither political party will be willing to reduce government spending in 2020 in fact the opposite almost always occurs during a presidential election year we are already witnessing both parties coming together to pass a flurry of legislation including a spending bill at the end of this year i expect to see more of that in 2020 more spending should equal more growth more growth means higher wages etc then there is the trump trade war everyone seems to be predicting more of the same tariffs will remain trump will continue to use trade to get what he wants and as a result business confidence and investment will remain subdued thus the muddle through economic forecast what might happen if the president switches tactics donald trump has two things going for him when it comes to voter sentiment even those who hate him believe he has done a good job on the economy and the stock market the only thing that has held back even stronger growth people believe is his trade wars if he were to change his tactics shelve the trade war for nine months and work to expand the economy through government spending then what the economy may grow faster than expected global growth could get a boost emerging markets might benefit as would other overseas markets as a result trump would probably win in november because no matter what americans say they tend to vote with their pocketbooks stronger economic growth both here and abroad a historically low unemployment rate and the inability thanks to trump s immigration policies by companies to hire the skilled labor they need would mean more wage hikes that would translate into higher consumer spending higher prices for goods and services and maybe just maybe the inflation cycle begins in my next column i will pursue this line of thought and provide some other scenarios that could play out in the new year until then have a most wonderful new year
gillette a fresh blanket of snow coated the field surrounding the dry fork station power plant set underneath a flawless blue sky in the heart of wyoming s coal country the untouched landscape looked like a blank canvas awaiting its first brush stroke largely hidden from the eye eight carbon capture testing pads sat just beneath the glistening snow ready for use jason begger s footsteps broke the

of all of this is to maintain a viable asset in a world that is moving away from high carbon intensity projects said begger who helps oversee the testing center in this case the asset that needs saving is wyoming coal in the race to respond to shifting market pressures wyoming lawmakers and energy experts have been on the hunt for solutions to save the state s ailing coal industry many including begger consider advancements in carbon capture or the trapping and reusing of carbon dioxide as one part of the solution some go so far as to tout the budding technology as a silver bullet for the state in the eyes of its proponents carbon capture would eventually allow coal fired power plants to eliminate emissions and continue humming along for decades to come but critics of the state s hearty investment in carbon capture view it as a losing battle in an increasingly carbon constrained world it s a venture that has already gobbled up billions of dollars in taxpayer money with few tangible returns they say despite the pushback wyoming lawmakers are diving head first into the venture king of coal wyoming produces more coal than any other state in the country communities here take pride in contributing 40 percent of the coal needed to meet the nation s electrical demand the state also pumps out 15 times more energy than it consumes making it the nation s largest net exporter of energy but unsteady coal markets have thrown the state s top ranking into jeopardy last year u s coal consumption fell to the lowest level since 1979 that s largely because coal s once stable customer base has branched out to cheaper natural gas and more commercially viable renewable energy what s more concerns over climate change have placed unprecedented pressure on utility companies to pivot to less carbon intensive electricity sources a vast majority of scientists agree that carbon dioxide is a leading contributor to human caused climate change among the nation s electricity producers coal plants release the most carbon during operations but only contribute to 31 percent of the nation s energy supply according to the environmental protection agency yet begger sees the carbon dioxide emitted from coal not just as a waste product or environmental liability instead it s the key to saving the state s challenged coal industry he said capturing carbon produced during the processing of coal to electricity could keep the fossil industry viable even amid growing demand for carbon reduction even though coal markets are going to fundamentally change you don t just throw your hands up and say we re just walking away from this begger explained like it or not wyoming is a fossil energy state and we have set up our tax base and our economy really on the extractive industry many wyomingites continue to hold out hope viewing carbon capture as one slice of the solution to the state s economic challenges the state has secured millions of federal dollars to research carbon capture as recently as nov 18 the wyoming infrastructure authority announced plans to lay the groundwork for a massive network of carbon dioxide pipelines to criss cross the state and transport the product to begger the stakes of carbon capture ventures could not be higher for wyoming you can help shape what the future looks like if you re actually helping drive it so we re trying to take that leadership role he said if you re not at the table pushing solutions and driving things then you re probably going to be on the menu cautionary tale imagine you re a surfer and a 30 foot wave is descending upon you you have two choices you can get up on that wave to ride it or you can drown explained david schlissel a longtime attorney consultant and expert witness on carbon capture market forces are dictating the transition from coal to other resources particularly renewables he said in other words the governor can try to save coal but the transition is going to be here regardless the state needs to ensure coal dependent communities can survive and thrive in the new energy economy schlissel emphasized but the answer doesn t rest with carbon capture rather than spend billions of dollars on carbon capture and multi billions if you re talking about more than one coal plant spend the money on the people he said the technological economic and environmental hurdles facing carbon capture may prove to be too great several analysts interviewed by the star tribune cautioned it s dangerous to view carbon capture as a panacea for wyoming s crippled coal industry said bob leresche vice chair of the powder river basin resource council and a board member of the western organization of resource councils carbon capture is a real unicorn but there is no way to think of it as ever being economical he asserted i would love it if someone would invent a silver bullet but the odds of that happening are very very slim that hasn t stopped the nation and wyoming from trying federal investment in the dream of capturing carbon isn t new for over 15 years the federal government has pumped billions of dollars into the effort since 2010 it has appropriated over 5 billion to the u s department of energy for carbon capture research according to a u s congressional review service report so far carbon capture projects have generated mixed results just two operating carbon capture power plants exist in north america petra nova power plant in houston and boundary dam power station in canada neither one of those plants have operated at the levels that they said they were going to operate when they built the facilities noted dennis wamsted an analyst at the institute for energy economics and financial analysis an energy transition think tank nrg energy the owner of petra nova has struggled to turn the carbon unit into the low cost generator it had hoped for the company collaborated with jx nippon oil and gas exploration corp in japan to tack on a carbon capture unit to its 3 700 megawatt parish generating plant according to a 2018 report published by ieefa retrofitting the plant for carbon capture cost 1 billion approximately 190 million came from the federal government flue gas from 240 megawatts of power are diverted from petra nova s unit 8 that s roughly one third of total emissions from that one unit the company then transports the captured carbon to nearby oilfields for enhanced oil recovery gobbling up energy but critics of carbon capture have pointed out that facilities like petra nova chew through an inordinate amount of energy making carbon capture one of the most inefficient electricity generators among its peers the sticking point mainly comes down to cost it s difficult to transform coal fired power plants into low carbon facilities using carbon capture without increasing electricity costs outfitting a coal plant with a carbon capture system decreases the plant s thermal efficiency and hikes up electricity costs according to a university of michigan study petra nova had to construct a natural gas unit next to the carbon capture system to provide enough energy to power it ironically the natural gas plant spewed about 450 000 tons of carbon over the course of about 17 months based on findings outlined in the ieefa report some carbon capture facilities such as another one built in mississippi by southern company consumed 30 percent of the plant s gross energy output the report noted to put it in perspective natural gas plants eat up about 3 to 4 percent of their energy output for operations the system s inefficiency and other technical problems make producing energy through carbon capture significantly more expensive than a conventional natural gas plant in 2017 the southern company shut down the carbon capture section of its plant in mississippi citing the lack of fiscal feasibility the department of justice subsequently launched an investigation into the company s decision in may the federal government had chipped in 387 million for the failed carbon capture project carbon capture is still expensive to do and it increases the cost of generated electricity confirmed rob godby an economist at the university of wyoming if you bolt it to a coal fired power plant that already can t compete with other alternative energy sources like natural gas or renewables it only makes it less competitive that said the technology could advance to solve efficiency and fiscal shortcomings currently hampering carbon capture units but it may be too little too late there s still a lot of learning by doing to be done godby said carbon plants will likely not be able to compete with electricity markets soon enough several analysts commented right now the biggest use that we have for carbon capture is enhanced oil recovery godby added in the process known as eor carbon dioxide is injected into reservoirs to remove residual oil that traditional drilling processes failed to extract but coal fired power plants generate so much carbon dioxide already you don t need too many carbon capture facilities before you satisfy all the eor demand that you might have at a local region godby said the lack of significant pipeline infrastructure blocks operators from expanding the product into other markets even outside wyoming the country s coal fleet is aging too as operating lives of coal fired power plants continue to shrink upgrades renovations and retrofit projects prove costly skeptics point to low carbon intensive energy systems like natural gas or wind as more viable options for wyoming ultimately it s important the state is clear eyed as it expands carbon capture capabilities godby said there is a real concern here that you are raising false hopes godby lamented carbon capture will not arrest the transition that is going on it potentially creates a use for some of the coal and some of the facilities that we have in the state in the future but we re still looking at a whole heap of coal closures whether they are mines or power plants before that technology is widely implemented the case for research hydraulic fracturing or fracking revolutionized the global energy economy in the blink of an eye the practice which involves injecting sand and chemicals into the ground at enormous pressures suddenly allowed operators to extract astronomical volumes of oil and natural gas advancements in fracking technology and a sudden flood of investment in it during the early 2000s catapulted the u s into the upper echelons of the global oil market a ranking it continues to occupy today but fracking wasn t exactly a new technology when it went mainstream it came onto the energy scene thanks to decades of research into how to make it both efficient and cost effective therefore even carbon capture skeptics consider research into carbon dioxide reduction technology a worthwhile investment i m all in favor of research said wamsted the analyst at ieefa research has gotten us a long way research led to the fracking revolution for natural gas research done by the department of energy helped commercialize wind and solar technologies that are now driving energy costs down across the country research is a laudable and commendable and a goal that should be sought by both state and federal government but the problem largely comes down to timing he reasoned coal production declined by 9 percent this year compared to last according to the energy information administration add to that the increasing urgency around reducing greenhouse gas emissions and averting irreparable damage wrought by global warming what we need are technologies and solutions that can reduce emissions now not in 10 or 15 years wamsted noted and the problem with carbon capture is that you can find a technology that will work but can you find a technology that will work quick enough and cost effective enough to be worthwhile carbon capture is still in its research and development stage but that does not mean the state shouldn t value the integrated test center or other state led initiatives to advance carbon capture technologies said godby the wyoming economist there s a compelling basic research case to be made to continue developing those technologies he said they may in the future at some point be valuable and so that basic research is reasonable and could potentially have future value which right now is uncertain without actually studying it we won t know the potential value technologies in the pipeline wyoming s integrated test center came to be thanks to a 15 million appropriation from the wyoming legislature in 2014 under then gov matt mead what remains of the appropriated funding will support the center until 2026 at that point begger hopes the center will be able to sustain itself the strategy is to commercialize those technologies to ensure we can reap the benefits of this incredible resource for as long as possible he said the center opened to significant fanfare in march and tenants have started to trickle in to experiment kawasaki heavy industries ltd a japanese company plans to test carbon capture processes at the integrated test center as part of a partnership between wyoming and the japan coal energy center the collaboration between the two entities launched in 2016 the company plans to be onsite in 2021 after construction of the design is complete according to begger finalists from an international competition called carbon xprize will also be stationed at the integrated test center in the near future the competition provides millions of dollars to scientists who find ways to transform carbon dioxide into utilitarian products like fuel or building materials in october tda research trucked in a bright yellow skid from colorado to test a hybrid system using two types of carbon capture technology they will continue testing for the next three to four months at the center in begger s mind what makes the center so special is its ability to pilot carbon capture technology on a scale comparable to commercial power plants a majority of carbon capture tests happen in universities at laboratory benches that s a far cry from the scale of hundred plus megawatt power plants i don t think anybody is naive enough to think that we re going to be mining coal for 1 000 years begger stated but until we have that transition in place you can t just shut it down a lot of what the state is doing is trying to find those pieces of science and a business plan to provide a transition and glide forward a lot of it is just hope he added a railroad engineer who documents wyoming s coal country in photos view from the rails view from the rails view from the rails view from the rails view from the rails

once the principal you owe drops to 80 of the home s value you can ask your lender to cancel the pmi to maximize your chances of getting it canceled make your payments on time even if you don t get

economy in the history of our country donald trump tweeted in september trump has repeatedly claimed big economic benefits from his presidency and this claim undergirds a lot of trump s popular support but the truth is that trump is a failure economically both in his business career and in his actions as president it is time to connect the dots of trump s economic failures in a way that everyone understands a powerful way to communicate trump s true economic legacy is to brand him as bankrupter in chief trump this is the real bottom line of trump s business career and it is what he is actually doing to the country and to individual americans to drive home this message bankrupter in chief trump should be repeated after each new trump claim policy action and report that illustrates this message until most americans understand this as trump s true legacy the country s economic resources are being wasted while its future economic health is endangered trump campaigned on the promise of eliminating the federal debt within eight years but what his economic policies have actually been doing is bankrupting the country the u s government s budget deficit ballooned to almost 1 trillion in 2019 which is nearly a 50 percent increase during trump s time in office debt to top 4 1 trillion trump s overall contribution to the national debt for the bills he has signed into law is projected to top 4 1 trillion according to the nonpartisan committee for a responsible federal budget the largest portion of this increase is coming from trump s tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations which are projected to boost the nation s debt by 1 8 trillion according to this group s analysis trump promised this his economic policies would lead to growth in the economy of between 3 and 4 percent per year but the reality is that the economy has been growing at barely 2 percent over the past year and the average economic growth since trump took office has been a little more than 2 25 percent per year the promised benefits from the massive tax cut have not materialized and in fact the united states has now had two consecutive quarters of negative investment growth not only are trump s tax cuts not boosting business investment as promised but they are also bankrupting the country s economic future the nonpartisan congressional budget office projects that deficits will remain massive each year going forward until the total federal government debt reaches nearly 100 percent of the country s gdp gross domestic product under current law the federal government is projected to borrow an additional 13 6 trillion from the end of 2018 through 2029 boosting debt held by the public to 29 3 trillion squandered stimulus the country s ability to weather economic downturns has also been compromised because the tools of economic stimulus needed to pull the country out of a recession have already been squandered at a time when they were not needed the country s economic resources are being wasted with minimal benefit while its future economic health is endangered another of trump s great promises was that he would eliminate the u s trade deficit here again trump s performance has been disastrous far from declining the u s trade deficit is now running some 40 percent above the level it was running when trump first assumed office trump points to the rise in stock prices as evidence that his economic policies are working but the truth is that stock prices have increased during trump s presidency at about half the pace that they increased during president obama s first three years in office bankrupting individual americans trump administration policies are leading to bankruptcy for large numbers of americans farmers have been hit especially hard farm bankruptcies grew to the highest level since 2011 according to the american farm bureau federation farm debt in 2019 is projected to be a record high 416 billion the farm bureau reported in october while farm income is 29 percent lower than in the record year of 2013 and this is happening despite the trump administration directing nearly 30 billion to farmers in bailout programs which along with other disaster aid and insurance indemnities now accounts for nearly 40 percent of farmers income and a lot of that aid has yet to actually reach farmers trump promised that his tax cuts for the wealthy and for corporations would lead to more jobs and higher wages for all americans but here again trump has not delivered on his promises tax cuts an enormous flop from a purely economic standpoint the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 has been an enormous flop writes michael linden executive director of the groundwork collaborative average u s job creation per month has actually declined in the nearly two years since the law passed and wage growth has been only a small fraction of what the white house promised during his campaign and in his inaugural address trump promised to protect the forgotten man and woman he has actually been doing just the opposite by systematically dismantling many protections for individual consumers protections for individual investors protections for people preparing for retirement and protections for other americans the trump administration is probably the most anti investor and consumer protection administration in decades if not ever said dennis kelleher president and ceo of better markets an investor and consumer watchdog group not only have protections for individual americans been stripped from regulations and policies but enforcement of remaining laws and regulations has also plummeted the result concludes public citizen is that while trump once asserted that he was not going to let wall street get away with murder he now is allowing industry after industry to get away with just about anything this too will cause bankruptcies for large numbers of individual americans trump also wants to take away access to health insurance for millions by undoing the affordable care act this would be especially damaging to those with pre existing conditions many of whom could not buy health insurance before that law took effect and if trump succeeds in undermining the affordable care act this would cause financial ruin to many more people given that medical issues and costs are the number one reason americans file for bankruptcy a career of business bankruptcies trump cultivates a mythology that he has been tremendously successful in business the reality is that public records show that six times trump filed chapter 11 bankruptcies for his companies yes not once not twice but six times and even in cases where trump was able to avoid bankruptcy there were many business failures for example trump defaulted on the debt of his airline trump shuttle turning it over to u s airways the full extent of trump s failures in business has been largely hidden by this refusal to release his tax returns but the new york times was able to obtain tax information from 1985 to 1994 and these records revealed 1 17 billion in business losses in these 10 years alone in fact year after year mr trump appears to have lost more money than nearly any other individual american taxpayer the times concluded comparing his losses to publicly available irs information these revelations led to newspaper and magazine headlines like this one as a businessman trump was the biggest loser of all how was trump able to stay in business despite many bankruptcies and losing so much money the answer is that trump was able to structure his deals so that he was losing other people s money that of banks bond investors governments and others more than his own money passing losses to others in other words trump was passing financial losses to those who supported him not surprisingly this led many banks and other financial institutions to stop providing financing to trump the principal exception has been deutsche bank of germany over the past two decades it was the only mainstream financial institution consistently willing to do business with mr trump who had a history of defaulting on loans the bank lent him a total of more than 2 billion about 350 million of which was outstanding when he was sworn in as president this is the same bank that was fined 630 million in 2017 by american and british banking regulators in connection with around 10 billion in suspicious trades being laundered out of russia it s not just banks that have failed to receive payments due from trump hundreds of small businesses individual contractors laborers and other ordinary americans have alleged that trump has not paid them numerous reports have documented these claims such as this usa today story hundreds allege donald trump doesn t pay his bills and this wall street journal article donald trump s business plan left a trail of unpaid bills then there is trump university which trump shut down after he settled two class action lawsuits and a civil lawsuit accusing him of cheating thousands of americans out of millions of dollars through what many called a sham unfortunately some of the 7 000 potential beneficiaries of the 25 million lawsuit settlement passed away before receiving any refund such as boyce chair of springfield n j who lost 34 995 on so called mentorship program tuition the bottom line is that just as trump bankrupted business after business and built his fortune by passing debt and losses from his failing enterprises on to others so too is trump today bankrupting the country and passing the debt and losses from his failing economic policies on to ordinary americans and to future generations steven piersanti is a senior editor at berrett koehler publishers a

alaska priorities in year end budget bills signed by president trump include support for critical programs and tax relief by mary kauffman december 28 2019 saturday pm sitnews president donald trump recently signed year end budget packages to fund the federal government for the upcoming fiscal year the alaska delegation had a significant role in crafting the final product which includes a number of funding programs and initiatives important to alaska full statement from president trump regarding fiscal year 2020 appropriations legislation in addition the bill packages include provisions that will help keep the cost of healthcare down by preventing burdensome taxes the affordable care act s aca cadillac tax will be permanently repealed this tax on high cost insurance plans would have hit alaska harder than anywhere else in the nation because healthcare is more expensive in rural low population states also permanently repealed are the excise tax on health insurance providers and the aca mandated tax on medical devices including pacemakers artificial joints defibrillators and other items this funding package is the culmination of months of hard work and thoughtful consideration by members a true bipartisan compromise we avoided a government shutdown and fund important initiatives and programs said u s senator lisa murkowski r ak alaska s delegation congressman don young senators lisa murkowski and dan sullivan photo courtesy office of don young in a prepared statement u s senator dan sullivan r ak said after voting on dec 19 to fund the federral government though the end of the fiscal year september 30 2020 while i continue to believe that the process by which we fund the government is fundamentally flawed and must be reformed these bills include significant wins for alaskans at long last we were able to repeal the affordable care act s so called cadillac tax this tax up to 40 percent on health insurance plans threatened the vast majority of plans offered in alaska including union plans and plans offered to state workers and had the potential to collapse the entire health insurance market in alaska had it been fully implemented we were also able to do away with the kiddie tax which among others things targeted young alaskans receiving their pfds and we were able to provide tax relief for those impacted by the 2018 southcentral earthquake i also fought hard to make sure this bill funded the secure rural schools program further we made continued progress on substantial alaska military investments including over 50 million of coast guard infrastructure investments to be ready to take new ships arriving in kodiak and southeast i ve continued to press for these investments as chair of the senate armed services subcommittee on readiness and also as chair of the senate commerce subcommittee on security i applaud senator murkowski for her diligent work on the senate appropriations committee and congressman young for securing these provisions in the house murkowski said the priorities in this bill will develop much needed infrastructure and create greater economic opportunities lower energy costs help communities facing coastal erosion and prioritize our national defense i m particularly proud of the provisions i secured that support alaska s fisheries promote america s growing role as an arctic nation and help to protect our people water and lands i m proud we continue to make progress towards a fleet of icebreakers by providing funding for long lead materials for a second heavy polar security cutter the permanent repeal of affordable care act health related taxes will give lasting relief ensuring alaskans don t see steeper insurance premiums alaska congressman don young r ak released the following statement following a house vote on two appropriations packages on december 17 2019 i am grateful to negotiators in both parties in the house and senate for agreeing on the appropriations packages passed out of the house today i am pleased to see that these final appropriations bills provide crucial funding for our military and repeal harmful taxes that drive up the cost of health care and hurt middle class families i am also proud to have helped secure a 2 year extension of the secure rural schools program that many alaskan communities rely on to fund schools and infrastructure the appropriations package also contained important wins for our rural hospitals and village clinics in addition to providing critical funding to help combat hunger and expand access to proper nutrition in our communities i have been a strong advocate for combating domestic violence and child abuse particularly in rural areas and i am pleased to see resources made available to combat violence against women and bring perpetrators of these heinous crimes to justice this was a well rounded bill that delivers many important results for alaskans and i look forward to president trump signing these packages into law the president signed dec 20 2019 note numbers are nationwide program funding levels numbers for alaska are noted agriculture rural development and food drug administration click here for a more comprehensive list of funding details in the funding bill signed by president trump senator murkowski secured a provision which requires any food produce entering the u s market containing genetically engineered salmon to be clearly labeled genetically engineered the legislation includes 5 million for a program previously created by senator murkowski the micro grants for food security program to help support alaskans ability to grow their own food the funding package works to ensure low income families women and children have greater food security by including 67 88 billion for the supplemental nutrition assistance program snap 6 billion for the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children wic and 526 3 million for the summer food service program sfsp the legislation includes a range of priorities to help address some of rural alaska s unique challenges including support for rural water and waste program loans to further develop rural areas to help offset the high costs of energy in remote communities and to help develop essential community infrastructure in rural alaska and native villages to help meet basic quality of life needs commerce justice science click here for a more comprehensive list of funding details senator murkowski also helped secure increased funding to 502 5 million for violence against women prevention and prosecution programs including support for research relating to the incidence of missing and murdered indigenous women and girls and violence against indian women in remote communities underserved by law enforcement resources language is included directing the department to improve coordination including data sharing training and technical assistance and other relevant resources to better address and prevent violent crime in indian country the bill also includes a five percent set aside from victims of crime act fund for tribes to address services for victims of domestic and sexual violence as well as 235 million for the community oriented policing services cops program an initiative to increase the number of police officers and ensure they are properly trained the bill provides 125 million for implementation of the stop school violence act legislation that senator murkowski cosponsored which helps ensure lifesaving resources are available to states and schools to stop violence before it happens senator murkowski pushed to establish federal funding and frameworks to build on america s strategic role in the arctic this bill includes 8 3 billion for the national science foundation nsf as well as language directing the nsf to consider the impact of the opening of the two transarctic sea routes and the proximity to deep water u s ports the bill includes support for oceanic and atmospheric research oar which includes 6 million to help us better understand the complex and rapidly changing arctic region building on previous efforts the bill also contains language to address hydrographic survey priorities in the arctic to help increase understanding of the growing impacts of ocean acidification on our ocean resources and coastal communities 12 million is provided in support of alaska s seafood industry senator murkowski helped secure 65 million for the pacific coastal salmon recovery fund which helps maintains pacific salmon populations and supports both the recovery and protection of all stocks an increase to 35 5 million is included for salmon management activities including implementing the pacific salmon treaty terms across the northwest states defense click here for a more comprehensive list of funding details the arctic is a rapidly evolving region but our vision remains focused on ensuring peace opportunity and collaboration with america recognized and serving as a strong leader in the region the greater understanding that we have of what s happening in the region including activities with military implications the better prepared we can be to protect and defend our nation s interests i m proud this bill supports that strategy said senator murkowski as we work to develop legislation that addresses the greatest needs of alaska and our military i thank senator sullivan for his leadership as member of the senate armed services committee and for the significant provisions he helped secure in this bill the passage of this year s ndaa the fifty ninth successive passage of this bill shows that members of congress can rise above partisan politics to perform their most important constitutional duty to provide for the common defense said senator sullivan this bill focuses our military on the 2018 national defense strategy s push to address great power competition with russia and china particularly in the arctic undoes a long standing discriminatory provision that targeted native businesses competing for large dod contracts and provides support for alaska s military priorities importantly it also gives our service

the year that is just coming to an end was the nearly year there was nearly a global recession there was nearly a full blown trade war between the us and china and britain nearly left the european union in the event none of things happened and 2019 will go down in history as one of those that are soon forgotten unless of course it proves to be like 1913 one of those when in retrospect at least it is possible to see the signs of a perfect storm brewing all the elements that might constitute an almighty downpour in 2020 were visible as the old year drew to an end with december witnessing four events that will help to shape the coming 12 months the first of these chronologically at least was the neutering of the world trade organization as a body that can settle disputes between its member states the wto s appellate body needs to have three judges in post in order to function but in early december found itself down to just one because the us has refused to sanction replacements when existing judges come to the end of their terms this may sound arcane but it is a body blow to the multilateral trading system the second event was the uk general election which resulted in a convincing victory for boris johnson s conservative party until 12 december the question of whether brexit would actually go ahead remained in doubt 2020 could be the year the economic chickens start coming home to roost that is no longer the case the uk will leave the eu on 31 january 2020 and the government says it is confident that it can conclude a trade deal with brussels before the end of the year that looks to be an extremely tight some would say impossibly ambitious timetable with bags of potential for problems at a time when neither the uk nor the eurozone economies looks especially healthy event number three was the lack of any significant progress at the cop25 climate change meeting in madrid a failure that was brought into sharp relief by the ongoing heatwave in australia which has seen temperatures hit record levels the final piece of big news as 2019 drew to a close was the strength of financial markets global bourses were boosted by the first signs of a de escalation in the trade dispute between the us and china and by the knowledge that the world s leading central banks have absolutely no intention of raising interest rates any time soon central bank governors such as mark carney at the bank of england and christine lagarde at the european central bank have been telling banks pension funds and insurance companies that they need to take account of the risks posed by climate change for now the markets are far more focused on when donald trump and xi jinping will sign a phase one trade agreement the benign view of 2020 goes as follows after a rocky patch in 2019 global growth is starting to pick up and will continue to be supported by loose monetary policy trump will kick off his re election campaign by announcing a trade deal with china and share prices will keep going up alternatively 2020 is the year when the chickens start coming home to roost financial markets work out that the trade war between washington and beijing is going to be long and bitter central banks prove to have limited ammunition when growth starts to disappoint negotiating a post brexit trade deal turns out to be much tougher than johnson expects evidence of the worsening climate emergency continues to mount the crisis at the wto becomes symbolic of a backlash against globalisation it would be folly to assume that all will turn out well next year the world could be heading for economic financial and environment crises rarely has it looked less well equipped to cope retailers need to think outside the boxing day sales whither the boxing day sales the era of 24 hour online shopping means the traditional 26 december spree is no longer the fierce scrum over discounted coats and boots it once was this year crowds were some 9 smaller than in 2018 according to retail analyst springboard a disappointing showing not helped by heavy rain soaking parts of the country but if retailers want to blame anyone for boxing day looking shop soiled they should look no further than themselves sales are not the gold dust they once were indeed some struggling fashion chains have been running promotions since the autumn the diehards were still queuing at dawn on thursday morning outside next of all places but that is because the chain s anti discounting stance makes its sale actually worth getting out of bed for for shoppers the imported us phenomenon of black friday which predominantly plays out online rather than in store is the latest thing this year the late november promotional blitz appears to have pulled forward spending that would traditionally have taken place in december leaving consumers with less money in hand now shops can open for long hours in the run up to christmas the frenzied buildup is hard for staff many of whom earn the minimum wage and the stress takes its toll on family life in a poll by trade union usdaw three quarters of shopworkers said they ended up spending too little time with their loved ones the old retail playbooks are dead so perhaps a new decade requires fresh thinking social media chatter suggests members of the public are sympathetic to stores remaining closed on boxing day for instance so maybe retail managers should listen and give their staff a well deserved day off rail passengers deserve better only the distractions of elections brexit and christmas allied with rock bottom expectations can have saved the rail industry from more ignominious headlines on at least four franchises northern transpennine south western west midlands punctuality has plummeted and disruption has become a daily norm rail leaders professed to have learned the lessons of 2018 s chaotic timetable change but similar failings have been apparent again in the west midlands since this may s timetable overhaul and across the north where new trains were supposed to underpin a new december timetable throw strikes on south western into the mix and passenger misery is all but complete awaiting only a further above inflation fare rise to take effect on thursday paralysis in whitehall which has been largely devoted to ameliorating the self inflicted pain of brexit is obviously not unique to transport but rail has had its own particular alibi for inaction the williams review inspiring a 15 month bout of navel gazing contemplating its own implosion even the most fervent advocates of privatisation now accept that the current franchise system isn t working the big question is whether what comes after franchises will be any better former ba boss keith williams has noted before the publication of his review the importance of accountability as mayors call for train operators to be penalised for shoddy service those firms though far from blameless can justly point to delayed infrastructure works and consequent problems with rolling stock and crew training not to mention franchise specifications that made strikes inevitable on the ground problems will not be solved by a remote restructuring but an overarching body running an integrated railway removed from ministers or lawyers will encourage straight talking about where the problems lie and how they can be best resolved before passengers lose faith entirely
as 2019 comes to a close american policymakers must face a harsh truth the last decade was an economic disaster if the 2020s are going to be any better our leaders will have to learn from their mistakes or simply be replaced for all the talk of recovery this decade began with the worst economic collapse since the great depression unemployment spiked to 10 percent and it took most of the last ten years for it to come back down as nice as a 3 5 percent unemployment rate is it s also something that almost never happens furthermore our current good times look a less good under the surface the government s definition of unemployment can leave out a lot of people this year the portion of people who got jobs each month who wouldn t even have been counted among the unemployed the month before reached 75 percent that s by far the highest it s been in the last three decades the percentage of working age americans who have jobs only returned to its pre great recession peak in the last few

from our morning news briefing to a weekly good news newsletter get the best of the week delivered directly to your inbox sign up beyond that job quality in terms of pay benefits hours security and more has also deteriorated employment may be widely available again but a lot of that employment is fundamentally worse than it was in decades past americans wages still aren t growing as fast as they were before the crash according to both the bureau of labor statistics and the atlanta fed in fact the atlanta fed finds that wage growth s peak in 2007 never got as high as its peak in 2000 a similar pattern to prime age employment in the 2010s productivity growth the rate at which the economy learns to create more value with less inputs also fell lower than it s been in decades though it may finally be picking up again finally if you look at economic output just before the great recession and draw a line continuing that growth at the same trend it turns out the 2010s didn t close the gap at all once the recovery from 2008 began the economy just started growing again at a permanently lower trend line trillions worth of annual economic activity jobs wealth creation living standards simply vanished this decade with no sign we will ever recover to a large extent all of these problems boil down to a failure to run the economy hot enough there was never enough spending out there to justify hiring everyone who wanted to work which meant businesses were never under pressure to raise wages to compete with each other for labor or to raise their productivity to stay ahead of rising labor costs how did this happen first off government spending public investment in things like infrastructure research and development education and more is an enormous source of demand for the economy same goes for the welfare state which supplies americans with hundreds of billions to collectively spend indeed a lot of welfare state spending is designed to automatically increase during recessions providing economic recoveries with extra juice at the very beginning of the 2010s government spending contributed to a big chunk of economic growth as the 2009 stimulus played out and social programs like unemployment benefits and food stamps kicked in but from late 2010 to 2015 the government cut back severely and for the most part fiscal policy became a net drag on the economy left without federal support state governments reduced their own spending which undercut the recovery even more from 2015 to 2017 the government ceased harming the economy and after 2017 federal spending became a significant positive contributor to growth again but by then the damage was done we can lay a lot of blame for this on the republican party which was mendaciously hell bent on austerity when democrats held the white house but happy to strike big spending deals once they were back in power but president obama was talking up the supposed debt crisis as early as 2011 his various economic officials are still pounding the austerity drums under trump democratic house speaker nancy pelosi is a fan of pay for rules which would effectively neuter the stimulative power of new spending and of course the democrats remain terrified of ambitious spending proposals from the likes of bernie sanders and elizabeth warren the other problem was monetary policy in its defense the federal reserve did cut interest rates to zero soon after the great recession in an effort to boost the economy more recently it s begun cutting rates again in recognition of the recovery s tepidness but in between the fed started hiking interest rates far too soon moreover the entire interaction between fed interest rate policy and congress fiscal policy was corrupted by a failure to realize the limits of what monetary policy can achieve on its own the thing that links most all of these mistakes was a wildly unjustified pessimism among experts and policymakers concerning how hot the economy could run potential gdp was repeatedly revised down and everyone assumed spending needed to be cut back and interest rates raised lest inflation take off during the 2016 election mainstream progressive economists openly mocked their heterodox peers for suggesting the economy was much further below full capacity than everyone thought at this point policymakers should take a stance of radical humility on these questions we should assume we are below full capacity and should keep stimulating until inflation has steadily risen by a few percentage points congressional fiscal policy should dramatically expand public investment and the automatic stabilizers of the welfare state and should deliberately aim to overheat the economy the fed can shave whatever s necessary off the top to keep us at full capacity without going over politicians in both parties should drop the deficit hysteria or at minimum the democrats should refuse to be trolled by the gop on the subject simply put u s policymakers from both parties completely blew it during the 2010s our government has enormously powerful tools at its disposal to drive economic growth and recoveries but due to a combination of bad theory foolish assumptions raw ideological blindness and outright mendacity those tools were never put to proper use the good news is the 2020s are an opportunity to do better

finally be picking up again finally if you look at economic output just before the great recession and draw a line continuing that growth at the same trend it turns out the 2010s didn t close the gap at all once the recovery from 2008 began the economy just started growing again at a permanently lower trend line trillions worth of annual economic activity jobs wealth creation living standards simply vanished this decade with no sign we will ever recover to a large extent all of these problems boil down to a failure to run the economy hot enough there was never enough spending out there to justify hiring everyone who wanted to work which meant businesses were never under pressure to raise wages to compete with each other for labor or to raise their productivity to stay ahead of rising labor costs how did this happen first off government spending public investment in things like infrastructure research and development education and more is an enormous source of demand for the economy same goes for the welfare state which supplies americans with hundreds of billions to collectively spend indeed a lot of welfare state spending is designed to automatically increase during recessions providing economic recoveries with extra juice at the very beginning of the 2010s government spending contributed to a big chunk of economic growth as the 2009 stimulus played out and social programs like unemployment benefits and food stamps kicked in but from late 2010 to 2015 the government cut back severely and for the most part fiscal policy became a net drag on the economy left without federal support state governments reduced their own spending which undercut the recovery even more from 2015 to 2017 the government ceased harming the economy and after 2017 federal spending became a significant positive contributor to growth again but by then the damage was done we can lay a lot of blame for this on the republican party which was mendaciously hell bent on austerity when democrats held the white house but happy to strike big spending deals once they were back in power but president obama was talking up the supposed debt crisis as early as 2011 his various economic officials are still pounding the austerity drums under trump democratic house speaker nancy pelosi is a fan of pay for rules which would effectively neuter the stimulative power of new spending and of course the democrats remain terrified of ambitious spending proposals from the likes of bernie sanders and elizabeth warren the other problem was monetary policy in its defense the federal reserve did cut interest rates to zero soon after the great recession in an effort to boost the economy more recently it s begun cutting rates again in recognition of the recovery s tepidness but in between the fed started hiking interest rates far too soon moreover the entire interaction between fed interest rate policy and congress fiscal policy was corrupted by a failure to realize the limits of what monetary policy can achieve on its own the thing that links most all of these mistakes was a wildly unjustified pessimism among experts and policymakers concerning how hot the economy could run potential gdp was repeatedly revised down and everyone assumed spending needed to be cut back and interest rates raised lest inflation take off during the 2016 election mainstream progressive economists openly mocked their heterodox peers for suggesting the economy was much further below full capacity than everyone thought at this point policymakers should take a stance of radical humility on these questions we should assume we are below full capacity and should keep stimulating until inflation has steadily risen by a few percentage points congressional fiscal policy should dramatically expand public investment and the automatic stabilizers of the welfare state and should deliberately aim to overheat the economy the fed can shave whatever s necessary off the top to keep us at full capacity without going over politicians in both parties should drop the deficit hysteria or at minimum the democrats should refuse to be trolled by the gop on the subject simply put u s policymakers from both parties completely blew it during the 2010s our government has enormously powerful tools at its disposal to drive economic growth and recoveries but due to a combination of bad theory foolish assumptions raw ideological blindness and outright mendacity those tools were never put to proper use the good news is the 2020s are an opportunity to do better

december 30 2019 12 05 am updated 12 05 am ist india s bold decision to stay out of the regional comprehensive economic partnership rcep until the needs of the country s small enterprises farmers and poorest citizens are properly addressed dismayed many economists the indian government s fear was that the resulting increase in chinese exports would harm small producers and farmers china and india the two most populous countries in the world both embarked on new journeys around the same time more than 70 years later china has progressed much faster india other the other hand is yet to reach the development indicators that china attained back in the early 1990s people centric policies a chinese thought leader said 15 years ago that both countries have the same vision of prosperity for their citizens to reach there they must cross a turbulent stream by feeling the stones underfoot but how do governments do that first they need to make their policies people centric rather than growth centric the communist party of china demands that local officials address the needs of citizens effectively as does singapore s government the chinese government derives its legitimacy from citizens satisfaction with their well being not from a vote in an election singapore minister tharman shanmugaratnam once said in the case of india its constitutional structure enables its states to adopt different models of development thus there is a kerala model a gujarat model and now a common man s model implemented by the aam aadmi party aap in delhi local participative governance has been a distinction of kerala s model and the state has been well ahead of the rest of the country matching china in its human development indicators in education health and women s inclusion delhi s aap government has adopted a people centric model of government it has established school management committees with parental involvement teacher training budgets have increased five fold the performance of delhi s government schools is not only higher than the national average it now exceeds the performance of private schools in delhi public health expenditures have more than doubled mohalla clinics have been set up in poor colonies to provide accessible and affordable health care the share of unauthorised colonies provided with piped water has increased from 55 to 93 in just five years reducing the need for poor people to pay for expensive tanker delivered water but despite water subsidies for the poor the delhi jal board s income has increased electricity supply has expanded to include 20 more consumers amongst indian metros delhi provides the cheapest electricity yet its distribution companies all in the private sector have improved their financial performance increase in disposable incomes the government has computed that its programmes for improving the ease of living of citizens by improving the quality and accessibility and reducing costs of a range of public services has increased savings per family by 4 000 per month the increase in disposable incomes has resulted in additional consumer buying power estimated at 24 000 crore per annum this proves that growth must be bottom up to be equitable and sustainable india has climbed many rungs on the world bank s ease of business rankings yet investments to expand production ventures have not increased much because consumer demand has slumped even for basic items like packaged biscuits it seems odd that democratically elected governments in many countries including india who should be focused on citizens well being have become so focused on making it easy for global capital to do business in their countries this has made citizens rise up against the globalisation paradigm promoted by an establishment of policymakers and economists citizens want their governments to put jobs in their countries first and to implement policies that increase incomes at the bottom of the pyramid rather than facilitating only further growth at the top india s complex socio economic environmental system is under even greater stress the country must improve on many fronts simultaneously india ranks very low in international comparisons of human development education and health even below its poorer subcontinental neighbours it is the most water stressed large economy in the world its cities are the most polluted india s economic growth is not generating enough jobs for its burgeoning population of youth the employment elasticity of india s growth numbers of jobs created with growth is amongst the worst in the world bold actions without an understanding of the whole system can cause great harm the bold move to demonetise the currency notes in 2016 was an egregious example unemployment of persons with vocational education has gone up between 2011 12 and 2017 18 from 18 5 to 33 india now has a larger number of frustrated youth more free trade not the answer the rcep decision shows that india is now standing up to pressure from a rump of washington consensus economists who continue to advocate that more free trade is the solution to india s economic problems even when there is evidence that india has not benefited from the agreements it has entered into india s challenge now is to build an indian ecosystem in which competitive enterprises will grow to create more opportunities for jobs for youth and for increasing citizens incomes growth of incomes in india will make india more attractive for investors a stronger industrial system will give india more headroom in trade negotiations too india s industrial and entrepreneurial ecosystem s growth must be accompanied by an improvement in environment policies must be managed with a whole systems view while ease of doing business gauges health from a business perspective ease of living should become the measure of the health of the whole system policy decisions invariably require compromises between competing interests here mahatma gandhi s talisman provides a good test the government should think of the needs of the poorest citizens first reduced duties on imports benefit citizens as consumers however a citizen s more fundamental need is for a good job and source of income to buy the imported goods india urgently requires an employment and income strategy to guide its industry and trade policies arun maira is a former member of planning commission
this article is more than 4 years old 2019 bloomberg finance lp when parties sit down to negotiate there is hope having advised countless negotiations over the years i have learned that great managers entrepreneurs and statesmen regard a no as an opening offer they work things out overcoming obstacles and even hatred to the benefit of both sides those who refuse to join the negotiation are usually the ones scared to be pushed over and those who leave prematurely leave countless options on the table sometimes the key ability of a great negotiator is to make the other party stay in this list you will find the 10 deals that have a crucial impact on 2020 some have been on the previous year s list there are successful negotiations failures and particularly deals that are still being negotiated in 2020 associated press the deal illusion civil war in yemen 2 0 after a four year civil war that has cost tens of thousands of lives and has brought yemen to the brink of a famine a deal has been signed between yemen s government and southern separatists in riyadh this is not a deal to end the war but just one that changes a three party to a two party civil war it will make it less complicated but not less bloody the negotiation was hosted by saudi arabia s crown prince mohammed bin salman and included yemeni president abdu rabbu mansour hadi the southern transitional council leader aidarous al zubaidi and the uae s crown prince mohammed bin zayed the houthi rebels backed by iran were not present there are three parties involved the yemenite government backed by saudi arabia the houthi rebels which are shia muslims backed by iran and the southern rebels backed by the united arab emirates this deal united the southern rebels with the government forces both sunni muslims a new cabinet is to be formed including the southerners and granting them more representation no deal was struck with the houthis who took over the country s capital sana in 2014 the joint forces will now focus their efforts against the houthis in the north saudi arabia s crown prince mohammed bin salman lauded the deal this agreement will open god willing broader talks between yemeni parties to reach a political solution and end the war us president donald trump commented on twitter a very good start please all work hard to get a final deal for now the fighting will merely go on among two instead of three parties but there is hope that the deal will have changed the power balance in a way to have the new allies negotiate with the houthis getty singapore on thames the exit of an empire finally light at the end of the tunnel or at least a lit tunnel regarding brexit after a landslide victory in the uk elections prime minister boris johnson can now get brexit done he won with 46 percent the largest conservative majority since margaret thatcher however the country is still divided as 52 percent of the votes went to parties opposing or rethinking brexit with prime minister johnson however revoking or postponing brexit is off the negotiation table the uk will leave the european unit by january 2020 however there is a one year transition period in which the uk will treated as a de facto eu member things are getting very interesting as there are in essence two possible negotiation outcomes if there is no agreement or an agreement to decouple the uk and the eu would trade on world trade organization rules this would lead to massive difficulties in transactions but the uk would be free to impose its own taxes and tariffs if there were a deal the uk would be a junior partner enjoying the liberties and securities of the eu but having to play by eu rules brussels will do everything it can to prevent a competitor at its doorstep the eu s chief negotiator michel barnier made it clear that if the uk started to deregulate it would face a proportional response from the eu he uses the classic technique of increasing his leverage with a higher authority namely the other member countries don t underestimate the difficulties of the process of ratification if it is not ratified we return to zero ursula von der leyen the president of the european commission made her goal very clear zero tariffs zero quotas zero dumping boris johnson is balancing his options turning the uk to a singapore on thames a lightly regulated tax haven or being a de facto eu member without the rights will the uk stay close to the eu or to other allies particularly the us all eyes are on johnson will he keep hardline brexiteers such as foreign minister dominic raab co author of britannia unchained or move toward eu alignment he must also be careful about scotland and northern ireland who strongly opposed brexit and could use this to fight for sovereignty negotiations between the eu and the uk are scheduled to start on february 1 2020 associated press talking while fighting the china usa trade war s ceasefire china and the us have reached what china s commerce ministry labels a consensus on principles the consensus seems to be no more than a ceasefire in a long trade war not the end of it the white house said that the two parties made progress in a variety of areas and are in the process of resolving outstanding issues according to the us government china has agreed to increase annual us imports to us 200 billion specifically promising to buy us 50 billion worth of us agricultural products what do both sides want the united states represented by us trade representative robert lighthizer and treasury secretary steven mnuchin wants to reduce the heavy 419 2bn trade deficit and wants china to stop subsidizing key industries and forcing foreign investors to transfer their technology china represented by vice premier liu he wants to keep the trade deficit as high as possible and has been rather reluctant to meet us demands trump used tariffs to exert power and china was badly hurt which was especially painful in a time when the country is facing its slowest economic growth in almost 30 years due to a shrinking manufacturing sector and an aging society as fan gang director of the beijing based think tank the national economic research institute points out this pre deal will lead to a very fragile peace the us the world s technology power is making the chinese buy goods that are typically exported by less developed countries given the different tensions both superpowers have all around the world it appears as if the two parties are moving away from each other with us companies closing facilities in china the upcoming negotiations will become very interesting particularly in the face of the upcoming us presidential elections associated press no breakthrough no failure saving the ukraine from a semi civil war with russia ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky and russian president vladimir putin have finally started negotiating about the future the ukraine which has been in constant turmoil since 2014 when russia annexed crimea it is the bloodiest conflict in europe since the balkan wars of 1991 2001 having resulted in almost 14 000 deaths the negotiations started in december 2019 and were hosted by emanuel macron and brokered by france and germany it was the first time putin and his ukrainian counterpart met face to face there is a ceasefire but both sides accuse each other of breaking the deal in october zelensky agreed to the steinmeier formula named after the former german foreign minister according to which the people of the donbass region can vote whether to be autonomous after heavy protests zelensky added that there would be no elections until the russians have left zelensky is under pressure in a country that is deeply divided between nationalist and pro russian sentiments russia on the other hand still suffers from eu sanctions that are in place as long as there is no deal with the ukraine the eu wants peace at its borders and an undisturbed flow of gas from russia to the ukraine in a 2009 dispute russian gazprom had cut off its gas supply via ukraine zelensky who against his will became a central figure in the impeachment inquiry against us president donald trump is a former comedian who has just resumed office in may 2019 the question is whether he can deal with a negotiator as tough and seasoned as putin however he stood his ground in the first round in a result that the russian broadsheet vedomosti summed up as no breakthrough no failure this is a negotiation to watch as it will decide the fate of a country 2019 bloomberg finance lp the sino british joint declaration britain s lose lose scenario in the hong kong question a negotiation that took place over 30 years ago is becoming crucial for today s hong kong which has been in turmoil since june when an extradition bill was introduced that could have hong kong criminal suspects sent to mainland china to face trial the bill has been withdrawn but heavy protests continue the sino british joint declaration of 1984 was the result of negotiations between chinese leader deng xiaoping and british prime minister margaret thatcher regulating the future of hong kong the uk which had occupied hong kong since 1840 agreed to hand it over to china on july 1 1997 the declaration states that china s policies regarding hong kong will remain unchanged for 50 years and that particularly hong kong s legal and judicial system would be untouched until 2047 the chinese regard the agreement as void as it only covered the period from 1984 to 1997 chinese diplomat lu kang stated unambiguously we would like to repeat again that since july 1 1997 the uk has had no rights whatsoever in relation to hong kong dominic raab british foreign secretary holds on to britain s position that the deal is a legally binding international treaty that remains in force today indeed the treaty explicitly mentions dates after 1997 raab points out as a co signatory of the joint declaration the uk takes these commitments seriously and supports their implementation through the one country two systems framework margaret thatcher pledged that britain would not accept any breach of the sino british joint declaration and pro democracy politicians just won 17 out of 18 districts in hong kong also us president trump just signed the hong kong human rights and democracy act of 2019 enraging china but the uk is not the us it just doesn t have the leverage with eu backing britain s position would have been stronger but now the uk is on its own ruining the relationship with china over an issue that could not lead to anything would be unwise particularly as the uk is in search of allies 2018 bloomberg finance lp breakfast at lvmh and other m a deals mergers and acquisitions can fail miserably but they can create value and make companies better and more profitable according to bcg s m a report m a transactions went rather well in the recent past there were fewer but larger transactions in 2019 with the average deal size rising from 380 1 million to 424 6 million in 2019 there was the 74 billion acquisition of celgene by pharmaceutical giant bristol myers squibb and a 57 billion transaction in mid 2019 when occidental petroleum corporation acquired anadarko petroleum corporation with backing by warren buffet s berkshire hathaway occidental outbid the much larger competitor chevron a good example of value creation

acquired tiffany for 16 2 billion or 135 a share in cash after tiffany had turned down lvmh s offer of 120 per share the transaction is to close in mid 2020 if regulators and tiffany s shareholders approve while lvmh s 16 2 billion acquisition of the us jeweler tiffany s is far from being the largest transaction of the year it is the largest deal in luxury history the luxury industry is a mirror

venezuela from civil war venezuela one of the oil richest nations in the world is broke another failed attempt of socialism that was launched by the late president hugo chávez with laws such as the law of land and agrarian development under which the government can take private lands if it believed they weren t being used to their maximum after chávez death in 2013 nicolás maduro became interim president and has remained in office since after an election in 2018 that was widely criticized as illegitimate the opposition swore in juan guaidó as a rival interim president who has since been recognized by most western states guaidó accuses maduro of not having met negotiating agreements from 2016 that asked for free elections and the opening of a humanitarian channel maduro on the other hand considers him a us puppet in early 2019 four latin american and eight european countries formed the contact group on venezuela to mediate the country s future calling for new elections a subsequent un security council resolution that called for free and fair presidential elections however was vetoed by china and russia the two sides finally began negotiations mediated by the norwegian centre for conflict resolution several rounds of negotiations in oslo failed according to guaidó the dictatorial regime of nicolas maduro abandoned the negotiation process with false excuses in the summer the united states tightened sanctions and thus manifested the west s support of opposition leader guaidó while maduro is still being supported by russia and china on april 30 guaidó led a coup to overthrow maduro but failed spectacularly since then his negotiation leverage is dwindling not only did he fail but his western supporters were alienated by his attempt of a military coup negotiation leverage shifted toward maduro dag nylander who heads international peace efforts at norway s foreign ministry made clear that norway is ready to mediate negotiations when the two parties are ready to return to the negotiation table a deal would be vital to save the country from a disastrous civil war associated press make or break it why greta couldn t save the deal the much anticipated united nations cop25 climate talks held in madrid from december 3 concluded after 13 long days but the deals reached amounted to almost nothing this is surprising in light of the attention this topic draws which is rather recent when i worked on climate change for the german delegation to the united nations in new york in 2009 it wasn t necessarily a hot topic excuse the pun now with teenage activist greta thunberg having reached superstardom and hundreds of thousands marching on the streets of madrid during the conference one would expect results the goal of the negotiations was to discuss the implementation of the paris agreement from 2015 in which 200 countries agreed to limit global warming to less than 2 degrees celsius among the key negotiation items was article 6 dealing with the global trading of carbon credits which can make or break the entire paris agreement one of the questions is whether countries can use carryover carbon credits from the kyoto protocol to meet their commitments for the paris agreement critics fear that these emission trading could allow targets to be met on paper but not in the atmosphere supporters regard article 6 as a way to make the entire world make deals on behalf of the climate on day one of the conference a negotiator commented that success on article 6 would be a miracle well miracles could happen but none happened at cop25 there was no deal the association of small island states aosis particularly blamed china india and brazil the only agreement to reduce emissions made during the conference wasn t even part of the cop25 talks but a pledge of eu leaders to eliminate their carbon footprints by 2050 with over 27 000 delegates from over 190 nations forming countless alliances this is as complex as a multi stakeholder negotiation can become many countries failed to take action with the us even moving out of the agreement much time was wasted on procedure arguing on how to label negotiations they are now called multilateral informal informals with co facilitators don t ask antónio guterres un secretary general was highly disappointed with the result and tweeted the international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation adaptation and finance to tackle the climate crisis but we must not give up and i will not give up hopefully cop26 in glasgow in 2020 will reach a better deal as it will be only weeks before the paris agreement s start date time pressure can work wonders for the dynamics of a negotiation associated press a new camp david deal negotiating with the taliban us president donald trump made a surprise visit to us troops on thanksgiving where he announced the continuation of the peace negotiations with the taliban the taliban wants to make a deal we ll see if they want to make a deal it s got to be a real deal but we ll see but they want to make a deal the taliban quickly replied that they were ready to restart the talks and indeed the talks between the taliban continued from where they ended the us wants the taliban to end violent attacks and a commitment not to shelter terrorists us secretary of state mike pompeo and his chief negotiator zalmay khalilzad would in turn offer the taliban the withdrawal of us troops last year after nine rounds of thorough negotiations in qatar between the us and the taliban a deal was almost finalized president trump invited the taliban leaders to camp david the iconic presidential retreat just a few days before the anniversary of the 9 11 attacks to dramatically finalize the deal with himself as the dealmaker however when a taliban claimed car bomb in kabul killed a us soldier and eleven others trump canceled the peace talks negotiations were on ice but not over us officials continued making small deals with the taliban such as prisoner swaps to keep communication channels open the taliban on the other hand kept rather quiet about trump which demonstrated their willingness to negotiate back at the negotiation table trump uses his old negotiation tactic of not showing much interest in the taliban s willingness to make a deal if they do they do and if they don t they don t that s fine however a political solution is the only way out for america from an 18 year long war america s longest war even outlasting vietnam or both world wars combined in fact world powers have a tradition of failing in afghanistan at the peak of their power the british as well the soviet empires both failed to conquer afghanistan and lost men money and morale the taliban of course are aware of the us public s tiredness of the war effort and they know that trump tends to withdraw us troops from foreign wars however a mere withdrawal of us troops would diminish us leverage and could lead to the taliban taking over the entire country the afghan elections just confirmed ashraf ghani as president but the taliban still refuse to speak with the afghan government viewing it as a us puppet yet ignoring ghani would be a great insult to the head of a state which is why trump met with him on his thanksgiving trip facing us presidential elections ending the modern era s vietnam war would be most favorable for candidate trump the new york times analyzed why closing this deal would be a matter of heart for trump the yearning ambition for the grand prize the endless quest to achieve what no other president has achieved the willingness to defy convention the volatile mood swings and the tribal infighting inshallah whatever the motivation this deal could finally end a long and bloody war associated press the syrian comeback how turkey and russia could end a war the syria peace talks are a textbook example of the effects of changing leverage in negotiations and an example of the real deal happening away from the spotlight the official geneva negotiations the fourth attempt under the auspices of un special envoy for syria geir pederson includes 150 official representatives 50 delegates loyal to the syrian government 50 members of the opposition largely supported by turkey and saudi arabia and 50 civilian representatives however the opposition block known as the syrian negotiation commission barely has any military leverage and is deeply divided yet still asks for assad to leave office and the introduction of a new constitution as the syrian government gained back control of almost the entire country the opposition co chair hadi al bahra opened the geneva talks humbly it is time for us to believe that victory in syria is achieving justice and peace not winning the war assad made clear how seriously he takes the negotiations by making clear that his own delegation has zero authority the syrian government is not part of these negotiations nor of these discussions the only force assad takes seriously is the syrian kurdish militias who still control the oil rich north east of the country but the kurds have been excluded from the talks due to a veto from turkey who regards them as part of the kurdistan workers party pkk the proponent of a socialist nationalist state in a request from foreign policy a us state department spokesperson confirmed support of the populations of northeast syria at geneva which could only mean the kurds however the us has given up much of its influence when it abandoned its former allies by withdrawing its troops the us doesn t want to ruin its relationships with turkey over kurdish independence un envoy pedersen asked all countries to leave the geneva negotiations as an exclusively syrian owned syrian led process it s too late the syrian crisis has become a struggle between the usa turkey russia and iran at least all relevant parties sit in the same room assad himself is not very interested in negotiations as time has made him stronger than ever the kurds are forced to work out a deal with assad but under his terms this will be the one negotiation that could end a civil war lasting eight and a half years having displaced almost half of the population and destroyed 65 of syrian infrastructure as the opposition co chair hadi al bahra rightly said without a genuine political transition assad s regime can t normalize its relations with states rejoin the arab league obtain relief from sanctions or reconstruction indeed turkey and russia could in fact work out how to solve the issue away from the 150 delegates
in 2019 democrats running for president announced a slate of multitrillion dollar proposals aimed at transforming the country and combating the economic and social ills they blame for giving rise to president trump but as the year comes to a close the mounting price tag of those plans has become a point of contention between the liberal and moderate wings of the party no one inside the beltway seems to ask how much the status quo costs sen bernie sanders i vt wrote thursday on twitter defending his proposals by citing estimates of deaths caused by air pollution and a lack of health care we have the resources and a moral obligation to pass medicare for all and a green new deal sanders s agenda would cost more than 50 trillion over 10 years more than the plans of any other democratic candidate like the others he would pay for his plans by raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy advertisement as democrats seek to appeal to a broad swath of voters candidatesare airing proposals that include government supported health care and child care free college student loan forgiveness transformative climate policies massive pay raises for teachers and a universal basic income among others a washington post review of the major spending proposals of the leading democratic presidential candidates found 10 year costs ranging from about 4 trillion to more than 50 trillion the annual federal budget now is about 4 5 trillion even the most sparse of the 2020 plans dwarfs what successful democrats pushed before as she seized the democratic nomination in 2016 hillary clinton proposed a 10 year agenda estimated at 1 45 trillion according to the committee for a responsible federal budget advertisement the rapidly rising price tags and expansive reach of the current plans has led to charges of socialism from republicans but in recent weeks more moderate democrats have been the most vocal critics of their liberal colleagues spending plans on issue after issue we ve got to break out of the washington mind set that measures the bigness of an idea by how many trillions of dollars it adds to the budget or the boldness of an idea by how many fellow americans it can antagonize south bend ind mayor pete buttigieg said during the democratic presidential debate this month in los angeles sen amy klobuchar d minn who has said her priority as president would be a 1 trillion infrastructure program has questioned the practicality of her competitors more expensive proposals where i disagree is i just don t think anyone has a monopoly on bold ideas she said during the debate i think you can be progressive and practical at the same time advertisement the post analysis focused only on the broad categories of health care housing the environment criminal justice education child care and other anti poverty initiatives using self reported estimates from the campaigns of the candidates leading nationally and in early states sanders buttigieg former vice president joe biden and sen elizabeth warren d mass the review found a shared desire to strengthen the social safety net enlarge the federal government and reduce inequality but each arrived at different ways of doing so with varying price tags sanders for example would increase minimum salaries for teachers to 60 000 and provide free breakfast and lunch to every public school student in the country as part of an agenda that tops 51 trillion over 10 years among a set of plans with a total 10 year cost exceeding 30 trillion warren proposes subsidizing child care for almost all americans and reducing rental costs nationwide by 10 percent biden s agenda a more moderate set of proposals costing more than 4 1 trillion over 10 years calls for tripling funding at low income schools and making community college free advertisement buttigieg who unveiled a 1 1 trillion 10 year economic plan in november now has spelled out more than 5 5 trillion in federal initiatives he has criticized warren and sanders for their free college programs that would provide a universal benefit regardless of income trump has seized on the democrats spending proposals and led the gop characterization of them as socialists he has warned that the true outcome of democrats plans would be higher taxes they say we re going to give away your health care we re going to do free education we re going to cut student loan debt down to nothing trump said in september during a speech to the house republican conference in baltimore everything is given away yet trump signed a 1 4 trillion spending bill this month that will add more red ink to the record 23 trillion national debt republicans signature legislative achievement under trump a massive 2017 tax cut whose benefits skewed toward corporations and the wealthy has helped pushed the annual federal deficit past 1 trillion advertisement but many republicans following trump s lead have largely abandoned the concerns about debt and deficits they expressed during former president barack obama s tenure democrats have likewise felt free to sidestep discussions about the 23 trillion national debt during their primary contest said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics the fetters around fiscal responsibility have been thrown off said zandi who has analyzed the spending plans of several democratic presidential candidates there s no real political constituency for fiscal discipline either on the republican or democratic side indeed several trailing democratic candidates have like klobuchar and biden been critical of the spending surge but have found voters largely shrugging off their concerns other lower polling candidates in the historically large primary also have built their candidacies around costly and ambitious initiatives advertisement entrepreneur andrew yang has backed a universal basic income of 12 000 per year for every american adult which he estimated would cost 2 4 trillion per year or 24 trillion over 10 years he has also proposed giving 100 in democracy dollars for every american voter to use to participate in the political system sen cory booker d n j has proposed baby bonds for every newborn several candidates have expressed openness to the idea of providing reparations to the descendants of enslaved americans for his part trump has boasted at rallies about spending trillions of dollars on the military and giving more than 28 billion in payouts to farmers affected by the trade war he sparked with china and other countries speaking to a conservative group in west palm beach fla on dec 21 trump praised his administration for securing more than 2 5 trillion in military spending dismissing the idea that the increased funding had added to the growing budget deficit advertisement let me tell you about budgets i m a big budget person but when it comes to the military there is no budget he said in his 2016 campaign trump differed from other republicans by brushing aside proposals to curb social security and medicare spending which members of his party had long argued were necessary to halt runaway deficits he has pledged to get serious about fiscal discipline and reducing the deficit if reelected but his campaign has not put forward a plan to cut spending democrats have said trump s 2016 election and the policies he s pursued while in office require bold countermeasures that will level the playing field for middle class americans they ve sought to outdo one another by targeting primary voters concerned about issues including systemic racism climate change and education advertisement an nbc news wall street journal poll released this month found that 56 percent of democratic primary voters prefer candidates who propose large scale policies that cost more compared with 38 percent who like candidates pitching less expensive policies that would bring less change but potentially be easier to pass into law with just a few weeks before primary voting begins some of the more moderate candidates are increasingly hopeful voters will be repelled by the rising price tags of the most ambitious proposals biden who is leading the national race in most polls and leads with voters who prefer smaller scale change has repeatedly challenged his rivals to explain how they would pay for their spending programs warren has been the most detailed in outlining the costs of her various plans and how she would pay for them with a 2 percent wealth tax on fortunes exceeding 50 million and other tax hikes on the wealthy warren has said she would be able to fund a broad expansion of the federal government s social contract without raising taxes on middle class americans warren advanced in the polls earlier this year as she released dozens of plans offering vast benefits to most americans by redistributing wealth that has become increasingly concentrated among the rich calculators on her campaign website allow americans to find out how much money they would save through her plan canceling student loan debt and how much extra cash they would receive from her proposal to provide an extra 200 monthly for everyone receiving social security her momentum appeared to stall after she was pressured to release her own plan for universal health care warren s 20 5 trillion proposal her most expensive plan yet would be funded through an array of taxes on the wealthy and corporations both sanders and warren who continue to face bipartisan questions about the costs and feasibility of their health care plans have said most americans would pay less for health care under a government run system that eliminates premiums deductibles and the private insurance companies that collect them but over the course of the year several democratic candidates backed away from medicare for all citing its requisite tax increases and its upending of the private insurance industry i believe this hits the middle class too hard sen kamala d harris d calif wrote in july about sanders s proposal to pay for his medicare for all plan with a 4 percent income tax on most families harris who had proposed an ambitious agenda estimated at more than 12 3 trillion dropped out of the primary this month in addition to his medicare for all proposal eliminating out of pocket health care costs sanders has also pledged to have the government wipe out all 1 6 trillion in outstanding student loan debt his proposal announced in june went even further than warren s pledge to eliminate debt for 95 percent of the people who have student loans sanders has pledged to pay for his agenda by reversing trump s tax cuts and imposing a wealth tax and a series of tax hikes on the finance industry and more he has acknowledged that his health care plan would raise taxes on middle class americans but he insists that would be offset by the trimmed costs candidates have also touted 13 figure price tags as they ve competed to show their visions for combating climate change warren s 3 trillion plans include a tenfold increase in federal spending on clean energy research and development she also proposed a 10 7 trillion green jobs plan to invest in environmentally friendly industries buttigieg s 1 5 trillion plan creates a national extreme weather insurance program biden s 1 7 trillion plan aims to achieve net zero emissions of carbon pollution by 2050 sanders has boasted that his plan the most expensive at 16 3 trillion would declare climate change a national emergency eliminate fracking and ban all imports and exports of fossil fuels several candidates have pushed ahead with expensive plans by arguing that the cost of not acting far exceeds the price tag for their proposals my opponents and critics say bernie you re proposing to spend a lot of money on climate sanders said recently at a rally in los angeles and i say what is the alternative others have followed the example of trump who was able to win in 2016 by making broad promises that connected with voters while disregarding political structures of washington policymaking such as detailing how he would pay for it said michael strain an economist at the right leaning american enterprise institute these policies are so large and so different from what we ve seen that it s hard to come up with a good estimate of how much they would cost and how disruptive they would be strain said of the democratic proposals that creates political space for the candidates to argue the best case scenario
the arkansas democrat gazette ran down the details today on the beginning in 2020 of gov asa hutchinson s whopping 14 percent state income tax cut for the rich over two years but it lacked a worthwhile sidebar on the major beneficiaries the top marginal income tax rate for those making more than 80 000 will drop from 6 9 percent to 6 6 percent in 2020 percent and then to 5 9 percent in 2021 hutchinson hopes for still more if he can continue to beggar schools and colleges privatize prisons trim medicaid rolls and otherwise slash state services the state might be able to afford it advertisement the almost 5 percent cut in overall income tax in 2020 and another 9 percent cut in 2021 are estimated by state officials to reduce state revenue by 97 million a year though other analysts say the loss is more likely to be about 150 million a year when updated income figures are used not a 2016 revenue base seventy percent of the savings i said 70 percent will go to the top 1 percent of taxpayers those making more than 456 000 i said 456 000 a year ninety percent i said 90 percent will go to those making more than 250 000 a year the dream that this will spur economic development efforts is a pipe dream the rich will as ever put their money where it gets the best return be it the caymans or california as they always have you didn t see them investing in the little rock tech park did you tax money paid for that supposed development engine in that many of them are heirs to great wealth many will just pile up still more and maybe buy some fine houses and cars advertisement hutchinson will tell you that po folks got benefits in two earlier rounds of tax cuts true after a fashion about 1 million got tax cuts averaging pennies but the tax cut for the rich beginning in 2020 for 1 percent of taxpayers exceeds cumulatively the entire dollar benefits of the two earlier tax cuts when discussing the coming windfall and the governor s announced intention to go even lower with an ideal top rate of 4 percent a 33 percent cut in the tax bill after 2021 at a cost of hundreds of millions in lost revenue a year it s well to remember the analysis by the arkansas advocates for children and families of the tax cutting and the impact on state services advertisement overall arkansans making more than 94 000 would receive 98 percent of the benefits of this tax cut leaving the other 4 in 5 arkansans with essentially no tax relief at all to put that in perspective the size of the average tax cut for an arkansan in the middle 20 percent of taxpayers those making between 36 000 and 56 000 would be 6 the top 1 percent would receive an average tax cut of 7 964 more insult to injuries to the poor as the d g article noted this windfall tax cut legislation for the wealthy included some small marginal tax increases down at the bottom end of the income scale thought state officials claimed other changes would offset those increases the 2019 legislature also put a new tax on gasoline put a punitive tax on owners of electric powered cars increased sales taxes by making sure they would be applied to internet sales and asked voters to permanently raise fuel taxes in future years to pay for road construction it also extended several corporate tax breaks advertisement all this advocates said will make us more competitive with places like texas which asa and them love to note has no state income tax no it doesn t but texas has enormous severance tax riches much higher property taxes a franchise tax that s equivalent to an income tax for many businesses and a clawback provision when land taxed at low agricultural tax rates think deltic timberland in western little rock is converted into pricey real estate developments don t hold your breath for such law changes in arkansas where the legislature is currently raising an enormous howl because assessors are attempting to apply the constitutional requirement for equal taxation by assessing chicken houses at their value rather than a brother in law rate
one of the impediments to the adoption of blockchain and crypto technologies in the world are the regulations governing their introduction into the world of business the constantly changing nature of the legal framework and the fear of being caught up in legal disputes with regulatory authorities especially the tax ones is forcing most small and medium sized businesses across the globe to work with blockchain from the shadows nonetheless many experts believe the year 2019 has seen a significant improvement in many countries in regard to blockchain regulation with the attitude toward digital money shifting dramatically in recent years this observation is shared by alina kiselevich a communication specialist at enigma securities a crypto market broker dealer who told cointelegraph that some countries now consider them legal tender while many viewing cryptocurrencies as commodities governments around the world are keenly aware of the problem that the technology is rapidly outpacing the laws that govern it china blockchain adoption is being accelerated but crypto can be only referred to as a national cryptocurrency when it comes to crypto regulation the relationship with blockchain in china could compete with a shakespearean romance on one hand the chinese central authorities are introducing blockchain technology in some of their mainstay powerhouses such as the agricultural bank of china and other financial institutions for tracking transactions and introducing transparency however on the other hand they are still cracking down on cases in which the technology is used among the population china s leading social media platform weibo recently banned leading chinese crypto platforms binance and tron due to a violation of its rules in november shanghai regulators ordered a search of all local crypto exchanges and formed reports on their findings to the people s bank of china for further action regardless of the bans the standing committee of the 13th national people s congress in china ruled that a new law on the regulation of cryptographic technology will come into effect on jan 1 2020 the law aims to set a regulatory framework for blockchain applications in light of president xi jinping s calls for accelerating the adoption of blockchain technology in the country according to steve tsou global ceo of rrmine a distributed bitcoin hashrate asset management and trading platform 2019 has been a year of laying down the regulatory foundations for chinese crypto he told cointelegraph various regions have passed a series of policies to support blockchain companies and set up innovative pilot areas among them the core directions are ai tech based on computing power and blockchain iot networks and offshore digital financial innovation speaking about the future development of crypto regulation in china tsou added that with clearer supportive attitude and more restrictive supervision there can be a process of trial which has at least found an exit and clear direction for the entire crypto world similar expectations were shared with cointelegraph by sukhi jutla the co founder of marketorders a blockchain based platform for the gold and diamond jewelry industry with over 1 billion population in china this looks like the perfect testing ground to see mass adoption taking place china is already the leader when it comes to mobile payments and creating their own dedicated cryptocurrency was the natural next step china is the home to thousands of blockchain startups so i wouldn t be surprised to see china leading the way and making even more gingiva advancements in 2020 france crypto to crypto trades are not taxable the land of high arts and couture has been on the sidelines of blockchain integration until françois villeroy de galhau the governor of the bank of france announced that the institution is ready to launch a pilot project for a central bank digital currency or cbdc in the first quarter of 2020 the new instrument will be based on a digital euro format and will be available only to financial institutions excluding retail customers the move has already been regarded as a counteract to the threat posed by facebook s libra stablecoin considering that france is aiming to become the first country to issue a cbdc with blockchain based settlements and is currently the biggest adopter of bitcoin payments with over 25 000 sales points accepting it across the country in another even more crypto friendly move french minister of economy bruno le maire stated on sept 12 that crypto to crypto trades will no longer be subject to tax however sales of cryptocurrencies for fiat will still be taxable with the nation s treasury germany banks are allowed to work with cryptocurrencies rational and calculative as ever the german government has been biding its time in releasing any manner of clarification regarding its stance on blockchain technologies at present the german financial industry one of the main engines of europe s largest economy is prohibited from having any dealings with cryptocurrencies however the german government passed a bill in november that allows banks to sell bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as well as grant custody over them by the end of 2020 though the law is still at the draft stage it has been met with significant enthusiasm from local businesses as it would allow banks to streamline crypto operations and give them the authority to safeguard user assets on the basis of their experience and established risk mechanisms the united states of america digital assets are regulated just like fiat money the u s is seen as a trendsetter in terms of blockchain and cryptocurrency adoption and most other countries in the world act in hindsight to the economic giant across the atlantic though still fragmented on regulation at the state level the u s is coming to terms with the need to adopt new technology as individual state authorities pass crypto friendly laws the state of wyoming passed a bill in 2019 that came into effect on march 1 the law divided digital assets into three categories digital consumer assets digital securities and virtual currencies all assets from the category of virtual currencies will be equated with fiat currencies and subject to the same tax and supervision procedures the law also allows banks to provide custodial services for digital assets making the ownership of cryptocurrencies both legal and equal in status to fiat currencies iran crypto mining is legal but needs a license introducing new technology in a land so harshly pressured by western sanctions is a tricky deal notably iran is becoming one of the main hubs for cryptocurrency and blockchain adoption spurred on by its long standing sanctions both the iranian government and citizens are increasingly turning to decentralized technology for circumventing the economic blockade in what can be described as a bold move the iranian government passed a law in july 2019 that endorsed the mining of cryptocurrencies equating it to industrial activity the ministry of industry mine and trade has already started issuing licenses for the activity and demand is surging the activity will be subject to taxation like in any other industry and miners who create their own mining farms will get support from the government to encourage the trend the iranian government is offering subsidized electricity rates at half a cent per kilowatt for mining activities a trend that has started attracting mining companies from china and even the u s to iran however despite the seemingly libertarian approach and progressive attitude toward blockchain technology cryptocurrencies are banned as a means of settlement in iran honorable mentions as the leading countries stances on the crypto market have changed in 2019 other regions also have a part to play in impacting cryptocurrency and blockchain adoption among them is the united kingdom according to galyna danilenko from smartlands a u k based digital securities issuance and investment platform uk has made a significant breakthrough in 2019 with the legal paper issued in november digital assets were recognized as property jessica renden head of operations at cryptocurrency exchange cointree referred to japan and new zealand as the main countries that are setting trends in the crypto regulation market in 2019 she explained her view to cointelegraph the new zealand tax authorities have confirmed that bitcoin and several other coins are approved as salary payment alternatives subject to employment contracts set out by employers earlier this year the japanese government passed a bill to incorporate cryptocurrency into regulation and to date have 21 approved registered crypto exchanges russia is another country that made the most promising breakthrough in cryptocurrency regulation according to evan luthra a forbes top 30 under 30 tech entrepreneur and blockchain expert holding an honorary ph d in decentralized and distributed systems he told cointelegraph that although legislation on cryptocurrencies has not been formed yet in russia a lot has changed throughout the year the authorities changed their initial radically negative position and are now interested in developing new technologies for the benefit of the state financial system welfare and convenience of citizens the main achievement i guess was the russian federal law on digital rights release according to marketorders jutla the united arab emirates is one of the leaders in crypto regulation when it comes to the middle east he said this year the securities and commodities authority sca in the united arab emirates drafted a resolution on regulating crypto assets providing greater clarity for crypto related projects in the middle east nation by drafting this resolution the uae is sending a positive sign to the world this can be seen as a signal that they are open to exploring this area and by creating guidelines they are giving more reassurance confidence and stability to businesses owners who may want to enter this field cryptocurrency regulation trend moves on experts predict that in the next couple of years more countries will make significant changes in their crypto regulation in regard to this renden told cointelegraph that the first country backed digital currency should arrive in the next one to two years potentially from china she added this will open the floodgates as regulators become more comfortable and organizations around the globe realize the benefits digital currencies provide such as low transaction fees and instant payments within five years we expect all first world countries to have released or to be working on their own digital currency if they aren t already while sharing an opinion on this matter to cointelegraph kiselevich said that he sees numerous countries around the world making big steps toward launching and implementing both crypto and blockchain technologies adding that it looks like a trend that might be followed by a lot of countries later
this article was produced through a partnership between propublica and the connecticut mirror which is a member of the propublica local reporting network it was originally published in ct mirror on november 25 2019 hartford the moon pulls 6 year old romeo lugo to the window at night the autistic child loves to gaze up at it howling like a werewolf as it rises like a luminous pearl over the horizon of city buildings and trees he sees from his second floor apartment but on one particular evening four years ago his mother aida noticed something else as they stood at the window a man getting out of a gray car in front of their building and walking toward the nearby barber shop gun drawn she grabbed romeo and ducked bam bam bam aida lugo recalls hearing seconds later i couldn t move after the incident the single mother explored moving from frog hollow one of the state s poorest and toughest areas she even visited nearby towns but the only units in her price range were located no more than a few blocks from the gunshots and the drug dealers in her neighborhood so she remains marooned there in the same apartment that s because state officials have chosen year after year to direct the bulk of public funding for affordable housing to connecticut s most impoverished communities since the mid 1980s almost 2 2 billion in low income housing tax credits have been awarded to construct 27 000 affordable housing units in the state just 10 were built in prosperous towns an investigation by the connecticut mirror and propublica has found about 80 were located in struggling communities literally erecting pockets of poverty the rest fall somewhere in between an abandoned storefront in lugo s neighborhood with bullet holes in the windows credit monica jorge propublica an abandoned storefront in lugo s neighborhood with bullet holes in the windows credit monica jorge propublica while many state leaders across the country direct those credits to poor areas arguing that s where the need is greatest connecticut stands out on the national stage in a recent federal study of 21 states it had the second highest concentration of affordable housing in high poverty neighborhoods behind only mississippi today lugo s unit is one of more than 700 apartments funded through the tax credit program within a six block area of her home the neighborhood is host to a homeless shelter a juvenile jail public housing and a profusion of unoccupied storefronts and apartments plastered with for rent signs on several utility poles are devices that notify police when gunshots are fired surveillance cameras abound you know you don t have any other option but to try and get used to it and the things around you lugo said i just keep to myself with my kids and we do what we have to do most of the funding to build affordable housing in the u s comes from the federal government with states receiving a set amount of low income housing tax credits or lihtc each year based on their populations state officials then decide how and where they are used connecticut s extreme concentration of affordable housing in poor areas owes largely to its selection process the state requires developers to obtain local zoning approval before they even apply for a tax credit a practice that has been flagged by federal regulators as potentially discriminatory in may the connecticut mirror and propublica reported that many zoning boards in the state rely on their finely tuned regulations to keep housing segregation firmly in place the news organizations found that more than three dozen towns have blocked construction of any privately developed duplexes and apartments within their borders for the last two decades we have an affordable housing crisis and a segregated housing crisis the state has opted to only address the affordable housing crisis erin boggs open communities alliance developers in turn look to cities where local leaders are often more receptive to any development that could help replace blighted properties or vacant lots in connecticut that has meant a deepening racial divide in a state that s home to some of the most segregated neighborhoods in america according to the connecticut economic resource center at least half of the homes in lugo s neighborhood are reserved exclusively for the poor nearly all of the residents of the area are hispanic like lugo or black u s census bureau data shows we have an affordable housing crisis and a segregated housing crisis the state has opted to only address the affordable housing crisis said erin boggs executive director and civil rights attorney with open communities alliance a nonprofit that advocates for housing reforms gov ned lamont s administration says it favors a balanced approach encouraging affordable housing both in high opportunity communities with good schools and low crime rates and in more impoverished neighborhoods connecticut recognizes the value of increased opportunity and growth in all of our communities the governor s office said in a statement the numbers however tell a different story the connecticut mirror and propublica compared the location of lihtc funded units with so called opportunity maps developed for the connecticut department of housing by researchers at ohio state university of the nearly 100 million in tax credits awarded by the state this spring 88 of the new apartments will be in low opportunity areas that means high crime low homeownership rates little access to working class jobs and lackluster school performance connecticut s democratic senators say they are troubled that so many of the tax credits are going to high poverty areas the tax credit program they say is long overdue for a reevaluation it s concerning and i want to know why said sen richard blumenthal in response to the connecticut mirror and propublica s analysis i think we have to examine the reasons for it whether they are economic or discriminatory and determine whether there are remedies necessary and appropropriate sen chris murphy added i think we should be spreading out low income housing tax credit dollars to projects throughout the state you ve got to give people choice folks that have lower incomes or need rental support shouldn t only have a handful of neighborhoods in connecticut s cities as their only housing options meanwhile developers say they are just building what the state is most likely to fund at the same time they are conflicted about constructing housing reserved for the poor mainly in poor communities to be honest this system discriminates against poor people you are forcing these people to live in communities that don t have the level of resources needed to educate their kids said john mcclutchy founder of jhm group which is one of the largest recipients of tax credits in connecticut we are looking to build housing that better reflects the community it shouldn t just be warehousing poor people housing segregation by formula created by congress as part of a massive tax overhaul during the reagan administration the low income housing tax credit was designed to lift the poor amid surging home prices by many measures it was a success since 1987 the tax credit has funded the construction and rehabilitation of more than 3 million apartments for the poor 30 of the country s affordable housing units conservatives and liberals alike lauded the program but over time housing advocates and civil rights groups say officials in some states funneled a disproportionate amount of credits to poorer communities in 2008 a community group in texas pressed that case against the state s housing department arguing in a lawsuit that the agency had violated the fair housing act by concentrating low income housing tax credits in the dallas metro area the u s supreme court agreed ruling that there are limits to building subsidized housing in mostly impoverished neighborhoods because the practice has a disparate impact on minorities to be honest this system discriminates against poor people developer john mcclutchy questioning how and where credits are awarded may prevent segregated housing patterns that might otherwise result from covert and illicit stereotyping wrote justice anthony kennedy in the majority opinion in 2015 meanwhile the irs which oversees the lihtc program cautioned states in the waning days of the obama administration against requiring local approval for affordable housing projects giving what is essentially a local veto to municipal leaders the agency found is perpetuating residential racial and economic segregation some states made sweeping changes in maryland for instance housing officials settled a long running dispute with a community group in baltimore agreeing to stop requiring local approval and promising to open 1 500 lihtc funded apartments in prosperous neighborhoods gov ned lamont takes questions after making his first appearance before affordable housing advocates in september credit monica jorge but in connecticut efforts to overhaul the system stalled state rep jason rojas a democrat from east hartford and the house chair of the legislature s powerful tax writing committee proposed legislation in 2015 and 2016 that would have reserved at least 60 of the tax credits for developments in wealthier areas despite support from the state s latino and african american commissions and numerous other civil rights organizations rojas faced stiff opposition from his own party leaders argued that such a monumental change would do nothing to solve the problem of local opposition as a compromise the connecticut housing finance authority the agency that administers the tax credit program tweaked its grading system for lihtc projects the housing finance authority is separate from the department of housing evaluated on a point scale developments in areas of opportunity or ostensibly better off communities would now receive additional points in the annual selection process the lamont administration has endorsed that approach seila mosquera bruno the state housing commissioner and chair of the housing finance authority board that awards the credits says the extra points are precious when applying i think that the points that are there for building into these high opportunity areas are allowing to do a little more she said the new formula however has not produced much change developers must still win local zoning approval before seeking the tax credits a lot of developers aren t willing to take on that fight said mcclutchy whose developments are primarily located in high poverty communities the roadblocks that the suburban communities put up cost time and money i do not think there is an incentive to take that on applicants can still win points by proposing to preserve and expand rundown affordable housing or develop polluted land likewise they are rewarded for proximity to daily public transportation all are prominent features of urban areas even the newer opportunity points are misleading affordable housing advocates say for example a project can win points if it s located within 10 miles of a community college an incentive intended to place people closer to educational opportunities in fact such schools are generally located in struggling communities a for sale sign in front of neglected property in lugo s neighborhood credit monica jorge projects in districts with good schools can also win extra points but the housing agency s list of such districts includes several that the state department of education has labeled as low performing the result of the 20 projects awarded federal tax credits in the past three years just one is in a high opportunity community as defined by the ohio state researchers located in the small shore town of east lyme the project of 56 affordable housing units broke ground recently after six years of local opposition that pattern seems unlikely to change anytime soon of next year s tax credit applicants a single development is located in a high opportunity neighborhood we are still warehousing low income people who are largely women of color with children and putting them into neighborhoods where people with the ability to choose where to live do not choose to live said cori mackey the executive director of the center for leadership and justice a grassroots organization that has raised attention to the subpar living conditions in hartford the question is why does everybody but those who are poor have a choice about where to live we lack the political will to do anything the consequences of racial and economic isolation are stark research shows people living just a few blocks from each other often have drastically different life outcomes for example the life expectancy of those who grow up in lugo s neighborhood is 12 years shorter than those living just 1 5 miles down the road in the middle class town of west hartford according to national center for health statistics data compiled and released by the robert wood johnson foundation we are still warehousing low income people who are largely women of color with children cori mackey center for leadership and justice separately a team from harvard brown and the u s census bureau found that children in frog hollow were four times more likely to be imprisoned on april 1 2010 than those over the west hartford line nearly every student in romeo lugo s elementary school is a minority and multiple grades behind in math and reading rojas the democratic lawmaker grew up in a similar neighborhood becoming friends with middle class kids in his middle school was life changing he said because it helped him think about his future differently and inspired him to go to college i wouldn t say success can t come from places where there is a lack of social capital or where there is significant racial and economic isolation but we also know how much harder it can be when you live in a community like that rojas said some of his democratic colleagues agree arguing that the administration should diversify the locations of lihtc developments if you only build more of it in the cities then you are never really addressing the problem of diversity and integration said state senate president pro tem martin looney d new haven there has to be a push to increase affordable housing in the suburbs brandon mcgee and other lawmakers led a panel at the annual affordable housing conference this fall credit monica jorge those sentiments however are rare in the state legislature where democrats have held power for more than two decades state rep brandon mcgee a co chairman of the legislature s housing committee grew up in public housing and prefers the bulk of funding to go to places like his district in hartford where a tax credit project broke ground this year our people are living in some of the worst conditions i have ever seen in my life he said i do not subscribe to the mindset that you need to move out of hartford to have a better life when you are talking about concentration of poverty well address poverty you can t run from it for their part gop legislators are typically resistant to moves that could undermine local control and make it easier to build affordable housing in their districts former state rep brenda kupchick a republican from fairfield who served as the ranking member of the legislature s housing committee from 2013 to 2018 said she would not want to reroute the tax credit funding to build housing in well off communities like hers i wouldn t want to take money from urban neighborhoods that is helping them she said recently elected to fairfield s top post of first selectmen she said the town has little land suitable to build and support affordable housing as a result both parties are united in maintaining the status quo we lack the political will to do anything rojas said rep jason rojas d east hartford co chair of the finance committee credit monica jorge efforts to link unrelated state funding to a town s openness to affordable housing have gone nowhere and in fact lawmakers have successfully pressed in recent years to weaken one of the few laws that encourages affordable housing a measure that allows developers to bypass local zoning decisions by going through the courts if they set aside 30 of a project s units for poor people in 2017 the legislature passed a bill to make it easier for towns to win state sanctioned waivers from the law support was so strong that lawmakers garnered enough votes to override a veto from then gov dannel malloy lamont the state s current chief executive is a democrat and a multimillionaire who owns a mansion in the wealthy town of greenwich and multiple other properties in affluent communities he has defended local control and avoided the politically thorny issue of exclusionary zoning declining numerous requests over the last 10 months to be interviewed lamont previously told the connecticut mirror his goal is to work collaboratively with the locals in terms of what they want and what they are not willing to take at the end of the day that community will probably take the lead on making that choice while some federal lawmakers are calling for a reassessment of the lihtc program and stricter enforcement of anti discrimination laws executive action in washington seems unlikely the trump administration has proposed weakening the federal disparate impact rule the legal doctrine at the heart of the landmark supreme court case the change would effectively limit the ability of civil rights groups and others to challenge how states run their tax credit programs there are a myriad of considerations that go into where housing should be placed j paul compton jr general counsel for the u s department of housing and urban development told reporters this year it is not the department s role to broadly dictate to the thousands of communities across america local decisions that are made in good faith unintended consequences concentrated poverty six years ago aaron gill was looking for a place for his family the engineer wanted to live close to downtown hartford on its face nearby frog hollow seemed perfect it was within walking distance of the train station as well as the restaurants and theaters around the state capitol and several apartments were open there was just one problem the only options available had income restrictions on them gill said if connecticut s distribution of tax credits has kept poor people in poor neighborhoods it has also kept middle class and wealthy people out and housing advocates say that lack of economic diversity can deprive struggling communities of sorely needed investment aaron gill on the sidewalk outside the building he purchased and renovated with his wife on the edge of the historic frog hollow neighborhood in hartford credit ryan caron king connecticut public radio nearly all of the renovated homes and apartments in frog hollow for instance are reserved for low income residents that creates a barrier for thousands of potential residents working in the immediate area among the nearby employers are trinity college two hospitals and a host of state government agencies the unintended consequences of some of these policies has been to reinforce the pattern of concentrated poverty said melvyn colón executive director of southside institutions neighborhood alliance a nonprofit that builds affordable housing in hartford each year he too has to turn away a handful of interested buyers because they make too much money his group receives state funding and officials require the homes be sold to those who make below average income the only housing stock left for others are aging properties in gill s case he and his wife ultimately purchased a rundown apartment building and renovated it to make the finances work they rented out the extra units and leased the ground floor where entrepreneurs have opened a cafe and ice cream shop gill acknowledges that he is the exception few have the money or desire to become a developer just to live in the area this was a personal interest for our family instead of spending money on cars or clothes we put all our money into this property said gill who is now a commissioner on the city s planning and zoning board nothing in the federal requirements for tax credits requires housing developments to be exclusively reserved for the poor in fact the rules allow as few as 20 of the units to be marked affordable but developers say demand among middle class and upper income renters is weak in these struggling neighborhoods so that pushes them toward higher concentrations of subsidized units the willow creek development in hartford of the 135 new apartments 92 are reserved for poor residents credit monica jorge it is a lot easier to build a 100 affordable project than it is to build a mixed income project said dara kovel a former state housing official who oversaw the tax credits and is now a developer connecticut s point system also rewards projects that devote a large share of units to the poor for example the state recently demolished a rundown and mostly abandoned public housing complex in hartford s blue hills neighborhood about three miles from frog hollow officials awarded development firm jhm group 35 million in federal tax credits and 18 million in state funding to build in its place willow creek a series of smaller apartment buildings of the 135 new apartments 92 are reserved for poor residents mcclutchy the firm s founder says he would have preferred more income diversity but added it s a competitive process and you want to win so you adapt u s rep jim himes a democrat who represents southwest connecticut worked for a nonprofit that helped build affordable housing in connecticut and elsewhere before he was elected to congress states he said should tweak their formulas to reward mixed income developments i think you should get more points for having forward looking mixed use mixed income sustainable projects himes said that would be one way to deal with the challenge that in the previous generation you had isolated concentrated developments and those just don t work very well the lack of income diversity in many cities has resulted in a shrinking tax base to pay for schools law enforcement and other infrastructure on the verge of bankruptcy in recent years hartford scaled back its police force and trash collection of large items leaving old mattresses and furniture littering lugo s neighborhood romeo is regularly sent home early from school when staff is stretched too thin making it impossible for lugo to keep a job school calls me all the time to pick him up if i don t pick him up they see me as an irresponsible parent she said mattresses and broken furniture sit outside in lugo s neighborhood credit monica jorge some housing authority leaders and state officials defend connecticut s practices arguing that the bevy of tax credits in poor areas have lifted struggling neighborhoods it has taken housing that cities have had to actually condemn as unfit for human habitation and transform a neighborhood said karl kilduff who served as the executive director of the housing finance authority during the previous administration he cited the city of norwalk about 70 miles south of hartford there state officials awarded tax credits to raze old housing and develop new low income units a market rate apartment building later opened across the street he said kilduff doesn t believe that would have happened without the injection of federal tax credits he predicts that pattern will emerge in hartford too research on the effects of the low income housing tax credit is limited one study largely based on lihtc properties in california and the country s largest metropolitan areas found that these developments can help low income communities home values in struggling neighborhoods adjacent to the new affordable housing increased by 6 5 after 10 years professors at stanford university s business school concluded these properties also attracted some white homeowners to isolated communities they found resulting in decreased segregation in lower income areas the impact of affordable housing is not absolute however says anika singh lemar a professor at yale law school the urban planning answer is that housing doesn t revitalize she said it can be part of a larger revitalization strategy imagine a plan that includes jobs job training infrastructure investments in grocery stores and day cares and other neighborhood amenities but a housing development on its own doesn t revitalize nowhere else to go in frog hollow lugo is still waiting a devout catholic she s placed religious symbols around plants and toys in her apartment as if to

elita chikwati senior agriculture reporter this year will be remembered as one of mixed fortunes for stakeholders in the tobacco industry on the positive side output surpassed the 2018 deliveries of 253 million kg to hit a record 259 million kg despite various challenges that affected production and marketing of the crop in 2000 a record of 231 million kg had been delivered to the auction floors and after the land reform programme output declined before increasing in the last two years to shatter the previous record and demonstrate that black farmers were up to the task in 2019 tobacco contributed significantly to gross domestic product gdp through exports to different destinations africa america europe european union far east middle east and oceania the bulk of the crop went to the far east tobacco which used to be grown by the elite has been democratised and thousands of people mainly indigenous blacks are now growing the crop the numbers are growing each year and in 2019 us 529 million was generated from the exports of the 259 million kg several success stories have been recorded in the tobacco industry with some farmers testifying great improvements in their livelihoods while companies have ventured into value addition some companies have also started processing the crop and exporting cigarettes a move meant to maximise profits this year farmers in burma valley continued to produce cigar wrapper tobacco and exporting it plans are underway for the wrapping of the cigar locally starting next year such is the success story of tobacco a crop that has become so popular with most smallholder farmers after the land reform challenges the 2019 tobacco crop was grown under unfavourable weather conditions characterised by late rains and prolonged dry spells especially when the crop was almost ready for reaping low prices deliveries to the floors were low during the first days of the season as most farmers adopted a wait and see attitude while others withdrew their bales in protest of the low prices on offer the first day of the marketing season was hampered by farmers who withdrew 98 percent of the crop from the floors in protest over low prices offered by buyers the tobacco industry and marketing board timb statistics show that growers sold 3 886 kilogrammes of tobacco worth us 7 100 on the first day compared to 165 105 kilogrammes worth us 366 003 same period in 2018 the statistics also show that rejected bales on the first day of 2019 marketing season had increased by 1 433 percent from the 5 70 percent in 2018 to 87 38 percent in 2019 the highest price offered on the first day in 2019 was 4 50 per kilogramme which is less than the 4 99 per kilogramme offered during the same period in 2018 payment system in 2019 farmers were paid 50 percent of their money in rtgs accounts with the remaining 50 percent being deposited into their foreign currency accounts a number of farmers at first complained that they did not have fca bank accounts while others said not enough communication had been done by the relevant authorities to educate them on the new payment system others were not aware of the period that was taken for the money to be transferred from the rtgs account to the fca resulting in some spending their money while others were complaining that the money was not being deposited into the fca when they would have used the money in the rtgs account cash constraints the farmers complained over the limited cash payments they were getting 50 cents per kilogramme cash for the rtgs transactions and 10 cents per kilogramme for the united states dollar transactions the money was not enough for most farmers who preferred to be given their cash so they will be able to pay their workers back home the farmers also complained that 50 percent foreign currency earnings were not enough and should have been increased to around 80 percent farmers also complained over the use of plastic money as they were being charged extortionate interest rates which eroded their earnings regulatory issues the 2019 marketing season which started on march 20 coincided with new developments in the economy and many farmers did not have the adequate information and could not understand issues leading to many withholding their crop two percent tax tobacco farmers were at first not exempted from the two percent tax and this further eroded their earnings finance and economic development minister professor mthuli ncube had to intervene and scrapped the intermediated money transfer tax two percent tax from all transactions involving the tobacco through statutory instrument 80 of 2019 which amended the finance rate and incidence of intermediated money transfer tax regulations this resulted in a boost in sales stakeholders concerns and interventions due to the continuous problems at the auction floors and high rates of rejections stakeholders in the tobacco industry farmers rbz officials tobacco merchants and buyers timb and the tobacco research board trb converged for a tobacco indaba where they called for a holistic approach to challenges that were being faced by farmers to come up with solutions that will enable the whole value chain to benefit from the business the stakeholders established that farmers were lacking important knowledge which resulted in them experiencing challenges from production to marketing of tobacco 2019 20 tobacco season preparations the 2019 20 season is underway although there has been a decline in the farmer registrations when compared to the previous season as at december 19 timb statistics show a decline of 16 percent in farmer registrations for the 2019 20 season by december 19 141 169 farmers had registered to grow tobacco compared to 167 100 farmers during the same period last year the decline has been attributed to bad experiences by farmers during the 2019 season the challenges have seen some farmers looking to other high value crops that are less risky when compared to tobacco with other farmers keeping their options open farmers are considering other options like horticulture crops others farmers said the improvement in the payment system by the grain marketing board had also attracted them to grow more maize instead of tobacco timb said the decline in figures was transitory as more farmers were expected to register as they plant their crops in the fields crop condition there are concerns over the current dry conditions which are affecting the current tobacco crop irrigation is being affected by load shedding while those who want to switch to generators are experiencing challenges procuring fuel due to shortages future despite the challenges faced during the 2019 season some tobacco growers have continued to show resilience and shown interest to produce the crop
there may be three billionaires running for president but that hasn t stopped many democratic candidates from railing against the ultra wealthy especially massachusetts sen elizabeth warren coming together to create an economy a government an energy system that works for all of us not just the one percent vermont sen bernie sanders said at a campaign rally meanwhile warren is proposing sweeping cultural change and ambitious plans such as her 21 trillion dollar proposal for medicare for all that leaves more moderate competitors like minnesota sen amy klobuchar to question how she will pay for it in turn warren blasted her moderate democratic rivals seeking the white house accusing them of naively accepting republican calls for unity rather than standing up to the rich while too quickly bending to the whims of their own wealthy donors the massachusetts senator strongly defended her progressive vision for the nation built on using new taxes to extend benefits such as universal child care and health coverage warren didn t name former vice president joe biden or mayor pete buttigieg of south bend indiana but she was clearly taking aim at them suggesting that long simmering tensions between the party s centrist and progressives wings are boiling over unlike some candidates for the democratic nomination i m not counting on republican politicians having an epiphany and suddenly supporting the kinds of tax increases on the rich or big business accountability they have opposed under democratic presidents for a generation warren said during a speech at the new hampshire institute of politics unlike some candidates for the democratic nomination i m not betting my agenda on the naive hope that if democrats adopt republican critiques of progressive policies or make vague calls for unity that somehow the wealthy and well connected will stand down related elizabeth warren health care plan pledges no middle class tax increase the cornerstone of warren s policy centers around a 2 cent wealth tax on those with fortunes over 50 million dollars which she claims will pay for things like the expansion of charter schools and free college for those who qualify well i don t want a government that works for giant multinational corporations i want one that works for our family warren told a cheering crowd at a campaign event and in order to pay for medicare for all warren proposes a 6 percent tax on anyone who s worth over a billion dollars and that has led to clear battle lines drawn between warren and those considered billionaires who argue the senator s plans are punitive and will dismantle their life s work while disincentivizing others who want to get rich one day she pledges to use that tax money to offer universal child care and wipe out most student debt for 42 million americans while helping finance a medicare for all plan providing government sponsored health care nationwide elizabeth warren is of course the person that wall street dislikes the most said hal dash a democratic strategist but warren is not backing down her latest campaign ad is aimed right at the uber wealthy you built it at least in part using workers all of us helped pay to educate getting your goods to market on roads and bridges all of us helped paid the bill we re americans we want to make these investments all we re saying is when you make it big pitch in two cents warren said emphatically at a campaign rally she s even taken a swipe at billionaire democratic hopeful michael bloomberg a former new york city mayor i don t believe that elections ought to be for sale warren said in an appearance on bloomberg warren remains bunched near the top of the polls with biden buttigieg and sanders the race s other strong progressive voice but rather than contrasting herself with sanders to shore up the democratic left she has increasingly gone after the mayor and the former vice president as well as bloomberg the division is growing as the first votes of the democratic primary near and there s mounting concern that no clear front runner will emerge from the initial slate of contests nobody is perfect and nobody is pure and there s no question that any democrat running for president would be a whole lot better than donald trump warren said thursday to applause she added later but voters will not trust a candidate who won t make a single difficult decision that might cut down on the access and influence of wealthy donors and voters will be right in response to warren s speech buttigieg senior adviser lis smith suggested that the senator may ultimately undermine democratic unity sen warren s idea of how to defeat donald trump is to tell people who don t support her that they are unwelcome in the fight and that those who disagree with her belong in the other party smith said warren has centered her candidacy on proposing structural changes to remake the political and economic system but some potential hurdles of doing so were on display earlier this month when the university of pennsylvania s penn wharton budget model which provides nonpartisan analysis of public policy proposals released findings showing that warren s wealth tax will raise 2 3 trillion to 2 7 trillion over 10 years that s as much as 1 4 trillion less than warren s campaign estimates the analysis also concluded that the new taxes would cause the economy to contract 0 9 percent to 2 1 percent by 2050 and says the new tax would reduce private capital formation enough to drive the u s economy s average wage down 0 9 percent to 2 3 percent even affecting households not rich enough to qualify for the tax warren s wealth tax has been among the most popular and most scrutinized proposals of her campaign although sanders has proposed an even higher tax on top fortunes warren s has given her an economic populist edge and even prompted crowds at her rallies to break into chants of 2 cents responding to the analysis after her new hampshire speech warren said it wasn t really based on what she wants to do saying the authors changed provisions and then analyzed something else i understand there are people who want to throw up a lot of dust around this because they don t really have any comeback to that central question and that is why aren t we asking the folks at the very top to pitch in a couple of cents so that we could actually invest in opportunity and everyone else she said still even warren herself acknowledged the potential difficulty of her agenda noting in her speech will i have a magic wand to enact my full agenda of course not no president does i know i will have to compromise but that s not where we start she said she d exploit senate procedures allowing some legislation to pass with a simple majority noting that republicans used that to pass the tax cuts championed by trump but pulling that off is difficult since the chamber rules would require near universal democratic unity the associated press contributed

letters to the editor britain us must undo damage caused by sanctions lawson mabhena on wednesday a new year begins marking a countdown to three years after the popular november 2017 uprising that led to zimbabwe s second republic the economy is expected to take centre stage in 2020 and all eyes will be on president mnangagwa and his government whose sweeping economic reforms must now start paying dividends in particular the end of austerity will come as a relief to ordinary zimbabweans although hard work will be the order of the day during the growth productivity and prosperity period the transitional stabilisation programme tsp which began in september 2018 will end in december 2020 paving way for the first five year national development plan 2021 2025 the second five year national development plan will run from 2026 2030 the last stage in the attainment of vision 2030 to achieve vision 2030 zimbabwe will need the support of regional and international partners no single country exists in a vacuum president mnangagwa s engagement re engagement and rapprochement foreign policy thrust is a realistic attempt to co exist in the global village the year 2019 will be remembered as the year sadc threw its full weight behind zimbabwe the regional block in august declared october 25 as a day of solidarity with zimbabwe against illegal sanctions stifling economic growth in the country and the region foreign affairs and international trade minister dr sibusiso moyo in september presented a paper to cabinet indicating that zimbabwe lost about us 98 billion due to the illegal sanctions imposed after the land reform programme of 2000 according to the paper zimbabwe lost an estimated us 42 billion in revenue us 4 5 billion in bilateral donor support us 12 billion in loans from international financial institutions us 18 billion in commercial loans and a gdp reduction of us 21 billion furthermore significant progress that the country had made in the development of infrastructure health education and other social service delivery systems according to the report has been severely reversed by the sanctions imposed by the united states of america under the zimbabwe democracy and economic recovery act zidera of 2001 zimbabwe s access to international credit markets was blocked after the enactment of zidera the country has been forced to virtually operate on hand to mouth and there has been a significant build up of external debt arrears this unfavourable development has worsened the country s credit worthiness as the country s international financial risk profile escalated the paper presented by minister moyo reads this subsequently led to the drying up of traditional sources of external finance from the international financial institutions ifis with the country receiving no support from the african development bank since 1998 the international monetary fund since 1999 and the world bank since 2001 clearly the claim by western countries that the sanctions are targeted at individuals and do not hurt ordinary zimbabweans is nothing but a blue lie the sanctions have been a major determining factor in the rapid economic decline experienced over the past two decades admittedly poor governance corruption and patronage were also contributing factors under the rule of late former president robert mugabe that is why president mnangagwa and his government have gone all out to correct ills of the past political and economic reforms promoting democracy and restoring economic stability have been instituted while harare has been mending relations with western countries and international financial institutions sanctions imposed on zimbabwe are against the spirit of re engagement and liberalism being promoted under the second republic britain and america should now play their part in undoing the damage they have done to zimbabwe s economy the act of sabotage on october 1 2019 by the us must never be repeated in 2020 the us banned zimbabwean diamonds over unverified allegations of the use of forced labour in the extraction of gems in the marange fields the economy took a big knock as a result zimbabwe was expecting to produce 4 1 million carats of diamonds in 2019 up from 2 8 million carats in 2018 at the peak of production in 2012 the country s output was 12 million carats the ban which is an extension of sanctions is a deliberate attempt in ensuring that domestic economic policies fail the flip side however is that if the tsp was a poor policy it would not need help to fail clearly there is some sort of fear that zimbabwe could be on an economic recovery path on her part britain has been engaging well with zimbabwe special envoys have been dispatched and although nothing has been said in public expectations are high that 2020 could be a good year for zimabwe united kingdom relations british prime minister boris johnson is on record for admitting that his country contributed to the demise of the zimbabwean economy writing for the telegraph in february 2015 mr johnson who was then london mayor said his country under the leadership of mr tony blair had played a shameful role in zimbabwe s economic woes there had to be a willing buyer willing seller the british government agreed to fund the arrangement compensating the former colonial farmers for land that they gave up under that arrangement the white farmers were able to survive more or less zimbabwe remained economically viable more or less and then in 1997 along came tony blair and new labour and in a fit of avowed anti colonialist fervour they unilaterally scrapped the arrangement the overseas development minister clare short made it clear that neither she nor blair gave a stuff about the former colonial farmers wrote mr johnson on the occasion of mr mugabe s birthday if mr johnson is an honourable man he will play his part in forging a new relationship with zimbabwe the new zimbabwe being built by president

caracas venezuela ani camacho has watched her 5 year old son zabdiel battle cancer for years the despair briefly turned to hope when she learned last december that zabdiel was going to get a potentially life saving bone marrow transplant in italy a complex medical procedure he could not receive in venezuela we were super happy camacho said all the family had left to do was buy plane tickets and get visas she said but she and zabdiel never left venezuela because the program that would have allowed him to travel became enmeshed in the country s economic chaos and was put on hold they remain in caracas traveling back and forth between an apartment lent by a family member and j m de los ríos children s hospital where zabdiel has spent much of his life and made most of his friends it s so much anguish desperation impotence camacho 40 said as she waited for her husband to bring her son home from the hospital where the boy was getting a spinal tap we are out of options she said with venezuela in the grip of a severe economic crisis spanning several years children like zabdiel have been caught in the center as the humanitarian toll worsens with no immediate end in sight aid workers and doctors told nbc news the boy s struggle for medical care was emblematic of a broader crisis that was causing a generational toll as children continue to languish at key points in their mental and physical development janeth márquez director of the catholic aid organization cáritas in venezuela said the three biggest problems facing venezuela s children are an inability to get medical care or supplies malnutrition and the effect of families being separated as parents leave the country to find work to be able to send money back home about a third of the country s children need help accessing basic nutrition health and education services unicef said in june the united nations agency also said that mortality of children under 5 had increased by more than half from 2014 to 2017 zabdiel is among dozens of children at the hospital in need of bone marrow transplants hundreds of children and young people received the transplants and aftercare treatment in italy under a 2010 agreement that was financed by venezuela s state run oil company zabdiel camacho has spent much of his life at a hospital in caracas venezuela courtesy ani camacho but that program has been suspended four children whose families were also hoping for transplants died at the hospital in may another child on the list has died since then according to advocates venezuela s government claims u s sanctions have frozen funds that could have paid for the expensive medical treatments while critics of president nicolás maduro say it is another example that venezuela s medical system is in turmoil amid mismanagement and corruption camacho said the children have been caught in the middle with their lives at stake they are the most affected by this situation she said my son doesn t know anything about this but he is in a fight and a war we would collapse on a wednesday in june a line of people mostly women holding babies and young children stretched out the door of the emergency medical clinic that cáritas runs for families in need some were there to see an on site pediatrician others because they were sick and needed treatment or medications they could not otherwise afford márquez said there has been a sharp increase in people needing their services since 2014 when only about 10 people would come to their main offices now hundreds of people come every day including an influx of middle class people seeking medicine they can no longer afford or that is not available otherwise auribel plazuela 31 arrived at the clinic that morning for a follow up appointment for her 9 month old daughter and to receive asthma treatment for herself plazuela said that about two months earlier her baby appeared weak and was coughing and coughing so she brought her to the clinic where she was given medication along with a treatment plan i completed the treatment and thank god the baby hasn t suffered any more she said as other children cried while being seen by a pediatrician at the same time a little girl in a pink and white top and shorts was given an injection to treat nausea and vomiting it s truly very difficult people come here every day that truly need this plazuela said in other hospitals it s very difficult because you have to pay and with the situation the way it is now you can t plazuela said she has asthma and had been having trouble breathing for the last three days so she came to cáritas and waited to receive a nebulizer treatment she said she brought her daughter in again for a check up and the doctor found her to be in good health plazuela said she knew other parents of children with special needs such as epilepsy who went to the clinic because they needed very expensive medication without the services the clinic provides we would collapse she said all of us venezuelans are going through the same thing she said you buy one thing or the other i buy food or i buy medicine and in the end i need both this crisis is taking children the government s data from 2016 shows that maternal mortality shot up 65 percent in one year infant mortality rose by 30 percent to more than 11 000 babies under the age of 1 dying in that single year márquez said her organization works with communities who have faced an onslaught by the crisis in venezuela and has seen the toll it has on families sadly we are seeing how this crisis is taking children she said if the crisis continues we are looking at a dark horizon for people who do not have money for the most vulnerable she said maduro s critics say his government is to blame for the country s woes and the escalating collapse of the economy under his presidency through mismanagement and corruption while maduro has long claimed harsh u s sanctions are ravaging the economy carlos 30 sits on a pile of trash where he looks for food in caracas on april 10 2019 eva marie uzcategui getty images in 2018 venezuela s inflation rate rose to 130 060 percent according to the government s data in the third quarter of 2018 the country s gdp shrank 22 5 percent over the prior year maduro who took power in 2013 as the heir to president hugo chávez remains in office despite opposition leader juan guaidó s call for mass demonstrations and a military uprising at the end of april but mass defections never materialized and much of the military has remained loyal to maduro guaidó declared himself venezuela s interim president in late january after maduro s disputed re election last year more than 50 countries including the united states recognize guaidó as the country s interim leader this hurts the children the most dr julio castro who works at the central university of venezuela said a major contributing factor to health issues in venezuela was the lack of consistent access to clean safe drinking water which has led to outbreaks of diseases including hepatitis a tap water is not considered safe to drink and most people who can afford to do so boil the water or buy packaged bottles even in caracas the capital some people do not have running water every day he said while others store water in tanks that can become breeding grounds for mosquito borne diseases or drink from polluted rivers or lakes plazuela said that while she has a water tank sometimes the water comes out yellow or dirty so she always boils the water for herself and her four children márquez said cáritas latest study found that 35 percent of children were suffering from chronic malnutrition living with nutritional deficiencies for at least five years in 2017 that number was 27 percent according to cáritas in a statement to united nations human rights chief michelle bachelet cáritas highlighted several critical issues including delays in growth because of chronic malnutrition the charity said it had evaluated more than 30 000 children in the last three years and found that 6 out of 10 families interviewed are begging and searching for food in garbage dumps four in 10 have had to sell belongings to afford food and another four in 10 have had to separate as a family to continue surviving cáritas said the united nations said in june that more than 4 million migrants and refugees have left venezuela in the last few years the pace of migration has skyrocketed since the end of 2015 the u n said with the number increasing by a million in seven months from last november to june globally venezuelans are one of the single largest population groups displaced from their country the international organization for migration and u n refugee agency said in a statement márquez said that cáritas great concern is that emigration continues to increase this year which totally destroys the family destroying homes we say we have mothers who don t have children and children who don t have mothers she said cáritas runs a weekly soup kitchen which drew a hundred people on a recent day a priest led the group in prayer and volunteers passed out bread and bowls of soup containing beef potatoes corn carrots onions and lentils workers said it was the only time many of the families ate protein during the week residents collect water released through a pipe in an abandoned construction site which contains chemicals products in caracas on april 4 2019 roman camacho sopa images lightrocket via getty images ana rojo had some soup while holding her 1 year old son at a table surrounded by other family members as a mother of 12 children rojo said the soup kitchen was essential for her family many venezuelans including rojo s family rely on a government subsidized food aid program but the aid only lasts her family a few days she said rojo said sometimes she would just start to cry because she would have to send her kids to bed hungry you send them to bed with just a glass of water and that s not fair to them she said rojo said her 5 year old son sometimes faints and turns purple he starts to vomit because he hasn t eaten this hurts the children the most she said because you re an adult and you endure but they don t the situation is getting worse every day dr castro said the country s continuing hyperinflation has worsened health issues for families it s impossible for them to afford medicine for any diseases he said hospitals throughout the country also do not have the medicine they need or water on an everyday basis some have problems with electricity he said my concern is that the situation is getting worse every day castro said rosa colina whose daughter cristina 18 is also in need of a bone marrow transplant described being in hospitals lacking medicine sometimes when medication was available she had to pay for it out of pocket expenses she cannot afford cristina suffers from a blood disorder called thalassemia major and developed hepatitis c after a blood transfusion in 2016 colina said she has had to go out in the street and beg for money in the hope of being able to afford medication cristina colina suffers from a blood disorder called thalassemia major and developed hepatitis c after a blood transfusion in 2016 courtesy rosa colina the hospitalizations and increasing health complications have taken over cristina s daily life a year ago she required a wheelchair following the development of a blood clot and while she has since regained some mobility her parents need to physically help her get around before 2016 cristina was a model but not anymore she used to play violin she left that too her mom said through tears colina said she hopes a transplant could give cristina a chance at a normal life and to accomplish the goals she has held for so much of her young life some 500 bone marrow transplants for adults and children have been done in the country at a hospital in caracas and at another in the city of valencia since 2000 said dr francisco ramírez director of the bone marrow transplant program at the hospital of clinics caracas but in the last two years the number of transplants has decreased from about 25 a year to nine last year and three so far this year he said this is mainly due to the difficulty in getting medications of getting what corresponds to the costs he said beyond the limited resources children like zabdiel who do not have a matching donor in venezuela have had to look internationally for potential matches and transplant treatments as venezuela currently does not have the methodology or ability to take bone marrow matches from international sources and bring them to venezuela to treat the children he said the country and aid organizations are looking into other ways to give transplants to children like zabdiel but limited resources are again a major issue he said maduro s government has said coercive measures by the u s government in the form of sanctions have prevented the state run oil company pdvsa from transferring money for the transplant treatments venezuela sent the funds through pdvsa and they were retained in novo banco portugal thanks to the sanctions and the criminal blockade venezuelan foreign minister jorge arreaza said in a statement in april while the u s government maintains the pdvsa citgo blockade in venezuela the lists of citizens who hope to benefit from the social health program grow he added referring to the u s subsidiary of pdvsa enrica giavatto director of the association for bone marrow transplant said since 2006 the organization has brought 487 venezuelans most of them women and young people to italy pdvsa had initially been covering the cost of transplants she said in june 2018 the group received funding related to the last two months of 2018 but since then they have not received any additional payments giavatto said she said the association has not been paid costs related to the transplants and after care treatment for all of 2018 and 2019 the group has continued to provide care for the 19 children and adults who are in italy receiving treatment as part of the program she said giavatto said that because italy s hospitals are public and because of the high debts owed because of the lack of payment the association is not able to take more patients including zabdiel she added that the venezuelan government did try to make a bank transfer of more than 4 million euros to the association but that was stopped by portuguese bank novo banco she said venezuela asked the group to then open a bank account in russia to bypass the sanctions she said the group did but has not heard an answer novo banco did not immediately respond to a request for comment katherine martínez director of prepara familia a nongovernmental humanitarian organization has been advocating for the families and said the venezuelan government has the duty to find other sources of funding for the transplants we re talking about the lives of children that are very much at risk she said these are families that are doing all they can back at the apartment in caracas where camacho lives the door opened and zabdiel arrived home accompanied by his father leonardo amaya the boy was dressed in a white button down shirt and gray corduroy pants a white bandage around his right wrist he played with brightly colored toy cars that he had separated into groups of autobots and decepticons dueling factions from the transformers series after a relapse in 2018 zabdiel is receiving maintenance treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia that includes daily medication chemotherapy and lumbar punctures his mother said camacho described zabdiel as a loving and happy child throughout their struggles family photos showed the boy dressed as superman in one he wears a superman t shirt and cape a mask covering his mouth with his right hand bandaged in another he wears a superman hoodie his mouth again covered with a mask giving a thumbs up to the camera as their wait continues camacho said she lives in fear that my son will die waiting for a transplant i am afraid that we will have to give up our dreams for our son she said

california s real estate and rental markets have long been expensive even unaffordable for many californians but the problem has spiraled out of control in recent years and by 2019 it was overwhelmingly clear that what was once a garden variety housing shortage had been allowed to grow into a housing crisis rents have risen faster than incomes and 1 in 3 households statewide now spend more than half their income on rent leaving many families one rent increase or one missed paycheck away from losing their homes despite massive infusions of public funding to try to solve the problem counties across the state have reported double digit increases in homelessness the greatest job growth has been in coastal cities that have the highest housing costs forcing workers to choose between paying more than they can afford for housing commuting long distances or forgoing career opportunities because the cost of living is too high advertisement the consequences are apparent in the proliferation of tent cities the growing number of mega commuters who travel 90 miles or more spewing greenhouse gases all the way to get to work and the pessimistic polls that show residents are increasingly losing hope for the future in the golden state housing is at the root of the state s problems the good news is that california leaders took significant steps in 2019 to ease the problem but california s housing shortage is so steep and the affordability gap so wide it will take more time and more ambition to end the crisis gov gavin newsom certainly had big ambitions for housing when he took office in january on the campaign trail newsom said he wanted the state to build 3 5 million homes by 2025 to end the housing shortage in his first weeks on the job the governor called for a marshall plan for affordable housing and he made headlines with a threat to withhold transportation dollars from communities that failed to build enough homes to meet their needs advertisement in the end newsom did deliver a big increase in funding this year nearly 3 billion for housing and homelessness but to appease legislators and angry city officials he watered down his proposal to withhold transportation dollars instead he agreed to a compromise bill that would allow a judge to impose steep fines up to 600 000 a month on cities that willfully refuse to plan and zone for enough market rate and affordable housing newsom stayed on the sidelines during the debate over senate bill 50 the controversial measure that would have overridden local zoning laws to allow mid rise apartment buildings to be constructed within half a mile of major transit stops or in jobs rich areas even in single family neighborhoods the bill was shelved and will be reintroduced in january and newsom didn t make much progress on a grand bargain to reform the california environmental quality act so that it can no longer be used to block much needed housing there has been some grumbling that newsom s results don t match his rhetoric that s true the governor does have a penchant for overpromising but we prefer to cut him some slack on this one because it s unrealistic to think a governor can reverse decades of political and nimby intransigence on housing in one year and the fact is california did make real progress advertisement newsom and lawmakers enacted a slew of laws to encourage new housing it ll be easier to build granny flats in the future permitting and approval for new homes have been streamlined legislators passed a bill to establish the nation s strongest statewide rent control law as of jan 1 most annual rent increases will be capped at 5 plus inflation and landlords will have to show just cause before they evict a renter the law which sunsets after 10 years is a common sense measure that provides some stability for renters who have borne the brunt of the state s housing crisis the politics on housing are shifting even though renters make up nearly half the state s population tenant protection bills have a history of failing in sacramento thanks to powerful landlord and real estate interests advertisement likewise california officials have long believed that cities and counties should have almost complete control over housing decisions in practice however local control often means saying no to new development most cities in california have shied away from denser compact development that would be more walkable bikeable and transit friendly that is changing too under pressure from newsom and housing advocates southern california leaders reluctantly agreed to plan for the development of more than 1 million new homes in the region by 2029 with much of the housing concentrated in the coastal areas these are communities that have jobs transit and amenities but tend to oppose new development and the commitment to focus growth in those areas will help combat urban sprawl there s also a shift on single family zoning which has long been held sacrosanct in california apartments and condos are banned in nearly 80 of the state s residential neighborhoods closing those areas off to multi family development dramatically limits the number of homes that can be built often it means that would be residents cannot live near good schools or their jobs and it perpetuates racial and economic segregation advertisement that s why oregon and minneapolis have done away with single family zoning sb 50 would have done so as well by allowing property owners to convert houses anywhere in the state into four unit apartment houses and that proposal will be back for consideration in january the mayors of los angeles oakland san jose and sacramento have all expressed interest in allowing small apartment buildings in single family neighborhoods there s still so much work ahead california has to make it much easier and cheaper to build housing the state and local governments need to figure out ways to incentivize or subsidize the development of a lot more low and middle income housing the coming year will be a test of whether california can truly turn into a pro housing state

allocation too meagre to make a mark say entire budget incapable of powering development despite the federal government s claim to have released more than 56 per cent of the approved expenditure for capital projects in the 2019 appropriation some development economists and experts insist that the said release has not impacted the ailing economy the minister of finance budget and national planning zainab ahmed while briefing state house correspondents at the end of the last federal executive council fec in abuja said about n1 2t 56 1 per cent out of the total n2 14 trillion excluding the capital component of statutory transfers capital budget had been released to various ministries departments and agencies so far we have released up to n1 2t in capital expenditure which is a 50 per cent performance of the capital for the whole year 2019 the 2019 budget is also a six month budget so we have achieved a fifth per cent capital release for 50 per cent performance of the 2019 budget we have also been able to release all that is required for personnel so personnel expenditure is on course debt service is also on course she said commenting on the presentation the lead consultant centre for social justice csj eze onyekpere said it was difficult to come to terms with the fact that such amount has so far been released to mdas because there was nothing on ground to point to the question we are asking is where are the projects that were executed with the amount released unfortunately too the n1 21t capital votes said to have been released cannot impact very well on the economy and mind you releases are not the same thing as cash backing and vice versa for professor of political economy pat utomi from whatever prism one looks at it the country s budget is unlikely and incapable of engendering development because it is too small for the kind of economy that we should be driving what we need is good behaviour by public officials so that private capital can come in do you know what percentage of the gross domestic products gdp this budget is it is less than six per cent of what is required to run the economy so there is an over emphasis on the budget as we know it today partly because of the earn and spend approach to governance what we need is to take a cue from the budget in terms of the direction that the country is traveling so that private capital can come in and take a longer term position on the implication of having two budgets run side by side since the 2019 budget became operational in june this year and the 2020 budget has also recently been signed into law to commence in january utomi who is frustrated with the country s budget process elected to reserve his comment he hinged his position on the fact that the budget process in nigeria is not a serious one but a public relations exercise according to him there is glaring lack of understanding of the budget as a development tool and as something that leads to an accumulation of activities infrastructure and programmes that lead a country to a particular destination and these are things that make me just give up in the united states the budget is a 36 month cycle the day that president donald trump was elected the next two budgets that he would be implementing would have been passed under the watch of barrack obama yes he can tweak a thing here or there but the essential thrust of the budget had been passed by the us congress before he was elected and this is what gives room for continuity but here you elect a governor his first action is to cancel what the governor before him did or approved this is dangerous for development and this is what the scenario is today in our country i do not think they do it out of wickedness but out of ignorance so the media is to help educate people who go into public life there is a famous french writer from the 18th century called frederick beigbeder one of his books the law talks about the process of legal plunder it seems that politics in nigeria tends to push us towards legal plunder instead of advancing the common good of all this is why you have the budget process the way it is utomi who said basic things that should form part of the 2023 budget should already be in the national assembly noted that south koreans got to where they are through perspective planning on his part the director general institute for fiscal studies ifs godwin ighedosa is pretty difficult to aggregate the performance of the 2019 capital budget because it is only a huge budgetary provision that can impact on the nation s economy as it is now ighedosa maintained that even if the government released the entire capital budget of n2 31t the impact would still be considered small for what the country requires to prosecute its capital votes or expenditures for the next 10 years he said our views at the institute based on calculation are that looking at a robust national budget nigeria should be thinking of about n45t to n50t annual budgets in the next 10 years but the question now is how do we create the social economy sector to cover the n45t to n50t that is required to fund the economy so it is difficult then to see how n1 21t capital votes or expenditure can have a serious impact on the economy when we travel from lagos to abuja abuja to port harcourt etc we see the dilapidated nature of our roads we also see the poor delivery of public services in terms of the worn out or decayed educational system and poor medical services then you can rest assured that putting all of these things in place cannot be accommodated within the current budget allocation for the nation ighedosa who said it was time to come to terms with the fact that the government does not have the money to fund its budget added today nigeria still has the lowest revenue to gdp ratio of 7 per cent in africa ghana has 19 per cent morocco has 27 per cent south africa has 25 per cent algeria is almost 25 per cent as well according to him most of the country s budget has been deficit funded so the government is left with increasing borrowings i have always said that borrowing is not bad if the funds are channelled towards critical infrastructure developments that would aid investments because it is there that you will see improvements in our balance sheet the problem with nigeria is that the government is always borrowings for consumption that creates a lot of problems because it fails to tie the borrowings to projects that will increase economic development an agricultural economist who is of the faculty of agriculture university of calabar prof omo ogun ajayi said the low performance of the 2019 capital votes was a result of the delay in the release of funds adding that the funds were not readily available until the middle of the year we cannot grow the economy if we continue to joke with capital budgets but i consider it a welcome development when the finance minister said that the government would no longer release the remaining capital votes to mdas given the change in the budget cycle the minister is right to put a stop to further releases of the year s capital votes because such negates international best practices in financial principles remember too that such late releases are sometimes diverted to organise hoax conferences and workshops ajayi who also called for the diversification of the economy without further delay added clearly the performance of the 2019 budget has little impact on the wellbeing of the populace as basic infrastructure are collapsing while unemployment remains very high in the land we hope that the 2020 budget will not be upturned by the tempestuous global oil prices
